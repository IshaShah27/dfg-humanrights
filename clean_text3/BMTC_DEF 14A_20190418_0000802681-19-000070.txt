Dear Fellow Shareholders:
You are cordially invited to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of shareholders of Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation (the "Corporation"), parent to The Bryn Mawr Trust Company (the "Bank"), which will be held at Merion Cricket Club, 325 Montgomery Avenue, Haverford, PA on Thursday, April 18, 2019, at 11:00 A.M. At the Annual Meeting, shareholders will be asked to elect directors, approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, our 2018 executive officer compensation ("Say-on-Pay"), ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019, and act upon such other business as may properly come before the meeting. This year, we will again be using the "Notice and Access" method of providing proxy materials to you via the Internet. We believe that this process provides you with a convenient and quick way to access the proxy materials while allowing us to conserve natural resources and reduce the costs of printing and distributing.
On or about March 8, 2019, we mailed to our shareholders an Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials, which we refer to as the Notice and Access card, containing instructions on how to access our proxy statement and annual report on Form 10-K, and how to authorize a proxy to vote your shares. The Notice and Access card also contains instructions as to how you can receive a paper or email copy of our proxy materials. For shareholders who previously elected to receive a full set paper copy of the proxy materials, we mailed the Proxy Statement, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the proxy card on or about March 12, 2019. It is important that your shares be represented at the Annual Meeting and voted in accordance with your wishes. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to complete a proxy as promptly as possible-by Internet, telephone or mail-so that your shares will be voted at the Annual Meeting. This will not limit your right to vote in person or to attend the meeting.
In 2018, Bryn Mawr Trust continued the strong performance we saw in 2016 and 2017. The clear driver of our financial results, however, was the impact of the Royal Bank acquisition on the overall enterprise.  Our ability to expand Royal client relationships, attract new clients because of the larger balance sheet and add to our exceptional employee base contributed to the success.
The Strategic Plan adopted by our Board and Management in 2015 continues to produce strong results for the Corporation.  To highlight a few of the contributors to our strong performance, the Bank's Capital Markets Group, launched in 2017, continues to position the Corporation's solutions and services for growth by offering interest rate swaps and foreign exchange capabilities to our clients.  In 2018, the initiative contributed $4.8 million in non-interest revenue.  Our Princeton office, which also opened in 2017, had $142.6 million in assets under management.  That office's pipeline continues to grow each day.  More importantly, the Princeton office serves as a model for our "One BMT Offices" by providing not only our Wealth Management solutions, but also Private Banking, Commercial lending, mortgage and insurance services.  Following the acquisition of Domenick last year, our insurance operations continue to realize operational efficiencies and revenue growth as the businesses are consolidated.  Equally important, these business lines are successfully working with other departments in the Corporation to offer exceptional financial solutions to all our clients.  The addition of Royal Bank's leasing company and leasing subsidiary brought assets in that business to nearly $145 million.
Since 2012, Bank assets have grown over $2.6 billion and Wealth assets under management have growth nearly $6.8 billion.  As we grow, our regular and on-going strategic planning process helps us identify areas within the organization that need attention, change or investment. Our analysis in 2018 targeted two primary areas for continued concentration: our human capital and technology needs.  Investments in these two critical areas allow us to build a stronger, more sustainable Bank for future long-term growth.
Our business model effectively consists of two very meaningful businesses, the Bank and our Wealth Management Division.  Recognizing the need to have targeted, professional management, in 2018 we appointed Presidents of each distinct business.  Kevin Tylus, former CEO of Royal Bank, serves as the President of the Bank and brings his years of experience as CEO and director to our banking and lending operations.  Jennifer Fox serves as the President of our Wealth Management Division and brings the Bank and our clients extensive experience in financial planning and asset management.  CFOs were also added to each management team, further deepening the expertise in each Division.  To support our growth, additional professionals were added to senior management.  Each person brings significant, larger bank experience to bear which helps us to not only be out in front of our growth but infuses best practices to our organization.  Additionally, leadership and management training programs are being developed to assist our leaders and ensure appropriate succession planning.
Technology is a continued area of concentration. We started the modernization of our technology platforms in 2015.  Those investments supported our growth in recent years and improved with the client experience and our efficiency.  As we enter the next phase of our strategic plan, we are fortunate to have Adam Bonanno join us as Chief Technology Officer for the Corporation and the Bank.  His broad experience with cyber security, data management and bank technology will have an immediate impact on the Corporation as we implement identified technology for the Bank and Wealth Management Division that will increase immediate efficiencies and help to expand our business.  We are excited about the future opportunities these platforms will provide the Corporation.
Looking ahead in 2019, we are in the process of establishing a formal Corporate Responsibility Program with our efforts organized around the following key areas: financial empowerment, volunteerism, diversity and inclusion and environmental responsibility.  We have always recognized our responsibility as a Corporate citizen and believe that social responsibility is a key dimension of our brand and reputation and will be fundamental to our growth over the coming years.
We remain focused on building and enhancing long term shareholder value, and are excited about the opportunities to strengthen and expand the BMT brand.  Thank you for your continued support in the Corporation and the Bank.

INFORMATION REGARDING THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 
Matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
[END TABLE]
This Proxy Statement is being furnished to shareholders of Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation ("we," "us," "our" or the "Corporation") in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of the Corporation for use at the Corporation's Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on Thursday, April 18, 2019, at 11:00 A.M. at Merion Cricket Club, 325 Montgomery Ave, Haverford, PA 19041, or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting (the "Annual Meeting"). At the Annual Meeting, the shareholders will consider and vote upon the election of three Class I directors, a non-binding advisory vote on executive officer compensation ("Say-on-Pay Proposal"), and the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and such other business as may properly come before the meeting or any adjournment thereof. The proxies are authorized to transact such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting.
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be Held on April 18, 2019 
This proxy statement and the Corporation's annual report to security holders on Form 10-K are available at www.envisionreports.com/BMTC or by following the instructions on the Corporation's Notice and Access card.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Notice and Access 
[END TABLE]
We use the "Notice and Access" method of providing proxy materials to you via the Internet instead of mailing printed copies. We believe that this process provides you with a convenient and quick way to access the proxy materials, including our proxy statement and 2018 annual report to shareholders on Form 10-K, and to authorize a proxy to vote your shares, while allowing us to conserve natural resources and reduce the costs of printing and distributing the proxy materials.
Most shareholders will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials unless they request them. Instead, the Important Notice Regarding Availability of Proxy Materials, which we refer to as the Notice and Access card, that was mailed to our shareholders on March 8, 2019, provides instructions regarding how you may access and review all of the proxy materials on the Internet. The Notice and Access card also includes instructions on how to submit your proxy via the Internet or telephone. If you would like to receive a paper or email copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials printed on the Notice and Access card.
If your shares are held by a brokerage house or other custodian, nominee or fiduciary in "street name," you will receive a Notice and Access card intended for their beneficial holders with instructions for providing to such intermediary voting instructions for your shares. You may also request paper copies of the proxy materials and provide voting instructions by completing the enclosed voting instruction form and returning it using the addressed, postage paid envelope included with the Notice and Access card. Alternatively, if you receive paper copies, many intermediaries direct their beneficial holders to provide voting instructions via the Internet or by telephone. If your shares are held in "street name" and you would like to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you must contact your broker, custodian, nominee or fiduciary to obtain a legal proxy form from the record holder of your shares and present it to the inspector of election with your ballot.

Record Date, Voting and Voting Procedures 
[END TABLE]
Our Board fixed the close of business on March 1, 2019, as the record date for determining holders of record of our common stock entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. Each shareholder is entitled to one vote per share on the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting. A quorum is the minimum number of shares required to be present at the Annual Meeting for the meeting to be properly held under our bylaws. The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, present either in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. As of March 1, 2019, there were 20,231,150 shares of our common stock outstanding. The shares for which shareholders abstain on one or more matters will be counted as present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum if the shareholder is physically present or if the shareholder has submitted a valid proxy for the shares, whether by Internet, telephone or executed paper proxy card. Broker non-votes will be counted as present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum so long as the shares are voted by the broker on at least one matter.
Shares represented by properly submitted proxies will be voted in accordance with the directions indicated in the proxies unless those proxies have been revoked prior to use. If a properly submitted proxy does not give any voting directions, then that proxy will be voted in favor of the adoption of the proposals recommended by the Board, and in the discretion of the proxy agents on any other matters which may properly come before the Annual Meeting.
For purposes of the Annual Meeting, if a quorum is present, the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation provide that each director shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy for that position. Cumulative voting is not permitted. "Withhold" votes and broker non-votes will not count in determining the number of votes required to elect a director, nor will they count in favor of or against a director's election.
For the other proposals to be presented at the Annual Meeting, if a quorum is present, the Corporation's bylaws require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares having voting powers and present in person or represented by proxy to approve the proposals. Abstentions and broker non-votes with respect to any such proposals are not deemed to constitute "votes cast" and, therefore, do not count either for or against approval of a given proposal.
A shareholder may revoke a proxy at any time prior to its use for any purpose by giving written notice of revocation prior to the Annual Meeting date to our Corporate Secretary, Lori A. Goldman, at our principal executive offices at 801 Lancaster Avenue, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010-3396. A shareholder may also appear in person at the Annual Meeting and ask to withdraw the proxy prior to its use for any purpose and can vote in person. A later dated proxy revokes an earlier dated proxy.
We do not know at this time of any business, other than that stated in this Proxy Statement, which will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting or with respect to any amendments or variations to the proposals described in this proxy statement.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Other Matters 
[END TABLE]
We will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting. In addition to the use of the mail, proxies may be solicited by personal interview, telephone, telefax and e-mail, by our directors, officers and employees and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including The Bryn Mawr Trust Company (which we refer to as the "Bank"). Arrangements have been made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for forwarding paper copies of our proxy materials to beneficial holders of our common stock held of record by such persons, and we will reimburse such persons for their expenses in doing so.
The term "Bryn Mawr Trust" in this proxy statement means collectively the Corporation and the Bank, or either of those institutions individually depending on the context.

Director Independence 
[END TABLE]
The Board has determined that all of its members during 2018, except for Francis J. Leto and F. Kevin Tylus, were independent and met the independence requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market, including the independence requirements for any committee on which such director served. In determining the directors' independence during 2018, other than for Messrs. Leto and Tylus, the Board of Directors considered routine banking transactions between the Bank or its affiliates and each of the directors, their family members and businesses with whom they are associated. Considerations included loans, deposit accounts, wealth management and fiduciary accounts, routine purchases of insurance or securities brokerage products, overdrafts on deposit accounts (if any), payments made to companies with which they are associated (if any), contributions the Corporation made to non-profit organizations with whom the directors are associated, and any transactions described below in the section of this Proxy Statement under the heading "TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS" at page 55. In each case, the Board of Directors determined that none of the transactions, relationships or arrangements impaired the independence of the director.

Board Leadership Structure 
[END TABLE]
The positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of the Corporation and the Bank are separate. Britton H. Murdoch is the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Francis J. Leto is the CEO. The CEO is responsible for setting the strategic direction, day-to-day leadership and performance for the Corporation and the Bank,while the Chairman maintains frequent contact with and provides guidance to the CEO; sets the agenda for and presides over Board meetings; acts as a liaison between management and non-management directors; and facilitates teamwork and communication between non-management directors and management. The Board believes maintaining separate Chairman and CEO positions enhances its ability to provide strong, independent oversight of the Corporation's and the Bank's management and affairs. In addition, maintaining separate positions of Chairman of the Board and CEO allows the CEO to better focus his efforts on strengthening our franchise and increasing shareholder value.
[BEGIN TABLE]
CEO & Management Succession Planning 
[END TABLE]
The Management Development & Compensation Committee ("Compensation Committee") plays a pivotal role in managing and developing the Corporation's NEOs and certain other key executives. At least annually, the Compensation Committee works with the full Board of Directors to formally assess the CEO's performance, and with the CEO to formally assess performance of all other executive officers. The Compensation Committee is also instrumental in evaluating potential executive candidates and overseeing development of executive succession plans. In 2018, management and the Compensation Committee undertook significant succession planning and infrastructure development. This effort spanned multiple layers of the organization.

Risk Oversight 
[END TABLE]
Bryn Mawr Trust engages in business activities and assumes related risks just as our financial services peers do. Material risks regularly reported to and monitored by the Board of Directors include credit, compliance, operational, cybersecurity, liquidity, market, reputational, and strategic risks. Our risk management activities focus on ensuring proper identification, measurement, and management of such risks across the enterprise to facilitate maintenance of safe and sound operations and financial condition. We promote a culture of compliance with laws and regulations. Our risk management goals are supportive of maximizing shareholder return and preserving shareholder value. Certain material risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.
The Board of Directors serves in an oversight capacity to ensure management effectively understands and manages risk to maximize value to its shareholders. The Board approves the Company's risk appetite, makes appropriate inquiries regarding management's risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks by comparing the actual risks to the risk appetite, stays informed of significant current and emerging risks, and determines whether management is responding appropriately to risks incurred. The Board challenges management and ensures accountability.
The Board of Directors believes establishing an appropriate "tone at the top" and maintaining honest and transparent communication between management and the Board are essential to maintaining effective risk management and oversight over the organization. Our CEO meets regularly with executive officers to discuss strategy and risks facing the Corporation and the Bank. Executive management attends the quarterly Board meetings, as well as the Executive and Risk Management Committee meetings in between Board meetings, and is available to address any questions or concerns raised by the Board regarding material risks and associated risk management practices. Each member of the Board of Directors receives regular presentations from executives and key members of senior management (including the Information Security Officer, Consumer Compliance Officer, Bank Secrecy Act Officer, Director of Facilities and Physical Security Officer) on strategic matters, key challenges, and risks and opportunities for the Corporation and the Bank, either as part of the full Board or the various Board committees. Additionally, the Board and executive management engage in strategic planning at an annual retreat, which provides a forum for the focus on long-term goals and challenges faced by the organization. 
The full Board, as well as the Board Committees, play an active role in overseeing management of the Corporation's risks.  See "Information about Committees of our Board of Directors" beginning on page 20 of this Proxy Statement for more information on responsibilities of each of the committees.  Below is a chart depicting how each committee assists the Board in its risk oversight responsibilities.
[BEGIN TABLE]

Nominations & Qualifications for Directors 
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates for director nominations from various sources, including current directors, our clients and other relevant constituencies, and may also engage, if it deems appropriate, a professional search firm. For incumbent directors whose terms of office are set to expire, the committee reviews the directors' overall service to the Corporation during their terms, including the number of meetings attended, level of participation, quality of performance and their respective contributions towards advancing Bryn Mawr Trust's interests and enhancing shareholder value. For a new director candidate, the committee reviews the candidate's biographical information and qualifications.  The committee may check references and obtain any additional information which it deems necessary. A qualified nominee will be interviewed by all members of the committee, if practicable. Serious candidates may meet with all members of the Board. Using the input from the interviews and information obtained, the committee evaluates whether a prospective candidate is qualified to serve as a director and whether it should recommend to the Board that the Board nominates (or selects to fill a vacancy with) the prospective candidate. 
In evaluating candidates for nominees for director, the committee considers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our need for particular talents and experience; 
• the candidate's ability to meet the independence standards under the Nasdaq Stock Market listing rules; and 
• the requirement that our Audit Committee meet the experience requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market rules and that at least one of our Audit Committee members qualifies as a financial expert under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). 
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Committee believes members of the Board should:

Director nominees must also be willing to commit the necessary time to Board activities, enhance their knowledge of the financial services industry, and assume broad fiduciary responsibility. They should be committed to enhancing shareholder value, including assisting in business development activities where appropriate. A nominee for director must be or become a shareholder upon joining the Board.

Diversity 
[END TABLE]
The Corporation and its Board strongly believe diversity is critical to the Corporation's success and creating long-term value for our shareholders. A Board consisting of individual directors with diverse backgrounds ensures broader representation and inspires deeper commitment to management, employees, and the community we serve. While not specific to a particular policy, the Board prioritizes diversity in gender, ethnic background, and professional experience when considering candidates for director as part of its commitment to diversity.  At present, 40% of our Board is diverse from a gender, race or ethnic perspective.  For additional information regarding the composition of our current Board, including diversity, see "Board Skills & Qualifications" at page 4.
In addition, we are committed to a culture of inclusiveness, equality and diversity at all levels of the Company's workforce, offering a supportive and understanding environment designed to assist all individuals in realizing their maximum potential, regardless of their differences. Our goal is to ensure that, in carrying out our activities, we promote equality of opportunity and good relations between people of diverse backgrounds, and avoid unlawful discrimination.  As of December 31, 2018, more than 30% of our executive officers, and more than 37% of our senior management team, were diverse from a gender, race or ethnic perspective.

Shareholder Engagement 
[END TABLE]
Executive management and certain Board members conducted shareholder outreach following the 2018 Annual Meeting. Our outreach was triggered in part by our desire to understand lower than expected 2018 "Say on Pay" voting results of 79% approval. The outreach took place during the course of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, and included some of our largest shareholders and certain of the shareholders who voted against our 2018 "Say on Pay" proposal. 
No shareholders identified particular concerns with our compensation structure or pay metrics. Certain shareholders requested clarification regarding portions of the 2017 payments to named executive officers ("NEOs"), such as: the change of control payment that was paid to Mr. Tylus in connection with the Royal Acquisition; and clarification regarding certain incentives, including two NEOs' cash bonuses aggregating approximately $52,000 and Mr. Leto's equity award, for extraordinary efforts in connection with the Royal Acquisition and the Company's many 2017 projects (see note 1 to the Equity Award Table in "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - Compensation Actions for 2018 - Long Term Incentive Compensation" on page 34). As a result of this feedback, we have enhanced certain of our compensation related disclosures in this Proxy Statement. The Company values shareholder opinion and the Compensation Committee strives to align executive compensation with the long-term interests of the Corporation and its shareholders. 
In addition, executive management and investor relations communicate with shareholders through a variety of routine forums, including earnings presentations, SEC filings, the Annual Report and Proxy Statement, the annual shareholder meeting, and investor meetings. They relay shareholder feedback and trends concerning corporate governance practices to our Board and its Committees, and work with them to enhance our practices and improve our disclosures.

Our business is managed by a Board of Directors that may consist of no fewer than eight nor more than twelve directors, as fixed from time to time by the Board. As provided in the bylaws, our Board is divided into four classes of directors, with each class being as nearly equal in number as possible. The Corporation and the Bank have the same Board members. Our Board is currently comprised of ten (10) directors, with three (3) members in Class I, three (3) members in Class II, two (2) members in Class III, and two (2) members in Class IV.
Under our bylaws, persons selected by the Board to fill a vacancy serve as directors for a term to be approved by the Corporation's shareholders at the next annual meeting. If a director is selected by the Board on or after the record date for an annual meeting, then the new director serves as a director until the subsequent annual meeting of shareholders. Each class of directors serves a four-year term. Directors remain in their positions until their successors are elected and take office.
In 2018, our Board of Directors met thirteen (13) times. Each director attended at least 75% of the Board meetings and the committee meetings that were held by the committees on which he or she served during 2018.

The Compensation Committee annually reviews the components of director compensation and makes recommendations to the full Board of Directors regarding any changes that the Compensation Committee believes should be made to director compensation.
We have agreed to pay, and our non-employee directors have agreed to accept, their annual $12,500 retainer compensation in the form of our common stock. The annual retainer is payable at the Board's organizational meeting, which is generally held in April of each year, at the market value of the stock on the day prior to the day of payment. This stock is issued under the Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation Retainer Stock Plan for Outside Directors (the "Retainer Plan"), which was approved by the Corporation's shareholders with an effective date of January 1, 2012. The purpose of the Retainer Plan is to provide competitive compensation for board service and strengthen the commonality of interests between directors and shareholders by allowing the Corporation to pay all or a portion of each outside director's compensation for services as a director in the form of BMBC common stock. Each director is required to own the equivalent of $100,000 in shares of our common stock by the end of his/her first term, which further aligns the directors' interests with those of our shareholders.
In addition to the annual retainer, each non-employee director is paid a standard fee of $1,500 for each Board meeting attended, $1,000 for attending the Corporation's organization meeting held after the annual meeting each year, and $1,250 for each committee meeting attended. A separate fee is not paid to directors for attending a Corporation Board meeting held on a Bank Board meeting day, nor is a separate fee paid to directors for attending committee meetings that are held in conjunction with the Bank Board meeting. From time to time there are telephonic Board and Committee meetings. The payment for telephonic meetings, whether for the Board or a Committee, depends on the meeting length. Directors are paid a fee of $750 for meetings that are at least 45 minutes long, and $500 for meetings less than 45 minutes. A $10,000 fee was paid to the Audit Committee Chair in 2018 and a $5,000 fee was paid to the chair of each of the other committees. Further, the Chairman of the Board received additional cash compensation of $40,000 and 228 additional RSUs in 2018. See "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS— Compensation Actions for 2018 - Long-Term Incentive Compensation" at page 33 for more information regarding the RSUs granted in 2018. From time to time, directors may also be reimbursed for travel expenses associated with attendance at Board or committee meetings.

Equity Awards 
[END TABLE]
Directors are eligible to participate in our Amended and Restated 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2010 LTIP"). In a given year, each non-employee director serving after our Annual Meeting is eligible to be granted equity awards under our 2010 LTIP, at such number and on such terms as the Board of Directors, in its discretion, decides to grant. In 2018, each of our non-employee directors was granted RSUs under our 2010 LTIP. See "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS— Compensation Actions for 2018 - Long-Term Incentive Compensation" on page 33 of this Proxy Statement for additional information regarding RSUs.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Directors' Deferred Payment Plans 
[END TABLE]
Under our Deferred Payment Plan for the Corporation's Directors and an identical plan for the Bank's directors (the "Director Plans"), a director may defer receipt of a portion or all of the fees paid for service as a director. The Director Plans are non-qualified plans and the Director Plans' funds are held in a trust administered by the Bank's Wealth Management Division. Under the Director Plans, a participating director may earn a yield on the deferred director's fees based on the yield on one or more different investment funds. The investment options include a number of outside independent mutual funds, a Bryn Mawr Trust brokerage account through which the director may freely select his or her own investments, and an investment in our common stock. A director may change his or her investment options quarterly, except that any fees deferred which would otherwise have been paid in the form of shares of our common stock must remain invested under the Director Plans in units of phantom stock for one year following the deferral date. All distributions from the deferred account must be in cash or shares of our common stock (or equivalent phantom stock), as selected by the director. The director may choose to have the deferred account distributed to him or her on: (a) the date he or she ceases to serve as a director; (b) his or her 65th birthday; or (c) any date in the three-year period after the director ceases to serve as a member of the Board. Payments to the director may be made in annual installments payable for up to ten years or in a single lump-sum payment. Upon a director's death prior to the distribution date, his or her beneficiary will be paid the balance in the director's account in a single lump-sum payment. The Board may amend or terminate the Director Plans, in whole or in part, without the consent of any director who has deferred compensation into the Director Plans, but an amendment may not adversely affect the amounts credited to a director's account before the amendment. The right to receive future payments under the Director Plans is an unsecured claim against our general assets.

PROPOSAL 2 – A NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
PROPOSAL 2 – A NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
[END TABLE]
Section 14A of the Exchange Act requires that we include in this Proxy Statement the opportunity for our shareholders to vote on an advisory (non-binding) resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers ("NEOs"), referred to as "Say-on-Pay." Accordingly, this Say-on-Pay proposal gives you, as a shareholder, the opportunity to endorse or not endorse our executive pay program through the following resolution submitted for shareholder approval at the Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and narrative discussion in the Corporation's Proxy Statement for the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, is hereby approved."
While this vote is non-binding, the Board and the Compensation Committee expect to take into account the outcome of this vote in considering future executive officer compensation arrangements. It is our practice, based on Board recommendation and shareholder approval (last obtained in 2017), to submit a Say-on Pay resolution to shareholders on an annual basis. The next non-binding vote with respect to the frequency of the Say-on-Pay vote will be submitted to shareholders no later than our annual meeting in 2023.
As described in detail under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the Board believes that the talents of our employees have a significant influence on our long-term success. Our compensation system plays a significant role in our ability to attract, retain and motivate a quality workforce. The Board believes that our current compensation program links executive compensation to performance, aligning the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders, and encourages you to review carefully the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 28, along with the tabular and other disclosures on Executive Compensation beginning on page 39 of this Proxy Statement.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee recognizes the importance of executive compensation to our shareholders and considers the most recent Say-on-Pay advisory voting results in making compensation decisions.  At the 2018 Annual Meeting, approximately 79% of shares cast voted "For" our 2017 named executive officer compensation. While we believe this indicates our shareholders' support of the Corporation's executive compensation plan, we initiated discussions with certain of the Corporation's shareholders to obtain additional insight with respect to their view of our executive compensation practices. More information about this shareholder engagement can be found under the heading "Shareholder Engagement" on page 19.  As it has made decisions with respect to 2018 executive Annual Incentive Awards and 2019 executive compensation, the Compensation Committee has considered the feedback received through the shareholder engagement process and has continued its custom of evaluating and, where appropriate, enhancing the Corporation's compensation practices in an effort to achieve optimal results in aligning the long-term interests of the Corporation's executive officers with those of the Corporation and its shareholders.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Compensation Program and Philosophy 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes that competitive compensation is critical for attracting, retaining and motivating qualified and effective executives. The goal of our executive compensation methodology is to retain and reward leaders who create long-term value for our shareholders. This goal affects the compensation elements we use and our compensation decisions. Our compensation methods reward sustained financial and operating performance and leadership excellence, align the executives' long-term interests with those of our shareholders, and motivate executives to build on their expertise and remain with the Corporation for long and productive careers. Currently, our executive compensation program includes the following primary elements:
• base salary;
[BEGIN TABLE]
• short-term incentive compensation primarily in the form of Annual Incentive Awards, which are aligned with corporate performance; 
• long-term incentive compensation, principally in the form of performance and time-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") under our Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP"); and 
• retirement and other benefits. 
[END TABLE]
Our approach to allocating between short-term and long-term compensation has been to ensure adequate base compensation to attract and retain executives, while providing incentives to enhance the long-term financial standing of the Corporation and to enhance the value of our shares for our shareholders. We pay base salary to provide financial security, and Annual Incentive Awards to motivate performance of short-term goals. Long-term compensation in the form of RSUs is offered to balance short and long-term motivations through rewards linked to the performance of multi-year goals. Finally, we pay retirement and other benefits to encourage loyalty and productivity, and to be competitive with peer institutions.
Each year, the Compensation Committee pays particular attention to CEO compensation to ensure that it reflects operating and stock performance and demonstrates awareness of investor sentiment. Together with Mr. Leto, the Compensation Committee also focuses on compensation of the other named executive officers to achieve the right balance of incentives to appropriately reward and retain executives and maximize their performance over the long-term. The Compensation Committee recognizes that value-creating performance by an executive or group does not necessarily translate immediately into appreciation of the Corporation's stock price, however, the Compensation Committee intends to continue to reward management performance based on its belief that, over time, strong operating performance and earnings growth will be reflected through level or increased stock prices.
While the Compensation Committee operates within the framework of the compensation philosophy, the Committee retains full discretion and the right to determine compensation for executives based on the data and information available to it. The Compensation Committee did not use set formulas in determining the amount and mix of overall compensation granted to named executive officers (referred to as "NEOs" or "named executives") in 2018.
As compensation practices within our industry evolve, the Compensation Committee recognizes the importance of keeping current and continues to evaluate and enhance our compensation practices on a regular basis.

Consideration of Risk 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee strives to provide strong incentives to manage the Corporation for the long-term, while avoiding excessive risk taking in the short-term. Goals and objectives reflect a fair mix of quantitative and qualitative performance measures to avoid excessive weight on a single performance measure. While Annual Incentive Awards are granted to reward executives in the shorter term, equity awards - such as performance- and time-based RSUs - are granted to incentivize executives to work towards long-term goals and sustained shareholder value. Likewise, the elements of compensation are balanced among current cash payments, equity awards and optional deferred bonus plans. With limited exceptions, the Compensation Committee retains full discretion to adjust compensation for quality of performance, contribution to the organization, and adherence to company values.
The Compensation Committee reviews the relationship between our risk management practices and the incentive compensation we provide to our named executives annually to confirm that our incentive compensation does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks. The Compensation Committee also reviews the relationship between risk management practices, corporate strategy and senior executive compensation.
The Compensation Committee does not believe that any of the current incentive plans, policies, or methods pose an excessive risk to the Corporation's short- or long-term financial stability. Controls are in place at the management level, and overseen by the Compensation Committee, to ensure incentive plans, policies, and methods are evaluated annually and revised as necessary. The Compensation Committee believes that these controls effectively mitigate risks that may arise under incentive plans, policies, and methods.
Hedging & Pledging Policy
The Corporation strongly discourages all directors and executive officers from hedging or pledging our securities. Pursuant to our Insider Trading Policy, any director or executive officer seeking to hedge or pledge our securities must obtain pre-approval for the transaction from the Compliance Officer. In 2018, no directors or executive officers hedged or pledged the Corporation's securities.

2018 Salaries
In 2018, our compensation philosophy and overall goals largely remained consistent with past years, and the reasons for the various changes in NEO salaries in 2018 related primarily to merit and, in some cases, the competitive hiring market. Merit increases were based on individual and divisional performance, and designed to ensure comparability to the Corporation's peers using a 2018 compensation and peer group analysis performed by McLagan ("2018 McLagan Compensation Analysis") (see "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Benchmarking Data and Use of Compensation Consultants" beginning at page 35). Below is a chart depicting the salary changes year-over-year for each NEO, including a summary of the factors that primarily contributed to such changes.
[BEGIN TABLE]
NEO 2017 Base Salary*† 2018 Base Salary**† Primary Factors Contributing to Salary Change 
Francis J. Leto $570,000 $603,000 Merit: Mr. Leto received a merit increase for 2018 based on his contributions towards strong overall financial results and all-time high stock price. Of particular note include Mr. Leto's role in: the Royal Acquisition and Hirshorn Boothby aquisition; the Corporation's December 2017 subordinated debt offering; the August 2017 launch of a proprietary mutual fund; enhancements to product offerings of the Bank; certain reorganizational efforts within the enterprise, including certain key hires such as Bank President F. Kevin Tylus, Wealth Management Division President Jennifer D. Fox, and Chief Risk Officer Patrick M. Killeen; the Bank's good standing within the community; and enhancing employee engagement and morale. 
Michael W. Harrington $335,000 $355,000 Merit: Mr. Harrington received a merit increase for 2018 based on his individual performance and contributions, including: the rollout of a significant accounts payable project; key employee hires and build out of a Capital Markets program with very positive 2017 results; strengthening of the Bank's investor relations program; and the enhancement of a long-term earnings model. 
Alison J. Eichert $335,000 $360,000 Merit: Ms. Eichert received a merit increase in 2018 as a result of her individual performance and contributions to achieving the Bank's overall goals. Particularly notable were Ms. Eichert's role: in leading the Royal Acquisition strategy and in other M&A activities, and in developing a shared services leaders platform. 
Jennifer D. Fox $310,000 $310,000 Contractual: Ms. Fox's salary was agreed upon pursuant to the terms of her employment agreement (See "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION – Executive Employment Agreements" at page 40).

Annual Incentive Methodology
In 2016, the Compensation Committee established an annual incentive methodology ("annual incentive methodology" or the "methodology") for use in determining cash bonus awards ("Annual Incentive Awards") for the Corporation's executive management team, including our NEOs. The Committee had four primary objectives in establishing this methodology, including to:
• Enhance the link between pay and performance through specific, quantifiable goals;
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Simplify the communication and administration of cash incentives for the Corporation's executive management team; 
• Align with regulatory guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies; and 
• Align with the expectations of shareholders. 
[END TABLE]
The annual incentive methodology provided each participant with a unique award opportunity denominated as a percent of his or her 2018 salary. The Annual Incentive Award opportunity for each NEO was intended to provide market-competitive incentive compensation with corporate and individual performance objectives required to achieve award payouts. The annual incentive methodology had specifically defined threshold, target, and maximum performance levels which correspond to threshold, target, and maximum payouts. No award would have been paid for any goal on which performance was below the threshold level, and no additional award would have been earned for performance above maximum on any goal. Payouts were prorated for performance between established levels on any given incentive metric.
The table below details the Annual Incentive Award opportunities for each officer for 2018.
[BEGIN TABLE]

F. Kevin Tylus 20% 40% 70% 75,000 150,000 262,500 
[END TABLE]
Corporate Performance Component
The annual incentive methodology conditioned Annual Incentive Awards for our NEOs on the Corporation's achievement relative to four defined corporate performance goals, which comprised, at target, 80% of the Annual Incentive Award opportunity for each NEO. The corporate performance goals were approved by the Compensation Committee and represented key strategic performance objectives for 2018. The Compensation Committee felt the inclusion of these four corporate goals allowed payouts under the methodology to reflect a broad measurement of corporate performance in 2018, including bottom-line profitability, exclusive of due diligence and merger-related expenses; top line revenue objectives; and safety and soundness. The assessment of corporate goals was based on the reported financial results of the Corporation, exclusive of due diligence and merger related expenses, for the 2018 fiscal year. Financial results are subject to adjustment at the discretion of the Compensation Committee to exclude the impact of one-time extraordinary gains or losses, which may have the effect of either increasing or decreasing calculated payouts under the methodology. No such adjustments were made for 2018.

* Reflects core net income, which excludes due diligence and merger-related expenses, and certain other non-core income and expense items, as detailed in the Corporation's January 17, 2019 earnings press release.  The Committee has determined that the core net income measure is more appropriate than a GAAP net income measure for use in the annual incentive methodology as it provides a more comparable basis on which to evaluate the Corporation's annual performance.  Further, using the core net income metric aligns executive compensation with the Corporation's long-term performance goals as it mitigates the risk that executive management is dis-incentivized from pursuing strategies that position the Corporation well for future performance, but at significant non-recurring expense during the first year, such as acquisitions that should be accretive to long-term shareholder value.  
[END TABLE]
Individual Performance Component
In addition to the corporate performance component, each NEO's Annual Incentive Award opportunity was comprised of an individual performance component. The purpose of the individual component of the methodology was to reflect qualitative and other corporate performance results outside of the four enumerated corporate goals, and individual performance.
Performance on the individual component was assessed subjectively by the CEO (except with respect to Mr. Leto), and reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. Multiple factors were considered in this subjective assessment, including but not limited to:
• Overall corporate performance;
• Performance relative to peers or the banking industry in general;
• Progress on key strategic initiatives;
• Regulatory relationships and evaluations; 
• The performance of each individual's business line or department; and
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Extraordinary unplanned accomplishments outside of the planned annual goals but which significantly contributed to organizational success and increased shareholder value. 
[END TABLE]
Each NEO's individual performance was assessed by the CEO and Compensation Committee on a 0-30% scale, with 20% representing "expected" performance. Awards on the individual component were then calculated formulaically in similar fashion to the company goals and aggregated with the company goals to achieve an overall Annual Incentive Award calculation.  The table below indicates the final Annual Incentive Award cash payouts approved by the Compensation Committee under the methodology for 2018, based on the corporate and individual performance conditions described above:

[END TABLE]
Long-Term Incentive Compensation
The Compensation Committee believes that a portion of the NEOs' compensation should be tied to the Corporation's operating and stock price performance over the long term to align compensation with long-term performance and further align the interests of executives with those of shareholders. The Corporation's current long-term incentive plan under which NEOs are eligible in 2018 to receive awards is the Amended and Restated 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2010 LTIP"), which allows the Compensation Committee flexibility to issue equity incentive awards such as stock options, stock grants, and both time-based and performance-based restricted stock units and restricted stock awards. Subject to an increasing scale over five years for new employees, NEOs other than the CEO are required to own the equivalent value of one and a half times their base salary in common stock of the Corporation. The CEO is required to hold, within five years, three times his base salary in common stock of the Corporation. This further aligns their interests with those of our shareholders.
In 2018, the Corporation awarded its grants under the 2010 LTIP for executive officers using a similar methodology to that which was used in 2016 and 2017, with approximately 1/3 of grants consisting of time-based RSUs and 2/3 of grants consisting of performance-based RSUs. The main change in 2018 related to the time-based portion of the grants, which were revised to shift from a pro-rata model (providing for annual vesting at 33.3% over three years) to a cliff-based model (providing for vesting in whole at the three-year anniversary of the grant date). The objectives of the 2018 RSU grants were to:
• Provide officers with competitive levels of equity compensation;
• Create alignment between the interests of management and the interests of shareholders;
• Reward executives for performance over a multi-year period; and
• Align the grants with recent guidance and industry best practices.
The 2018 grants made to executives include both time and performance-based RSUs and other criteria as outlined below.
• 66.7%* Performance-Based RSUs:
◦50%* related to Total Shareholder Return;
◦50%* related to Return on Average Equity;
◦In each case, measured against the approved compensation peer group; and
◦Subject to three-year cliff vesting, followed by two year holding period.
• 33.3%* Time-Based RSUs:
◦Contingent upon continued employment; and
◦Subject to three-year time cliff vesting, followed by two year holding period.
* Percentages are based on grant date fair value
The value of RSUs awarded in 2018 to each of our NEOs was based on a specified percentage of his or her salary. The amounts were intended to provide market-competitive equity incentive compensation to each of our NEOs, conditioned to a significant degree on long-term corporate performance. The number of RSUs actually granted to each NEO was determined based on the targeted percentage of salary and calculated grant date fair value of the award. The Committee opted to benchmark the awards against the 75th percentile of the compensation peer group in an effort to both incentivize continued long-term performance and retention, as well as reward the exceptional performance of the executives.

F. Kevin Tylus 3,088 1,497 199,926 
[END TABLE]
The vesting conditions on the 2018 RSUs described above are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Time-Based Portion: The time-based RSUs, which make up 1/3 of each award, will vest in whole at the conclusion of a three-year vesting period, contingent on continued employment, except as set forth in Note 1 below.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance-Based Portion: The performance-based RSUs, which make up 2/3 of each award, will, subject to performance-based vesting criterion, vest at the conclusion of the three-year vesting period. The amount that will vest will be determined by the Corporation's percentile rank compared to our compensation peer group. Performance at or below the 25th percentile will result in 0% of the performance-based RSUs vesting, performance at the 50th percentile will result in 100% of the performance-based RSUs vesting, and performance at or above the 75th percentile will result in 150% of the performance-based RSUs vesting. If the applicable Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") or Return on Average Equity ("ROAE") Percentile Rank is greater than 25% and less than 75% with respect to the relevant Performance Period, the number of RSUs that vest will be prorated based on the actual level of performance achieved. One-half of the performance-based RSUs (1/3 of the total award) are based on the Corporation's ROAE performance, and one-half of the performance-based RSUs (1/3 of the total award) are based on the Corporation's TSR performance, each as described below: 
◦ ROAE-Based Portion: The performance period for these awards runs from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2021, with final certification and vesting of awards (if any) occurring on August 9, 2021. 
◦ TSR-Based Portion: The performance period for these awards runs from August 9, 2018 to August 9, 2021, with final certification and vesting of awards (if any) occurring on August 9, 2021. If the Corporation's TSR is negative at the end of the performance period, vesting of these awards cannot exceed the Target level, regardless of performance relative to our peers. 
[END TABLE]
Dividend equivalents for both time-based and performance-based awards will accrue over the vesting period, and participants will receive payouts at vesting based upon the final number of RSUs that vest.
(1) Mr. Leto's award includes 2,400 time-based RSUs having a grant date fair value of $100,000, which will vest in equal installments over three years, that were granted in February 2018 as an equity award in recognition of Mr. Leto's extraordinary efforts and accomplishments in 2017 including the Royal Acquisition and Hirshorn Boothby acquisition, the launch of a proprietary mutual fund, the completion of a successful subordinated debt offering, and other 2017 accomplishments.  The award was also intended to have some retentive value, and to bring Mr. Leto's compensation more in line with similarly situated executives in the Corporation's peer group which would not have been accomplished under the standard cash Annual Incentive Award that was paid under the annual incentive methodology. See "BENCHMARKING DATA AND USE OF COMPENSATION CONSULTANTS" at page 35.  While the Compensation Committee views this grant as compensation for 2017 performance, it is included in this 2018 Compensation Discussion and Analysis, and the tables set forth in the section titled "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION" beginning at page 39, due to the requirement under Item 402 of Regulation S-K that all stock-based compensation be disclosed in the year of grant.
2015 Performance-Based RSU Vesting
In August 2018, the performance-based RSUs granted in August 2015 vested. The Corporation's TSR for the three-year period yielded 77.29% and the Nasdaq Community Bank Index's TSR yielded 45.11%, which resulted in a 100% vesting and payout of awards.

Benchmarking Data and Use of Compensation Consultants 
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the Compensation Committee used a peer data analysis to evaluate compensation practices and considered the results of comparative surveys with respect to executive compensation as one of the many factors it used to determine overall executive compensation.
The Compensation Committee engaged McLagan, an AON Hewitt company (referred to as "McLagan"), as a compensation consultant to support Compensation related activities. Neither the consultant nor its affiliates were engaged to provide additional services to the Corporation or the Bank requiring additional disclosure pursuant to Regulation S-K Item 407(e). A Compensation Committee Adviser Independence Assessment, including evaluation of conflicts of interest, was completed as required under the SEC and NASDAQ rules for compensation advisors. The compensation consultant was deemed independent, without conflicts of interest.
The Compensation Committee engaged McLagan to provide consulting services relative to the design of the annual incentive methodology and the RSU award program for 2018 (the "2018 McLagan Compensation Analysis") (see "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Annual Incentive Methodology" and "Long-Term Incentive Compensation" beginning at pages 31 and 33, respectively).
The 2018 McLagan Compensation Analysis included the development of a peer group for use with compensation related decisions. These results were used for all compensation decisions in 2018 that involved peer-based analysis. McLagan developed potential peer groups with a regional, national and combined focus. Bryn Mawr Trust's unique combination of business specialties and results makes finding a peer group challenging. Specifically, the size of and contribution from the Wealth Management Division are unmatched in our relative peer banks. While there may be no perfect fit, McLagan used several criteria to identify an appropriate compensation peer group. Upon review, the Committee adopted a combined peer group for 2018 executive compensation related decisions ("compensation peer group") consisting of the following institutions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 1st Source Corp. 
• Boston Private Financial 
• Camden National Corp. 
• CoBiz Financial Inc. 
• First Busey Corp. 
• First Commonwealth Financial 
• First Financial Bankshares 
• Horizon Bancorp 
• Independent Bank Corp. 
• Lakeland Financial Corp. 
• Midland States Bancorp Inc. 
• Opus Bank 
• Peapack-Gladstone Financial 
• Peoples Bancorp Inc. 
• Sandy Spring Bancorp Inc. 
• Stock Yards Bancorp Inc. 
• Tompkins Financial Corporation 
• Univest Corp. of Pennsylvania 
• Washington Trust Bancorp Inc. 
• WSFS Financial Corp. 
[END TABLE]
Following the adoption of the peer group in 2018, the Committee further engaged McLagan to evaluate compensation for the executive leaders as well as the Board. The compensation study evaluated the mix of base salary, equity compensation, and Annual Incentive Award compensation for peer executives, and was considered in 2018 compensation actions for certain NEOs as discussed earlier in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis.

Other Compensation Elements 
[END TABLE]
The following summarizes the compensation elements we use as tools to reward, align and retain our named executives in addition to the base salaries, Annual Incentive Awards, and RSU awards described above.
Deferred Compensation and Defined Benefit Plans
To attract and retain qualified executive officers, in 2018 we offered our executive officers, and other employees who earned in excess of the Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) compensation limit, participation in our Deferred Bonus Plan for Executives, which allows payment of any Annual Incentive Award received to be deferred, and provides the executive with sole discretion as to the investment of such deferred amounts. The right to receive future payments under the Deferred Bonus Plan is an unsecured claim against our general assets.
The Corporation also provides retirement benefits to the NEOs under the same 401(k) Plan ("401(k) Plan") in which other employees participate. Additionally, Ms. Eichert participates in two supplemental employee retirement plans (respectively, the "First Supplemental Plan" and the "Second Supplemental Plan," and together, the "Supplemental Plans") that were designed to serve as a long-term retention tool for executives. The First Supplemental Plan was frozen effective March 31, 2008, and the Second Supplemental Plan was frozen effective March 31, 2013.
Following the freezing of the Second Supplemental Plan in 2013, the Compensation Committee adopted the 2013 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "2013 Executive Plan"), which is a non-qualified defined-contribution plan designed to better align NEO interests with the interests of the Corporation and its shareholders. The 2013 Executive Plan provides for the award, and ultimate realization, of certain deferred compensation benefits based, in part, on the achievement of certain performance goals determined each year. Under the 2013 Executive Plan, the Corporation will allocate amounts to the deferred compensation account of each participant. The amounts to be allocated to participants' accounts consist of three distinct parts:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A fixed 1.5% of the participant's then-current base annual salary, contributed quarterly ("Fixed Contribution"); 
• Interest credited at the rate of 120% of the long-term applicable federal rate prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service on the previous quarters balance ("Accrued Interest"); and 
• A variable allocation based on achievement of certain performance goals, contributed annually ("Performance Contribution"). 
[END TABLE]
Goals for the Performance Contribution are established by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of each year.
For 2018, the Committee adopted two goals related to the Corporation's Return on Assets ("ROA") and Earnings per Share ("EPS"). Because of the robust performance goals associated with a significant portion of the award potential, we view the 2013 Executive Plan as part of our long-term incentive strategy, rather than a traditional retirement plan. Each participant is eligible to receive a Performance Contribution ranging from 6% of base salary at target performance, if all targets are met, to 9% of base salary at maximum performance. No Performance Contributions are awarded for performance below target. The maximum goal must be attained in each ROA and EPS growth target to receive the additional Performance Contribution. 
Based on actual performance in 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that the Corporation achieved the maximum performance levels for both EPS and ROA. As a result, each participant was allocated a Fixed Contribution of 6% of his or her base salary (1.5% quarterly), plus Performance Contributions of an additional 3% of base salary for the achievement of the ROA goal, and 3% of base salary for the achievement of the EPS goal, and an additional 3% for achieving maximum performance on both goals for results achieved against goals established at the beginning of 2018.
See the sections entitled "401(k) Plan" and "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" beginning at pages 48 and 49, respectively, of this Proxy Statement for more information.

Change of Control and Severance Arrangements
In order to recruit qualified employees, the Bank may provide, at its discretion or in some instances pursuant to contractual obligations, severance benefits to our executive officers and other employees if their positions are eliminated or if they are terminated involuntarily without cause. In those cases where severance benefits are provided, the Bank enters into a severance agreement with the departing employee, which includes a full release of all claims against the Bank and its affiliates.
We also have change of control agreements ("Change of Control Agreements") with each of our NEOs, which are designed to be competitive with the market and the Compensation Committee believes that the amount of the benefits is appropriate. The Change of Control Agreements contain a double trigger for payments, requiring both a change of control and termination of employment at any time during the two years following the change of control, either (a) without cause by the Bank, or (b) by the executive officer for good reason. "Change of control" is defined under the agreements as (a) the acquisition by any person or group of twenty-five percent or more of our outstanding common stock, or (b) incumbent members of our Board cease to be at least a majority of the Board. The Change of Control Agreements provide for a cash payment of three times the executive's base salary at the time they are triggered, and an additional cash payment equal to the difference between the price of our common stock on the date of the change of control and the exercise price of all options held by the executive officer. Upon a trigger event, an executive officer is entitled to his or her earned bonus and other benefits. See "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION—Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control" beginning on page 50 of this Proxy Statement for more information.
Perquisites and Other Benefit Compensation
Other than reimbursement for expenses where spouses accompany executives in connection with business travel and entertainment, it is our general policy not to provide perquisites to executive officers. In isolated cases, and where appropriate to achieve our corporate goals, we may agree to give limited perquisites to specific executive officers.
To attract and retain executive talent, we provide term life, health, disability and dental insurance to our NEOs on terms similar to those we provide other employees generally, except with respect to payments upon change of control, death or disability. See "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION—Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control" beginning on page 50 of this Proxy Statement. Each NEO is also covered by a disability insurance policy that will pay a lifetime benefit of approximately 70% of base monthly salary.
Tax Deductibility of Compensation - The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") imposed a $1 million limit on the amount that a public company may deduct for compensation paid to its CEO or any of its three other most highly compensated executive officers who were employed as of the end of the year. This limitation previously did not apply to compensation that satisfied the requirements under Section 162(m) for "qualifying performance-based" compensation (i.e., compensation paid only if the individual's performance meets pre-established objective goals based on performance criteria approved by shareholders). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"), enacted in December 2017, repealed the performance-based compensation exception to the $1 million deduction limitation and extended applicability of the Section 162(m) limitation to the chief financial officer. The Act's changes to 162(m), however, do not apply to compensation paid pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect as of November 2, 2017, and which was not materially modified or renewed on or after November 2, 2017. Accordingly, compensation paid under those arrangements is generally still tax deductible.
For 2018, the Corporation's grants of RSUs and Annual Incentive Awards were designed to satisfy the requirements for deductible compensation. In 2018, the Compensation Committee structured our compensation methods, where feasible, to minimize or eliminate the impact of limitations or penalties such as those in Section 162(m), and did not otherwise consider accounting or tax treatments of particular forms of compensation in making compensation decisions. The Compensation Committee considers the potential effects of Section 162(m) of the Code on the deductibility of compensation paid to NEOs, but may award compensation to the NEOs that is not deductible where the Compensation Committee believes that shareholder interests are best served.

(1) Reflects bonuses awarded to the NEOs in 2017 and 2016. For 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that bonus payments in the form of Annual Incentive Awards to NEOs would have no discretionary element and would instead be based solely on the amount determined using the annual incentive methodology. As such, Annual Incentive Awards granted to NEOs with respect to 2018 performance are included in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column, rather than the Bonus column. 
(2) Reflects the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes for each fiscal year indicated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. For a discussion of the assumptions made in the valuation of these awards, please see "Stock–Based Compensation" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the applicable year. The value of the performance-based RSUs included in this column assumes achievement of the maximum level of performance conditions. 
(3) Amounts included for 2018 in this column reflect (i) Annual Incentive Awards granted during the first quarter of 2019 based on 2018 performance determined using the annual incentive methodology, and (ii) the Performance Contribution awarded due to the achievement of the 2018 performance goals under the 2013 Executive Plan, each as depicted in the following table. Beginning with 2018 disclosure, we have determined that the amounts awarded under the 2013 Executive Plan are more appropriately disclosed in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column with respect to Performance Contributions, and in the All Other Compensation Column with respect to Fixed Contributions. Amounts included for 2017 and 2016 in this column reflect the full amount awarded under the 2013 Executive Plan for each NEO during such year.  For information on the annual incentive methodology and 2013 Executive Plan, see "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Compensation Actions for 2018 – Annual Incentive Methodology" and "Other Compensation Elements – Deferred Compensation and Defined Benefit Plans" beginning at pages 31 and 36, respectively.

Executive Employment Agreements 
[END TABLE]
Each of Messrs. Leto, Harrington and Tylus, and Ms. Fox, are party to employment agreements with Bryn Mawr Trust which provide, among other things, that such officers will receive normal benefits afforded to full time employees and are eligible for all other executive compensation programs detailed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Each employment agreement provides the executive with a base salary that is subject to annual increase. Mr. Tylus' employment agreement set his salary at $375,000, subject to annual increases, and Ms. Fox's employment agreement set her salary at $310,000, subject to annual increases.
Under the respective employment agreements, Bryn Mawr Trust may terminate the employment agreement of the applicable executive upon his or her death, Disability or for Cause as those terms are defined in the employment agreement. If employment is terminated due to Disability, Bryn Mawr Trust must continue to pay his or her full salary for a period equal to the applicable "elimination period" under any group long-term disability insurance provided by us (currently 180 days), or, if the Bank ceases to provide group long-term disability insurance, we must pay his or her full salary through the last day of the 180-day period following the date of termination.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  BRYN MAWR BANK CORPORATION    l   2019 PROXY STATEMENT    l  40 
[END TABLE]
For Messrs. Leto and Harrington, and Ms. Fox, if the executive's employment is terminated for reasons other than Disability and other than for Cause, the executive is entitled to receive payment of an amount equal to a multiple of his or her annual salary (for Mr. Leto, two times, for Mr. Harrington and Ms. Fox, one times) at the rate in effect on the date of the Notice of Termination in substantially equal biweekly installments provided the executive signs and does not revoke a waiver and release. In addition, Bryn Mawr Trust will be responsible for paying 100% of the applicable premiums for COBRA continuation for the executive and his/her eligible dependents for a specified period following the Date of Termination (for Mr. Leto, 18 months, and for Mr. Harrington and Ms. Fox, 12 months, or until such time that the executive or his/her dependents are no longer eligible). Mr. Leto's employment agreement also provides that any unvested equity awards will automatically vest in such a case of termination.
The employment agreements of Messrs. Leto, Harrington and Tylus, and Ms. Fox, also contain standard non-disclosure, non-solicitation and non-competition provisions applicable for specified periods of time following termination of employment.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Equity Based Compensation 
[END TABLE]
All of the named executives have equity awards outstanding under the 2010 Plan, and Ms. Eichert has equity awards outstanding under the 2007 LTIP as of December 31, 2018.
2007 Plan
The 2007 LTIP broadened the types of awards available to include stock options, stock grants, and both time- and performance-based RSUs, and restricted stock awards. Under the 2007 LTIP, options become immediately exercisable in full if any of the following happen within two (2) years after a Change of Control:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the participant's employment is terminated without cause; 
• the participant terminates employment with good reason; or 
• the participant's employment terminates under circumstances that entitle the participant to benefit under the participant's Change of Control Agreement (more fully described in the section entitled "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION-Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control-Change of Control" on page 50 of this Proxy Statement). 
[END TABLE]
Under the 2007 LTIP, outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights also become immediately exercisable in full:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if we are the surviving entity in a merger and do not make any adjustments necessary to preserve the value of participants' outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights; or 
• if we are not the survivor and the surviving entity does not assume the obligations under the 2007 LTIP. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, determine that, upon a Change of Control, a cash payment may be made for any outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights granted under the 2007 LTIP. The amount payable would be equal to the excess of the fair market value of a share of common stock prior to the Change of Control over the exercise price of the stock option or stock appreciation right. If a cash payment is made, each related stock option or stock appreciation right would terminate and the participant would have no further rights except the right to receive the cash payment.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  BRYN MAWR BANK CORPORATION    l   2019 PROXY STATEMENT    l  41 
[END TABLE]
2010 Plan
The 2010 LTIP provided for the grant of certain awards to employees, including our officers, officers of our subsidiaries and our directors. The 2010 LTIP further broadened the types of awards available to participants to: incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options (incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options are collectively called "options"), stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents, and both time- and performance-based RSUs, and restricted stock awards.
In 2015, we amended and restated the 2010 plan. The awards granted under the 2010 LTIP to date have been time- and performance-based RSUs. The Compensation Committee has broad discretion with respect to the terms of RSUs that it grants, including among many others, providing for solely time-based units and setting objective performance goals that must be met for RSUs. For more information regarding the RSUs that were granted in 2018, see "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS— Compensation Actions for 2018 - Long-Term Incentive Compensation" at page 33.
As of December 31, 2018, the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the 2010 Plan was 945,002 shares in total. An aggregate maximum of 407,619 shares of common stock remained available for grant at that date under the 2010 LTIP. No shares remain available for grant under the 2007 LTIP.

Grants of Plan-Based Awards 
[END TABLE]
As reflected in the table below, the Compensation Committee awarded RSUs in 2018 that contained three different types of vesting elements: one time-based vesting element, and two performance-based vesting elements. Upon vesting, RSUs granted to NEOs in 2018 are generally subject to a two-year holding period before they may be sold or otherwise disposed of by an NEO. The Compensation Committee also granted each NEO with an opportunity to receive an Annual Incentive Award for 2018 with the threshold, target, and maximum values set forth below. For additional information regarding the RSUs and Annual Incentive Awards granted in 2018, see "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS — Compensation Actions for 2018 - Annual Incentive Methodology" and "Long-Term Incentive Compensation" at pages 31 and 33, respectively.

Supplemental Plans 
[END TABLE]
We previously sponsored two supplemental employee retirement plans (respectively, the "First Supplemental Plan" and the "Second Supplemental Plan," and together, the "Supplemental Plans") that were designed to serve as a long-term retention tool for executives. The First Supplemental Plan was frozen effective March 31, 2008, and the Second Supplemental Plan was frozen effective March 31, 2013. Standard actuarial assumptions as of December 31, 2018 were used to calculate the present value of each individual's pension benefit, including a discount rate of 3.95%, assumed retirement age of 65 and the RP-2014 Generational Mortality tables projected using Scale MP-2018.

401(k) Plan 
[END TABLE]
We maintain a 401(k) Plan for all eligible employees. An employee becomes eligible to participate in our 401(k) Plan at the date of hire. A participant may elect to have his/her compensation reduced and contribute the amount of the reduction on his/her behalf to the 401(k) Plan in an amount not to exceed the applicable yearly dollar limitations (catch up contributions are also permitted).
Quarterly, we make a dollar-for-dollar matching contribution of up to 3% of each eligible participant's base compensation. In any 401(k) Plan year, we may make a discretionary contribution to eligible participants' accounts from our net profits. A discretionary profit sharing contribution of 3% of gross compensation, not greater than the maximum IRS allowable amount, was allocated to eligible officers and employees on a quarterly basis throughout 2018.
Participants become eligible for employer contributions on the first day of the quarter following 6 months of employment with a minimum of 83.3 hours of service for each month.
For employees hired after January 1, 2015, the following vesting schedule applies to employer contribution accounts:

Participants may invest their account balance in a number of outside mutual funds, and in our common stock.
As of December 31, 2018, the 401(k) Plan's related trust held 166,912 shares of our common stock for the benefit of 254 participants (including both active and retired employees). Each participant may elect to receive payment in cash or our common stock.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control 
[END TABLE]
The information below summarizes the compensation and benefits for our NEOs in the event of a termination of the NEO's employment. Amounts shown are estimates and the actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of the NEO's termination of employment.
Termination for Cause
Upon termination for cause, a NEO is entitled to receive the following amounts:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• salary through the date of termination; 
• salary in lieu of unused paid time off; and 
• amounts contributed and accrued under our Deferred Bonus Plan for Executives. 
[END TABLE]
If we terminate a NEO for cause as defined in the applicable incentive compensation plans (the 2007 LTIP and the 2010 LTIP), then the NEO forfeits all vested and unvested stock option awards, and all unvested RSUs.
Termination by the Corporation Other Than for Cause; Voluntary Termination by NEO
If we terminate a NEO for reasons other than cause, or the NEO voluntarily terminates employment, then, except in the cases of retirement, death or disability, the NEO is entitled to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• salary through the date of termination; 
• salary in lieu of unused paid time off; 
• the amounts contributed to and accrued under our Deferred Bonus Plan for Executives; 
• the vested portion of the 2013 Executive Plan; and 
• retention of all vested stock options (but unvested options become null and void). 
[END TABLE]
Additionally, at the Bank's discretion, upon termination by the Corporation other than for cause, in exchange for an executed release, NEOs other than Messrs. Leto and Harrington and Ms. Fox may be paid severance benefits. In the event severance benefits are paid, the Bank's practice is to pay two weeks of base salary for each year of employment, up to a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks. The severance pay policy is not based on merit and does not apply if an executive is terminated for lack of performance.
With respect to Mr. Leto, in addition to the bullet point items listed above, upon the Corporation's and Bank's termination of him without cause, or upon his voluntary termination for good reason (as defined in his employment agreement), Mr. Leto will be entitled to two (2) years of base salary and eighteen (18) months of COBRA payments in exchange for an executed release.
With respect to Mr. Harrington and Ms. Fox, in addition to the bullet point items listed above, upon the Bank's termination of them without cause, or upon their voluntary termination for good reason (as defined in the respective employment agreements), Mr. Harrington and Ms. Fox will each be entitled to one (1) year of base salary and twelve (12) months of COBRA payments in exchange for an executed release.

Retirement
If a NEO retires, he or she is entitled to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• salary through the date of retirement; 
• salary in lieu of unused paid time off; 
• the amounts contributed to and accrued under our Deferred Bonus Plan for Executives; 
• the vested portion of the 2013 Executive Plan; 
• retention of all vested stock options (but unvested options become null and void); 
• with respect to RSUs, a pro-rated portion of the underlying stock based on the lapse of time since the date of grant; provided, that the Compensation Committee retains the right to extend the vesting period at their full discretion; and 
• for Ms. Eichert, the amounts accrued and vested under the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Plans. 
[END TABLE]
Death
If a NEO dies during employment, his or her estate is entitled to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• salary through the date of death; 
• salary in lieu of unused paid time off; 
• the amounts contributed to and accrued under our Deferred Bonus Plan for Executives; 
• the vested portion of the 2013 Executive Plan; 
• retention of all vested stock options (but unvested options become null and void); 
• with respect to RSUs, a pro-rated portion of the underlying stock based on the lapse of time since the date of grant; provided, that the Compensation Committee retains the right to extend the vesting period at their full discretion; and 
• for Ms. Eichert, the amounts accrued and vested under the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Plans. 
[END TABLE]
Additionally, the beneficiary of each NEO will be entitled to a death benefit payment under our life insurance plan equal to $200,000.
Disability
If a NEO becomes disabled during employment, he or she is entitled to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• salary through the date of disability; 
• salary in lieu of unused paid time off; 
• the amounts contributed to and accrued under our Deferred Bonus Plan for Executives; 
• the vested portion of the 2013 Executive Plan; 
• retention of all vested stock options (but unvested options become null and void); 
• with respect to RSUs, a pro-rated portion of the underlying stock based on the lapse of time since the date of grant; provided, that the Compensation Committee retains the right to extend the vesting period at their full discretion; and 
• for Ms. Eichert, the amounts accrued and vested under the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Plans. 
[END TABLE]
Additionally, upon disability, each NEO will be entitled to short-term disability payments for six months equal to either 60% or 100% of base salary, depending on years of service (or in Messrs. Leto, Harrington and Tylus' and Ms. Fox's case, 100% pursuant to their employment agreements), and thereafter, each NEO will be entitled to long-term disability payments for an indeterminate period equal to approximately 70% of base salary.

Change of Control
We have entered into Change of Control Agreements with each NEO which provide for a payment of three (3) times the NEO's base salary and certain other benefits upon termination in connection with a Change of Control. The agreements contain a double trigger for such payments, that is, a Change of Control must occur and the executive officer must be terminated either (a) without cause by us or our successor, or (b) by the executive officer for good reason (as defined in the agreement) at any time during the two years following the Change of Control. "Change of Control" is defined under the agreements as (a) the acquisition by any person or group of twenty-five percent or more of our outstanding common stock, or (b) incumbent members of our Board cease to be at least a majority of the Board. Except for continued benefits, career counseling services and expense reimbursements, payments under the Change of Control Agreements are to be paid in a lump-sum payment following the Change of Control.
Additionally, each equity award would vest in full at the target level upon the Change of Control, and would be payable ten days thereafter.

(5) Welfare benefits include the cost of continuation of medical, dental, life and disability insurance benefits for 36 whole months after the termination date, on the cost-sharing basis in effect immediately prior to the change of control. 
(6) Actual payments to NEOs under the Change of Control Agreements that would constitute an excess parachute payment within the meaning of section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), can, at the election of the employee, be reduced to avoid or to lower the taxation of excess parachute payments under Section 4999 of the Code. These Change of Control Agreements do not provide gross up language that would provide for a higher payment to the employee to reduce the effect of the tax under 4999 of the Code.

CEO Pay Ratio 
[END TABLE]
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the Corporation is providing the following information for the year ended December 31, 2018:
As permitted by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the CEO Pay Ratio disclosure in the Company's 2018 Proxy Statement did not account for approximately 100 employees who became employees of the Corporation or its consolidated subsidiaries following the Royal Acquisition in December 2017. Because the Company believes this change in the employee population could significantly affect the pay ratio disclosure, we have re-identified the median employee for fiscal year 2018. The median employee for 2018 was identified from all full-time and part-time employees, including seasonal and temporary employees but excluding the CEO, who were employed by the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries on November 30, 2018. A total of 679 employees were included, all of whom are located in the United States. Employees who were on medical leave as of the determination date were also excluded from the calculation.
Compensation was measured over the 12-month period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2018. The median employee compensation was determined using 2018 gross pay from our payroll records as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for fiscal 2018. This information excluded benefit deductions such as 401(k) and medical deductions, as well as earnings related to supplemental long-term disability (taxable premiums), accrued dividends on outstanding equity awards, supplemental executive retirement plan (present value), equity award grants, and deferred bonus plan offsets.
Mr. Leto had 2018 annual total compensation of $1,729,087 as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. The median employee's annual total compensation for 2018, using the methodology that was used to calculate Mr. Leto's compensation in the Summary Compensation Table, was $69,891. As a result, the CEO pay ratio is 25:1.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
[END TABLE]
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than ten percent of any class of equity securities of the Corporation (collectively, "Insiders") to file reports of their holdings of our common stock with the SEC and with the Nasdaq Stock Market on which our common stock is traded. Based on our records and other information available to us, we believe for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and prior fiscal years, all Insiders timely filed all Section 16(a) reports, except that Mr. Calderin filed one late report on Form 4 reporting one transaction in 2018.
[BEGIN TABLE]
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS 
[END TABLE]
Some of our directors and executive officers, members of their immediate families and the companies with which they are associated were our customers and had banking transactions with us in the ordinary course of our business during 2018. All loans and commitments to lend were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other non-affiliated customers. In our opinion, the loans and commitments did not involve more than a normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.
Bruce G. Leto, a brother of our director and CEO Francis J. Leto, is a partner of and on the board of directors of Stradley Ronon Stevens & Young, LLP, a law firm headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The firm provides certain legal services to Bryn Mawr Trust and its affiliates for which the firm received approximately $183,971 in fees during 2018. Bruce Leto's indirect interest in these fees was approximately $10,374, computed without regard to the amount of profit or loss.
Our Audit Committee Charter and Regulation O Procedures require Audit Committee and/or Board review and approval of certain related party transactions to ensure compliance with Regulation O. All related party transactions, other than excepted transactions and pre-approved transactions, must be reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee. Excepted transactions are those transactions available to all employees generally and those involving less than $120,000 when aggregated with all similar transactions in any calendar year. Pre-approved transactions include the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• compensation payable to directors or officers if reportable under Item 402 of the SEC's Regulation S-K; 
• compensation payable to an immediate family member of another director or executive officer, if approved by the Compensation Committee; 
• transactions with another company (including charitable contributions, grants or endowments to a charitable organization) at which a related person's only relationship is as an employee (other than executive officer), director or less than 10% owner, if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed $200,000 or 5% of that company's total revenues; and 
• routine banking relationships that otherwise comply with banking laws and regulations. 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee is to apply the following standards when it reviews related party transactions for approval:
[BEGIN TABLE]

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
[END TABLE]
Management is responsible for the financial reporting process, including the system of internal controls, and for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing those financial statements. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and review these processes, acting in an oversight capacity relying on the information provided to it and on the representations made by management and the independent registered accounting firm.
In connection with the preparation and filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee (a) reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with our management, (b) discussed with KPMG LLP ("KPMG"), our independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1301 (as modified or supplemented), and (c) has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (as modified or supplemented) regarding KPMG's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with KPMG its independence. Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 to be filed with the SEC.

Services Provided by KPMG 
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees. These are fees for professional services performed by KPMG in 2018 and 2017 for the integrated audit, including an audit of our financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting and review of financial statements included in our Form 10-Q and Form 10-K filings. These fees also include professional services performed for the issuance of comfort letters and consents in connection with our registration statements.
Audit Related Fees. These are fees for services performed by KPMG in 2018 and 2017 that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements. This includes attestations by the independent registered public accounting firm, and consulting on financial accounting/reporting standards. 
Tax Fees. These are fees for professional services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm with respect to tax compliance, tax advice for existing operations and the Royal Acquisition, and tax planning. Our Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of the non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the independence of KPMG and determined that to be the case.

Preapproval of Audit and Non-Audit Services 
[END TABLE]
Under our Audit Committee charter, the Audit Committee is required to preapprove all auditing services and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for us by the independent registered public accounting firm, subject to the de minimus exception for non-audit services under SEC regulations which are approved by the Audit Committee prior to completion. The Audit Committee may also delegate the ability to preapprove audit and permitted non-audited services to a subcommittee consisting of one or more members, provided that any pre-approvals are reported to the full committee at its next scheduled meeting. All services performed by KPMG for us during 2018, and related fees, were preapproved by the Audit Committee.
Although shareholder ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by our bylaws or otherwise, we are submitting the selection of KPMG to our shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance practice. Even if the selection is ratified, our Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. If our shareholders do not ratify the Audit Committee's selection, the Audit Committee will take that fact into consideration, together with such other factors it deems relevant, in determining its next selection of independent registered public accounting firm.
Proxies solicited by the Board will be voted FOR the ratification of KPMG as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Corporation, unless the shareholders specify a contrary choice in their proxies.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM OF THE CORPORATION.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2020 
[END TABLE]
Shareholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy statement for its 2020 annual meeting of Shareholders must be received by the Corporation no later than November 8, 2019, which is 120 days prior to the anniversary of the date this Proxy Statement was released to shareholders. However, in the event the date of the 2020 annual meeting is changed from the date of the previous year's meeting by more than 30 days, then shareholder proposals must be received within a reasonable time before the Corporation begins to print and send its proxy materials. Our obligation, if any, to include any such proposal will be subject to SEC Rule 14a-8. Shareholder proposals for nominees for directors must be submitted to the Chair, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, Board of Directors, Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation, P.O. Box 351, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010-3396. Any other proposals should be submitted by certified mail-return receipt requested to the attention of our Corporate Secretary, at our executive office at 801 Lancaster Avenue, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010-3396.
If a shareholder wishes to present a proposal at the 2020 annual meeting but does not intend to have such proposal included in the Corporation's proxy statement, and such proposal is properly brought before the 2020 annual meeting, then in accordance with Rule 14a-4 under the Exchange Act, if the shareholder has not provided notice of the proposal by January 22, 2020 (or if the date of the meeting has changed more than 30 days from the prior year, a reasonable time before the Corporation sends its proxy materials), we will have the right to exercise discretionary voting authority on that proposal. If you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy holders will have the discretion to vote your shares with respect to any such shareholder proposal for which the Corporation does not receive timely notice.

HOUSEHOLDING 
[END TABLE]
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy delivery requirements for Proxy Statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single Proxy Statement addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. We and some brokers household proxy materials, delivering a single Proxy Statement to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate Proxy Statement, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the Proxy Statement and wish to receive only one, please notify your broker or nominee if your shares are held in a brokerage account or other account or our agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare") if you hold registered shares. You can notify Computershare by sending a written request to: Computershare, P.O. Box 505000, Louisville, KY, 40233-5000, or by calling Computershare at (877) 238-6956.
