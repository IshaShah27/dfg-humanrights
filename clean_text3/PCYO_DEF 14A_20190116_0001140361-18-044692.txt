PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE
ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
To be held on January 16, 2019
This proxy statement is being made available to shareholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the board of directors of PURE CYCLE         CORPORATION (the "Company," "we" or "our") to be voted at the annual meeting of shareholders of the Company (the "Meeting") to be held at 1550 Seventeenth Street, Suite 500, Denver, Colorado 80202, at the offices of Davis Graham & Stubbs LLP on         January 16, 2019, at 2:00 p.m. Mountain Time, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof. This proxy statement will be made available to shareholders on or about December 7, 2018. The cost of soliciting proxies is being paid by the Company. The         Company's officers, directors, and other regular employees may, without additional compensation, solicit proxies personally or by other appropriate means.
Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the Company has elected to provide access to its proxy materials via the         Internet. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to our shareholders, who will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or to request a printed         set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy can be found in the Notice. In addition, shareholders may request proxy materials in printed form by writing to the         Company's Secretary at the Company's address set forth above.
If you would like to receive the Notice via email rather than regular mail in future years, please follow the instructions in the Notice. Choosing to         receive future notices by email will help the Company reduce the costs and environmental impact of the Company's shareholder meetings.
ABOUT THE MEETING
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be Held on January 16, 2019:
The proxy materials, including this proxy statement and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended August 31,         2018, are available at http://www.proxyvote.com.
What is the purpose of the Meeting?
At the Meeting, shareholders are asked to act upon the matters outlined above in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and as described in this         proxy statement. The matters to be considered are (i) the election of directors, (ii) the ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019, (iii) the approval,         on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company's named executive officer, and (iv) such other matters as may properly come before the Meeting. Management will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Who is entitled to vote and how many votes do I have?
If you were a shareholder of record as of 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on November 19, 2018, you will be entitled to vote at the Meeting or any adjournments or         postponements thereof. On the record date, there were 23,789,098 shares of the Company's 1/3 of $.01 par value common stock ("common stock") issued and outstanding. Each outstanding share of the Company's common stock will be entitled to one vote         on each matter acted upon. There is no cumulative voting.
How do I vote?
If your shares are held in an account at a bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee in "street name," you need to submit voting instructions to your bank,         brokerage firm, or other nominee in order to cast your vote. If you wish to vote in person at the Meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from the nominee that holds your shares. If you are the shareholder of record, you may vote your shares by         following the instructions in the Notice mailed on or about December 7, 2018, or, if you have received a printed set of the proxy materials, you may vote your shares by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and then mailing it to         the Company's transfer agent in the pre-addressed envelope provided. You may also vote your shares by calling the transfer agent at the number listed on the proxy card or by attending the Meeting in person.
Can I change or revoke my vote?
A proxy may be revoked by a shareholder any time before it is voted at the Meeting by submission of another proxy bearing a later date, by attending the         Meeting and voting in person, or if you are a shareholder of record, by written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company.
Is my vote confidential?
Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual shareholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your         vote will not be disclosed within the Company or to third parties, except (1) as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements, (2) to allow for the tabulation of votes and certification of the vote, and (3) to facilitate a successful proxy         solicitation. Occasionally, shareholders provide written comments on their proxy cards, which are forwarded to management of the Company.
Will my shares held in street name be voted if I do not provide my proxy?
If you hold your shares through a bank, broker, or other nominee, your shares must be voted by the nominee. If you do not provide voting instructions,         under the rules of the securities exchanges, the nominee's discretionary authority to vote your shares is limited to "routine" matters. Proposals 1 and 3 are not considered routine matters for this purpose, so if you do not provide your proxy, your         shares will not be voted at the Meeting with respect to these proposals. In this case, your shares will be treated as "broker non-votes" and will not be counted for purposes of determining the vote on these proposals.
A "broker non-vote" occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner has discretionary authority to vote on at least one matter at the meeting         but does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that proposal and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner.
What is a quorum?
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock constitutes a quorum at the Meeting for the         election of directors and for the other proposals. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for the purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Meeting.
How many votes are required to approve the proposals?
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Election of Directors – The election of directors requires the affirmative vote of                      a plurality of the votes cast by shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote for the election of directors. This means that the nominees receiving the most votes from those eligible to vote will be elected. You may                      vote "FOR" all of the nominees or your vote may be "WITHHELD" with respect to one or more of the nominees; however, a "withheld" vote or a broker non-vote (defined above) will have no effect on the outcome of the election.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Ratification of auditors, advisory vote on executive compensation, and other matters                      – The number of votes cast in favor of the proposal at the Meeting must exceed the number of votes cast against the proposal for the approval of Proposals 2, 3 and other matters. For Proposals 2, 3 and any other business matters to be                      voted on, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST," or you may "ABSTAIN." Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes for or against a proposal and, therefore, have no effect on the vote. Because your vote on executive                      compensation is advisory, it will not be binding on the board of directors or the Company. However, the board of directors will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive                      compensation.  
[END TABLE]
 If no specification is made, then the shares will be voted "FOR" the election as directors of the persons nominated by the board of directors, "FOR"         Proposal 2, "FOR" Proposal 3, and otherwise, in accordance with the recommendations of the board of directors.
Does the Company expect there to be any additional matters presented at the Meeting?
Other than the items of business described in this proxy statement, the Company is not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the Meeting. If you         grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy holders, Mark W. Harding and Harrison H. Augur, have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matter properly presented for a vote at the Meeting. If for any unforeseen reason any of the         director nominees are not available for election at the date of the Meeting, the named proxy holders will vote your shares for such other candidates as may be nominated by the board.
When will the results of the voting being announced?
The Company will announce preliminary results at the Meeting and will publish final results in a current report on Form 8-K to be filed within four         business days of the date of the Meeting. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND
MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS
Voting Securities and Principal Holders Thereof
The following table sets forth information as of November 19, 2018, as to the beneficial ownership of shares of the Company's common stock by (i) each         person (or group of affiliated persons) known to the Company to own beneficially 5% or more of the common stock, (ii) each director of the Company and each nominee for director, (iii) each executive officer and (iv) all directors and executive         officers as a group. All information is based on information filed by such persons with the SEC and other information provided by such persons to the Company. Except as otherwise indicated, the Company believes that each of the beneficial owners         listed has sole investment and voting power with respect to such shares. On November 19, 2018, there were 23,789,098 common shares outstanding. Shares not outstanding but deemed beneficially owned by virtue of the right of a person to acquire         shares within 60 days of November 19, 2018, are included as outstanding and beneficially owned for that person, but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS
Board Leadership Structure
The Company's board of directors has chosen to separate the positions of Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chairman of the Board. Keeping these positions         separate allows the Company's CEO to focus on developing and implementing the Company's business plans and supervising the Company's day-to-day operations and allows the Company's Chairman to lead the board of directors in its oversight and         advisory roles. Because of the many responsibilities of the board of directors and the significant time and effort required by each of the Chairman and the CEO to perform their respective duties, the Company believes that having separate persons in         these roles enhances the ability of each to discharge those duties effectively and, as a corollary, enhances the Company's prospects for success. The board of directors also believes that having separate positions provides a clear delineation of         responsibilities for each position and fosters greater accountability of management. Board Risk and Oversight
Our board of directors, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. With the oversight of the Company's         full board of directors, the Company's CEO is responsible for the day-to-day management of the material risks the Company faces. In its oversight role, the board of directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management         processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. At least annually, the board of directors holds a strategic planning session with management to discuss strategies, key challenges, risks and opportunities         for the Company. This involvement of the board of directors in setting the Company's business strategy is a key part of its oversight of risk management, its assessment of management's appetite for risk, and its determination of what constitutes an         appropriate level of risk for the Company. Additionally, the board of directors regularly receives updates from management regarding certain risks that the Company faces, including various operating risks. Management attends meetings of the board         of directors and its committees on a regular basis, and as is otherwise needed, and is available to address any questions or concerns raised by the board on risk management and any other matters.
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing risk management of financial matters, financial reporting, the adequacy of the Company's risk-related         internal controls, internal investigations, and enterprise risks, generally. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Nominating Committee") oversees the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and governance-related risks, such as         board independence, as well as management and director succession planning. The Compensation Committee oversees risks related to compensation policies and practices and is responsible for establishing and maintaining compensation policies and         programs designed to create incentives consistent with the Company's business strategy that do not encourage excessive risk-taking.
Board Membership and Director Independence
Director Independence – At least a majority of         the members of the board and all members of the board's Audit, Compensation, and Nominating Committees must be independent in accordance with the listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market. The board has determined that four of the six current         members, Messrs. Augur, Epker, Guido, and Howell, are independent pursuant to the standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market.
Terms of Directors and Officers – All         directors are elected for one-year terms which expire at the annual meeting of shareholders or when their successors are duly elected and qualified. The Company's officers are elected annually by the board of directors and hold office until their         successors are duly elected and qualified.
Family Relationships of Directors and Officers         – None of the current directors or officers, or nominees for director, is related to any other officer or director of the Company or to any nominee for director.
Board Meetings Held – The board of directors         and each of the standing committees described below meet throughout the fiscal year on a set schedule. They also hold special meetings and act by written consent from time to time as appropriate. The Company's independent directors meet regularly         in executive sessions without management present. The executive sessions of independent directors are held in conjunction with each regularly scheduled board meeting.
During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, the board of directors held three (3) meetings. All board members attended 75% or more of the aggregate of         the total number of meetings of the board of directors and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the board on which the director served during the periods that the director served on the board and committees, as applicable. All of         the Company's board members are expected to attend the annual meeting of shareholders. All of the Company's board members attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. Committees
The Board has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating Committee. Each of the committees regularly reports on         its activities and actions to the full board of directors.
Membership in the standing committees for 2018 is set forth below:

[END TABLE]
Compensation Committee – The Compensation         Committee consists of Mr. Epker (Chairman) and Messrs. Augur and Guido. The board of directors determined that all members of the Compensation Committee were "independent" within the meaning of the listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market. The         functions to be performed by the Compensation Committee include establishing the compensation of officers, evaluating the performance of officers and key employees, and administering employee incentive compensation plans. The Compensation Committee         typically meets with the CEO to obtain information about employee performance and compensation recommendations. It also has the authority to engage outside advisors to assist the committee with its functions. The Compensation Committee has the         power to delegate authority to the CEO or a subcommittee to make certain determinations with respect to compensation for employees who are not executive officers. The Company's Compensation Committee Charter is available on the Company's website at         www.purecyclewater.com. The Compensation Committee held three (3) meetings during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee         – The Nominating Committee consists of Messrs. Guido (Chairman), Augur and Epker. The board of directors determined that all members of the Nominating Committee were "independent" within the meaning of the listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock         Market. The principal responsibilities of the Nominating Committee are to identify and nominate qualified individuals to serve as members of the board and to make recommendations to the board with respect to director compensation. In addition, the         Nominating Committee is responsible for establishing the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and evaluating the board and its processes. In selecting nominees for the board, the Nominating Committee is seeking a board with a variety of         experience and expertise, and in selecting nominees it will consider business experience in the industry in which the Company operates, financial expertise, independence from the Company, experience with publicly traded companies, experience with         relevant regulatory matters in which the Company is involved, and a reputation for integrity and professionalism. The Company does not have a formal policy with respect to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, but it         considers diversity as part of its overall assessment of the board's functions and needs. Nominees must be at least 21 years of age and less than 75 on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders unless the Nominating Committee waives such         requirements. Identification of prospective board members is done by a combination of methods, including word-of-mouth in industry circles, inquiries of outside professionals and recommendations made to the Company. The Nominating Committee Charter         is available on the Company's website at www.purecyclewater.com. The Nominating Committee held three (3) meetings during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018. The Nominating Committee will consider nominations for director made by shareholders of record entitled to vote. In order to make a nomination for election         at the January 2020 annual meeting, a shareholder must provide notice, along with supporting information (discussed below) regarding such nominee, to the Company's Secretary by August 9, 2019, but not before June 10, 2019, in accordance with the         Company's bylaws. The Nominating Committee evaluates nominees recommended by shareholders utilizing the same criteria it uses for other nominees. Each shareholder recommendation should be accompanied by the following:

(1)  In addition to cash compensation, pursuant to the Pure Cycle Corporation 2014 Equity Incentive Plan effective as of April 12, 2014 (the "2014 Plan"), each non-employee                      director may receive an option to purchase shares of common stock at the discretion of the board, and the terms of such awards granted to non-employee directors, including the discretion to adopt one or more formulas for the                      determination of non-employee director awards, are at the discretion of the board. On January 14, 2015, the board adopted a formula under the 2014 Plan that provides for an option grant to each non-employee director to purchase 6,500                      shares of common stock at each annual meeting of shareholders at which the non-employee director is re-elected to the board. The options vest on the date of the next annual meeting of shareholders or the first anniversary of the date of                      grant, whichever is earlier. On January 27, 2016, the board adopted a formula under the 2014 Plan providing for an option grant to each non-employee director to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock upon initial election or appointment                      to the board, which vests one-half on each of the first two anniversary dates of the grant. The option exercise price for all non-employee director grants is set at the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. The                      amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of options granted during the Company's fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, as computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.

 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Person Covered
This discussion addresses compensation for fiscal 2018 for Mark W. Harding, the Company's President, CEO and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and its only         executive officer.
Compensation Philosophy
The Company's executive compensation program is administered by the Compensation Committee of the board of directors. The Compensation Committee reviews         the performance and compensation level for the CEO and makes recommendations to the board of directors for final approval. The Compensation Committee also determines equity grants under the 2014 Plan, if any. The CEO may provide information to the         Compensation Committee regarding his compensation; however, the Compensation Committee makes the final determination on the executive compensation recommendation to the board. Final compensation determinations are generally made in September         immediately following the end of the Company's fiscal year. The following outlines the philosophy and objectives of the Company's compensation plan.
The objectives of the Company's compensation plan are to correlate executive compensation with the Company's objectives and overall performance and to         enable the Company to attract, retain and reward executive officers who contribute to its long-term growth and success. The compensation plan is designed to create a mutuality of interest between executive and shareholders through equity ownership         programs and to focus the executive's attention on overall corporate objectives, in addition to the executive's personal objectives.
The goal of the Compensation Committee is to provide a compensation package that is competitive with compensation practices of companies with which the         Company competes, provides variable compensation that is linked to achievement of the Company's operational performance goals, and aligns the interests of the executive officer and employees with those of the shareholders of the Company.         Additionally, the Compensation Committee's goal is to design a compensation package that falls within the mid-range of the packages provided to executives of similarly sized corporations in like industries.
Generally, the executive officer receives a base salary and an opportunity to earn a cash bonus based on attainment of predetermined objectives at the         discretion of the Compensation Committee. Long-term equity incentives are also considered. The mixture of cash and non-cash compensation items is designed to provide the executive with a competitive total compensation package while not using an         excessive amount of the Company's cash or overly diluting the equity positions of its shareholders. The Company's executive officer does not receive any perquisites or personal benefits. The executive officer is eligible for the same benefits         available to all Company employees. Currently, this includes participation in a tax-qualified 401(k) plan and health and dental plans.
Compensation Consultants
The Compensation Committee charter authorizes the Compensation Committee to engage compensation consultants and other advisors to assist it with its         duties. No compensation consultants were engaged by either management or the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2018. Shareholder Feedback and Say-On-Pay Results
The Compensation Committee considers the outcome of shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation when making future decisions relating to the         compensation of the CEO and the Company's executive compensation program. At the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, approximately 99.8% of the votes cast were for approval of the "say-on-pay" proposal. The Compensation Committee believes the         results conveyed support for continuing with the philosophy, strategy and objectives of the Company's executive compensation program.
Compensation of the Company's CEO
The current compensation program for the Company's CEO consists of the following:
Base Salary – Base salary is intended to provide the CEO with         basic non-variable compensation that is competitive considering the CEO's responsibilities, experience and performance and the Company's financial resources.
In making the base salary decision, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion and judgment primarily based upon individual performance and         competitive considerations. In September 2017, the Compensation Committee recommended and the board of directors approved a salary increase for Mr. Harding from $375,000 for fiscal 2017 to $400,000 for fiscal 2018. In recognition of Mr. Harding's         continuing contributions in 2018 in positioning the Company to realize its long-term objectives, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the board approved, raising Mr. Harding's base salary to $425,000 for fiscal 2019. At the same time, Mr.         Harding was awarded the incentive bonus discussed below in recognition of the significant accomplishments of Mr. Harding and the Company in achieving the objectives set forth in the Company's 2018 performance plan.
Incentive Bonus – The Compensation Committee's goal in granting         incentive bonuses is to tie a portion of the CEO's compensation to the operating performance of the Company and to the CEO's individual contribution to the Company. In formulating recommendations for bonus compensation for Mr. Harding, the         Compensation Committee considered a number of factors, including, among other things, (i) the efforts of Mr. Harding in pursuing projects to achieve long-term goals of the Company; (ii) the progress made by Mr. Harding and the Company in achieving         the objectives established by the Compensation Committee for fiscal 2018 (as discussed below); and (iii) Mr. Harding's experience, talents and skills and the importance thereof to the Company.
In September 2017, the Compensation Committee recommended and the board approved a performance plan for fiscal 2018, which was comprised of financial and         nonfinancial objectives, both short-term and long-term in nature, including objectives related to development of the Company's Sky Ranch property, improving tracking of project costs, managing the budget, and recruiting additional personnel. The         plan also included strategic objectives, the disclosure of which the Company believes would cause competitive harm.
In September 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company's operating results for fiscal 2018 and evaluated the Company's success in achieving the         performance plan objectives. The Compensation Committee determined that a bonus was warranted in recognition of Mr. Harding's success launching the Sky Ranch development and managing expenses of the Company consistent with the budget. The Compensation Committee recommended awarding, and the board authorized awarding, Mr. Harding a discretionary bonus of $300,000 in fiscal 2018, as well as a         stock option to purchase 50,000 shares of common stock, as described below.
Long-Term Equity Incentives – The goal of long-term equity         incentive compensation is to align the interests of the CEO with those of the Company's shareholders and to provide the CEO with a long-term incentive to manage the Company from the perspective of an owner with an equity stake in the business. It         is the belief of the Compensation Committee that stock options and other equity based awards directly motivate an executive to maximize long-term shareholder value. The philosophy of the Compensation Committee in administering the Company's 2014         Plan is to tie the number of stock options and shares of stock awarded to each employee to the performance of the Company and to the individual contribution of each employee to the Company. The Compensation Committee recommended awarding, and the         board authorized awarding, Mr. Harding a non-statutory stock option to purchase 50,000 shares of the Company's common stock in recognition of his performance during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, and to motivate future performance,         determining that it would be preferable to recognize his achievements with a mix of cash and long-term incentives. Stock Ownership Requirements for Executive Officers
While the Company has not established stock ownership guidelines for its executive officer, at August 31, 2018, the Company's CEO owned stock with a market         value of approximately of twenty times his base salary, which the Compensation Committee believes appropriately aligns the interests of the CEO with those of the Company's shareholders.
Hedging Policy
Company policy prohibits directors, officers and employees from engaging in short sales of Company securities, buying or selling put or call options of         Company securities, buying financial instruments designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company securities, or engaging in frequent trading (for example, daily or weekly) to take advantage of fluctuations in share         price.
Employment and Severance Agreements
The Company does not have any written employment, change of control, severance or other similar agreement with the executive officer.
Executive Compensation Tables
The Company's CEO, Mr. Harding, is the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer of the Company and its only executive officer.         Therefore, all tables contained in this section relate solely to Mr. Harding.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE1
The Audit Committee of the board of directors is comprised of independent directors and operates under a written charter adopted by the board of directors.         The Audit Committee Charter is reassessed and updated as needed in accordance with applicable rules of the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market.
The Audit Committee serves in an oversight capacity. Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. The         independent auditors are responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and issuing a report thereon. The Audit         Committee's primary responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes and to select and retain the Company's independent auditors. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed with management the Company's         audited financial statements and discussed not only the acceptability but also the quality of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of the significant judgments and estimates, critical accounting policies and the clarity of disclosures in         the audited financial statements prior to issuance.
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2018 with the Company's independent         auditors, Plante & Moran PLLC ("Plante Moran"), and discussed not only the acceptability but also the quality of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of the significant judgments and estimates, critical accounting policies and the         clarity of disclosures in the audited financial statements prior to issuance. The Audit Committee discussed with Plante Moran all communications required by generally accepted auditing standards, including those described in Statement on Auditing         Standards (SAS) No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1, AU Section 380), as adopted by the PCAOB in Rule 3200T. The Audit Committee has         received the written disclosures and the letter from Plante Moran required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding independent auditor communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed Plante Moran's         independence with Plante Moran.
Based on the foregoing, the Audit Committee recommended to the board of directors that the Company's audited financial statements be included in the         Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018.

1 This report is not "soliciting material," is not deemed "filed" with the         SEC and is not to be incorporated by reference in any filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing, except to the extent the Company         specifically references this report. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Agreements with Related Parties
On October 12, 2016, the Audit Committee approved accepting a bid submitted by Nelson Pipeline Constructors LLC to construct the Sky Ranch pipeline for         approximately $4.1 million (the "Nelson Bid"). Nelson Pipeline Constructors LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nelson Infrastructure Services LLC, a company in which Patrick J. Beirne owns a 50% interest. In addition, Mr. Beirne, a director of         Pure Cycle, is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of each of Nelson Pipeline Constructors LLC and Nelson Infrastructure Services LLC. Since Mr. Beirne is the 50% owner of the parent company of Nelson Pipeline Constructors LLC, Mr. Beirne's         interest in the transaction is approximately $2.05 million without taking into account any profit or loss from the Nelson Bid. Pursuant to the Company's policies for review and approval of related party transactions (discussed below), the Nelson         Bid was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee and by the board of directors, with Mr. Beirne abstaining. The Nelson Bid was the lowest bid received by the Company in connection with the Sky Ranch pipeline project and was lower than the         Company's estimated cost to construct the pipeline on its own.
Review and Approval of Related Party Transactions
It is the Company's policy as set forth in its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that actual or apparent conflicts of interest are to be avoided if         possible and must be disclosed to the board of directors. Pursuant to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the Audit Committee Charter, any transaction involving a related party must be reviewed and approved or disapproved by the Audit         Committee. Additionally, the Audit Committee Charter requires the Audit Committee to review any transaction involving the Company and a related party at least once a year or upon any significant change in the transaction or relationship. The Code         also provides non-exclusive examples of conduct which would involve a potential conflict of interest and requires any material transaction involving a potential conflict of interest to be approved in advance by the board. If a waiver from the Code         is granted to an executive officer or director, the nature of the waiver will be disclosed on the Company's website, in a press release, or on a current report on Form 8-K.
The Company annually requires each of its directors and executive officers to complete a directors' and officers' questionnaire that solicits information         about related party transactions. The Company's board of directors and outside legal counsel review all transactions and relationships disclosed in the directors' and officers' questionnaire, and the board makes a formal determination regarding         each director's independence. If a director is determined to be no longer independent, such director, if he or she serves on any of the Audit Committee, the Nominating Committee, or the Compensation Committee, will be removed from such committee         prior to (or otherwise will not participate in) any future meeting of the committee. If the transaction presents a conflict of interest, the board of directors will determine the appropriate response.

RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
(Proposal No. 2)
Action is to be taken by the shareholders at the Meeting with respect to the ratification and approval of the selection by the Audit Committee of the         Company's board of directors of Plante & Moran PLLC ("Plante Moran") to be the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019. In the event of a negative vote on such ratification, the         Audit Committee of the board of directors will reconsider its selection. A representative of Plante Moran is expected to be present at the Meeting. The Plante Moran representative will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires         to do so and is expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.
The Audit Committee reviews and approves in advance the audit scope, the types of non-audit services, if any, and the estimated fees for each category for         the coming year. For each category of proposed service, Plante Moran is required to confirm that the provision of such services does not impair the auditors' independence. Before selecting Plante Moran, the Audit Committee carefully considered that         firm's qualifications as an independent registered public accounting firm for the Company. This included a review of its reputation for integrity and competence in the fields of accounting and auditing. The Audit Committee has expressed its         satisfaction with Plante Moran in all of these respects. The Audit Committee's review included inquiry concerning any litigation involving Plante Moran and any proceedings by the SEC against the firm.
Plante Moran has no direct or indirect financial interest in the Company and does not have any connection with the Company in the capacity of promoter,         underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer or employee. Neither the Company, nor any officer, director nor associate of the Company has any interest in Plante Moran.
Change in Auditors for Fiscal 2018 – As         discussed in our Current Report on Form 8‑K filed with the SEC on October 4, 2018, EKS&H LLLP ("EKS&H") resigned as our independent registered public accounting firm on October 1, 2018 because EKS&H combined with Plante Moran. On         October 1, 2018, the Audit Committee of our board of directors engaged Plante Moran to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company effective as of that date. EKS&H had been the Company's independent registered         public accounting firm since December 4, 2017.
During the period from December 4, 2017 to August 31, 2018, and the subsequent interim period through October 1, 2018, we did not have any disagreements         with EKS&H on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to EKS&H's satisfaction, would have caused EKS&H to make reference         thereto in its reports on our financial statements for the relevant periods. During the period from December 4, 2017 to August 31, 2018, and the subsequent interim period through October 1, 2018, there were no reportable events, as defined in Item         304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2017 and 2018, and the subsequent interim period through October 1, 2018, the Company did not consult with           Plante Moran regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements by Plante Moran, in either           case where written or oral advice provided by Plante Moran would be an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any other matter that was the subject of           a disagreement between the Company and its former auditor or was a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) or Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, respectively). Change in Auditors for Fiscal 2018 – On           December 4, 2017, the Audit Committee engaged EKS&H to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company beginning with the fiscal year ending August 31, 2018. EKS&H replaced Crowe Horwath LLP (now known as Crowe           LLP) ("Crowe") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Crowe, which served as the independent auditors for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017, was dismissed on December 4, 2017.
The report of Crowe on the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of         opinion, and such report was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017, and the subsequent interim period through December 4, 2017 (the date of the change in auditors), the Company         did not have any disagreements with Crowe on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Crowe's satisfaction, would have caused it to make         reference thereto in its reports on the Company's financial statements for the relevant periods. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 and through December 4, 2017, there were no reportable events, as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of         Regulation S-K.
During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, and through December 4, 2017, the Company did not consult with EKS&H regarding (a) the         application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, (b) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements by EKS&H, in either case where written or oral advice provided by EKS&H would be an         important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issues or (c) any other matter that was the subject of a disagreement between the Company and its former auditors or was a         reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) or Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, respectively).
Change in Auditors for Fiscal 2017 – As         discussed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 17, 2017, the Audit Committee engaged Crowe to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company as of January 16, 2017. Previously, GHP Horwath, P.C.         ("GHP") had served as independent registered public accounting firm of the Company since December 15, 2006. On January 13, 2017, GHP notified the Company that it was resigning as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm because         the partners and employees of GHP had joined Crowe.
The reports of GHP on the Company's financial statements for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2016 did not contain an adverse opinion or         disclaimer of opinion, and such reports were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2016, and the subsequent interim period through January 13, 2017, the Company did not have any         disagreements with GHP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to GHP's satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference thereto in         its reports on the Company's financial statements for the relevant periods. During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2016, and through January 13, 2017, there were no reportable events, as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2016, and through January 16, 2017, the Company did not consult with Crowe regarding (a) the application         of accounting principles to a specified transaction, (b) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements by Crowe, in either case where written or oral advice provided by Crowe would be an important factor         considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issues or (c) any other matter that was the subject of a disagreement between the Company and its former auditor or was a reportable event (as         described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) or Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, respectively). Crowe has no direct or indirect financial interest in the Company and does not have any connection with the Company in the capacity of promoter,         underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer or employee. Neither the Company, nor any officer, director nor associate of the Company has any interest in Crowe.

ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
(Proposal No. 3)
The following proposal provides our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve or not approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our         named executive officer as disclosed in the proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.
We urge shareholders to read the "Executive Compensation" section         beginning on page 10 of this proxy statement, as well as the Summary Compensation Table and other related compensation tables and narrative, beginning on page 12 of the proxy statement, which provide detailed information on the compensation of our         named executive officer. The Company's compensation programs are designed to support its business goals and promote short- and long-term profitable growth of the Company.
We are asking shareholders to approve the following advisory resolution at the Meeting:
RESOLVED, that the shareholders of the Company approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officer,         as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the disclosure under the heading "Executive Compensation" and in the compensation tables and accompanying narrative discussion in the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement. This advisory resolution, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" resolution, is not binding on the Company or the board of directors. The say-on-pay         proposal is not intended to address any specific item of compensation but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officer and the executive compensation policies, practices, and plans described in this proxy statement. Although this         proposal is non-binding, the board of directors will carefully review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding the Company's executive compensation program. Based on the advisory vote of the shareholders at the annual         meeting of shareholders held in January 2014, the board of directors determined that it would conduct an advisory vote on executive compensation on an annual basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board of directors may decide to conduct         advisory votes on a more or less frequent basis and may vary its practice based on factors such as discussions with shareholders and the adoption of material changes to compensation programs.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE         OFFICER.
____________________________
ACTION TO BE TAKEN UNDER THE PROXY
The proxy will be voted "FOR" the individuals nominated by the board and "FOR" approval of Proposals 2 and 3, unless the proxy is marked in such a manner         as to withhold authority to so vote. The proxy will also be voted in connection with the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. Management knows of no other matters,         other than the matters set forth above, to be considered at the Meeting. If, however, any other matters properly come before the Meeting or any adjournment thereof, the persons named in the accompanying proxy will vote such proxy in accordance with         their best judgment on any such matter. The persons named in the accompanying proxy will also, if in their judgment it is deemed to be advisable, vote to adjourn the Meeting from time to time.
