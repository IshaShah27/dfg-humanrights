PROXY STATEMENT 
INFORMATION CONCERNING VOTING AND SOLICITATION 
Availability of Proxy Materials on the Internet 
Our Board of Directors (the "Board") made this Proxy Statement and the Company's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 available to you on the Internet or, upon your request, has delivered printed versions of these materials to you by mail, in connection with the Board's solicitation of proxies for use at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, to be held on Tuesday, May 7, 2019 commencing at 9:00 a.m. local time at The Langham Hotel, 330 North Wabash Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, and at any adjournment thereof (the "2019 Annual Meeting" or the "Annual Meeting"). 
General 
The date of this Proxy Statement is March 27, 2019, the approximate date on which this Proxy Statement and proxy card are first being mailed and made available on the Internet to stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 was publicly filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 21, 2019. 
Who Can Vote 
You are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting if you were a stockholder of record of our common stock as of the close of business on March 11, 2019 (the "Record Date"). Each stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of our common stock held on the Record Date. Our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights. 
Shares Outstanding and Quorum 
At the close of business on the Record Date, 87,221,116 shares of our common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote and no shares of our preferred stock were outstanding. A majority of our common stock outstanding on the Record Date, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. 
How to Vote 
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote by proxy on the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions provided in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials sent to you. If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, or have a printed proxy card, you may also vote by filling out the proxy card and returning it in the envelope provided. You may also vote in person at the Annual Meeting. 
If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," please refer to the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee for voting your shares. If you wish to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from the organization that holds your shares and have proof of ownership of shares of our common stock as of the Record Date. 
How Your Shares Will Be Voted 
If you properly complete your proxy card and send it to the Company prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting, or submit your proxy electronically by Internet or by telephone before voting closes, your proxy (one of 
- 1 - 
 the individuals named in the proxy card) will vote your shares as you have directed. If you sign the proxy card but do not make specific choices, your proxy will vote your shares as recommended by the Board: (i) to elect the director nominees listed in "Election of Directors," (ii) to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, and (iii) for the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young AB as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year. 
Voting on Matters Not in Proxy Statement 
The deadlines have passed for stockholders to (i) nominate directors for election to the Board and (ii) for other stockholder proposals to be brought before the Annual Meeting. Thus, only the Company may (i) substitute director nominees or (ii) bring other business before the Annual Meeting. The Company does not plan to substitute any director nominee, and the Company does not intend to raise any matter other than those described in this Proxy Statement at the Annual Meeting. 
However, administrative and similar matters can arise at any annual meeting. To address such unforeseen matters, your proxy may exercise his or her discretion and authority to vote on such matters incidental to the conduct of the Annual Meeting only. Note that this authority is limited by applicable law, the proxy rules of the SEC, and the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"). 
Revoking Proxies or Changing Your Vote 
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote before the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting. Prior to the applicable cutoff time, you may change your vote on a later date via the Internet or by telephone (in which case only your latest Internet or telephone proxy submitted prior to the Annual Meeting will be counted), by signing and returning a new proxy card with a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. However, your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy unless you properly vote at the Annual Meeting or specifically request that your prior proxy be revoked by delivering a written notice of revocation to Autoliv at its mailing address prior to the Annual Meeting. 
Voting Rights of Holders of SDRs 
Holders of Autoliv's Swedish Depository Receipts ("SDRs") are entitled to vote the shares of common stock of the Company underlying their SDRs at the 2019 Annual Meeting as if they directly held the common stock of the Company. Therefore, each holder of SDRs is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock underlying each SDR held on the Record Date. To have their votes counted at the 2019 Annual Meeting, SDR holders must give instructions as to the exercise of their voting rights by proxy or attend and represent their shares of common stock of the Company underlying the SDRs at the Annual Meeting in person. 
Non-Voting Shares, Abstentions and Broker "Non-Votes" 
Shares held by persons attending the Annual Meeting but not voting, shares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions to a proposal, and broker "non-votes" will be counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum. A broker "non-vote" occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have discretionary authority to vote the shares. Brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on Proposals 1 and 2 set forth below. Brokers generally have discretionary authority to vote on Proposal 3 set forth below. 
Vote Required to Approve Each Proposal at the Annual Meeting 
The following summary describes the vote required to approve each of the proposals at the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Proposal 1:  Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting  and entitled to vote thereat. However, pursuant to the Autoliv, Inc. Corporate Governance Guidelines, if a director nominee in an uncontested election fails to receive the approval of a majority of the votes cast on his or her election by the  stockholders, the nominee shall promptly offer his or her resignation to the Board for consideration. A committee consisting  
[END TABLE]
- 2 - 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Proposal 2:  The non-binding resolution to approve the compensation of the Company's named  executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement requires the affirmative majority vote of the shares present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereat. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against  the proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect in determining the outcome of the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Proposal 3:  The ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young AB as the Company's independent registered public  accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereat. Abstentions will have the same effect as  a vote against the ratification. Although brokers have discretionary authority to vote on the ratification, if a broker submits a non-vote, it will not be counted for purposes of the ratification but will be  counted for the purposes of establishing a quorum.  
[END TABLE]
Any other proposal brought before the Annual Meeting (if any) will be decided by a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. Consequently, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the matter and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the matter. 
Principal Executive Offices 
The Company's mailing address is Box 70381, SE-107 24 Stockholm, Sweden, and its principal executive offices are located at Klarabergsviadukten 70, Section B, 7th floor, Stockholm, Sweden SE-111 64. The Company's telephone number is +46 8 587 20 600. 
Solicitation of Proxies 
The Company, on behalf of the Board, is soliciting the proxies and will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies. In addition to solicitation over the Internet and by mail, the Company will reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of our stock and obtaining their proxies. Certain directors, officers and other employees of the Company, not specifically employed for this purpose, may solicit proxies, without additional remuneration, by personal interview, mail, telephone, facsimile or electronic mail. The Company has retained Georgeson LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $14,500 plus expenses and Computershare AB for a fee of SEK 105,000, or approximately $11,300, plus expenses.

PROPOSAL 1 - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

The Board has currently fixed the size of the Board at nine. In accordance with the By-Laws, the Board has adopted a resolution to increase the number of directors on the Board to ten, effective immediately prior to the opening of the polls for the election of directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Mikael Bratt, Jan Carlson, Hasse Johansson, Leif Johansson, David E. Kepler, Franz-Josef Kortüm, Xiaozhi Liu, James M. Ringler, and Ted Senko, whose present terms will expire at the time of the Annual Meeting, are nominees for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Ms. Min Liu has also been nominated by the Board to be elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting pursuant to the terms of a Cooperation Agreement between the Company and Cevian Capital II GP Limited ("Cevian"), and its affiliates (the "Cooperation Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, Ms. Liu will offer her resignation from the Board if Cevian no longer owns at least 8% of the then-outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. The Cooperation Agreement is described in further detail in the section entitled "Agreements with Stockholders—Cooperation Agreement with Cevian Capital II GP Limited" below. 
If elected, the above nominees would serve until the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier retirement, resignation, disqualification, removal or death. If any director nominee should become unavailable for election prior to the Annual Meeting, an event that currently is not anticipated by the Board, either the proxies will be voted in favor of the election of a substitute nominee or nominees proposed by the Board or the number of directors may be reduced accordingly. Each nominee has agreed to serve if elected, and the Board has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable to serve.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Stockholder Engagement Efforts 
The Company engages with the Company's stockholders throughout the year to ensure that management and the Board understand and consider the issues that matter most to them, to solicit their views and feedback on various matters, and to provide perspective on the Company's policies and practices. During 2018, members of the Company's management met with certain of the Company's stockholders to listen to their concerns and discuss a variety of topics, including performance, strategy, capital allocation, corporate governance, compensation, and other matters. 
Environmental Sustainability 
The Company is committed to sound and ethical business practices that align with the goals and needs of our employees and the communities in which we operate, including limiting our environmental impact particularly by reducing energy and water consumption, waste, and emissions. As a reflection of the importance of these matters, we assign oversight responsibility for sustainability to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Company also publishes an annual report describing our environmental sustainability goals and practices and our commitments to the health and safety of our employees. Our annual sustainability reports are publicly available on our website at https://www.autoliv.com/sustainability/sustainability-report. 
Board Independence 
The Board believes that generally it should have no fewer than seven and no more than eleven directors. The Board currently consists of nine members. In accordance with the By-Laws, the Board has adopted a resolution to increase the number of directors on the Board to ten, effective immediately prior to the opening of the polls for the election of directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
The Board has determined that all the director nominees, except Messrs. Bratt and Carlson, are independent directors under the applicable rules of the NYSE, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. In making its independence determinations, the Board reviewed (i) information regarding relevant relationships, arrangements or transactions between the Company and each director or parties affiliated with such director, (ii) Company records and (iii) publicly available information. Mr. Bratt is not independent because he is a current officer of the Company, and Mr. Carlson is not independent because he served as an officer of the Company in the last three years. 
The Board has also determined that none of the independent directors has a relationship with the Company other than as a director and/or a stockholder of the Company. 
Retirement Age Policy and Director Tenure 
It is the general policy of the Company that a director who has attained the age of 75 years during his or her term will not stand for re-election at the next annual meeting of stockholders. 
For each director nomination recommendation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the issue of continuing director tenure and takes steps as may be appropriate to ensure that the Board maintains an openness to new ideas and a willingness to critically re-examine the status quo. An individual director's repeated nomination is dependent upon such director's performance evaluation, as well as a suitability review, each to be conducted by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regarding each director nomination recommendation. The average tenure of the Board is 5.8 years and the median tenure is 4 years, with four newly appointed directors within the last three years and one new director nominee for election at the Annual Meeting.

Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight 
Board Leadership 
The Board is responsible for selecting the Company's Chairman of the Board (the "Chairman") and Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO"). The Corporate Governance Guidelines permit the Board to determine the most appropriate leadership structure for the Company at any given time and give the Board the ability to choose a Chairman that it deems best for the Company. The Board periodically evaluates the Company's leadership structure to determine what structure is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders based on the current circumstances and needs of the Company. 
The Board currently has a non-independent, non-CEO Chairman and a Lead Independent Director. The CEO and Chairman roles were previously combined from May 2014 until June 2018 when Mr. Carlson stepped down as CEO of Autoliv to become the CEO of Veoneer. The Board determined during that time that the combined role of CEO and Chairman under Mr. Carlson was the appropriate leadership structure for the Company. After evaluating its leadership structure, the Board believes it is in the Company's best interests for Mr. Carlson to continue to serve as Chairman because his familiarity with the Company's business enables him to effectively lead the Board in its discussion, consideration, and execution of the Company's strategy. 
The Board believes that having Mr. Carlson serve as a non-independent Chairman is appropriately balanced by the designation of a Lead Independent Director. In May 2018, the Board appointed James M. Ringler as Lead Independent Director to serve as the principal liaison between the Chairman and the other independent directors and to provide independent leadership of the Board's affairs on behalf of the Company's stockholders. Mr. Ringler presides over the executive sessions of the independent and non-management directors. The duties of the Lead Independent Director include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Presides at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including chairing executive sessions of the  independent and non-management directors;

Risk Oversight 
The Board is responsible for the oversight of risk management of the Company with various aspects of risk oversight delegated to its committees. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring financial risk and discussing risk oversight and management as part of its obligations under the NYSE's listing standards. The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, including those related to internally and externally disclosing cybersecurity risks and incidents. The Risk and Compliance Committee is responsible for monitoring legal and regulatory risks and other compliance risks, including those related to ethics practices and information technology and security. The Risk and Compliance Committee periodically receives reports from and reviews with management the Company's risk management program. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee oversees the Company's succession planning programs and policies related to recruiting, retaining, and developing management. The Risk and Compliance Committee is responsible for coordinating with the Audit Committee and other Board committees to discuss matters pertaining to risk oversight. In its meetings, the Board receives reports from various Board committees and management, including the CEO, the CFO, and General Counsel regarding the main strategic, operational, and financial risks the Company is facing and the steps that management is taking to address and mitigate such risks. Additionally, the Board will receive periodic risk-related updates from other members of management as necessary. 
The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee has reviewed with management the design and operation of our incentive compensation arrangements for senior management, including executive officers, to determine whether such programs might encourage inappropriate risk-taking that could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee considered, among other things, the features of the Company's compensation program that are designed to mitigate compensation-related risk, such as the performance objectives and target levels for incentive awards (which are based on overall Company performance), and the Company's compensation recoupment policy. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee concluded that any risks arising from the Company's compensation plans, policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. For additional information regarding compensation risk, see page 34 of this Proxy Statement. 
Board Meetings 
The Board met ten times during the year ended December 31, 2018, including several meetings related to the spin-off. The Board also acted by written consent six times during the year. All directors serving during 2018 participated in at least 80% of the total number of meetings of the Board and committees on which they served. Following each of the meetings of the full Board, the independent directors met in executive session without management participating, for a total of ten times in 2018. 
Board Compensation 
Directors who are employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries do not receive separate compensation for service on the Board or its committees. Non-employee directors receive an annual board retainer, which is higher for a non-employee Chairman of the Board. The committee chairs and the Lead Independent Director receive compensation in addition to the standard non-employee director retainer. 
Effective beginning with 2017 service, the Board amended the Director Compensation Policy primarily to (i) provide for payments in advance, rather than in arrears, for a service year that runs from annual meeting to annual meeting, and (ii) provide that one-half of the annual retainer will be paid in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs), rather than fully-vested shares of stock, which RSUs will be granted on the date of the annual meeting and will vest on the earlier of (a) date of the next annual meeting, or (b) the one-year anniversary of the grant date. In addition, the Board revised the non-employee director stock ownership policy to require each non-employee director to acquire and hold shares of the Company's common stock in an amount equivalent to five times the cash component of the annual Board retainer (as opposed to three times the annual base retainer as a whole), with five years for the existing directors to reach the new ownership requirements.

Policy on Attending the Annual Meeting 
Under the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Company's policy is for all directors to attend the Annual Meeting. All current directors who stood for election participated in the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. 
Related Person Transactions 
As a general matter, the Company prefers to avoid related person transactions (as defined below). The Company recognizes, however, that certain related person transactions may not be inconsistent with the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Company's policy is that all related person transactions must be reviewed and approved or ratified by the Audit Committee or, in certain circumstances, the Audit Committee Chairman. As provided in the Related Person Transactions Policy, a "Related Person Transaction" is a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which the Company (including any of its subsidiaries) was, is or will be a participant and in which any "Related Person" (as defined in the Related Person Transactions Policy) had, has or will have a direct or indirect interest. In determining whether to approve a related person transaction, the Audit Committee considers all of the known relevant facts and circumstances, including the benefit of the transaction to the Company, the terms of the agreement with the Related Person, the possible impact on a director's independence, the availability of other sources for goods or services comparable to those provided by the Related Person, and any other information regarding the transaction or the Related Person that may be material. 
Transactions with Veoneer relating to the Spin-Off 
On June 29, 2018, Autoliv completed the spin-off of its former Electronics business, Veoneer, Inc. ("Veoneer") to the Company's stockholders, resulting in Autoliv and Veoneer being two independent, publicly-traded companies. As discussed above, Mr. Carlson, who was the CEO of Autoliv prior to the spin-off, is now a non-employee director and the Chairman of the Board of the Company and is also the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Veoneer. Since Mr. Carlson is a related person of the Company, certain transactions between the Company and Veoneer are considered related person transactions that were approved by the Audit Committee and require disclosure pursuant to Section 404(a) of Regulation S-K. 
Relating to the spin-off and the internal reorganization of Autoliv that was completed in advance of the spin-off to transfer the Electronics business to Veoneer, the Company entered into several agreements with Veoneer that were approved or ratified by the Audit Committee. When reviewing these transactions, in addition to considering Mr. Carlson's positions with Autoliv and Veoneer, the Audit Committee also considered (i) the amounts involved, to the extent quantifiable, (ii) the benefits to Autoliv of the transactions (iii) the lack of availability of other sources of comparable products or services, and (iv) that, due to the nature of the spin-off, the transactions are not comparable to the terms available to unaffiliated entities or persons. 
- 12 - 
Distribution Agreement: Relating to the internal reorganization, Autoliv and Veoneer entered into a Master Transfer Agreement, which was amended and restated effective as of the spin-off (the "Distribution Agreement"). The Distribution Agreement governs certain transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities by each of Veoneer and Autoliv and the settlement or extinguishment of certain liabilities and other obligations among the companies. Substantially all of the assets and liabilities associated with the separated Electronics business were retained by or transferred to Veoneer or its subsidiaries and all other assets and liabilities were retained by or transferred to Autoliv or its subsidiaries. The Distribution Agreement also provided the principal corporate transactions required to effect the spin-off, certain conditions to the spin-off and provisions governing the relationship between us and Autoliv with respect to and resulting from the completion of the spin-off. The Distribution Agreement also provides for indemnification obligations designed to make the Company financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the completion of the internal reorganization, as well as those obligations of Autoliv assumed by us pursuant to the Master Transfer Agreement; provided, however, certain warranty, recall and product liabilities for Electronics products manufactured prior to the completion of the internal reorganization were retained by Autoliv and Autoliv will indemnify Veoneer for any losses associated with such warranty, recall, or product liabilities. At December 31, 2018, Autoliv's indemnification liabilities under the Distribution Agreement are approximately $12 million. 
Employee Matters Agreement: The Employee Matters Agreement governs Autoliv's and Veoneer's compensation and employee benefit obligations with respect to the current and former employees and non-employee directors of each company. Autoliv will be responsible for liabilities associated with Autoliv allocated employees and liabilities associated with former employees and Veoneer will be responsible for liabilities associated with Veoneer allocated employees, but Autoliv will retain and continue to be responsible for certain post-retirement liabilities relating to plans sponsored by Autoliv. The Employee Matters Agreement provided for the conversion of the outstanding awards granted under the Autoliv equity compensation programs into adjusted awards relating to both shares of Autoliv and Veoneer common stock. 
Tax Matters Agreement: The Tax Matters Agreement governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Autoliv and Veoneer with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. The agreement also specifies the portion, if any, of this tax liability for which Veoneer will bear responsibility and provides for certain indemnification provisions with respect to amounts for which they are not responsible. In addition, under the agreement, each party is expected to be responsible for any taxes imposed on Autoliv that arise from the failure of the Spin-offs and certain related transactions to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
Transition Agreements. Autoliv and Veoneer entered into multiple agreements to provide each other with certain ongoing services for a limited amount of time following the completion of the spin-off. The Amended and Restated Transition Services Agreement provides that certain finance, information technology, human resources, facilities and other services will be provided between Autoliv and Veoneer for a limited time to help ensure an orderly transition following the spin-off. Each party will pay the other for any such services utilized at agreed amounts as set forth in the agreement. The services will terminate no later than April 1, 2020. Autoliv and Veoneer also entered into several Reseller Agreements to facilitate Veoneer's ongoing use of critical assets such as leased facilities and intellectual property and transition the supply of products to customers who require involved processes to change suppliers. In 2018, Autoliv paid Veoneer an aggregate of $1 million for services provided under the Amended and Restated Transition Services Agreement and Veoneer paid Autoliv an aggregate of $8.2 million for services provided under the Amended and Restated Transition Services Agreements and the reseller agreements. Autoliv and Veoneer also entered into software sublicenses, a transitional trademark license and multiple lease guarantees to facilitate the transition following the completion of the spin-off. 
Supply/Service Agreements. We entered into certain direct purchase and applications engineering agreements with Veoneer after the spin-off. In 2018, Autoliv paid Veoneer an aggregate of approximately $0.85 million for engineering services and $78.0 million for products, and Veoneer paid Autoliv an aggregate of approximately $0.4 million for engineering services, under these commercial agreements. 
In 2018, Veoneer also made payments to Autoliv in the amount of $12.2 million pursuant to an agreement between Veoneer and Autoliv entered into in connection with the Spin-off relating to product pricing considerations for certain customer products and programs. 
- 13 - 
Sublease Agreement: A subsidiary of Veoneer has subleased office space from a Company subsidiary under an agreement approved by the Company's Audit Committee. The estimated value of this sublease to the Company is approximately $385,000 over the duration of the term based on current exchange rates between the US Dollar and the Swedish krona. 
Agreements with Stockholders 
Cooperation Agreement with Cevian 
On March 1, 2019, the Company entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the "Cooperation Agreement") with Cevian Capital II GP Limited ("Cevian"), pursuant to which the Company agreed to nominate Ms. Liu for election to the Board at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.

The nomination of Ms. Liu for election at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders and her inclusion on future slates of directors during the Standstill Period (defined below) is conditioned upon Cevian owning at least 8% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. Ms. Liu will offer her resignation from the Board if Cevian no longer owns at least 8% of the then-outstanding shares of common stock of Autoliv.

The Cooperation Agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the Standstill Period or any other date established by mutual written agreement of the parties. 
The Cooperation Agreement contains mutual non-disparagement provisions and requires Cevian to keep confidential any non-public information it receives by reason of Ms. Liu's role as a director and to abstain from trading in securities in violation of applicable law while in possession of confidential or material non-public information. The Cooperation Agreement is governed by Delaware law.

Leadership Development and Compensation Committee Duties, Procedures and Policies 
The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee acts pursuant to a written charter. The charter is posted on the Company's website at www.autoliv.com – About Us – Governance – Board of Directors – Committees, and can also be obtained free of charge in print by request from the Company using the contact information below. Each member of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee has been determined by the Board to be "independent" as defined in, and is qualified to serve on the committee pursuant to, the rules of the NYSE, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. 
- 18 - 
The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee is responsible for (i) reviewing annually the Company's executive compensation plans in light of the Company's goals and objectives of such plans; (ii) evaluating annually the performance of the Chief Executive Officer in light of the goals and objectives of the Company's executive compensation plans and, together with the other independent directors, determining, and approving the Chief Executive Officer's compensation level based on this evaluation; (iii) evaluating annually the performance of the other executive officers of the Company in light of the goals and objectives of the Company's executive compensation plans, and setting the compensation of such other executive officers based on this evaluation; (iv) evaluating annually the appropriate level of compensation for Board and committee service by non-employee directors; (v) reviewing and approving any severance or termination arrangements to be made with any executive officer of the Company; (vi) reviewing perquisites or other personal benefits to the Company's executive officers and directors and recommending any changes to the Board; (vii) developing the Company's plans for management succession and recruiting, retaining, and developing management; (viii) reviewing and discussing with management the CD&A, beginning on page 25 of this Proxy Statement, and based on that review and discussion, recommending to the Board that the CD&A be included in the Company's annual proxy statement or annual report on Form 10-K; (ix) preparing the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee Report for inclusion in the annual proxy statement or annual report on Form 10-K; (x) reviewing the description of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee's process and procedures for the consideration and determination of executive officer and director compensation to be included in the Company's annual proxy statement or annual report on Form 10-K; (xi) reviewing the results of the most recent stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation and recommending to the Board the frequency of such vote; and (xii) performing such duties and responsibilities as may be assigned by the Board under the terms of the Company's general compensation plans and other employee benefit plans, including oversight of pay equality on behalf of the Board. 
The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee from time to time uses independent compensation consultants to provide advice and ongoing recommendations regarding executive compensation. In 2018, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee engaged Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook") as its independent advisor. FW Cook reported directly to the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee with respect to executive compensation matters. In 2018, the Company also engaged Willis Towers Watson ("Towers Watson") as a compensation consultant. For additional information regarding the role of each of these compensation consultants and the scope of their engagement, see page 33 of this Proxy Statement. 
The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee considered the independence of Towers Watson and FW Cook under the SEC rules and NYSE listing standards. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee also received a letter from each of Towers Watson and FW Cook addressing their independence. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee considered the following factors in determining the independence of the compensation consultants: (i) other services provided to the Company by each of Towers Watson and FW Cook; (ii) fees paid by the Company as a percentage of each consultant's total revenue; (iii) policies or procedures maintained by Towers Watson and FW Cook that are designed to prevent a conflict of interest; (iv) any business or personal relationships between the individual consultants involved in the engagement and any member of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee; (v) any Company stock owned by the individual consultants involved in the engagement; and (vi) any business or personal relationships between the Company's executive officers and Towers Watson or FW Cook or the individual consultants involved in the engagement. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee discussed these independence factors and concluded that the work of Towers Watson and FW Cook did not raise any conflicts of interest. 
The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee may form subcommittees for any purpose it deems appropriate and may delegate to any subcommittee such power and authority as it deems appropriate provided that no subcommittee shall consist of fewer than two members and that the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee shall not delegate any power or authority required by any law, regulation or listing standard to be exercised by the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee as a whole. Under the Company's 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "1997 Plan"), the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee may, to the extent that any such action will not prevent the 1997 Plan from complying with applicable rules and regulations, delegate any of its authority thereunder to such persons as it deems appropriate. In addition, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee has delegated to the CEO the authority to determine certain grants under the Company's long-term incentive plan, subject to 
- 19 - 
 established grant limits. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee reviews the compensation levels set by the CEO under the long-term incentive program.

Leadership Development and Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee is comprised exclusively of directors who have never been employed by the Company and who are "independent" as defined in the applicable rules of the NYSE, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. No executive officer of the Company served as a member of the compensation committee of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Company's Leadership Development and Compensation Committee. No executive officer of the Company served as a director of another entity, one of whose executive officers either served on the compensation committee of such entity or served as a director of the Company (i.e. no interlocks exist). 
Leadership Development and Compensation Committee Report1 
The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Company's Compensation Discussion and Analysis and, based on such review and discussions, has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The Swedish Corporate Governance Code 
Swedish companies with shares admitted to trading on a regulated market in Sweden, including the Nasdaq Stockholm, are subject to the Swedish Corporate Governance Code (the "Swedish Code"). This is a codification of best practices for Swedish listed companies based on Swedish practices and circumstances. The Swedish Code follows a "comply or disclose" approach; its recommendations are not binding on companies but if its recommendations are not complied with, the deviation must be explained. A non-Swedish company listed in Sweden can elect to either apply the Swedish Code or the corresponding local rules and codes where the company's shares have their primary listing or where the company is headquartered. As a Delaware corporation with its primary listing on the NYSE, the Company has elected to apply U.S. corporate governance rules and standards. This section and other parts of this Proxy Statement provide detailed information on various subjects covered by the Swedish Code.

In addition to, and consistent with, these statutory laws and regulations, Autoliv is governed by its own charter documents and internal standards and policies through its Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Third Restated By-Laws, Corporate Governance Guidelines, and Standards of Business Conduct and Ethics. These charter documents and internal standards and policies guide and assist the Board in the exercise of its responsibilities and reflect the Board's commitment to fostering a culture of integrity and monitoring the effectiveness of policy and decision-making, both at the Board and management level.

Such forward-looking statements include those that address activities, events, or developments that the Company or its management believes or anticipates may occur in the future. All forward-looking statements are based upon our current expectations, various assumptions and/or data available from third parties. Our expectations and assumptions are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that such forward-looking statements will materialize or prove to be correct as forward-looking statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual future results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the future results, performance or achievements expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the outcome could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including without limitation: changes in light vehicle production; fluctuation in vehicle production schedules for which the Company is a supplier; changes in general industry and market conditions or regional growth or decline; changes in and the successful execution of our capacity alignment, restructuring and cost reduction initiatives and the market reaction thereto; loss of business from increased competition; higher raw material, fuel and energy costs; changes in consumer and customer preferences for end products; customer losses; changes in regulatory conditions; customer bankruptcies; consolidations or restructuring or divestiture of customer brands; unfavorable fluctuations in currencies or interest rates among the various jurisdictions in which we operate; component shortages; market acceptance of our new products; costs or difficulties related to the integration of any new or acquired businesses and technologies; continued uncertainty in pricing negotiations with customers; successful integration of acquisitions and operations of joint ventures; successful implementation of strategic partnerships and collaborations; our ability to be awarded new business; product liability, warranty and recall claims and investigations and other litigation and customer reactions thereto; higher expenses for our pension and other postretirement benefits including higher funding needs for our pension plans; work stoppages or other labor issues; possible adverse results of pending or future litigation or infringement claims; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; negative impacts of antitrust investigations or other governmental investigations and associated litigation relating to the conduct of our business; tax assessments by governmental authorities and changes in our effective tax rate; dependence on key personnel; legislative or regulatory changes impacting or limiting our business; political conditions; dependence on and relationships with customers and suppliers; and other risks and uncertainties identified in Item 1A "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and in the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Introduction 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) describes the material elements of compensation awarded to, earned by, or paid to each of the Company's "named executive officers" during the last completed fiscal year, and discusses the principles and decisions underlying our executive compensation policies and the most important factors relevant to an analysis of these decisions and policies. 
Our Named Executive Officers in 2018 
In accordance with the relevant rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, our "named executive officers" include anyone who served as the CEO or CFO during 2018, and three other executive officers who had the highest total compensation during 2018. In addition, our named executive officers for 2018 include two former executives who left their roles during 2018 in connection with the spin-off. 
These named executive officers for 2018 are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mikael Bratt (President and CEO)  
[END TABLE]

• Jan Carlson (Former President and CEO)

Executive Summary 
The following is a brief overview of the fiscal year 2018 compensation program for our named executive officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total compensation for our named executive officers in 2018 generally consists of base salary, annual non-equity incentives, long-term equity incentives, retirement/pension related benefits, and other benefits.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• On June 29, 2018, we completed the separation of our Passive Safety and Electronics businesses through a spin-off of the Electronics business to the Company's stockholders, resulting in the Passive Safety business (the "Company" or "Autoliv") and the Electronics business ("Veoneer")  being two separate publicly-traded companies (the "spin-off").  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In relation to the spin-off:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Carlson left his role as President and CEO of Autoliv and became the President and CEO of Veoneer,   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Former President, Passive Safety Mr. Bratt was appointed as our President and CEO, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Fredin and Ms. Eliasson entered into mutual separation agreements with the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The spin-off impacted certain aspects of our compensation program, including as  follows:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In connection with the spin-off, all outstanding stock options, restricted stock  units ("RSUs") and performance shares ("PSs") were converted into adjusted stock options and RSUs relating to both shares of Autoliv and Veoneer. 50% (with certain limited exceptions due to local regulations) of the outstanding  stock award value, as calculated immediately prior to the spin-off, was converted to a stock option or RSU, as applicable, of Veoneer, and 50% to a stock option or RSU, as applicable, of Autoliv, in each   
[END TABLE]
- 25 - 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     case with an adjustment to the number of shares and, in the case of stock options, exercise price, as required to preserve the value inherent in the stock award before and after the spin-off. PSs were converted to RSUs of both Autoliv and Veoneer as described above, with the number of PSs so converting determined based on the pro-ration: (i) for the  period between the beginning of the performance period and December 31, 2017, the actual level of performance measured as of December 31, 2017; and (ii) for the period following December 31, 2017 and the last day of the  applicable performance period, actual performance measured as of December 31, 2017, or target level performance, whichever was greater. For purposes of vesting for all awards, continued employment with or service to Autoliv or Veoneer, as  applicable, will be treated as continued employment with or service to both Autoliv and Veoneer, as applicable.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The long-term equity incentive grants approved by the Board for 2018 consisted only of RSUs (as opposed to RSUs and PSs) due  to the difficulty in setting performance targets during the year of the spin-off.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2018 annual non-equity incentive awards were calculated assuming target performance  for the first half of the year and based on actual performance against goals relating to "Group Adjusted Operating Margin" (defined below) for the second half of the year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Based on the 2018 compensation risk assessment, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee (the  "Compensation Committee") concluded that our compensation programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Autoliv.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Philosophy 
Our Compensation Philosophy for our executive management is set forth below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Main  Principles   The Company believes that to achieve its strategic and financial objectives, it is necessary to attract, motivate, and retain exceptional  management talent. In addition, total compensation offered to our executive management should provide a shared responsibility for overall Company results which is aligned with the interests of the Company's stockholders. Our compensation  strategy is therefore based on principles of performance, competitiveness and fairness. 
 Compensation  Objectives    To meet our compensation philosophy, the compensation  programs we provide have the following objectives:    Objective A: Offer  total compensation and benefits sufficient to attract, motivate, and retain the management talent necessary to ensure the Company's continued success. Objective B: Align the interests of the executives and the stockholders. Objective C: Reward performance in a given year and over a sustained period using straightforward programs to communicate our performance expectations. Objective D: Encourage company-wide cooperation among members of the executive, regional, and business unit management teams and throughout the  Company.

 How to Use Market  Data    We consider the competitive environment of our significant  operations and market locations to provide a compensation package that optimizes value to the participant and cost to the Company. The Compensation Committee and management believe that it is their responsibility to use discretion and make informed  judgments as to individual compensation packages or pay levels that may occasionally deviate above or below our target pay strategy based on such factors as:   1. Individual performance and potential relative to market. 2. Long-term succession  planning and talent management. 3. Business conditions in our industry or the market overall as well as business or regulatory conditions in the executive's area  of responsibility. 4. Cases where individuals are asked to step into new roles and responsibilities for specific projects or strategic initiatives.

Initial base salaries are primarily a function of the Compensation Committee's assessment of (i) market compensation levels, (ii) the references made to base salary in our compensation philosophy for executive management, (iii) the compensation required to attract and retain the executive, and (iv) the Company's need to fill the position either internally or externally. Also, in deciding compensation levels during the compensation review at the beginning of 2018, one of the Compensation Committee's objectives was for base salaries and total direct compensation to approximate the market median of the relevant market data linked to the country in which the 
- 27 - 
 named executive officer is located. As part of the 2018 compensation review in December 2017, the Compensation Committee increased base salaries for our named executive officers prior to the spin-off between 3% to 5%, consistent with general market practice. In relation to assignments during the spin-off, additional base salary adjustments were made for a limited number of named executive officers as described in section "Additional 2018 Compensation Decisions" below. 
Non-Equity Incentives 
Members of our executive management team, including our named executive officers, are eligible to earn an annual non-equity incentive award based on achievement against pre-established performance criteria. Target payout amounts are reflected as a percentage of the executive's base salary, as set forth in the following table.

  (1)  In connection with the new assignments following the spin-off, the target non-equity incentive opportunity for Mr. Bratt increased from 45% to 50%, for Mr. Murray from 38.71% to 45% and for Messrs. Hague and Garceau from 35% to 45%.  
[END TABLE]
Our annual non-equity incentive award program used a single performance criterion for many years – "Group Operating Income". The Company believes that using a limited number of established measures critical for the success of our business provides clear direction to our executives and promotes our goal of a "one Autoliv" approach through shared responsibility for overall results. In addition, the Company believes that a limited number of performance metrics enhances the transparency of our annual incentive program and provides easy-to-understand information to our investors. Finally, we believe that a limited number of metrics based on overall company performance rather than individual or local performance mitigates the risk of excessive risk-taking that could arise from individual performance-based incentives. We still believe this simple, transparent approach supports good corporate governance, a belief that is evidenced by the program operating with limited changes for several years. 
The Company, however, recognizes that using a limited number of performance metrics has limitations. For instance, when the overall market for the Company's products is impacted by extraordinary economic circumstances, a single performance metric based on profit may result in no annual non-equity incentive awards being attainable, even if the Company out-performs its competitors and the overall market generally. Similarly, extraordinary, non-recurring events may also impact whether annual non-equity incentive awards are attained or not, resulting in unintended incentives for management. 
Due to the difficulty in setting performance targets in 2018 in light of the spin-off, the Compensation Committee approved that annual non-equity incentive awards for 2018 would be: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• deemed to be at the target payout level, without performance targets being set, for the  6-month period between January 1 – June 30, 2018, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• calculated based on actual performance against targets set after the spin-off for  "Adjusted Operating Margin" for the 12-month period between January 1 – December 31, 2018 for the Company, pro-rated for the six-month period of July 1 – December 31.  
[END TABLE]
- 28 - 
"Adjusted Operating Margin" is a non-U.S. GAAP measure consisting of the Company's Adjusted Operating Income in relation to the Company's net sales. Adjusted Operating Income consists of the Company's reported U.S. GAAP operating income adjusted for costs related to capacity alignment, antitrust related matters and separation of our business segments due to the spin-off. For a reconciliation of the Company's Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusting Operating Margin see Annex A. The Compensation Committee chose Adjusted Operating Margin as the sole metric as it believed it would best align performance with shareholder returns in the year of the spin-off. 
Payments on Adjusted Operating Margin achievement: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No annual incentive payment if the Adjusted Operating Margin was equal to or less than 10.9%.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the Adjusted Operating Margin was equal to or more than 11.9%, the incentive payment would be equal to two times the  target amount for the respective performance period, the maximum payout.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the Adjusted Operating Margin was between 10.9% and 11.9%, the incentive payment would be calculated through linear  interpolation ("along a straight line") between said levels.  
[END TABLE]
Actual Adjusted Operating Margin for 2018 was 10.5% and therefore there was no payout for the second half of 2018. The full year payout level was 50% of the target incentive opportunity for named executive officers due to the target level payout for the first half of 2018. 
Actual Non-Equity Incentive Award Levels 
Over the last several years, the amount of the non-equity incentive awards earned by our named executive officers has varied greatly, as reflected in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2018   0.50 x target   0.50 x target 
 2017   0.89 x target   1.00 x target 
 2016   1.55 x target   1.55 x target 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee may exercise its discretion, subject to the terms and conditions of the Company's compensation plans, to propose certain adjustments to performance metrics. The Compensation Committee did not exercise such discretion in 2018. 
Changes to Non-Equity Incentive Program. For information regarding the changes we implemented to our Non-Equity Incentive Program in 2019, see "Material Changes to 2019 Compensation Program" later in this CD&A. 
Equity Incentives 
Long-term equity incentives (LTI) for our named executive officers and other key employees represents a significant part of their total direct compensation. In 2018, the LTI program had 401 participants, compared to 374 participants in 2017 and 334 participants in 2016. The 2018 LTI participants included employees who, after the spin-off, are now Veoneer employees. The number of 2019 LTI participants decreased as a result of the spin-off. 
In 2016 and 2017, the approved target value of our named executive officers' LTI mix was comprised of PSs (50%) and RSUs (50%). In connection with the spin-off, these awards were converted to Autoliv RSUs and Veoneer RSUs (as described earlier in this CD&A). For 2018, the Compensation Committee only granted RSUs (100%) due to the difficulty of setting performance targets during the year in which the spin-off was completed. 
- 29 - 
 Equity incentives granted in 2019 once again consist of both RSUs and PSs. The Compensation Committee determined 2018 grant levels by first reviewing competitive market pay levels and trends provided by its independent consultant, historical grant levels, and the recommendations of our CEO for grants to senior executives excluding himself (for more information, please refer to the "2018 Executive Compensation Decisions" section below). The Compensation Committee also considered the total direct compensation of our named executive officers relative to the median levels of total direct compensation of our peer groups, subject to any modifications the Compensation Committee believed appropriate based on individual performance, industry conditions, and other criteria as discussed in the "Compensation Philosophy" above. The Compensation Committee delegated to the CEO the authority for the determination and allocation of certain grants below our named executive officers, subject to established grant limits and the Committee's review. 
Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"). We believe that RSUs provide a powerful tool to retain valuable executives because: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• RSUs are easy to understand and communicate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Due to the three-year vesting schedule, RSUs encourage the executive to stay with the Company or forfeit significant  accumulated value; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• RSUs also mitigate excessive risk-taking by focusing management on long-term value creation and ownership accumulation that  provides alignment with stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
RSUs granted in 2018 cliff-vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to the grantee's continued employment with the Company on such vesting date, subject to limited exceptions. 
Performance Shares ("PSs"). We believe that PSs focus and direct the efforts of our executives toward the attainment of critical multi-year corporate objectives as well as further encourage employment retention because: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The performance metrics selected for the PSs are reflected in our long-term value creation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Due to the three-year performance period, PSs parallel the RSUs in encouraging the executive to stay with the Company or  forfeit potential significant accumulated value.  
[END TABLE]
Dividend Equivalents. Commencing with the February 2017 grant, dividend equivalent rights were introduced for PSs and RSUs. Any cash dividend paid with respect to our common stock for which the record date occurs on or after the grant date and the payment date occurs on or before the vesting date results in a credit of additional PSs and RSUs, which additional PSs and RSUs are subject to the same vesting schedule as the underlying PSs and RSUs. 
How We Value Equity Awards. For accounting purposes and when internally assessing and communicating equity compensation, we use a model which assumes that the value of an RSU and a PS at target performance level is the closing price for a share of our common stock on the NYSE on the day of the grant. 
Annual Grant Date. The annual grant date for our stock incentive program is in the first quarter of the fiscal year, following publication of our fourth quarter financial results. This is done to enhance corporate governance procedures and to avoid unintended burdens to participants because of routine "black-out periods." 
Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards in Connection with the Spin-Off. In connection with the spin-off, the Compensation Committee approved the following adjustment and conversion approach for outstanding stock awards: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 50% of the outstanding value of all outstanding stock options, RSUs, and PSs were converted to Autoliv grants and the  remaining 50% are Veoneer grants (with certain limited exceptions due to local regulations), in each case with an adjustment to the number of shares and, in the case of stock options, exercise price, as required to preserve the value inherent in the  stock award before and after the spin-off.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The conversion prices used in calculating value before and after conversion were the average of the closing per share price  of Autoliv shares during the five trading days immediately preceding the spin-off effective date in comparison to the average of the closing per share price of Autoliv shares or Veoneer shares, respectively,  during the first five trading days immediately following the spin-off effective date.  
[END TABLE]
- 30 - 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PSs were converted to RSUs as described above, with the number of PSs so converting determined based on a proration:  (i) for the period between the beginning of the performance period and December 31, 2017, the actual level of performance measured as of December 31, 2017; and (ii) for the period following December 31, 2017 and the last day  of the applicable performance period, actual performance measured as of December 31, 2017, or target level performance, whichever was greater  
[END TABLE]
For purposes of vesting for all awards, continued employment with or service to Autoliv or Veoneer, as applicable, will be treated as continued employment with or service to both Autoliv and Veoneer, as applicable. 
The targets for outstanding PSs granted during 2016 and 2017 were as follows: 
2016 PSs 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Sales Growth (CAGR)(1)(4)    2016-2018    0%   5%   8% 
 Company EPS Growth(4) (CAGR) in relation to Light  Vehicle Production (LVP) Growth (CAGR) (2)(3)    2016-2018    Same as  LVP Growth   LVP Growth  +2 percentage points   LVP Growth  + 4 percentage points 
[END TABLE]
Based on the conversion approach described above and Sales Growth of 7.2% and Company EPS Growth of. LVP Growth plus 2 percentage points, the Compensation Committee approved a performance conversion factor of 137% (of the target level) for the conversion of outstanding 2016 PSs to RSUs. The converted RSUs vested and converted to shares on the 3rd anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the executive's continued service with Autoliv on such date (with certain limited exceptions). 
2017 PSs 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Sales Growth (CAGR)(1)(4)    2017-2019    2%   7%   12% 
 Company EPS Growth(4) (CAGR) in relation to Light  Vehicle Production (LVP) Growth (CAGR)(2)(3)    2017-2019    Same as  LVP Growth   LVP Growth  +5 percentage points   LVP Growth  + 10 percentage points 
[END TABLE]
Based on the conversion approach described above and Sales Growth of 2.7% and Company EPS Growth vs. LVP Growth that did not meet the threshold for payout, the Compensation Committee approved a performance conversion factor of 69% (of the target level) for the conversion of outstanding 2017 PSs to RSUs. The converted RSUs will vest and convert to shares on the 3rd anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the executive's continued service with Autoliv on such date (with certain limited exceptions). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  "Sales" is a non-U.S. GAAP measure consisting of the  Company's reported annual net sales, as reported in the Company's audited financial statements for the relevant year, adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign currency translations. "Sales Growth" is  a non-U.S. GAAP measure consisting of the compound annual growth rate (CAGR), expressed as a percentage, of Sales over the Performance Period, calculated with a beginning value of the Company's  Sales for the year prior to the first year of the Performance Period and an ending value equal to the Company's Sales for the last year of the Performance Period.

Changes to LTI Program. For information regarding the changes we implemented to our Long-Term Incentive Program in 2019, see "Material Changes to 2019 Compensation Program" later in this CD&A. 
Pension / Retirement and Other Post-Employment Benefits 
Autoliv provides certain supplemental retirement/pension and other post-employment benefits, in addition to the mandatory programs required by applicable national statutes, and maintains defined benefit or defined contribution plans for our named executive officers that are competitive with customary local practice. The programs' terms are as follows: 
Defined Contribution Programs (individual retirement investment from Company contributions). Since 2007, all newly hired senior executives participate only in defined contribution plans rather than defined benefit plans (except for certain senior executives that participate in location-specific defined benefit plans, e.g. Messrs. Murray and Fredin). 
The Company contributes a percentage of each executive's annual base salary to the plan, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Mikael Bratt   40% of base salary 
 Jan Carlson   48% of base salary 
 Mats Backman   35% of base salary 
 Brad Murray1   See below description about 401(k) plan and "Nonqualified  Deferred Compensation" table 
 Michael Hague2 
 Daniel Garceau1 
 Steven Fredin1 
 Karin Eliasson   35% of base salary 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  Comprises contributions to both 401(k) and non-qualified contribution plans for  Messrs. Murray, Garceau, and Fredin.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  Comprises contributions to 401(k) for Mr. Hague.  
[END TABLE]
Messrs. Murray, Hague, Garceau, and Fredin participated in a 401(k) plan available to U.S.-based employees in 2018. Under this plan, the Company makes an employer matching contribution equal to 100% of the first 3%, and then equal to 50% of the next 2% of employee contributions (expressed as percentage of base pay), up to certain limits. Messrs. Murray, Garceau, and Fredin also participated in a non-qualified defined contribution plan. 
Defined Benefits Program. Mr. Carlson participated in a Company defined benefit plan prior to becoming CEO. Messrs. Murray and Fredin participate in a U.S. tax-qualified defined benefit plan and an excess pension plan. Mr. Fredin participated in a supplemental defined benefit plan. Additional information regarding these plans is described later under "Pension Benefits." Other than Messrs. Carlson, Murray, and Fredin, none of our named executive officers are parties to a defined benefit arrangement with the Company. 
Retiree Medical Plan. Messrs. Murray and Fredin are eligible to participate in a retiree medical plan, available to all employees employed in the U.S. that were hired prior to January 1, 2004, at which time the plan 
- 32 - 
 was frozen to new participants. Effective from December 31, 2014, the retirement arrangement was adjusted so that eligible participants, including Messrs. Murray and Fredin, are covered by a Health Retirement Account ("HRA"), pursuant to which, upon attaining age 55 and a minimum of 15 years of service, the Company will provide an annual benefit of $3,000 to an HRA upon retirement prior to age 65 and an annual benefit of $875 to an HRA after age 65. This annual benefit will be reduced if the participant retires prior to age 60. This plan may be terminated at any time for both current employees and current retirees/participants with no obligation of benefit payout. 
Termination / Severance Agreements. Except for Mr. Murray, each of our named executive officers has an employment agreement with the Company, pursuant to which they are entitled to certain severance benefits in the event of termination of employment. A detailed summary of the terms of these agreements is provided on page 47 of this Proxy Statement. Mr. Murray has an international assignment agreement that provides certain terms of employment and he has a change-in-control ("CiC") severance agreement with the Company, pursuant to which he is entitled to certain severance benefits in the event of his termination of employment in connection with a CiC. In December 2010, the Board approved a policy limiting future CiC agreements to a "double-trigger" arrangement, which means that the severance benefit is not provided unless the participant incurs an involuntary termination or diminution of duties within a designated period following a CiC. Mr. Murray's CiC agreement is consistent with this policy. In addition, in November 2011, the Board approved a policy providing that new hires will receive CiC severance benefits, if at all, in accordance with local market practice, as opposed to all officers receiving the same CiC severance benefits by reason of being an officer. The "change-in-control" definition contained in the 1997 Plan and Mr. Murray's CiC severance arrangement are predicated on actual consummation of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, rather than upon stockholder approval of the transaction. This avoids an inadvertent "early trigger" of any CiC provisions should the transaction fail to close. 
The 1997 Plan provides that outstanding equity awards will become fully vested upon the occurrence of a CiC. However, the Compensation Committee approved a "double-trigger" for LTI awards granted in 2019, such that the awards assumed by the acquiring company in a CiC will become fully vested only upon the holder's subsequent qualifying termination. If the awards are not assumed by the acquiring entity, then they will become fully vested upon the CiC. 
We do not provide tax gross-up protection for CiC excise taxes (i.e., U.S. taxes under Section 4999 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "U.S. Internal Revenue Code") applied to change-in-control payments that exceed certain amounts under Section 280G) to our named executive officers. 
Executive Compensation Responsibilities 
Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee annually reviews our named executive officers' pay levels and target incentive opportunities versus the competitive market and considers information provided by (i) the consultants regarding trends, (ii) input from the Executive Vice President, Human Resources and Sustainability, (iii) the CEO's recommendations as to compensation for our named executive officers (other than himself), and (iv) other relevant factors as discussed above in the "Compensation Philosophy" section. 
Role of the Independent Compensation Committee Consultant 
The Compensation Committee regularly engages an independent advisor, who reports directly to the Compensation Committee. The independent advisor attends routine meetings of the Compensation Committee and provides independent perspective and advice to the Compensation Committee on various aspects of the Company's total compensation system and the market environment in which the Company operates. Additional information regarding the role of the Compensation Committee's advisor, FW Cook, may be found later in this CD&A in the "2018 Executive Compensation Decisions" section. 
Role of the Management Consultant 
Management periodically solicits the advice of external compensation consultants to ensure that the Company's compensation program is competitive with compensation programs offered by the companies in its 
- 33 - 
 peer group and companies in the markets in which the named executive officers are located. In setting the compensation at the beginning of 2018, Willis Towers Watson assisted management with reviewing the Company's compensation program for executives, as described in more detail below. 
Role of the Chief Executive Officer 
Our CEO regularly participates in the meetings of the Compensation Committee. The CEO and Executive Vice President, Human Resources and Sustainability work together to develop a recommendation to present to the Compensation Committee with respect to compensation packages for each of our named executive officers, other than the CEO. As a result, our CEO generally has a significant influence on the compensation paid to the other named executive officers. In addition, the Compensation Committee has delegated the authority for the determination of certain grants to employees other than executive officers under our long-term incentive plan to the CEO, subject to established grant limits. The Compensation Committee regularly holds executive sessions, excusing the CEO from the meeting, to discuss matters related to the CEO's compensation. 
Policies and Practices that Govern Executive Compensation at Autoliv 
Stock Ownership Guidelines. Effective January 1, 2013, and as amended and restated in December 2015, the Company adopted stock ownership guidelines for its executive officers. Pursuant to these guidelines, each executive officer is expected to accumulate and hold shares of Company common stock having a value at least equal to (i) 2x his annual base salary, in the case of the CEO, and (ii) 1x annual base salary, in the case of each executive other than the CEO. Executives are expected to make continuous progress toward their respective ownership requirements. Until the executive has satisfied the stock ownership guidelines, he or she will be required to retain 75% of the net shares received upon settlement of restricted stock units granted on or after January 1, 2013. For purposes of these stock ownership guidelines, "net shares" are those shares held by the executive after deducting any shares withheld by the Company or sold by the executive for the sole purpose of satisfying the executive's tax liabilities and related fees, if any, related to the settlement event. 
Policy Against Hedging, Short-Selling and Pledging. Any employee or non-employee director holding Autoliv securities is prohibited from engaging in hedging, short-selling, or pledging. 
Compensation Recoupment Policy. Our Board is authorized to recoup earned incentive compensation in the event of a material restatement of the Company's financial results due to fraud, intentional misconduct, negligence, or dereliction of duties by the executive officer. It is also authorized to recoup equity compensation in the event an executive is found acting in a manner that is harmful to the interests of the Company such as a violation of Company policy. 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
The Compensation Committee annually considers potential risks when reviewing and approving our compensation program. We have designed our compensation program, including our incentive compensation plans, with specific features to address potential risks while rewarding employees for achieving long-term financial and strategic objectives through prudent business judgment and appropriate risk taking. The following elements have been incorporated in our compensation program for executive officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A Balanced Mix of Compensation Components – The target compensation mix for our executive officers is composed of base  salary, annual cash incentives, long-term equity incentives, and retirement/pension provisions, representing a mix that is not overly weighted toward short-term cash incentives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Factors – Our group-common incentive compensation plans normally use Company-wide goals. Annual cash  incentives for participants in 2018 depend on Operating Income Margin performance. The Company eliminated performance shares only in 2018 due to difficulties linked to target setting when splitting its operations into two separate listed companies.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term Incentives – Our long-term incentives are equity-based and generally have a three-year vesting schedule to  complement our annual cash-based incentives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Capped Incentive Awards – Annual incentive awards are capped at 200% of target.  
[END TABLE]
- 34 - 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Ownership Guidelines – Our guidelines call for meaningful share ownership, which aligns the interests of our  executive officers with the long-term interests of our stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation Recoupment Policy – Our Board is authorized to recoup earned incentive compensation in the event of a  material restatement of the Company's financial results due to fraud, intentional misconduct, negligence, or dereliction of duties by the executive officer. It is also authorized to recoup equity compensation in the event an executive is found  acting in a manner that is harmful to the interests of the Company such as a violation of Company policy.  
[END TABLE]
Additionally, the Compensation Committee annually considers an assessment of compensation-related risks including an inventory of incentive and commission arrangements below the executive level. Based on this assessment, the Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation program does not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Autoliv. In making this determination, the Compensation Committee reviewed the key design elements of our compensation program in relation to industry "best practices" as presented by FW Cook, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, as well as how any potential risks may be mitigated, such as through our internal controls and oversight by management and the Board of Directors. 
2018 Executive Compensation Decisions 
The Process 
The total compensation of our named executive officers is reviewed annually. The Compensation Committee considers changes in the compensation levels after it reviews the relevant peer group or local market data (per position). The Compensation Committee uses this information as one input in its decision-making process. In addition to market data, the Compensation Committee also reviews the Company's financial performance, the named executive officers' individual performance, input from the Executive Vice President, Human Resources, and the recommendations of the CEO with respect to the compensation packages for the named executive officers other than himself. The Compensation Committee reviews, provides feedback, and approves the final recommendations for the compensation of our named executive officers. 
The Compensation Committee reviewed and decided on the 2018 compensation for our executives prior to the spin-off during its meeting held in December 2017. The review was supported by the comprehensive analysis and market review prepared by Towers Watson. Additionally, the Compensation Committee reviewed the compensation for our executives in relation to assignments to new roles following the spin-off. Mr. Carlson received no special payments from the Company in relation to his resignation from the Company in conjunction with his assumption of the role of Chief Executive Officer of Veoneer. 
The Advisors 
Throughout the decision-making process for 2018 compensation, which included the Compensation Committee's December 2017 meeting and all 2018 meetings, the Compensation Committee engaged FW Cook who reported directly to the Compensation Committee. During 2018, FW Cook attended most of the Compensation Committee's meetings and provided input for each meeting, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  independent perspective and advice to the Compensation Committee on various aspects of the Company's total  compensation system;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (ii)  information about the market environments in which the Company operates, including guidance regarding compensation trends,  compensation levels and compensation mix within the market;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (iii)  the regulatory developments in executive and director compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (iv)  recommendations regarding program design and structure;

[BEGIN TABLE]
  (v)  recommendations regarding compensation levels and mix for our executive officers and Board members; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (vi)  recommendations regarding compensation arrangements and conversion of outstanding stock incentive programs in relation to  the spin-off.  
[END TABLE]
- 35 - 
FW Cook did not provide any additional services to the Company other than those described herein. 
In 2017, the Company engaged Willis Towers Watson to assist in setting the compensation for 2018. At the direction of management, Towers Watson was assigned specific tasks related to the compensation of our senior executive officers, including: (i) review of peer group and pay changes in the 2017 employment market, (ii) compilation of peer groups for our named executive officers, and (iii) compensation analysis for the Compensation Committee. 
The Peer Groups 
In line with the principles of our compensation philosophy applicable as of December 2017 for the compensation review of our named executive officers, the Compensation Committee reviewed the most current compensation data available in selected markets, including market data from Sweden and the U.S. Willis Towers Watson used its proprietary non-disclosed compensation database to assess local market compensation levels for executive roles operating within the general, high-tech, automotive, and manufacturing industries. Such market assessments are based on our named executive officers' roles, characteristics, and responsibilities including job function, reporting level, and other organizational financial and organizational scope measures, including revenue responsibility, employees, and geographical responsibility. The market data contained information regarding the assessed level of base salary, total cash compensation, total direct compensation, and total compensation. 
Swedish Peer Group 
Messrs. Bratt, Backman, and Carlson, and Ms. Eliasson. In considering compensation for 2018 for our named executive officers based in Sweden, the Compensation Committee reviewed, among other factors, market data (base salary, total target cash compensation, total direct compensation, and total compensation) from a peer group consisting of large-cap Swedish companies that have global industrial operations of substantial size in major manufacturing markets of North America, Europe, and Asia (the "Swedish Peer Group") headquartered in Sweden and with executives based in Sweden with Swedish employment conditions. The Swedish Peer Group for 2018 consisted of the following companies: 
U.S. Peer Group 
Mr. Fredin. In considering Mr. Fredin's compensation for 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed, among other factors, market data (base salary, total target cash compensation, total direct compensation, and total compensation) from a peer group consisting of U.S. companies that were selected based on market capitalization, total revenue, and number of employees. 
The companies comprising the 2018 U.S. Peer Group are listed below:  
- 36 - 
Decisions for 2018 Compensation 
The following section of this CD&A focuses on the decisions linked to compensation paid to our named executive officers for 2018. 
The Compensation Committee reviews the compensation for the executives taking internal, external, and personal factors into consideration and one of the factors considered is the current market position of respective named executive officers. Although the analysis provides additional input to decision making, the Company is aware that the limited number of peer group companies in Sweden and potential changes made to peer groups based on data availability may result in inconsistencies in year-over-year analysis. 
The percentage changes in each element of compensation set forth below reflect the Compensation Committee's decisions in December 2017. 
Mikael Bratt. Pursuant to the December 2017 analysis provided by Towers Watson, Mr. Bratt's: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• base salary increased by 3.0% (in Swedish Kronor);

Messrs. Murray, Hague and Garceau were not executive officers during the Compensation Committee's December 2017 compensation review and, accordingly, were not included in its compensation review by the Compensation Committee. Their 2018 compensation was determined within the Senior Management compensation review process. The Compensation Committee reviewed their compensation at the time of their promotion to executive roles and made limited adjustments to their compensation at that time as described in "Additional 2018 Compensation Decisions". 
Additional 2018 Compensation Decisions 
Mr. Bratt's New Employment Arrangement 
As described above, Mr. Bratt entered into a new employment agreement with the Company upon promotion to President and CEO of the Company following the spin-off. In determining the compensation for Mr. Bratt, the Compensation Committee considered the market data available, as well as his current compensation. 
Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Bratt's employment agreement with the Company, he has an annual base salary of $1,003,233 (equivalent to an increase of 40% in comparison to his pre-assignment base salary), a target short-term incentive of 50% of his base salary (increased from 45%), eligibility to participate in the stock incentive plan and a defined contribution retirement benefit equivalent to 40% of his base salary (increased from 35%). For additional information regarding other benefits, see footnote 4 to the Summary Compensation Table. For information regarding Mr. Bratt's severance benefits under his employment agreement, see the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" section later in this Proxy Statement. 
Mr. Murray's New International Assignment Arrangement

Mr. Murray's international assignment agreement provides that his income will be tax equalized between Japan and the US according to the Company's practices.

Severance Arrangements with Mr. Fredin and Ms. Eliasson 
During 2018, the Company entered into mutual separation agreements with each of Mr. Fredin and Ms. Eliasson. For information regarding the severance benefits provided under these agreements, see the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" section later in this Proxy Statement. 
2018 Additional Benefits 
The Company's executive compensation program also includes certain retirement / pension benefits (see page 45 of this Proxy Statement) and certain other items of compensation, such as a company car. The Compensation Committee believes these benefits are appropriate for each of our named executive officers. 
Results of Say-on-Pay 
At our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders held on May 8, 2018, approximately 83.5% of the stockholders who voted on the "say-on-pay" proposal approved the compensation of our named executive officers, while approximately 15.3% voted against (with approximately 3% abstaining). In considering the results of this most recent advisory vote on executive compensation, the Compensation Committee concluded that the stockholder vote continues to reflect favorable stockholder support of the compensation paid to our named executive officers and the compensation philosophy and objectives of the Company.  
At the annual meeting of stockholders on May 9, 2017, our stockholders expressed a preference that advisory votes on executive compensation occur every year. In accordance with the results of this vote, the Board determined to implement an advisory vote on executive compensation every year until the next required vote on the frequency of stockholder votes on the compensation of executives, which will occur at the 2023 annual meeting. 
Material Changes to 2019 Compensation Program 
The Compensation Committee made certain changes to our 2019 compensation program as summarized below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual non-equity incentive award program award will be based on adjusted cash  conversion (50%) and adjusted operating margin (50%).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In February 2019, we re-introduced PSs. 75% of the value of our named executive  officers 2019 LTI grant is comprised of PSs and 25% of RSUs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our named executive officers may earn 0%-200% of the target number of PSs based on  the Company's achievement of specified targets for the Company's new order intake (35%) and EPS growth in relation to light vehicle production ("LVP") growth (65%).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To further enhance our governance practices, the Compensation Committee approved a double-trigger CiC acceleration provision  in the 2019 LTI grants (instead of the single-trigger acceleration provision included in previous grants). Specifically, (i) in the event of a CiC in which the LTI awards are assumed by the surviving entity, if the employee's employment is  terminated without cause (or, in certain cases, if he or she resigns for good reason) within two years following the CiC, then the RSUs and PSs will become immediately vested (at the target level, in the case of PSs); and (ii) in the event of a  CiC in which the awards are not assumed by the surviving entity, then the RSUs and PSs will become immediately vested (at the target level, in the case of the PSs).  
[END TABLE]

Currencies for Executive Compensation 
The Company generally sets cash-based compensation (including for all our named executive officers) in the local currency of the country of service with limited exceptions. Accordingly, the Company set compensation in Swedish kronor ("SEK") for Messrs. Bratt, Backman, Carlson, and Ms. Eliasson, and in U.S. dollars ("USD") for Messrs. Murray, Hague, Garceau, and Fredin, except for the annual target grant value of the LTI awards for which the compensation is set in USD for all our named executive officers. All amounts have been converted to USD using the following exchange rate: 1 USD = 8.971 SEK = 0.8731 EUR. For historic numbers, we have converted the compensation paid in prior years by the same exchange rate to facilitate comparison. While the historic amounts paid do not change, amounts reflecting historic figures in this Proxy Statement may differ significantly from disclosure in previous years due to fluctuations in exchange rates. We also note that the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the Compensation Committee's review of compensation may vary significantly from the exchange rates prevailing at the time this Proxy Statement is prepared. As a result, the year-to-year percentage changes in compensation reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee may differ significantly from the percentage changes in compensation presented in this Proxy Statement due to fluctuations in exchange rates.

  (2)  The numbers reflect the aggregate grant-date fair value of the RSUs granted in each respective year and the PSs granted in  2016 and 2017, calculated in accordance with FASB Topic 718. The fair value of the RSUs granted in 2017 and 2018 and PSs granted in 2017 was calculated based on the closing price per share of stock on the grant date. The fair value of RSUs and PSs  granted in 2016 was calculated using the Black Scholes valuation model. The assumptions made in the valuation of the RSUs and the PSs are contained in Note 17 "Stock Incentive Plan" to the Company's consolidated financial statements  contained in the Company's 2018 Annual Report. The grant date fair value of the PSs was computed by multiplying (i) the target number of PSs awarded to each named executive officer, which was the assumed probable outcome as of the grant date,  by (ii) the grant date fair value per share used for financial reporting purposes. Assuming, instead, that the highest level of performance conditions would be achieved, the grant date fair values of the PSs would have been as follows: (i) 2017: Mr.  Bratt $371,392; Mr. Carlson, $991,155; Mr. Backman, $371,392; Mr. Fredin, $371,392; and (ii) 2016: Mr. Bratt, $232,859; Mr. Carlson, $927,851; Mr. Backman, $232,859; Mr. Fredin, $347,650.

(1)  Before becoming CEO, Mr. Carlson participated in a defined benefit plan, which is now frozen. The future defined  benefit entitlement is based on Mr. Carlson's base salary at the time the defined benefit plan was frozen and the number of years he was participating in the defined benefit plan. The benefit entitlement is indexed each year based on the  Swedish consumer price index.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Represents the present value of Mr. Carlson's expected pension benefits in the Sweden Executives plan at  retirement according to US GAAP. The discount rate used to calculate the present value as of December 31, 2018 was 2.25% and the inflation assumption / pension indexation was 2.00%. The calculations are based on the latest mortality table  available from Svensk Försäkring DUS14 (white collar).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  The actuarial present value of the accumulated plan benefit is based on the accrued benefit in each plan as of  December 31, 2018, using the plan's benefit formula and actual earnings and service through December 31, 2018. The calculation is based on the same assumptions used for financial reporting purposes under generally accepted accounting  principles with the following exceptions: (a) Mr. Fredin was assumed to retire on his normal retirement date of March 1, 2027, (b) Mr. Fredin was assumed to elect a lump sum payment in all plans, payable on March 1, 2027,  (c) Mr. Murray was assumed to retire on his normal retirement date of July 1, 2024, (d) Mr. Murray was assumed to elect a lump sum payment in both plans, payable on July 1, 2024 and (e) no  pre-retirement decrements (withdrawal, retirement, disability, or death) were assumed.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Key assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit value as of December 31, 2018, for Mr. Murray are as  follows: (i) discount rate of 4.35%, (ii) lump sum interest rates of 4.29% for the first five years, 4.86% for the next 15 years, and 4.71% thereafter, and (iii) solely for determination of the projected lump sum amounts, the assumed  future applicable mortality table under U.S. Internal Revenue Code Section 417(e) rates based on RP2014 base table back-projected to 2006 and projected forward using Projection Scale MP2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Key assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit values as of December 31, 2018, for Mr. Fredin are as  follows: (i) discount rate of 4.35%, (ii) lump sum interest rates of 4.81% for the first five years, 4.94% for the next 15 years, and 4.71% thereafter and (iii) solely for determination of the projected lump sum amounts, the assumed future  applicable mortality table under U.S. Internal Revenue Code Section 417(e) rates based on RP2014 base table back-projected to 2006 and projected forward using Projection Scale MP2017.  
[END TABLE]
U.S. Pension Plan. During 2018, Messrs. Fredin and Murray participated in the Autoliv ASP, Inc. Pension Plan (which we refer to as the "Pension Plan"). The Pension Plan is a funded, defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits for the Company's U.S. employees hired prior to January 1, 2004, who meet minimum age and service eligibility requirements. Subject to certain limitations, the monthly retirement benefit under the Pension Plan (assuming attainment of age 65, the retirement age specified by the plan, and an election to receive payments in the form of a life annuity), is determined in accordance with a formula that takes into account the following factors: the highest average of any consecutive five calendar years of pensionable earnings during the last ten years of employment ("average final earnings"), and the number of years of benefit service. The retirement benefit for Messrs. Fredin and Murray under the Pension Plan is a monthly pension equal to 1/12th of the amount determined as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 1.0% of average final earnings times years of benefit service prior to 12/31/2005, plus  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 0.5% of average final earnings in excess of "Covered Compensation" times years of benefit service prior to  12/31/05, plus  
[END TABLE]
- 45 - 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 0.7% of average final earnings times years of benefit service on or after 1/1/2006, plus  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 0.5% of average final earnings in excess of "Covered Compensation" times years of benefit service on or after  1/1/2006.  
[END TABLE]
For purposes of this formula, "earnings" in a given year means the participant's gross annual compensation, excluding amounts credited or paid under the key employees stock option and performance unit plan, long-term incentive plans, severance pay and reimbursement for employment-related expenses, but including bonuses and incentive pay which is not, and has not been, subject to deferred income taxation under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. "Covered Compensation" means the average of the Social Security taxable wage bases during the 35-year period ending with the year in which the participant reaches the Social Security normal retirement age. Pension Plan benefits will begin when a participant reaches normal retirement age, defined as age 65. Benefits can commence immediately upon termination if the participant is vested after five years of vesting service, but if benefits are commenced prior to age 60, the benefit will be lower than at normal retirement age. Disability retirement is offered under the Pension Plan to participants who have at least 15 years of vesting service, are eligible to receive Social Security Disability benefits, become totally and permanently disabled while employed, and are not eligible to participate in long-term disability insurance. 
Benefits under the Pension Plan are payable in the form of a lump sum or annuity, as selected by the participant. Participants in the Pension Plan will be 100% vested in their plan benefit after five years of vesting service or if they reach age 65 while employed by Autoliv. Messrs. Fredin and Murray are fully vested in their Pension Plan benefits. 
Excess Pension Plan. Messrs. Fredin and Murray also participated in the Autoliv ASP, Inc. Excess Pension Plan (which we refer to as the "Excess Pension Plan"). The Excess Pension Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified defined benefit retirement plan, pursuant to which participating U.S. employees are eligible to receive a retirement benefit based on the benefit they would receive under the Pension Plan. Benefits payable under the Excess Pension Plan are calculated without regard to the limitations imposed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code on the amount of compensation that may be considered under the Pension Plan. The purpose of the Excess Pension Plan is to supplement the benefits payable under the Pension Plan. 
The benefit payable under the Excess Pension Plan is equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the monthly benefit that would be payable to the executive under the Pension Plan as of the later of age 65 or the executive's separation from service, computed without regard to applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Code limitations, and computed as if amounts deferred under a bonus or incentive compensation plan had been counted as "earnings" under the Pension Plan), over (ii) the amount of monthly benefit payable to the executive under the Pension Plan as of the later of age 65 or the executive's separation from service, as limited by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and the terms of the Pension Plan. Benefits under the Excess Pension Plan will be payable in a single lump sum on the first day of the seventh month following the month in which the executive retires or otherwise separates from service. Messrs. Fredin and Murray are fully vested in their benefits in the Excess Pension Plan. 
Supplemental Pension Plan. Messrs. Fredin is a named plan participant in the Autoliv ASP, Inc., Supplemental Pension Plan, which was established November 1, 2015, to correct an administrative error that was made in 1997 and discovered and corrected in 2015. The plan provides a supplemental pension benefit to a select group of management who were former employees of Morton International, Inc. and became employees of Autoliv North America prior to the merger with Morton International, Inc. The supplemental benefit is an amount equal to the sum of (1) the difference between (a) what Mr. Fredin's accrued benefit would have been under the Pension Plan had they been credited with benefit service with Autoliv ASP, Inc., beginning May 1, 1997 instead of July 1, 1999 and (b) Mr. Fredin's actual accrued benefits under the Pension Plan and (2) the additional benefit, if any, which would have been paid to him under the Excess Pension Plan had his Pension Plan benefit been determined in accordance with (a) above.

  (4)  Includes amounts previously reported in the Summary Compensation Table, in the previous years when earned if that  executive officer's compensation was required to be disclosed in a previous year. Amounts previously reported in such years include previously earned, but deferred, salary and Company matching contributions.  
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to the Non-Qualified Retirement Plan, participants may elect to defer a stated percentage of their base salary for each plan year, as determined by the administrative committee of the plan; provided, however, the amount deferred may not exceed 25% of a participant's base salary. Earnings (and losses) are credited to participants' accounts based on participant choices between various investment options. 
Participants are eligible to receive matching contributions equal to 80% of their deferred amounts. For plan years ending on or before December 31, 2008, deferred amounts exceeding 12% of the participant's compensation were not eligible for matching contributions. For plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, deferred amounts exceeding 7% of the participant's compensation are not eligible for matching contributions. Participants are always 100% vested in their deferred amounts and earnings thereon; provided, however, matching contributions and earnings thereon in a participant's account are subject to forfeiture if the participant is determined by the Board to have stolen Company assets, violated the Company's Standards of Business Conduct and Ethics or disclosed confidential business or technical information of the Company to unauthorized third parties. 
Participants may elect to receive distributions from their accounts on the first day of the seventh month following separation from service, or within sixty (60) days following the occurrence of one of the following distribution events as designated by the participant: (i) attainment of normal retirement age (65), or (ii) attainment of early retirement age (age 55 and at least five years of service with the Company). Amounts will be distributed in one of the following forms, as selected by the participant: (i) a single lump sum, (ii) 60 approximately equal monthly installments or (iii) 120 approximately equal monthly installments. If the participant dies before any distribution has started, a death benefit provides the balance of the participant's account to be distributed to a beneficiary in the same manner as the participant election on file. If the participant dies after a distributed has begun, distributions will continue to the designated beneficiary in the form elected. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
The Company has entered into agreements and maintains plans that may require the Company to make payments and/or provide benefits to our named executive officers in the event of termination of employment or a change in control. The paragraphs below summarize the material terms of such agreements with our named executive officers. 
- 47 - 
Employment Agreements. The Company has indefinite agreements with each of Messrs. Bratt, Hague, and Garceau ("the employment agreements") and had an indefinite agreement with Mr. Backman until his resignation effective February 28, 2019. Mr. Murray has a time limited international assignment agreement (the "IA Agreement") that expires on March 31, 2020 unless extended or terminated earlier. All agreements obligate the Company to provide 6-12 months' notice of termination of employment for each of the named executive officers (for Mr. Murray, 6 months or last day of the IA Agreement, whichever is earlier) unless the employment is terminated for "cause," in which case termination would be effective immediately. In addition to notice of termination, the named executive officers are eligible for certain severance payments or end-of-service benefits. Each of the named executive officers must provide the Company with 6-12 months' notice of resignation (for Mr. Murray, 6 months or last day of the IA Agreement, whichever is earlier). The employment agreements automatically terminate on the last day of the month before named executive officer's 65th birthday, except for Mr. Murray for whom the employment ends automatically on the last day of the IA Agreement. 
Except as provided below, following the executive's termination of employment, each of the named executive officers are prohibited from competing with the Company for a period of 12 months. Such noncompetition covenant does not apply if the Company terminates the named executive officer's employment for any reason other than for Cause, or the named executive officer resigns for Good Reason. In consideration for such noncompetition covenant, the Company is obligated to make up to 12 monthly payments equal to the difference between the executive's monthly gross salary as of the date of his employment termination and any lower salary earned by the executive in any new employment, if any. The aggregate monthly payments are limited to a maximum of 60% of the gross salary earned as of the date of his employment termination, and the Company will cease making payments once such aggregate amount has been reached. The Company is not obligated to make such payments if the executive's employment terminates due to his retirement. 
In addition to receiving full base salary and benefits during the requisite notice period, if the Company terminates the employment involuntarily other than for Cause or if the executive resigns for Good Reason, then the executive would be entitled to a lump sum severance payment equal to one and one-half times his then-current base salary, except for Mr. Murray who is eligible for a previously earned but deferred end-of-service payment of $800,000 following the end of employment with the Company (the "End-of-Service Payment"). Upon the final negotiation and execution of an IA Agreement amendment, he is also eligible for a retention payment of the cash value of the unvested equity outstanding on the expiration date of the IA Agreement provided he is employed until the expiration of that agreement. 
Change-in-Control Severance Agreement. Mr. Murray also has a change-in-control severance agreement ("CiC Severance Agreement") with the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the CiC Severance Agreement, in the event that during the two-year period following a change of control, (i) he terminates his employment for Good Reason, or (ii) the Company terminates his employment for any reason other than death or for Cause, he would be entitled to receive an immediate lump sum payment (the "CiC Severance Payment") in an amount equal to 2.5 times the sum of (a) his then-current annual salary (or if higher, the salary in effect immediately prior to the first event or circumstances which constitutes Good Reason), (b) the average of the annual cash bonuses earned by him pursuant to an annual bonus or incentive plan other than the long term incentive plan in respect of the two fiscal years ending immediately prior to the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs or, if higher, immediately prior to the fiscal year in which occurs the first event or circumstance constituting Good Reason. 
For purposes of Mr. Murray's CiC Severance Agreement, the following terms have the following meanings: 
"Cause" shall mean (i) the executive's commission of, conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere to, a felony, (ii) a determination by the Board that the executive has defrauded the company or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) a determination by the Board that the executive has caused significant harm to the company or any of its subsidiaries, monetarily or otherwise or (iv) the willful engaging by the executive in conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the company or its subsidiaries, materially or otherwise. 
"Change in Control" means one or more of the following circumstances: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  the acquisition (by one person or group) of more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power,   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (ii)  either (a) the acquisition (by one person or group) of stock processing more than 30% of the total voting power  during the twelve (12) month period ending on the date of most recent acquisition, or (b) the  
[END TABLE]
- 48 - 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (iii)  the acquisition of assets of the Company with a total gross fair market value equal to at least 40% of the total gross  fair market value of all assets.  
[END TABLE]
"Good Reason" means the occurrence of any one of the following events without the executive's express written consent: (i) a material diminution in the executive's base compensation; (ii) a material diminution in the executive's authority, duties and responsibilities; (iii) a material diminution in the authority, duties or responsibilities of the executive's supervisor; (iv) a material reduction in any budget over which the executive retains authority; (v) a material change in geographic location at which the executive must perform the services; (vi) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of CiC Severance Agreement. 
Equity Awards. Pursuant to the 1997 Plan and subsequent grant agreements until 2019, upon the occurrence of a change in control, any outstanding RSUs held by the executive would fully vest and the performance shares will vest at the target level. Pursuant to the agreements evidencing awards granted under the 1997 Plan, upon the executive's death or retirement, any outstanding RSUs held by the executive would become fully vested and the performance shares will remain outstanding and may be earned, in whole, in part, or not at all, following the conclusion of the performance period to the extent that the performance objectives are attained. Upon an executive's termination of employment, absent a change in control, any outstanding options, RSUs and performance shares that would vest during the applicable notice period, if any, would become fully vested. For awards granted in 2019, a change of control acceleration only occurs if the surviving entity does not assume or otherwise equitably convert or substitute the unvested equity in connection with the change in control. If the surviving company does assume or otherwise equitably convert or substitute the unvested equity, then the awards become fully vested only if the executive's employment is terminated without cause or he resigns for good reason within two years following the change in control event. 
Estimated Payments to Named Executive Officers upon Termination of Employment under Various Circumstances or a Change in Control. The following tables set forth the estimated value of the payments and benefits described above to each of Messrs. Bratt, Backman, Murray, Hague, and Garceau upon termination of employment under various circumstances or a change in control. The amounts shown assume that the triggering events occurred on December 31, 2018. In the case of Mr. Backman, who resigned effective February 28, 2019, no payments are due to him under this agreement or ancillary agreements with the Company other than payments for unused vacation time. For the calculations, the 2018 defined contribution payment for each named executive officer has been used. The amounts contained in the table would be paid in Swedish Kronor or USD. All amounts have been converted to USD using the following exchange rates: 1 USD = 8.9710 SEK = 0.8731 EUR.

Separation Agreement with Mr. Fredin. Following the spin-off on June 29, 2018, Mr. Fredin stepped down as the Company's Group Vice President, Business Development, and the Company and Mr. Fredin entered into a separation agreement that took effect on September 1, 2018 ("Agreement Effective Date"). Pursuant to the separation agreement, Mr. Fredin will receive the following benefits: (i) continued salary, pension and other benefits for a period of 18 months following the Agreement Effective Date, with a value at year-end of approximately $831,457, and (ii) any payout for the short-term incentive bonus for the year 2018, and (iii) a lump sum cash severance payment of $964,689, payable in March 2020. Pursuant to the separation agreement, Mr. Fredin remained in service until December 31, 2018. In addition, Mr. Fredin's Autoliv and Veoneer RSUs (as converted from RSUs and PSs in the spin-off), granted in 2016, 2017 and 2018 will vest on their scheduled vesting dates before the 18-month notice period ends on February 28, 2020. The parties also agreed that the non-competition period will apply for Mr. Fredin for a period of 12 months following the end of employment and, in return, Mr. Fredin will receive a compensation equivalent to $369,859, as adjusted for any employment income earned during that period. 
Separation Agreement with Ms. Eliasson. Following the spin-off on June 29, 2018, Ms. Eliasson stepped down as the Company's Group Vice President, Human Resources and Sustainability, and the Company and Ms. Eliasson entered into a separation agreement that took effect on January 1, 2019, "Agreement Effective Date". Pursuant to the separation agreement, Ms. Eliasson will receive the following benefits: (i) continued salary, pension and other benefits for a period of 6 months following the Agreement Effective Date, with a value of approximately $273,950, and (ii) any payout for the short-term incentive bonus for the year 2018, and (iii) a lump sum cash severance payment of $596,384, payable in July 2019. Pursuant to the separation agreement, Ms. Eliasson remained in service until December 31, 2018.

Additionally, she will receive a lump-sum cash payment, equivalent to the value of restricted stock units granted in 2017. The parties also agreed that the non-competition period will apply for Ms. Eliasson for a period of 12 months following the end of employment and, in return, Ms. Eliasson will receive a compensation equivalent to $238,554, as adjusted for any employment income earned during that period. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
The following ratio compares the annual total compensation of our median-paid employee with the annual total compensation of our CEO. The pay ratio included below is calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. Given the different methodologies that various public companies use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio reported below should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies. 
- 52 - 
Although we identified the median paid employee and disclosed our process for selecting the median paid employee in last year's proxy statement, we have determined a new median paid employee for 2018 and included a description of our selection process again in this Proxy Statement since we believe there was a significant change in the Company's demographics following the spin-off. 
We had two CEOs during 2018. For purposes of the CEO Pay Ratio calculation, we have used the compensation paid to Mr. Bratt, who was the CEO on October 31, 2018, our median employee identification date, for the portion of the year during which he was CEO. To more accurately capture the compensation paid to Mr. Bratt for his services as our CEO, (i) compensation paid to Mr. Bratt as CEO following the spin-off was annualized, (ii) the dollar value included for his non-equity incentive plan award was based on Mr. Bratt's target level as CEO multiplied by the actual STI payout level for the calendar year 2018, which was 50%, and (iii) the dollar value included for his LTI award was based on the grant value of his 2019 LTI award. As a result, the CEO compensation in the CEO Pay Ratio does not match the compensation reported for Mr. Bratt in the Summary Compensation Table (which reflects compensation paid to him during 2018 for both his CEO and non-CEO role). 
For fiscal year 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual compensation of our median-paid employee (other than the CEO) was $23,192; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of the CEO (for CEO pay ratio purposes as described above) was $2,217,658.   
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median-paid employee is 96 to 1. 
The methodology, material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used to identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  Our median employee identification date is October 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  As of October 31, 2018, our total employee population consisted of 63,539 individuals working at our parent company  and consolidated subsidiaries. Our employee population which we have used to identify our median employee, after taking into consideration the adjustments permitted by SEC rules, consisted of 63,539 individuals. All "Autoliv Employee"  categories who were employed by Autoliv as of October 31, 2018, whose compensation is set by Autoliv and who were paid through Autoliv payroll, were included in the analysis (permanent, temporary and part-time). We based our analysis on the  entire employee population (other than our CEO), as opposed to statistical sampling.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  Given the geographical distribution of our employee population and varying local requirements, we use a variety of pay  elements that differ by country to structure the compensation arrangements of our employees. Consequently, for purposes of measuring compensation of our employees, we selected "Actual Gross Taxable Compensation Reported Through Payroll"  (or "Actual Gross Taxable Compensation") as the measure of compensation to identify the median employee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  Given our multiple payroll systems, schedules and the differing fiscal years of our Company and its subsidiaries, we  measured "Actual Gross Taxable Compensation" as the total of payment made during the 10-month period starting on January 1, 2018 and ending on October 31, 2018 (the "measurement  period").  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  5.  We did not annualize or calculate the full measurement period equivalent of "Actual Gross Taxable Compensation"  compensation paid during the measurement period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  6.  As permitted by Item 402(u), we made  cost-of-living (COL) adjustments to the compensation of all our employees in jurisdictions other than the jurisdiction in which our CEO resides to identify the median  employee and used the same COL adjustment to determine the median employee's annual total compensation. Because of the geographical distribution of our employee population, we believe that COL   
[END TABLE]
- 53 - 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median employee resides in China.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The COL adjustments were based on 2017 purchasing power parity conversation factors provided by World Bank, International  Comparison Program database. 2018 conversion factors were not available at the time of our analysis.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We also identified who our median employee would have been had we not used any COL adjustments. Had we not used any COL  adjustments, our median employee would have been an employee residing in Romania with an annual total compensation of $11,092. For the purposes of this disclosure, this amount was converted from Romanian Leu to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate  0,242871 on October 31, 2018. The ratio of the annual total compensation of our President and Chief Executive Officer to the annual total compensation of our median employee identified without the effect of the COL adjustments is 200 to 1.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  7.  Using this methodology, we determined that our median employee was a full-time, salaried employee, with "Actual Gross  Taxable Compensation Reported to Tax Authorities Through Payroll" for the measurement period in the amount of $18,923 after COL adjustment. For the purposes of this disclosure, this amount was converted from Chinese Yuan to U.S. dollars using  the exchange rate 0,143363 on October 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  8.  With respect to our median employee, we then identified and calculated the elements of such employee's compensation  for the fiscal year 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation in the amount of $23,192. The difference between such employee's  "Actual Gross Taxable Compensation Reported to Tax Authorities Through Payroll" and annual total compensation calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K is  due to the measurement period being 10 months as compared to 12 months.

(1)  The annual total compensation of our President and Chief Executive Officer is different from the amount reported for him  in the "Total" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. The amount used for purposes of CEO Pay Ratio calculation is the annualized equivalent of his compensation after he became the CEO during 2018.

PROPOSAL 2 - ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Autoliv stockholders are entitled to cast an advisory vote on the Company's executive compensation program. As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 25 of this Proxy Statement, our compensation system plays a significant role in the Company's ability to attract, retain, and motivate management talent, which the Board believes is necessary for the Company's long-term success. The Board believes that its current compensation program directly links executive compensation to performance, aligning the interests of the Company's executive officers with those of its stockholders. 
The Board invites you to review carefully the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 25 of this Proxy Statement and the tabular and other disclosures on compensation under 2018 Executive Compensation Decisions beginning on page 35 of this Proxy Statement, and cast a vote either to endorse or not endorse the Company's compensation of its named executive officers through the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that stockholders approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, including the Company's compensation practices and principles, as discussed and disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the executive compensation tables, and any narrative executive compensation disclosure contained in this Proxy Statement." 
While the vote does not bind the Board to any particular action, the Board values the input of our stockholders and will take into account the outcome of this vote in considering future compensation arrangements. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE PROPOSAL. 
PROPOSAL 3 - RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM APPOINTMENT 
The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed Ernst & Young AB ("EY") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. The committee has been advised that EY has no relationship with the Company or its subsidiaries other than that arising from the firm's employment as accountants. 
In accordance with directions of the Audit Committee, this appointment is being presented to the stockholders for ratification at the Annual Meeting. While ratification by stockholders of this appointment is not required by law or the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws, the Audit Committee and management believe that such ratification is desirable. In determining whether to reappoint EY as our independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee considered a number of factors, including, among others, the firm's independence and objectivity, capability and expertise in handling the breadth and complexity of the Company's global operations, historical and recent performance, communication and interaction with the Audit Committee and management, and the reasonableness of its fees for audit and non-audit services. 
In the event this appointment is not ratified by the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the appointment at the Annual Meeting, the Audit Committee will consider that fact when it selects its independent registered public accounting firm for the following year. 
Ernst & Young AB has been the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company since May 1997. EY has been the independent registered public accounting firm for Autoliv AB since 1984. Audit services provided to the Company by EY during 2018 consisted of the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for that year and the preparation of various reports based thereon. 
The Company has been advised that a representative of EY will attend the Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and will be afforded the opportunity to make a statement, if desired.

Audit Fees 
Audit fees for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 relate to professional services provided by EY for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements for such years, including the audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the reviews of the financial statements included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for those fiscal years. Audit fees also include fees associated with the statutory audits of various subsidiary financial statements and procedures related to comfort letters, consents and assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC. Audit fees also include accounting and financial reporting consultations necessary to comply with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including audit procedures related to acquisitions. 
Audit-Related Fees 
Most Audit-Related Fees for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 are related to EY's work in connection with the Company's preparations for the spin-off, including the "carve-out" audits of Veoneer, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The remaining Audit-Related Fees for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 relate mainly to EY's audits of benefit plans and other attestation services other than the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and certain other accounting consultations. 
Tax Fees 
Tax Fees for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 relate to professional services provided by EY for tax compliance and tax advice. 
All Other Fees 
All Other Fees for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 mainly related to use of an EY online service and certain other permitted advisory services. EY billed no significant fees related to any other services for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017. 
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies 
The Audit Committee has adopted guidelines for the provision of audit and non-audit services by Ernst & Young AB, including requiring Audit Committee pre-approval of any such audit and non-audit services. In developing these guidelines, the Audit Committee took into consideration the need to ensure the independence of Ernst & Young AB while recognizing that Ernst & Young AB may possess the expertise on certain matters that best positions it to provide the most effective and efficient services on certain matters unrelated to accounting and auditing. On balance, the Audit Committee will only pre-approve the services that it believes enhance the Company's ability to manage or control risk. The Audit Committee was also mindful of the relationship between 
- 56 - 
 fees for audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such services and may determine, for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees for audit, audit-related and tax services, and the total amount of fees for permissible non-audit services (excluding tax services). The guidelines provide for the pre-approval by the Audit Committee of described services to be performed, such as audit, audit-related, tax and other permissible non-audit services. Approval of audit and permitted non-audit services may also be made by the chairperson of the Committee, and the person granting such approval must report such approval to the Committee at the next scheduled meeting. 
The Audit Committee has considered the audit, audit-related, tax, and all other services discussed above and additional information provided to the Company by Ernst & Young AB and determined that the provision of these services is compatible with the independence of Ernst & Young AB. The Audit Committee pre-approved all such services in 2018 and 2017.
