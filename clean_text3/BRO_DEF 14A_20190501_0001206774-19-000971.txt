Dear Fellow Shareholders:
On behalf of Brown & Brown, Inc.'s Board of Directors, we are pleased to invite you to attend our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Wednesday, May 1, 2019. The attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement include important information about the matters to be voted on at the meeting. The proxy materials for the Annual Meeting, which include the Proxy Statement and 2018 Annual Report, are available online to expedite receipt of proxy materials while lowering the costs and reducing the environmental impact of the meeting.
Fiscal 2018 was a milestone year for Brown & Brown, characterized by many exciting developments we believe are important to you as shareholders.
From a financial standpoint, we accomplished our intermediate goal of reaching $2 billion in annual revenues and delivered healthy organic revenue growth in all of our segments, other than our National Programs Segment due to a decline in weather-related events in 2018. Despite slight moderation in our operating margins, we achieved strong net income and earnings per share growth for the year.
In 2018, our Board remained focused on our disciplined capital allocation strategy, making several important investments during the year. Notably, we completed our landmark acquisition of Hays Companies, which will strengthen our presence in the Midwest, increase our capabilities, and position us for future growth. In total, we acquired 23 high-quality businesses with combined annual revenues of approximately $323 million. We also increased our dividend for the 25th consecutive year, returning approximately $83 million to shareholders, and continued making investments to upgrade and standardize our various technology platforms.
In March 2018, we completed a 2-for-1 stock split with the goal of making our stock more accessible in the public market. In addition, to better connect with our shareholders and other members of the investment community, we hosted our first-ever Investor Day in New York City in September 2018. We would like to thank those of you who participated, and we hope you found the experience meaningful.
Finally, in 2018, we welcomed two highly qualified new directors to our Board. In November 2018, Jim Hays joined us as a director following our acquisition of Hays Companies, bringing a wealth of knowledge and experience in the insurance industry. He also became a member of our Senior Leadership Team and was appointed Vice Chairman of the Company. Additionally, Larry Gellerstedt joined us in December 2018 as our newest independent director and has valuable experience leading businesses and serving on the boards of both public and private companies.
Whether or not you attend the meeting, we encourage you to vote online or by phone, or by signing and returning your proxy card promptly in the enclosed envelope to assure that your shares will be represented at the meeting. If you decide to attend the meeting and vote in person, you will, of course, have that opportunity.
On behalf of our Board of Directors, our management team, and our teammates, thank you for your investment in Brown & Brown. We look forward to seeing you at the Annual Meeting.
Sincerely,
"In total, we acquired 23 high-quality businesses with combined annual revenues of approximately $323 million."

[END TABLE]
All nominees have consented to being named in the Proxy Statement and have agreed to serve if elected. If any director nominee becomes unable or unwilling to serve, proxies will be voted for any substitute nominee(s) as the Board of Directors (the "Board") may nominate on the recommendation of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee.
Vote Required; Majority Voting; Board Recommendation
Our Bylaws provide for a majority voting standard for the election of our directors in uncontested elections. If the director election were contested, the plurality standard would apply, which means the nominees receiving the greatest numbers of votes would be elected to serve as directors.
To be elected, a nominee must receive the affirmative vote of more than 50% of the votes cast, either in person or by proxy, at the Meeting. If an incumbent director does not receive more than 50% of the votes cast with respect to his or her election, he or she must promptly tender a conditional resignation following certification of the vote. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will then consider the resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept it, and the Board would be expected to act on the recommendation within 90 days. Thereafter, the Board will promptly publicly disclose its decision concerning whether to accept the director's resignation offer (and, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the offer). If the Board does not accept the resignation, the director will continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until a successor has been elected and qualified. If the Board accepts the resignation, then the Board may fill any resulting vacancy or may decrease the size of the Board.

Director Independence
The New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") listed company manual requires directors to satisfy certain criteria to be deemed "independent." The Board applies these standards in determining whether any director has a material relationship with the Company that would impair his or her independence, as discussed below. As required by the NYSE listed company manual, the Board considers all material relevant facts and circumstances known to it in making an independence determination, from the standpoints of both the director and persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation.
The Board has considered the independence of our nominees in light of these NYSE standards and has affirmatively determined that the following 11 of the 14 director nominees have no material relationship with us other than service as a director, and are therefore independent: Samuel P. Bell, III; Hugh M. Brown; Bradley Currey, Jr.; Lawrence L. Gellerstedt III, Theodore J. Hoepner; James S. Hunt; Toni Jennings; Timothy R.M. Main; H. Palmer Proctor, Jr.; Wendell S. Reilly; and Chilton D. Varner. The following factors were relevant to the Board's determination of independence:

Director Nominee Selection Process
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating director nominees and for recommending to the Board a slate of nominees for election at each Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

The Company does not pay any third party a fee to assist in the identification or evaluation of candidates. The Committee will consider director nominations that are submitted in writing by shareholders in accordance with our procedures for shareholder proposals. See "Proposals of Shareholders" below. Such proposals must contain all information with respect to a proposed candidate as required by the SEC's proxy rules, must address the manner in which the proposed candidate meets the criteria described above, and must be accompanied by the consent of such proposed candidate to serve as a director, if elected.

Risk Oversight
The Board and its committees actively oversee management of the Company's risks.

While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board of Directors is regularly informed through attendance at committee meetings or through committee reports about such risks.
We believe the Board's approach to risk oversight, as described above, helps assess various risks, make informed decisions, and evaluate emerging risks in a proactive manner for the Company.
Further, our financial Internal Audit Team is responsible for the performance of the internal audit function and for testing compliance with policies and procedures relating to our financial reporting and control environment. Our Information Technology Review Team is responsible for testing our data security and information technology controls. Our Insurance Operations Review Team is responsible for the testing of our operational internal controls. Our Team Resources Review Team tests compliance with internal guidelines and state and federal employment law requirements relating to compensation and human resources, and regularly assesses risks and potential risks associated with our operations. These departments support the integration of our acquisitions and report to our Audit Committee on a quarterly basis, unless more frequent reports are necessary.
Our General Counsel is primarily responsible for enterprise risk management for the Company. On a quarterly basis, our General Counsel presents an enterprise risk management analysis to our Board of Directors, which includes an assessment of overall risk, risk mitigation and elimination priorities, anonymous ethics hotline reports and claims liabilities. Also, our Chief Executive Officer and General Counsel annually deliver a detailed presentation to our Board of Directors about risks associated with our business. This presentation includes extensive discussion, analysis and categorization of risks with respect to likelihood of occurrence, severity and frequency, as well as consideration of mitigating factors that contribute to lessening the potential adverse consequences associated with such risks (which can never, in any business, be fully eliminated). This presentation is prepared with input from the Company's executive officers, including our segment leaders and our Chief Information Officer.

Communication with Directors
Interested parties, including shareholders, may communicate with our Board of Directors, with specified members or committees of our Board, with non-management directors as a group or with the Lead Independent Director, Wendell S. Reilly, by sending correspondence to our Corporate Secretary at 220 S. Ridgewood Ave., Daytona Beach, Florida 32114, and specifying in such correspondence that the message is for our Board or for one or more of its members or committees. Communications will be relayed to directors no later than the next regularly scheduled quarterly meeting of the Board and Board Committees.
Corporate Governance Principles; Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; Code of Ethics for Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers
The Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Principles, a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and a Code of Ethics for Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, the full text of each of which can be found in the "Corporate Governance" section of the "Investor Relations" tab, under "Key Documents" on our website (www.bbinsurance.com), and each of which is available in print to any shareholder who requests a copy by writing our Corporate Secretary at 220 S.

Related Party Transactions Policy
Under our Related Party Transactions Policy, our General Counsel (or our Chief Executive Officer if the related party is our General Counsel or an immediate family member of our General Counsel) will review any potential Related Party Transaction to determine if it is subject to the Policy. If so, the transaction will be referred to the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee for approval or ratification. If, however, the General Counsel determines that it is not practical to wait until the next meeting of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, the Chair of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee shall have the authority to act on behalf of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee on whether to approve or ratify a Related Party Transaction (unless the Chair of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is a Related Party in the Related Party Transaction). In determining whether to approve or ratify a Related Party Transaction, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee (or, as applicable, the Chair of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee) will consider, among other things, the benefits of the transaction to the Company, the potential effect of entering into the transaction on a director's independence, the availability of other sources for the products or services, the terms of the transaction and the terms available to unrelated third parties generally. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee has authority to administer the Policy and to amend it as appropriate from time to time.
For purposes of our Policy, "Related Party Transactions" are transactions in which the Company is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000 when all such transactions are aggregated with respect to an individual, and a "related party" had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. "Related parties" are our directors (including any nominees for election as directors), our executive officers, any shareholder who beneficially owns more than five percent (5%) of our outstanding common stock, and any firm, corporation, charitable organization or other entity in which any of the persons listed above is an officer, general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which the person has a beneficial ownership interest of ten percent (10%) or more.

BOARD AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS
Board Structure and Process
Board Leadership
Our Board has the flexibility to determine whether the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer should be separated or combined. The Board makes this decision based on its evaluation of the circumstances and the specific needs of the Company. Mr. Hyatt Brown, who retired from the position of Chief Executive Officer in 2009, continues to serve as Chairman of the Board, while Mr. Powell Brown serves as Chief Executive Officer.
We believe our leadership structure is desirable because it allows Mr. Powell Brown to focus his efforts on running our business and managing the Company in the best interests of our shareholders, while we continue to realize the benefits of Mr. Hyatt Brown's extensive business and industry experience, knowledge of our company, current and past service on boards of other publicly traded companies and proven leadership ability.
The Board conducts executive sessions of non-management directors in connection with each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board. Our Lead Independent Director, Wendell S. Reilly, presides over these executive sessions.
Board and Board Committee Matters
Our Board of Directors has an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. The charters of each of these Board committees are available in the "Corporate Governance" section of the "Investor Relations" tab, under "Key Documents" on our website (www.bbinsurance.com) and are also available in print to any shareholder who requests a copy from the Corporate Secretary at 220 S. Ridgewood Ave., Daytona Beach, Florida 32114. Our committee meetings are generally attended by all Board members, subject to the availability of each director, which we believe enables our Board to function in a more collaborative, transparent, and effective manner, and which we believe promotes collegiality among the Board.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Committee 
Members James S. Hunt (Chair) Hugh M. Brown Theodore J. Hoepner Toni Jennings Six Meetings Held in 2018 The Audit Committee is composed of independent directors as defined in the NYSE listed company manual and includes two audit committee financial experts, Theodore J. Hoepner and James S. Hunt, among its members. The duties of the Audit Committee are to recommend to the Board of Directors the selection of independent registered public accountants, to meet with our independent registered public accountants to review and discuss the scope and results of the annual audit, and to consider various accounting, auditing, and technology matters related to the Company, including our systems of internal controls and financial management practices. 
 Compensation Committee 
Members Toni Jennings (Chair),  Samuel P. Bell, III Theodore J. Hoepner James S. Hunt H. Palmer Proctor, Jr. Eight Meetings Held in 2018 Each member of the Compensation Committee is independent as defined in the NYSE listed company manual. The Compensation Committee sets the compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, and reviews and approves the compensation for our other executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers. See "Executive Compensation - Compensation Committee Report" and "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." The Compensation Committee also reviews, makes recommendations with respect to, and approves our existing and proposed compensation plans, and is responsible for administering our 1990 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, our 2008 Sharesave Plan, our Performance Stock Plan ("PSP"), which was suspended in April 2010, our ISO Plan, which expired December 31, 2008, our 2010 SIP and our 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, which is the subject of Proposal 4 described in this Proxy Statement ("2019 SIP"). The Compensation Committee is authorized by its charter to form and delegate authority to subcommittees when appropriate.

 Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee 
Members Wendell S. Reilly (Chair) Hugh M. Brown Bradley Currey, Jr. Chilton D. Varner Six Meetings Held in 2018 Each member of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is independent as defined in the NYSE listed company manual. This Committee's duties include responsibilities associated with corporate governance, as well as the nomination of persons to stand for election to the Board at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders and recommendation of nominees to the Board of Directors to fill vacancies on, or as additions to, the Board. 
[END TABLE]
Director Tenure and Board Refreshment
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee regularly considers the composition of the Board. However, we have not established a mandatory retirement age or other term limits because we believe longer-tenured directors can bring important experience and institutional knowledge that are critical to the success of our Board and the long-term interests of our shareholders. Consideration is given to rotating committee members, committee chairs, and the Lead Independent Director position every three to five years because we believe fresh perspectives facilitate enhanced Board and committee performance. Our Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee evaluates the performance of each incumbent director at least annually before recommending his or her nomination for an additional term. In addition, any director who has a job change must submit a letter of resignation resigning from the Board. The submission of a letter of resignation provides an opportunity for the Board to review the continued appropriateness of the director's membership on the Board under the circumstances.
Board Evaluations
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee conducts an annual evaluation of the Board and its committees, as well as the individual performance of each director. As part of this process, all directors complete detailed confidential questionnaires to provide feedback on the effectiveness of the Board, the committees and the performance of individual directors. The results of the questionnaires are compiled anonymously by the Chair of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee in the form of summaries, and the feedback is reviewed and discussed by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee and subsequently reported to the full Board. We believe these assessments allow us to continually improve the effectiveness of our Board and committee meetings throughout the year.
Meetings and Attendance
During 2018, our Board of Directors held seven meetings. Each incumbent director serving during 2018 attended 100% of the total number of Board meetings and 100% of the total number of meetings of committees of which such director is a member. The Board expects, but does not require, directors, all of whom are director nominees, to attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. All then-current members of the Board attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Director Compensation
2018 Director Compensation
During 2018, non-employee directors were paid an annual retainer of $80,000, payable in quarterly installments. In addition, the Chairs of the Audit and Compensation Committees are each paid a $10,000 retainer, and the Chairs of the Nominating/Corporate Governance and Acquisition Committees each receive a $6,000 retainer, for services associated with those positions. Also, each director who is not an employee of the Company received in January 2018 a grant of fully vested shares of our common stock under our 2010 SIP, valued at $70,000 as of the close of business on the last business day before the regular January meeting of the Compensation Committee. All directors receive reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with meetings of the Board. No director who is an employee receives separate compensation for services rendered as a director.

2018 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
2019 Director Compensation
Our Board of Directors reviews the compensation of our non-employee directors at least every two years or as such other time as circumstances may warrant. In January 2019, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook"), an independent outside compensation consulting firm retained by the Compensation Committee, conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Company's non-employee director compensation review, as described below.
Survey Comparison
As part of FW Cook's analysis, the Compensation Committee reviewed and considered data from the 2018 FW Cook Director Compensation Report, which consisted of data from a blend of general industry companies with market capitalizations between $1 and $5 billion and market capitalizations greater than $5 billion, and the 2017–2018 NACD Director Compensation Report, which consisted of data from general industry companies, as well as insurance companies, with annual revenues between $1 and $2.5 billion.
Results of FW Cook's Analysis
Based upon the results of FW Cook's analysis, the Compensation Committee concluded that:

Based upon FW's Cook's analysis and the Compensation Committee's recommendation, in January 2019, the Board approved the following changes to the compensation for our non-employee directors, effective immediately following the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders:
The Compensation Committee also determined that beginning in May 2019, the annual grant of fully vested common stock would be made at the Compensation Committee's regular second-quarter meeting to align with the commencement of each non-employee director's annual term on the Board.

One or more representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to be present at the Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders.
Vote Required; Board Recommendation
In order to be ratified, this Proposal 2 must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the Proposal. The Board of Directors believes that the ratification of Proposal 2 is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.

AUDIT MATTERS
Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors operates pursuant to an Audit Committee Charter, which was most recently reviewed by the Committee in October 2018. The Charter is posted on the Company's website (www.bbinsurance.com) in the "Corporate Governance" section of the "Investor Relations" tab, under "Key Documents."
Each member of the Audit Committee qualifies as "independent" (as that term is defined in the NYSE listed company manual, as well as other statutory, regulatory and other requirements applicable to the Company's Audit Committee members).
With respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements with management and the independent registered public accountants;  
2.  has discussed with the independent registered public accountants of the Company the matters required to be discussed by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including those described in Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees;  
3.  has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accountants required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accountants' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accountants the independent registered public accountants' independence; and  
4.  based on the review and discussions with management and the independent registered public accountants referenced above, recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
[END TABLE]
It is not the duty or responsibility of the Audit Committee to conduct auditing or accounting reviews or procedures. In performing its oversight responsibility, members of the Audit Committee rely without independent verification on the information provided to them and on the representations made by management and the independent registered public accountants. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions do not assure that the audit of the Company's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP").

   3  Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation At the Meeting, we will ask our shareholders to approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our shareholders the opportunity to express their views on our executive compensation.  The Board recommends a vote FOR the resolution to approve on a non-binding advisory basis the compensation of the named executive officers. 
   3  Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation At the Meeting, we will ask our shareholders to approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our shareholders the opportunity to express their views on our executive compensation.  The Board recommends a vote FOR the resolution to approve on a non-binding advisory basis the compensation of the named executive officers. 
[END TABLE]
As described in detail below under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate, and retain our Named Executive Officers, who are critical to our success. Accordingly, our Named Executive Officers are rewarded to the extent we achieve specific annual goals and deliver financial performance intended to increase long-term shareholder value.
Our Compensation Committee has adopted an approach to executive compensation that we believe enables the Company to retain its executive talent while remaining committed to our core compensation philosophy of paying for performance and aligning executive compensation with shareholder interests. The Committee continually reviews the compensation programs for our Named Executive Officers with the goal of most effectively aligning our executive compensation structure with our shareholders' interests and current market practices. For example, (1) a significant portion of pay is performance-based, (2) compensation is incentive-driven with both short- and long-term focus, and (3) we believe components of compensation are linked to increasing shareholder value.
We are again asking our shareholders to indicate their support for our executive officer compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our Named Executive Officers and the philosophy, program and practices described in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the SEC's compensation disclosure rules. Accordingly, we ask our shareholders to vote "FOR" the approval, on an advisory basis, of executive compensation.
The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or our Board. However, our Board and Compensation Committee value the opinions of our shareholders, and to the extent there is any significant vote against the executive compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our shareholders' concerns, and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.
Accordingly, we ask our shareholders to vote on the following resolution at the Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED."
Vote Required; Board Recommendation
In order to be approved, this Proposal 3 must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the Proposal. The Board of Directors believes that the advisory approval of Proposal 3 is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.

Executive Summary
Our Compensation Committee has responsibility for the design, implementation, and approval of the compensation of our executive officers. We seek to provide an executive compensation package that supports our business strategy and is driven by our overall financial performance, the success of the business segments and corresponding financial performance that are directly impacted by the executive's leadership, and the performance of the individual executive. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews, with the support of an independent compensation consultant, the pay practices of other companies with the goal of seeing that the Company's executive compensation program remains competitive, but does not target compensation decisions or levels to a specific percentile or other absolute measures related to comparison group data.
At last year's Annual Meeting of Shareholders, 99% of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory vote to approve executive compensation. In view of this favorable vote (as well as a similar favorable vote in 2017) and the success of our 2017 executive compensation policies in incentivizing results that were aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders, as well as other factors (including regulatory requirements, market considerations, and Company and individual performance), our executive compensation policies and practices were substantially unchanged from the prior year.
We believe our compensation system continues to effectively incentivize our executive officers to deliver results for the Company that are aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. As reflected in the table below, we delivered healthy Organic Revenue growth in 2018, but due to a shortfall in the Company's adjusted EBITDAC Margin, which was driven by the mix of our business, lower profit-sharing contingent commissions, increased non-cash stock-based compensation costs, and increased customer fulfillment costs, the annual cash incentives for our Named Executive Officers were calculated and paid below the target amounts:

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
In 2016, FW Cook conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Company's pay practices and executive compensation levels as compared to a group of the Company's peers (the "2016 Comparative Market Assessment"), as described below. In January 2018 and as a follow-up to the 2016 Comparative Market Assessment, FW Cook conducted an additional analysis of the Company's compensation levels for its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as compared to a group of the Company's peers (the "2018 Comparative Market Assessment"), as described below.
Proxy Comparison Group
For both the 2016 Comparative Market Assessment and the 2018 Comparative Market Assessment, FW Cook focused on our peers in the Russell 3000 of similar size, industry, and business characteristics. The other insurance intermediaries for which compensation data was publicly available—Aon plc, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co, Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. and Willis Towers Watson PLC—compete with us the most directly for talent. However, these publicly traded insurance intermediaries are significantly larger than we are in total assets, total revenue and market capitalization. Because of these differences in size, FW Cook also reviewed the compensation practices of nine publicly traded insurance carriers and several other companies in the capital markets industry. The proxy comparison group was as follows:
Survey Comparison
As part of the 2016 Comparative Market Assessment, the Compensation Committee also reviewed and considered data from the 2016 Towers Watson CDB General Industry Compensation survey.
Results of the 2016 and 2018 Comparative Market Assessments
Based upon the results of the 2016 Comparative Market Assessment, the Compensation Committee determined that, among other things, the total 2016 direct compensation for the Company's executive officers, which includes each executive officer's base salary, target cash incentive amount, and target long-term equity incentives, was generally aligned with the market blend median. However, the Compensation Committee also concluded that the Company's 2016 management service fee (MSF), which is the notional amount investors pay for a company to be managed, calculated as the aggregate 2016 target pay for the Company's five highest paid executive officers in 2015, was positioned in the 32nd percentile of the Company's peer group, while the Company's 2015 revenue was positioned in the 48th percentile of its peer group. The Compensation Committee believes that the evaluation of MSF is valuable to gain an understanding of the pay competitiveness of the Company's executive officers, regardless of position or tenure.
Based upon the results of FW Cook's analyses, the Compensation Committee applied the following market-rate pay adjustments for our Named Executive Officers for 2018 and 2019:

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Role of the Compensation Consultant
Beginning in August 2015, the Compensation Committee engaged FW Cook to assist with a review of the components, structure and design of the long-term equity incentive arrangements with our executive officers and other key employees. The primary goal of this engagement was to help design long-term equity incentive arrangements that continue to be competitive and aligned with shareholder interests. FW Cook has remained engaged by the Compensation Committee to advise and assist with other matters related to executive and non-employee director compensation. The Compensation Committee considers FW Cook to be independent because FW Cook performed no services for the Company's management unrelated to services performed for the Compensation Committee and there was no conflict of interest raised as a result of any work performed by FW Cook, directly or indirectly, for the Compensation Committee during fiscal years 2015-2018.
Role of Management
The Compensation Committee considers input from our Chief Executive Officer in making determinations regarding the compensation of our executive officers, other than our Chief Executive Officer. As part of the annual planning process, our Chief Executive Officer recommends, and presents to the Compensation Committee for consideration, base salary adjustments, framework and targets for our annual cash incentive program, and long-term equity incentive award amounts for our executive officers, other than our Chief Executive Officer. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer periodically presents to the Compensation Committee and the Board his evaluation of each executive officer's performance and reviews succession plans for each of our executive officers.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
2018 Annual Cash Incentives
Our annual cash incentives are designed to align executive officer compensation with our annual goals and objectives, and to create a direct link between compensation and financial and operational performance. During the first quarter of each year, the Compensation Committee approves the annual cash incentive components, consisting of financial performance measures, individual target cash incentive amounts, and personal objectives, for each executive officer, including the relative weightings and goals against which performance is measured and payouts are determined for such fiscal year.
Target Amounts. In February 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the 2018 target cash incentive amounts for the Named Executive Officers. Other than for Mr. Watts, whose target cash incentive amount for 2018 increased from $525,000 to $625,000, the Compensation Committee did not change the target cash incentive amounts for our Named Executive Officers. The decision to increase Mr. Watts' 2018 target cash incentive amount from $525,000 to $625,000 was based upon the recommendation of Mr. Powell Brown. Mr. Powell Brown's recommendation was based upon the comparative market assessment conducted by FW Cook and the fact that Mr. Watts' 2017 total direct compensation was only slightly higher than the 25th percentile of the peer group and that his 2017 target cash incentive was between the 25th and 50th percentile of the peer group.
For 2018, the aggregate target cash incentive amounts were: for Mr. Powell Brown, $1,400,000; for Mr. Watts, $625,000; for Mr. Penny, $800,000; for Mr. Strianese, $850,000 and for Mr. Walker, $900,000. Payouts can range from 0% to 200% of the aggregate target cash incentive depending on the financial performance of the Company or the segment, as applicable, and Named Executive Officer performance against personal objectives.
For 2018, the Compensation Committee selected the following components and weightings for the annual cash incentives for the Named Executive Officers:

[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The target amounts for each financial performance measure were discussed over several months and then reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee in February 2018. These target amounts were based on our 2018 budget, which was approved by the Board in January 2018, in order to ensure that our performance targets are rigorous and challenging, yet realistic for our executive officers. Our budget reflects a multi-month process that includes thorough and thoughtful discussions among management, and between management and our Board. In determining our 2018 budget, which served as the basis for the targets for each 2018 financial performance measure, consideration was given to, among other things:
For each financial performance measure, we make no payout for performance below a certain threshold. As part of our pay-for-performance framework, the Compensation Committee adopted payout curves that are intended to incentivize performance generally within a "target payout corridor" and that provide for incrementally higher and lower payouts for performance outside of the target payout corridor. Payout percentages for each financial performance measure were calculated based on the following tables:

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
With respect to the achievement of personal objectives by each of the Named Executive Officers, which accounts for 20% of the 2018 cash incentive amount for each Named Executive Officer except for Mr. Penny, and for 50% of the 2018 cash incentive amount for Mr. Penny, the Compensation Committee evaluated the level of achievement for each Named Executive Officer's personal objectives in January 2019. The evaluation for Mr. Powell Brown, our Chief Executive Officer, was made by the Compensation Committee. For the other Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee, after discussion, consideration and review, accepted without modification the recommendations as proposed by the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee evaluated the achievement of each Named Executive Officer's personal objectives in their totality instead of assigning a weight to each particular personal objective.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
As illustrated in the table below, the final 2018 cash incentive amounts were calculated by combining the payout amounts for each of the components discussed above and then rounding the resulting number up to the nearest thousand dollars:
While not exercised in 2018, the Compensation Committee expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reduce the annual cash incentive for any Named Executive Officer, or to pay no annual cash incentive at all, if the Company's performance is unexpectedly poor or if the intended recipient commits acts of malfeasance.
2018 Discretionary Bonuses
Each of the Named Executive Officers is eligible to receive an additional discretionary bonus upon such terms and conditions as might be determined by the Chief Executive Officer, subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee, or, in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, as might be determined by the Compensation Committee. None of our Named Executive Officers received a discretionary bonus for 2018.
2018 Equity Incentive Grants
We endeavor to make our long-term equity incentive arrangements competitive and aligned with shareholder interests, as reflected in the following structure:
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Based upon the recommendation of our Chief Executive Officer and, with respect to our Chief Executive Officer, based upon the Compensation Committee's annual evaluation of our Chief Executive Officer's performance, the following long-term equity incentive awards for our Named Executive Officers were approved by our Compensation Committee in February 2018:
2018 Equity Incentive Plan Outcomes
July 2013 Equity Incentive Grants. In July 2013, certain of our Named Executive Officers received grants of restricted stock under our 2010 SIP, which included a performance condition of vesting based upon the compounded annual growth rate ("CAGR") of our earnings per share, excluding the impact of the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables and any other items (for example, extraordinary, nonrecurring items) that the Compensation Committee determines to be appropriately disregarded for all grants subject to this vesting condition ("Adjusted EPS"). Under the applicable award agreements, this performance condition is satisfied for (i) two-thirds of the shares granted if our cumulative Adjusted EPS during the five-year performance period ending June 30, 2018 is at least $4.42 (i.e., a CAGR during the performance period of at least 7.5%), and (ii) one-third of the shares granted if our cumulative Adjusted EPS during the performance period is at least $4.75 (i.e., a CAGR during the performance period of at least 10%).
In August 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that our cumulative Adjusted EPS, which excluded the net pretax loss on disposal of the Axiom Re business in 2014 and which excluded the positive impact in 2017 of revaluing the Company's deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Reform Act"), during the performance period was $4.57 (i.e., the CAGR during the performance period was greater than 7.5%, but less than 10%), and, therefore, the performance condition was satisfied with respect to two-thirds of the granted shares, as follows: Mr. Powell Brown, 93,052 shares; Mr. Penny, 49,628 shares; Mr. Strianese, 49,628 shares; and Mr. Walker, 49,628. The Compensation Committee concluded that it was desirable to exclude from the calculation of Adjusted EPS (i) the net pretax loss on disposal of the Axiom Re business in 2014 because the sale of these assets was nonrecurring and in furtherance of the Company's strategic plan to exit the reinsurance business, and (ii) the positive impact of revaluing the Company's deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Reform Act in 2017 because it was non-recurring, not related to the performance of the Company, and a non-cash adjustment. Upon the Compensation Committee's certification of this performance condition, Messrs. Powell Brown, Penny, Strianese, and Walker gained dividend rights and voting entitlement with respect to these shares. Except in limited circumstances, one-half of these shares become fully vested in three equal installments on August 3, 2018, July 1, 2019, and July 1, 2020, respectively, and the other half of these shares become fully vested on July 1, 2020, provided, that in all cases, the grantee remains continuously employed by us until such dates.
See Annex A for additional information regarding Adjusted EPS, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, including a reconciliation to the most closely comparable GAAP financial measure.
2019 Compensation
As part of its ongoing evaluation of our executive officers' compensation and based, in part, on the recommendation of FW Cook, in early 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the framework for our executive officers' compensation for 2019, as described below.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
2019 Base Salaries
Other than for Mr. Walker, whose 2019 base salary increased from $500,000 to $650,000, the Compensation Committee did not increase the base salaries for the Named Executive Officers in 2019. The decision to increase Mr. Walker's 2019 base salary was based upon the recommendation of Mr. Powell Brown and accompanied by a decrease of $50,000 in Mr. Walker's 2019 long-term equity incentive award. Mr. Powell Brown's recommendation was based upon the comparative market assessment conducted by FW Cook and the fact that Mr. Walker's 2018 total direct compensation was 15% below the peer group median.
2019 Annual Cash Incentives
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee determined not to change the components of our annual executive officer cash incentives, the weighting of each component, or the target cash incentive amounts for our Named Executive Officers, except for Mr. Penny. For Mr. Penny, the Compensation Committee determined that because Mr. Penny would have more limited office-specific oversight in 2019 than in 2018, 25% of Mr. Penny's 2019 annual cash incentive would be based upon the Organic Revenue growth of the Company, rather than upon the Organic Revenue growth of certain specified offices.
2019 Equity Incentive Grants
Based upon the recommendation of our Chief Executive Officer and, with respect to our Chief Executive Officer, based upon the Compensation Committee's annual evaluation of our Chief Executive Officer's performance, as well as input from FW Cook, the following long-term equity incentive awards for our Named Executive Officers were approved by our Compensation Committee in February 2019:
Other Compensation
We also provide the following compensation and benefits to attract and retain key employees.
Benefits Generally
Along with all other full-time employees, each of the Named Executive Officers is eligible: (a) to receive matching contributions to the Company's 401(k) Plan; (b) to participate in the Company's 1990 Employee Stock Purchase Plan; (c) to participate in group medical, dental and other benefit plans; and (d) to the extent permitted by applicable law, for reimbursement of amounts earned by the Company on personal lines insurance such as homeowners and flood insurance purchased by such Named Executive Officer. Our 401(k) Plan provides for matching contributions of up to four percent (4.0%) of the contributions made by each participant. The 401(k) Plan also permits discretionary profit-sharing contributions, but the Company made no such contributions to the accounts of Named Executive Officers for 2018.
Dividend Payments on Unvested Stock Awards
The Named Executive Officers receive dividends on unvested shares granted pursuant to the Company's equity incentive compensation plans (i) that have exclusively time-based vesting requirements (e.g., time-based Restricted Stock Awards), or (ii) for which the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied in accordance with the applicable award agreements, but the time-based vesting requirements have not been satisfied (e.g., performance-based Performance Stock Awards).
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Deferred Compensation Plan
The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which provides the opportunity to defer receipt of up to 75% of base salary and up to 100% of cash incentive and bonus compensation. Participant deferrals are credited to the participant's deferral contribution account. The participant's account is credited with earnings based on the performance of the participant's investment allocation among a menu of investment options designated by the Company. The Company is permitted, but not required, to make matching contributions and other discretionary contributions under this plan. The Company made no matching or other discretionary contributions to the accounts of Named Executive Officers for 2018.
A participant's account under the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plan generally is distributed in a lump sum or installments upon the participant's retirement, other termination of employment or death. However, in some circumstances (including hardship) all or a portion of the participant's deferral account may be distributed on one or more specified dates prior to termination of employment. Participants elect at the time of deferral to have the distributions made in a lump sum or annual installments.
Personal Benefits
Certain golf or social club membership dues paid by the Named Executive Officers who have responsibility for the entertainment of clients, prospective clients and principals of acquisition prospects are reimbursed by the Company or paid on behalf of the Named Executive Officer. Additionally, the Company reimburses the costs of annual physical examinations that are not otherwise covered by insurance, car service expenses, and for certain financial and tax planning services for each of the Named Executive Officers.
Policy on Tax Deductibility
The deductibility of compensation payments can depend upon numerous factors, including the nature of the payment and the time that income is recognized under various plans, agreements, and programs. Interpretations of, and changes in, applicable tax laws and regulations as well as other factors beyond the control of the Compensation Committee also can affect the deductibility of compensation. The Compensation Committee considers the anticipated tax treatment of the Company's compensation programs and payments, including the potential impact of Section 162(m) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Section 162(m) disallows a tax deduction for any publicly held corporation for individual compensation exceeding one million dollars in any taxable year for certain executive officers. Before the effective date of the Tax Reform Act, which was signed into law in December 2017, amounts in excess of one million dollars were deductible if they qualified as performance-based compensation under a plan that was approved by the shareholders and that met certain other technical requirements. With respect to awards made before the Tax Reform Act, our general policy was to try to deliver equity-based compensation to employees in as tax-efficient a manner as possible, taking into consideration the overall cost to the Company. However, because our interests and our shareholders' interests may sometimes be best served by providing compensation that is not deductible in order to attract and retain high-quality people that are crucial to both the short-term and long-term success of the Company, the Compensation Committee has determined at this time to retain the flexibility to provide for compensation that is not deductible.
As a result of Tax Reform Act, the exemption from the Section 162(m) deduction limit for performance-based compensation has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Therefore, compensation paid to our covered executive officers in excess of one million dollars is not deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. Also, the Tax Reform Act expands the number of individuals covered by the Section 162(m) deduction limit. We will continue to monitor the pre-2018 equity-based awards and endeavor to preserve the deductibility of such awards if and when they are paid. Despite the Compensation Committee's efforts to structure these awards in a manner intended to be exempt from the Section 162(m) deduction limit, because of uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) after the Tax Reform Act, including the uncertain scope of the transition relief provided by the legislation, no assurance can be given that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption from Section 162(m) will do so. In addition, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are consistent with the Company's business needs.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
With the exception of Mr. Walker and Mr. Watts, all of the Named Executive Officers have employment agreements with the Company that include change-in-control provisions. The terms of our employment agreements with our Named Executive Officers are described below in the section titled "Employment and Deferred Compensation Agreements."
The 2010 SIP provides for double-trigger vesting under which all participants, including all of the Named Executive Officers, would become vested in the following amounts if the participant's service with us is involuntarily or constructively terminated (other than for specified causes, as set forth in the 2010 SIP) within 12 months after a "Transfer of Control" as defined in the 2010 SIP:
For information concerning the value of the vested shares that each of the Named Executive Officers would have under the 2010 SIP in the event that termination of employment after "Transfer of Control" had occurred on the last business day of 2018, please see the table titled "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control - 2018" below.
The PSP (which was terminated in 2010) provides that all outstanding grants of PSP stock shall become fully vested and non-forfeitable in the event of: (i) the Company's entry into any agreement to sell all or substantially all of its assets or to enter into any merger, consolidation, reorganization, division or other corporate transaction in which Company stock is converted into another security or into the right to receive securities or property, where such agreement does not provide for the assumption or substitution of PSP stock; (ii) any tender or exchange offer for the Company's stock accepted by a majority of the shareholders of the Company; or (iii) the death of J. Hyatt Brown and the subsequent sale by his estate, his wife, his lineal descendants, any trust created for his benefit during his lifetime, or any combination of the foregoing, of the Company stock owned by J. Hyatt Brown prior to his death. The PSP further provides that if any shares of PSP stock become fully vested and non-forfeitable because of the occurrence of these events, the Company shall pay to the holders of such shares, within 60 days of the occurrence of such event, the full amount of any federal and state income tax liability incurred by such holder as a result of such vesting, including, without limitation, any excise tax with respect to such vesting (e.g., under Internal Revenue Code Section 4999 and any successor provision) as well as the amount of any tax liability with respect to such "gross-up" payment. This excise tax gross-up provision is a legacy provision that applies only to awards that were granted under the PSP prior to its suspension in 2010, and no new agreements that contain excise tax gross-up provisions have been entered into, and no previous agreements containing such legacy provisions have been materially amended. Additionally, the PSP provides that in the event of any "Change in Control" (as defined in the PSP, and excluding the triggering events described above), the Board thereafter shall have the right to take such action with respect to any shares of PSP stock that are forfeitable, or all such shares of PSP stock, as the Board in its discretion deems appropriate under the circumstances to protect the interests of the Company in maintaining the integrity of the awards under the PSP. The PSP further states that the Board shall have the right to take different action with respect to different "Key Employees" (as defined in the PSP) or different groups of "Key Employees," as the Board in its discretion deems appropriate under the circumstances. For information concerning the value of the vested PSP stock that each of the Named Executive Officers would have in the event that one of the triggering events described above occurred on the last business day of 2018, please see the table titled "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control - 2018" below.
Employment and Deferred Compensation Arrangements
Messrs. Powell Brown, Penny, and StrianeseThe Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Watts and Mr. Walker, entered into new employment agreements with the Company in 2014, replacing previous employment agreements that had different terms. Compensation under these agreements is not specified, but rather is to be agreed upon between us and the executive from time to time. See the section titled, "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" for information concerning the considerations affecting the compensation of the Named Executive Officers. The agreements include a provision that states that in the event of a "Change in Control," defined as a circumstance in which the holders of more than 50% of the voting stock of the Company before the transaction
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
closes hold less than 50% of the voting stock of the Company after the transaction closes, if the resulting entity employs executives with duties similar in character, classification or responsibilities to Executive's, the Agreement shall be deemed modified to provide Executive with "equivalent terms and benefits to those of similar executives." The new employment agreements include, among other provisions, restrictive covenants prohibiting the solicitation or diversion of business or employees for a period of two years following voluntary or involuntary separation from employment, and also prohibit disclosure of confidential information. These agreements may be terminated by either party at any time, with or without cause or advance notice.
Mr. WalkerMr. Walker entered into an employment agreement with the Company effective January 9, 2012, in connection with our acquisition of Arrowhead General Insurance Agency, Inc. The agreement may be terminated by either party at any time, with or without cause or advance notice. Compensation under the agreement is at an amount agreed upon between us and Mr. Walker from time to time, and for a period of two years following the termination of employment, the agreement prohibits Mr. Walker from directly or indirectly soliciting or servicing our clients, or soliciting our employees to leave their employment with us.
Mr. WattsIn connection with his hiring in 2014, Mr. Watts and the Company entered into an employment agreement with an initial term that ended on February 17, 2017 (the "Term"), pursuant to which, among other things, Mr. Watts: (1) received a stock grant with a grant date fair value of $250,002 that fully vested on February 17, 2019 (i.e. five years after the date of grant); (2) received a stock grant with a grant date fair value of $474,991 that fully vested on February 17, 2017 (i.e., three years after the date of grant); and (3) received a stock grant with grant date fair value of $800,020, which included a five-year, performance-based vesting condition that the Compensation Committee determined in February 2019 was achieved and which will vest in years five, six, and seven, subject to continuous employment through the applicable vesting dates. Following the conclusion of the Term on February 17, 2017, the terms of the employment agreement continued in effect, except that the agreement may now be terminated by either party at any time, with or without cause or advance notice. Compensation under the agreement is at an amount agreed upon between us and Mr. Watts from time to time, and for a period of two years following the termination of employment, the agreement prohibits Mr. Watts from directly or indirectly soliciting or servicing our clients, or soliciting our employees to leave their employment with us.
The above descriptions of our employment agreements with our Named Executive Officers are summaries and are qualified by reference to the copies of such agreements that have been filed as exhibits to our SEC filings as follows:
Hedging and Pledging Policies; Stock Ownership Requirements; Clawback Policy
The Board has adopted policies prohibiting the hedging (as defined below) of our stock by directors, executive officers, and other members of our Senior Leadership Team and prohibiting the pledging of our stock by directors, as well prohibiting the pledging of our stock held pursuant to our stock ownership requirements by our executive officers and other members of our Senior Leadership Team. For the purposes of this policy, "hedging" includes engaging in short sales of Company stock and engaging in hedging transaction in publicly traded options that are based on the trading price of Company stock, such as puts, calls and other derivative securities. Our stock ownership requirements provide that members of the Company's Senior Leadership Team must accumulate Company stock valued at the following multiples of their base salaries within three years of hire or promotion, and retain such stock until retirement, separation from employment, or removal from one of the categories set forth below:

[END TABLE]
In addition, each non-employee director is required to accumulate Brown & Brown common stock valued at least four times the current annual cash retainer within four years of joining the Board.
The Board has adopted a policy that provides for the clawback of certain performance-based compensation in the event of a restatement of the Company's financial results, other than a restatement caused by a change in applicable accounting rules or interpretations. Under the policy, if any performance-based equity or non-equity compensation paid to a current or former officer of the Company in the three years prior to the date of restatement would have been a lower amount had it been calculated based on the restated results, the Board's Compensation Committee will evaluate recovery of such performance-based equity or non-equity compensation. If a recovery is determined to be appropriate, then the Compensation Committee will seek to recover, for the benefit of the Company and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the after-tax portion of the difference between the previously awarded compensation and the recalculated compensation.
In determining whether to seek recovery under the Company's clawback policy, the Compensation Committee will take into account such considerations as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, whether the assertion of a claim may violate applicable law or prejudice the interests of the Company in any related proceeding or investigation, and the likelihood of success under applicable law.

We determined that, as of December 31, 2017, our employee population consisted of approximately 8,614 full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees, with 8,565 of these individuals located in the United States, 37 of these individuals located in the United Kingdom, three of these individuals located in Canada, and nine of these individuals located in Bermuda. 
2.  As permitted by SEC rules, we chose to exclude all of the non-U.S. employees described from the determination of the "median employee" because they account for less than 5% of our total employees. Our employee population, after taking into consideration this adjustment, consisted of approximately 8,565 individuals. 
3.  To identify the "median employee" from our employee population, we compared the amount of compensation of our employees as reflected in our payroll records as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for 2017. In making this determination, we annualized the compensation of approximately 1,781 permanent employees (full-time and part-time) who were hired in 2017, but did not work for us for the entire fiscal year. Since we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to our employees, the grant date fair values of such awards were excluded from our compensation measure. Fewer than 10% of our employees receive annual equity awards. 
4.  We identified our median employee using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all our employees included in the calculation. We did not make any cost-of living adjustments in identifying the "median employee." 
5.  We determined there was no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements during the last completed fiscal year that we believe would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure for 2018. Accordingly, we used the same median employee we identified in 2017 for purposes of calculating our pay ratio disclosure for 2018. 
6.  Once we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $66,650. The difference between such employee's annual total compensation and such employee's Form W-2 compensation represents $2,554 in matching contributions made by the Company to such employee's 401(k) Plan account. 
7.  With respect to the annual total compensation of Mr. Powell Brown, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of the Summary Compensation Table.

   4  The Approval of the Company's 2019 Stock Incentive Plan On March 18, 2019, the Board approved the Company's 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2019 SIP"), subject to shareholder approval. Therefore, the 2019 SIP will not become effective if the shareholders do not approve it.  The Board recommends a vote FOR this proposal. 
   4  The Approval of the Company's 2019 Stock Incentive Plan On March 18, 2019, the Board approved the Company's 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2019 SIP"), subject to shareholder approval. Therefore, the 2019 SIP will not become effective if the shareholders do not approve it.  The Board recommends a vote FOR this proposal. 
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that the Company's use of equity incentives is an integral part of our compensation program, and that grants of equity-based compensation are an essential factor in attracting and retaining effective and capable teammates who contribute to the growth and success of the Company, and in establishing a direct link between the financial interests of our teammates and our shareholders.
Vote Required; Board Recommendation
In order to pass, this Proposal 4 must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the Proposal. The Board of Directors believes that the approval of Proposal 4 is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
In General
The Company's 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2010 SIP") was initially approved by the Board of Directors and shareholders in 2010 and replaced the Company's Performance Stock Plan (the "PSP"). The terms of the 2010 SIP provide that the 2010 SIP will terminate in March 2020. As of February 25, 2019, the record date for the Meeting, there were 7,145,034 shares of our common stock available for future grants under the 2010 SIP.
In light of the upcoming expiration of the 2010 SIP in 2020, the Board of Directors on March 18, 2019 approved the adoption of the 2019 SIP, a copy of which appears as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. The adoption of the 2019 SIP is subject to approval by the Company's shareholders. The Board believes that it is desirable that shareholders approve the 2019 SIP, which authorizes the issuance of up to (i) 2,283,475 shares, plus (ii) the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2010 SIP that are not subject to awards outstanding or previously issued as of the effective date of the 2019 SIP, plus (iii) shares added to the reserve in connection with the expiration, forfeiture or termination of outstanding awards under the 2010 SIP and the PSP. If the 2019 SIP is approved, no further awards will be made under the 2010 SIP.
Summary of Outstanding Awards under Our Equity Compensation Plans
A summary of the number of shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2010 SIP and the PSP as of December 31, 2018, is as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Of this amount, the payout for 1,770,134 shares may be increased up to 200% of the target or decreased to zero, subject to the level of performance attained. The amount reflected in the table includes all restricted stock grants at a target payout of 100%. 
[END TABLE]
With respect to the outstanding restricted stock grants, 80% are performance-based grants that include additional time-based vesting conditions. The measurement periods for the performance conditions that must be satisfied for the awarding of these grants range from three to five years, and the additional time-based conditions require at least five years, and as many as 20 years, of service for full vesting of the awarded grants.

Shareholder-Friendly Features of the 2019 SIP
We endeavor to ensure that the design and administration of the 2019 SIP drive long-term shareholder value and are consistent with the policies and limitations recommended by independent shareholder advisory groups, such as Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"). One of the most significant aspects of the ISS evaluation of the proposed new plan is the projected cost or "shareholder value transfer" of the 2019 SIP relative to the Company's market and industry peers. This shareholder value transfer design and evaluation takes into account all of the Company's outstanding restricted stock grants under the 2010 SIP and the PSP, referred to as "overhang." Under the ISS analysis, a high overhang increases the projected shareholder value transfer cost of the available shares under a plan like the 2019 SIP. As a result of the relatively lengthy service conditions that the Company has applied to performance-based awards granted under the PSP and the 2010 SIP, our overhang is significantly higher than it would be if we granted shares subject to shorter vesting periods or granted shares that become vested immediately upon satisfaction of performance conditions. Therefore, our emphasis on both pay-for-performance and long-term employee retention in the design of our restricted stock grants creates more "overhang" and therefore limits the number of additional shares we are able to propose to the shareholders within the policies recommended by ISS.

Shares Available for Future Grant
Based on the proposed shares to be available for grants under the 2019 SIP and the outstanding awards under the 2010 SIP and the PSP as of December 31, 2018, if the shareholders approve the adoption of the 2019 SIP, the number of shares subject to outstanding awards and available for future grants would be as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Of this amount, the payout for 1,770,134 shares may be increased up to 200% of the target or decreased to zero, subject to the level of performance attained. The amount reflected in the table is calculated assuming the maximum payout for all restricted stock grants. 
[END TABLE]
Based on the 279,583,006 shares outstanding on December 31, 2018, this total number of shares subject to outstanding awards and available for future grants under the 2019 SIP, if the shareholders approve the adoption of the 2019 SIP, would be 7.69% of the fully diluted outstanding shares.

Description of the 2019 SIP
The principal terms of the 2019 SIP are summarized below. This summary is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the 2019 SIP, which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A.
Overview. The purpose of the 2019 SIP is to attract, incentivize and retain our key employees by offering those persons an opportunity to acquire or increase a direct proprietary interest in our operations and future success.
Shares Subject to the 2019 SIP. Subject to adjustment upon a change in capitalization, the number of shares of the Company's common stock that may be subject to awards under the 2019 SIP cannot exceed (i) 2,283,475 shares, plus (ii) the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2010 SIP that are not subject to awards outstanding or previously issued as of the effective date of the 2019 SIP, plus (iii) certain additional shares recaptured from expired, terminated, canceled, or forfeited portions of awards under the 2010 SIP and the PSP. If any portion of an outstanding award under the 2019 SIP, the 2010 SIP or the PSP for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled or forfeited, the shares allocable to the expired, terminated, canceled, or forfeited portion of such award shall be available for issuance under the 2019 SIP. However, the following shares are not available for issuance under the 2019 SIP: shares tendered as payment for option exercises, shares withheld to cover tax withholding requirements and shares that have been repurchased by the Company using stock option exercise proceeds. As of February 25, 2019, 7,145,034 shares were available for future grants under the 2010 SIP (assuming the maximum payout for all restricted stock grants), and a total of 13,247,237 shares were subject to outstanding equity awards under the 2010 SIP and PSP, assuming a target payout of all unawarded shares of 100%. Of these 13,247,237 shares, the payout for 1,668,220 shares of our outstanding performance-based restricted stock grants may be increased up to 200% of the target or decreased to zero, subject to the level of performance attained. The shares issued by the Company under the 2010 SIP
Table of Contents may be, at the Company's option, evidenced by a share certificate delivered to the grantee, or other physical or electronic evidence of share ownership, including, without limitation, deposit of shares into a stock brokerage account maintained for the grantee or credit to a book-entry account for the benefit of the grantee maintained by the Company's stock transfer agent or its designee.
Eligibility. All employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, and all members of the Board, are eligible to participate in the 2019 SIP. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 9,630 employees and 11 non-employee directors who were eligible to participate in the 2019 SIP.
Administration. The Compensation Committee has authority to grant awards to employees under the 2019 SIP and is responsible for the general administration and interpretation of the 2019 SIP. The 2019 SIP provides that members of the Compensation Committee have a right to indemnification with respect to claims arising against them individually as a result of their administration of the 2019 SIP, except in the case of gross negligence, bad faith or intentional misconduct. The Compensation Committee has authority to establish the terms of each award, including the number of awards granted, the vesting schedule and exercisability. The Compensation Committee may establish performance goals as a prerequisite to exercisability or vesting, and such goals and other terms need not be uniform among various participants. Each employee or director granted awards under the 2019 SIP will be required to enter into an award agreement with the Company setting forth the terms and conditions of the grant, including any performance goals that are a prerequisite to exercising or vesting of the grant. The Board may, in its discretion, make a limited delegation of authority to the Company's Chief Executive Officer to grant awards under the 2019 SIP to individuals who are not subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Types of Awards Available for Grant under the 2019 SIP
Options. Options granted under the 2019 SIP may be either "incentive stock options," as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or non-qualified stock options.
As a general rule, the exercise price for any stock option must be no less than the fair market value of the stock subject to such option as of the date of grant, except for incentive stock options granted to a grantee who owns 10% or more of the voting power of the Company, in which case the exercise price must be at least 110% of the fair market value of such stock as of the date of grant. To the extent that the fair market value of that portion of any grant of incentive stock options that is exercisable for the first time in any given year exceeds $100,000, such options will be treated as non-qualified stock options.
Options granted under the 2019 SIP generally will not be exercisable after the expiration of 10 years after the effective date of the grant. In addition, no incentive stock option granted to a beneficial owner of 10% or more of the Company's outstanding shares will be exercisable after the expiration of five years after the effective date of the grant.
Generally, options may be exercised only while the award holder is an employee or director of the Company or within a limited period after the award holder leaves employment or service with the Company or after the award holder's retirement, disability or death. During the award holder's lifetime, an award is exercisable only by the award holder. Awards generally are not transferable except upon the death of the award holder.
On the date of exercise, the award holder may pay the full option price in cash, in shares of common stock previously acquired by the award holder valued at fair market value or in any other form of consideration approved by the Compensation Committee. The use of previously acquired shares to pay the option price enables the award holder to avoid the need to fund the entire purchase with cash. Upon exercise of an award, the number of shares subject to the option and the number of shares available under the 2019 SIP for future option grants will be reduced by the number of shares with respect to which the option is exercised.
Stock Appreciation Rights. The Compensation Committee also may grant stock appreciation rights that will entitle the award recipient to receive the excess of the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock over the exercise price for each share with respect to which the stock appreciation right is exercised. Payment upon exercise of a stock appreciation right may be in cash, shares or a combination of cash and shares, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
Restricted Stock. The Compensation Committee also may grant awards in the form of shares of the Company's common stock that are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on transferability in such amounts and upon such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee specifies in the award agreement. The restricted stock award agreement shall set forth the
Table of Contents conditions, if any, which will need to be timely satisfied before the restricted stock grant will be effective, and the conditions, if any, which will need to be timely satisfied before the restricted stock grant will be vested and settled, and the conditions, if any, under which the grantee's interest in the shares will be forfeited. Any such conditions for effectiveness or vesting and settlement or nonforfeitability may be based upon the passage of time and continued service by the grantee, or the achievement of specified performance objectives, or both time-based and performance-based conditions.
Restricted Stock Units. The Compensation Committee also may grant awards in the form of units representing rights to receive shares in such amounts and upon such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee specifies in the award agreement, including forfeiture and other restrictions. The restricted stock unit award agreement shall set forth the conditions, if any, which will need to be timely satisfied before the restricted stock unit award will be effective, and the conditions, if any, which will need to be timely satisfied before the restricted stock units will be vested and settled, and the conditions, if any, under which the grantee's interest in the related units will be forfeited. Any such conditions for effectiveness or vesting and settlement or nonforfeitability may be based upon the passage of time and continued service by the Grantee, or the achievement of specified performance objectives, or both time-based and performance-based conditions.
Other Stock-Based Awards. The Compensation Committee also may grant other stock-based awards in such forms and in such amounts and upon such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee specifies in the award agreement. Other stock-based awards are valued based on shares of the Company's common stock. The other stock-based award agreement shall set forth the conditions, if any, which will need to be timely satisfied before the award will be effective, and the conditions, if any, which will need to be timely satisfied before the award will be vested and settled, and the conditions, if any, under which the grantee's interest in the award will be forfeited. Any such conditions for effectiveness or vesting and settlement or nonforfeitability may be based upon the passage of time and continued service by the Grantee, or the achievement of specified performance objectives, or both time-based and performance-based conditions.
Performance-Based Awards. The Compensation Committee may grant options, SARs, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other stock-based awards for which the amount, awarding, vesting, or settlement is contingent on the achievement of specific performance goals during a performance period, determined using a specific performance measure, all as specified in the award agreement. The performance goals and performance period will be established by the Compensation Committee. In establishing performance goals, the Compensation Committee may use performance measures based on any one or combination of performance criteria selected by the Compensation Committee. Although examples of certain performance measures are listed in the 2019 SIP, the Compensation Committee may use any performance measure that it determines to be appropriate. Performance may be measured on an absolute or relative basis and are related to the performance of the Company, a subsidiary, the grantee, the segment, department, or function within the Company or subsidiary in which the grantee is employed, a region, a product-line, or any other manner that the Compensation Committee determines appropriate in its discretion.
The Compensation Committee may adjust performance goals and the related level of achievement if the Compensation Committee determines in its discretion that events or transactions that are unusual in nature or infrequently occurring have occurred after the date of grant that are unrelated to the performance of the grantee and result in distortion of the performance targets or the related level of achievement. The Compensation Committee may provide in the applicable award agreement additional rules and procedures relating to its ability to adjust aspects of a performance-based award, its ability to increase or decrease the amount of compensation provided by a performance-based award, and the certification or other determination of the extent to which performance goals have or have not been attained.
Adjustment for Certain Events. If the Company undergoes certain events or changes regarding its capital structure, such as a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, reclassification or a similar event, appropriate adjustments will be made to the number and class of shares available for issuance under the 2019 SIP and the number and class of shares and, if applicable, exercise price relating to any outstanding awards. Appropriate adjustments would also be made if a majority of the shares which are the same class as the shares that are subject to outstanding awards are exchanged for, converted into, or otherwise become shares of another corporation. If such an event occurs, the Compensation Committee will amend the outstanding awards to provide that such awards are exercisable or will be settled for or with respect to such new shares.
Minimum Vesting. Except with respect to a maximum of 5% of the shares subject to the 2019 SIP, and except for a provision in the 2019 SIP or an individual award agreement for an acceleration of vesting in the event of the death or disability of the grantee or termination of the grantee's employment after a change in control, no award will provide for vesting that is any more rapid than vesting on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant.
Table of Contents
Effect of Change in Control. In the event of the involuntary or constructive termination of an award holder's employment after a change in control transaction, as defined in the 2019 SIP, the vesting of any outstanding award that is subject to a time-based vesting schedule will be accelerated, and the vesting of any outstanding performance-based award will be accelerated based on the greater of the performance goal(s) target or the actual level of achievement of the applicable performance goal(s) from the first day of the performance period to the date on which the change in control occurs.
No Repricing. The Compensation Committee may not modify or amend any outstanding option or stock appreciation right so as to specify a lower exercise price or accept the surrender of an outstanding option or stock appreciation right and authorize the granting of a new option or stock appreciation right with a lower exercise price in substitution for such surrendered option or stock appreciation right.
Application of Clawback Policy to 2019 SIP Awards. In the event of a restatement of the Company's financial results (other than a restatement caused by a change in applicable accounting rules or interpretations), if any performance-based award paid to a current or former officer of the Company (as defined under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act) in the three years prior to the date of restatement would have been a lower amount had it been calculated based on such restated results, the Compensation Committee shall evaluate recovery of such award. If a recovery is determined to be appropriate, then the Compensation Committee shall seek to recover for the benefit of the Company, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the after-tax portion of the difference between the awarded compensation and the actual compensation. In determining whether to seek recovery under this policy, the Compensation Committee shall take into account such considerations as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, whether the assertion of a claim may violate applicable law or prejudice the interests of the Company in any related proceeding or investigation, and the likelihood of success under applicable law.
Amendment or Termination of the 2019 SIP. Except as may be required by law, the Compensation Committee may terminate or amend the 2019 SIP at any time without further shareholder or regulatory approval. However, no termination or amendment of the 2019 SIP may adversely affect any then outstanding option without the consent of the award holder. Unless earlier terminated by the Compensation Committee, the 2019 SIP will be in effect until options have been granted and exercised with respect to all shares available for the 2019 SIP. However, no award can be granted under the 2019 SIP more than 10 years after the 2019 SIP has been approved by the Company's shareholders.
Tax Consequences
The federal income tax consequences of participation in the 2019 SIP are complex and subject to change. The following discussion is only a summary of the general tax rules applicable to the 2019 SIP.
Options. Options granted under the 2019 SIP may be either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. Options that are designated as incentive stock options are intended to qualify as such under Section 422 of the Code. With respect to incentive stock options, neither the grant nor the exercise of the option will subject the employee to taxable income, other than under the Alternative Minimum Tax (Section 56(b)(3) of the Code), which is not discussed in detail in this summary. There is no required tax withholding in connection with the exercise of incentive stock options. Upon the ultimate disposition of the stock obtained on an exercise of an incentive stock option, the employee's entire gain will be taxed at the rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided the employee has satisfied the prescribed holding periods relating to incentive stock options and the underlying stock. This treatment will apply to the entire amount of gain recognized on the sale of the stock, including the portion of gain that reflects the spread on the date of exercise between the fair market value of the stock at the time of grant and the fair market value of the stock at the time of exercise.
The Company does not receive a compensation deduction for tax purposes with respect to incentive stock options. However, if the employee disposes of the stock purchased on exercise of the incentive stock option prior to the expiration of the applicable holding periods required by Section 422 of the Code, the Company will be entitled to a deduction equal to the employee's realization of ordinary income by virtue of the employee's disqualifying disposition.
Non-qualified stock options granted under the 2019 SIP will not qualify for any special tax benefits to the option holder. An option holder generally will not recognize any taxable income at the time he or she is granted a non-qualified option. However, upon its exercise, the option holder will recognize ordinary income for federal tax purposes measured by the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise over the exercise price. The income realized by the option holder will be subject to income and other employee withholding taxes.
Table of Contents
The option holder's basis for determination of gain or loss upon the subsequent disposition of shares acquired upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option will be the amount paid for such shares plus any ordinary income recognized as a result of the exercise of such option. Upon disposition of any shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, the difference between the sale price and the option holder's basis in the shares will be treated as a capital gain or loss and generally will be characterized as long-term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year at the time of their disposition.
In general, there will be no federal income tax deduction allowed to the Company upon the grant or termination of a non-qualified stock option or a sale or disposition of the shares acquired upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option. However, upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option by a holder, the Company will be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income that an option holder is required to recognize as a result of the exercise, provided that the deduction is not otherwise disallowed under the Code.
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Stock Appreciation Rights. With respect to restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights that may be settled either in cash or in shares that are either transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the grantee will realize ordinary taxable income, subject to tax withholding, equal to the amount of the cash or the fair market value of the shares received. The Company will be entitled to a deduction in the same amount and at the same time as the compensation income is received by the grantee. With respect to restricted stock award shares that are both nontransferable and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the award recipient will realize ordinary taxable income equal to the fair market value of the shares at the first time the shares are either transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. The Company will be entitled to a deduction in the same amount and at the same time as the ordinary taxable income realized by the grantee.
Some awards, such as restricted stock unit awards, may be considered to be deferred compensation subject to special federal income tax rules under Section 409A of the Code. Failure to satisfy the applicable requirements under Section 409A of the Code for such awards would result in the acceleration of income and additional income tax liability to the grantee, including certain penalties. The 2019 SIP and awards under the 2019 SIP are intended to be designed and administered so that any awards that are considered to be deferred compensation will not result in negative tax consequences to the grantees under Section 409A of the Code.
All of the above-described deductions are subject to the limitations on deductibility described in Section 162(m) of the Code. Therefore, there can be no assurance that compensation attributable to 2019 SIP awards will be fully deductible under all circumstances. In addition, as a result of the provisions of Section 280G of the Code, compensation paid to certain employees resulting from vesting of awards in connection with a change in control of the Company also may not be deductible.
The foregoing is only a summary of the effect of federal income taxation upon the award recipient and the Company with respect to the grant and exercise of awards under the 2019 SIP, does not purport to be complete and does not discuss the tax consequences of the recipient's death or the income tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which a recipient may reside.
New Plan Benefits
All awards under the 2019 SIP will be made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Therefore, the benefits and amounts that will be received or allocated under the 2019 SIP in the future are not determinable at this time.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our directors, executive officers, and persons who own more than ten percent (10%) of our outstanding shares of common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.
Based solely on our review of such reports and written representations from reporting persons, we believe that during 2018, our directors, officers and 10% beneficial owners timely complied with all applicable filing requirements.

OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Voting Your Shares; Required Votes
Shares represented by duly executed proxies in the accompanying form that we receive prior to the Meeting will be voted at the Meeting. If you specify in the proxy a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the shares represented by such proxy will be voted as specified. If your proxy card is signed and returned without specifying a vote or an abstention, the shares represented by such proxy will be voted according to the recommendation of the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors knows of no other matters that may be brought before the Meeting. However, if any other matters are properly presented for action, it is the intention of the named proxies to vote on them according to their best judgment.
If your shares are held in "street name" a stock brokerage account, or by a bank or other nominee, you have the right to provide instructions on voting as requested by your broker, bank or nominee. Under the NYSE's rules, your broker, bank or nominee is permitted to vote your shares on the second proposal concerning the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 even if your broker, bank or nominee has not been given specific voting instructions as to this matter. Your broker, bank or nominee is not permitted to vote your shares on the first, third or fourth proposals.
After you have returned a proxy, you may revoke it at any time before it is voted by taking one of the following actions: (i) giving written notice of the revocation to our Corporate Secretary at 220 S. Ridgewood Ave., Daytona Beach, Florida 32114, or by email to annualmeeting@bbins.com; (ii) executing and delivering a proxy with a later date; or (iii) voting in person at the Meeting. Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Meeting will be tabulated by Alliance Advisors, LLC, and by one or more inspectors of election appointed at the Meeting, who will also determine whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business. A quorum is present when a majority in interest of all the common stock outstanding is represented by shareholders present in person or by proxy.
Shares of the common stock represented by proxies received by the Company (whether through the return of the enclosed proxy card, by telephone or over the Internet), where the shareholder has specified his or her choice with respect to the proposals described in this Proxy Statement (including the election of directors), will be voted in accordance with the specification(s) so made. If your proxy is properly executed but does not contain voting instructions, or if you vote via telephone or the Internet without indicating how you want to vote with respect to any item, your shares will be voted "FOR" the election of all nominees for the Board of Directors; "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; "FOR" the advisory vote to approve Named Executive Officer compensation; and "FOR" the approval of the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan.
A valid proxy also gives the individuals named as proxies authority to vote in their discretion when voting the shares on any other matters that are properly presented for action at the Meeting.
If the shares you own are held in "street name" by a broker or other nominee entity and you provide instructions to the broker or nominee as to how to vote your shares, your broker or other nominee entity, as the record holder of your shares, is required to vote your shares according to your instructions. Under the NYSE rules, certain proposals, such as the ratification of the appointment of the Company's registered public accountants, are considered "routine" matters, and brokers and other nominee entities generally may vote on such matters on behalf of beneficial owners who have not furnished voting instructions. For "non-routine" matters, such as the election of directors, the "say on pay" advisory vote and the approval of the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan, brokers and other nominee entities may not vote unless they have received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker or other nominee entity does not vote on a particular proposal because it does not have authority under the NYSE rules to vote on that particular proposal without receiving voting instructions from the beneficial owner.
Broker non-votes, as well as properly executed proxies marked "ABSTAIN," will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Meeting.
For information regarding the voting standard for Proposal 1, see "Vote Required; Majority Voting; Board Recommendation," above. In order to pass, each of Proposals 2, 3 and 4 must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the Proposal. A broker non-vote will not have an effect on these proposals. An abstention will not have an effect on Proposals 1, 2 or 3; however, pursuant to NYSE rules applicable to Proposal 4, an abstention will be considered a "vote cast" and therefore have the effect of a negative vote on the Proposal.

Table of Contents
This Proxy Statement contains references to Organic Revenue, Organic Revenue growth, Organic Revenue growth - adjusted, Adjusted EBITDAC, Adjusted EBITDAC Margin, and Adjusted EPS which are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to the GAAP information provided in the financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial information to our GAAP information is contained in this Annex A.
Organic Revenue and Organic Revenue growth. We view Organic Revenue and Organic Revenue growth as important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance on a consolidated basis and for each of our segments because they allow us to determine a comparable, but non-GAAP, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that were a part of our business in both the current and prior year and that are expected to continue in the future. We believe presenting these non-GAAP financial measures allows readers of our financial statements to measure, analyze and compare our consolidated growth, and the growth of each of our segments, in a meaningful and consistent manner.
Adjusted EBITDAC and Adjusted EBITDAC Margin. We view Adjusted EBITDAC and Adjusted EBITDAC Margin as an important indicators when assessing and evaluating our performance because it allows us to determine a comparable, but non-GAAP, measurement of our operating margins in a meaningful and consistent manner.
Adjusted EPS. Adjusted EPS means our earnings per share, excluding the impact of the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables and any other items (for example, extraordinary, nonrecurring items) that the Compensation Committee determines to be appropriately disregarded for all grants subject to a vesting condition of Adjusted EPS. We believe that Adjusted EPS provides a meaningful representation of our operating performance and is also presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of certain items that have a high degree of variability.
We present such non-GAAP supplemental financial information, as we believe such information provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of our operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis. Our industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-GAAP information with respect to one or more of these measures, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments. This supplemental financial information should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, our Consolidated Financial Statements.

  (iv)  to approve one or more forms of Award Agreement; 
  (v)  to establish guidelines, criteria, and overall numbers of and limits of Awards; 
  (vi)  to prescribe, amend, or rescind rules, guidelines and policies relating to the Plan, or to adopt supplements to, or alternative versions of, the Plan, including, without limitation, as the Committee deems necessary or desirable to comply with the laws of, or to accommodate the tax policy or custom of, foreign jurisdictions whose citizens may be granted Awards; 
  (vii)  to correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award Agreement and to make all other determinations and take such other actions with respect to the Plan or any Award as the Committee may deem advisable for the administration and operation of the Plan and Awards; 
  (viii)  to establish Performance Goals, Performance Measures, and Performance Periods; 
  (ix)  to establish procedural requirements for Performance-Based Awards, including without limitation certification or other determination that Performance Goals have been met; 
  (x)  to construe and interpret the Plan and any Award and make any determination of fact incident to the administration of the Plan; and 
  (xi)  to modify or amend each Award, provided however that the Committee may not modify or amend any outstanding Option or SAR so as to specify a lower exercise price, or accept the surrender of an outstanding Option or SAR and authorize the granting of a new Option or SAR with a lower exercise price in substitution for such surrendered Option or SAR, or buy out, for a payment in cash or shares of Stock, an outstanding Option or SAR. 
 (b)  Delegation to Chief Executive Officer. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may, in its discretion, delegate to the Company's Chief Executive Officer the power and authority to grant Awards to individuals other than (i) Employees who are or may become, upon hiring, subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and (ii) Directors. Any delegation hereunder will be in writing and will be subject to the 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
APPENDIX A
[BEGIN TABLE]
   restrictions and limitations that the Board specifies in writing at the time of such delegation, which must include a limitation on the total number of Shares that may be subject to Awards granted by the Chief Executive Officer pursuant to such delegation. The Board's delegation of authority to the Chief Executive Officer may be revoked or modified by the Board at any time. 
 (b)  If any portion of an outstanding Award for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled or forfeited, the Shares allocable to the expired, terminated, canceled, or forfeited portion of such Award will again be available for issuance under the Plan. 
 (c)  If any portion of an outstanding award that was granted prior to the Effective Date under a Prior Plan for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled or forfeited on or after the Effective Date, the Shares allocable to the expired, terminated, canceled, or forfeited portion of such Prior Plan award will be available for issuance under the Plan. Notwithstanding this Section 6(c), the provisions of the Plan will have no effect on awards granted pursuant to the Prior Plans, including without limitation Section 162(m) Grandfathered Awards, which will continue to be governed by the terms and provisions of the agreements and the plan documents governing such grants, as applicable. 
 (d)  All of the shares of Stock available for Awards under the Plan will be available for issuance pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan. 
 (e)  With respect to Stock Appreciation Rights, if the payment upon exercise of a SAR is in the form of Shares, the Shares subject to the SAR will be counted against the available Shares as one Share for every Share subject to the SAR, regardless of the number of Shares used to settle the SAR upon exercise. Similarly, in the event that any Option or other Award is exercised through the tendering of Shares or by the withholding of Shares by the Company, or withholding tax liabilities arising from such Option or other Award are satisfied by the tendering of Shares or by the withholding of Shares by the Company, the Shares subject to such Option or other Award will be counted against the available Shares as one Share for every Share subject to the Option or other Award, regardless of the number of Shares issued upon exercise of the Option or other Award. In the event that (i) any Option or other Award granted under the Plan or any other plan maintained by the Company is exercised through the tendering of Shares or by the withholding of Shares by the Company, or (ii) withholding tax liabilities arising from such Options or Awards are satisfied by the tendering of Shares or by the withholding of Shares by the Company, or (iii) Shares are repurchased by the Company using Option exercise proceeds, then the Shares so tendered or withheld or repurchased will not again be available for issuance under the Plan. Awards made in connection with the assumption of, or substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted to individuals who become Employees of the Company or a Subsidiary as a result of any merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, or reorganization, will not count against the limitations set forth in this Section 6. 
 (f)  The Shares issued by the Company under this Plan may be, at the Company's option, evidenced by a Share certificate delivered to the Grantee, or other physical or electronic evidence of Share ownership, including, without limitation, deposit of Shares into a stock brokerage account maintained for the Grantee or credit to a book-entry account for the benefit of the Grantee maintained by the Company's stock transfer agent or its designee. 
7.  Adjustments for Changes in Capital Structure. In the event of any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination, reclassification or similar event or change in the capital structure of the Company, the Board will make appropriate adjustments in (a) the number and class of Shares available for issuance under the Plan as set forth in Section 6 of the Plan, (b) the number and class of Shares subject to any outstanding Awards, (c) the per Share exercise price of any outstanding Option or SAR, (d) the limitations set forth in Section 9, and (e) any other term 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
APPENDIX A
[BEGIN TABLE]
  or condition of any outstanding Award affected by any such change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section 7 will be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and in no event may the exercise price be decreased to any amount less than the par value, if any, of the stock subject to an Option or SAR. Adjustments pursuant to this Section 7 will be made in accordance with the rules and regulations of Section 409A of the Code, and no such adjustment will be authorized to the extent that such adjustment would cause the Plan to violate Section 422(b)(1) of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments made pursuant to this Section 7 that are considered "deferred compensation" under Section 409A of the Code will be made in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and any adjustments that are not considered "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code will be made in such manner as to ensure that after such adjustment, the Awards either continue not to be subject to Section 409A of the Code or comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. The adjustments determined by the Board pursuant to this Section 7 will be final, binding and conclusive. 
8.  Eligibility. Awards may be granted only to Employees and Directors, as designated by the Committee in its discretion. Only Employees will be eligible to receive grants of Incentive Stock Options. The Committee's designation of a person as a Grantee in any year does not require the Committee to designate that person to receive an Award under the Plan in any other year or, if so designated, to receive the same Award as any other Grantee in any year. The Committee may consider such factors as it deems pertinent in selecting Grantees and in determining the amount of their respective Awards, including, but without being limited to: (a) the financial condition of the Company or a Subsidiary; (b) expected profits for the current or future years; (c) the contributions of a prospective participant to the profitability and success of the Company or a Subsidiary; and (d) the adequacy of the prospective participant's other compensation. The Committee, in its discretion, may grant Awards to a Grantee under this Plan, even though stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other benefits previously were granted to him or her under this or another plan of the Company or a Subsidiary, whether or not the previously granted benefits have been exercised, but the Grantee may hold such Awards only on the terms and subject to the restrictions hereafter set forth. A person who has participated in another benefit plan of the Company or a Subsidiary may also participate in this Plan. 
 (b)  Limitation on Maximum Value. The Committee may establish, at the Date of Grant, terms and conditions regarding any Award that limit the maximum value that a Grantee may realize upon the exercise or vesting of such Award. 
 (c)  Minimum Vesting Requirement. Except with respect to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the Shares that are authorized to be issued under the Plan, as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 7 of the Plan, and except for the death or Disability of the Grantee, or a Termination After Change in Control, no Award will provide for vesting that is any more rapid than vesting on the one (1) year anniversary of the Date of Grant.

10.  Options. 
 (a)   In General. The Committee may grant Options to Employee and Directors. Options may be Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualified Stock Options. Only Employees will be eligible to receive grants of Incentive Stock Options. The Committee will determine, in its discretion, the Employees and Directors to whom Options will be granted, the timing of the grants of such Awards, and the number of Shares subject to each Option. All Options will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and may contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the express provisions of the Plan, as the Committee determines in its discretion. Options may be granted in addition to, in tandem with, or independent of other Awards under the Plan. 
 (b)  Exercise Price. The per Share exercise price of each Option will be determined by the Committee on the Date of Grant, but in no event will the per share exercise price of any Option be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of the Share on the Date of Grant, and in no event will the per Share exercise price of any Incentive Stock Option granted to any Grantee who, on the Date of Grant, owns more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Subsidiary, be less than one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of the Share on the Date of Grant. 
 (c)  Term. The term of each Option will be fixed by the Committee on the Date of Grant, provided that the term will not exceed ten (10) years from the Date of Grant, and the term of an Incentive Stock Option granted to any Grantee who on the Date of Grant, owns more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Subsidiary, will not exceed five (5) years from the Date of Grant. 
 (d)  Exercisability. An Option will be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Committee on the Date of Grant. No Option may be exercised unless the Grantee is at the time of exercise an Employee or Director and has been continuously an Employee or Director since the Date of Grant, except that the Committee may permit the exercise of any Option for any period following the Participant's termination of employment or directorship not in excess of the original term of the Option on such terms and conditions as the Committee deems appropriate and specified in the related Award Agreement. 
 (f)  Termination of Service. The effect of a Grantee's Termination of Service on his or her outstanding Option(s) will be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement(s). 
[END TABLE]

APPENDIX A
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (b)  Exercise Price. The per Share exercise price of each SAR granted under the Plan will be determined by the Committee on the Date of Grant, but in no event will the per Share exercise price of any SAR be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of the Share on the Date of Grant. 
 (c)  Term. The term of each SAR will be fixed by the Committee on the Date of Grant, provided that the term will not exceed ten (10) years from the Date of Grant. 
 (d)  Exercisability. A SAR will be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the Committee in its discretion at the Date of Grant. No SAR may be exercised unless the holder of the SAR is at the time of such exercise an Employee or Director and has been continuously an Employee or Director since the date such SAR was granted, except that the Committee may permit the exercise of any SAR for any period following the Participant's termination of employment or directorship not in excess of the original term of the SAR on such terms and conditions as the Committee deems appropriate and specified in the applicable Award Agreement. 
 (e)  Form of Settlement. A SAR may be settled in the form of Shares or in cash, as may be established by the Committee in its discretion and specified in the related Award Agreement. 
 (f)  Termination of Service. The effect of a Grantee's Termination of Service on his or her outstanding SAR(s) will be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement(s). 
12.  Restricted Stock. 
 (a)  In General. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Committee may grant Restricted Stock to Employees or Directors from time to time. Shares of Restricted Stock are actual Shares issued to a Grantee and may be awarded either alone or in addition to other Awards. The Committee will determine, in its discretion, the Employees and Directors to whom Restricted Stock will be granted, the timing of such grants, and the number of shares subject to each Award of Restricted Stock. Restricted Stock may be granted in addition to, in tandem with, or independent of other Awards under the Plan. 
 (b)  Terms and Conditions. Each Award of Restricted Stock will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will set forth (i) the conditions, if any, that must be timely satisfied before the Award will be effective, and the conditions, if any, that must be timely satisfied before the Award will be vested, (ii) the conditions, if any, under which the Grantee's interest in the related Shares will be forfeited, and (iii) and any other terms and conditions of the Award. Any such conditions for effectiveness or vesting will be determined on the Date of Grant, and may be based upon the passage of time and continued service by the Grantee, or the achievement of specified performance objectives, or both time-based and performance-based conditions. The conditions for effectiveness or vesting and the other provisions of Awards of Restricted Stock are not required to be the same with respect to each Grantee. For the avoidance of doubt, the Committee may grant Restricted Stock without any conditions for effectiveness or vesting. 
 (c)  Dividends, Voting, and Other Ownership Rights. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the Award Agreement, an Award of Restricted Stock will entitle the Grantee to dividend, voting, and other ownership rights during the period for which the Share(s) remain subject to forfeiture and/or other conditions, provided, however, that in the case of an Award of Restricted Stock that is conditioned on the attainment of performance goals, the Grantee will not receive payment of any dividends unless and not earlier than such time as the Restricted Stock becomes earned or awarded based on the attainment of the performance goals. 
 (d)  Termination of Service. The effect of a Grantee's Termination of Service on his or her outstanding Award(s) of Restricted Stock will be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement(s).
