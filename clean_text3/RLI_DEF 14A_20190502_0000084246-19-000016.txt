PROXY STATEMENT
Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held May 2, 2019
GENERAL INFORMATION
This Proxy Statement is furnished to the shareholders of RLI Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), in connection with the solicitation, by the Board of Directors of the Company ("Board" or "Board of Directors"), of proxies to be used at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders ("Annual Meeting") to be held at 2 p.m. Central Daylight Time on Thursday, May 2, 2019, at the Mt. Hawley Country Club, 7724 North Knoxville Avenue, Peoria, Illinois, 61614, and at any adjournments of the Annual Meeting. 
This year, we are pleased to again be taking advantage of a Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rule that allows companies to furnish their proxy materials over the Internet. As a result, we are mailing to our shareholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("E-Proxy Notice") instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials. The E-Proxy Notice contains instructions that will enable shareholders receiving the E-Proxy Notice to access these materials over the Internet and, if so desired, to request a paper copy of these proxy materials by mail. Shareholders who do not receive the E-Proxy Notice will receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail. The Company intends to mail the E-Proxy Notice to shareholders on or about March 21, 2019.
VOTING
Because many shareholders cannot attend the Annual Meeting in person, it is necessary that a large number of our voting shares be represented at the Annual Meeting by proxy to achieve a quorum. Pursuant to the Company's Bylaws, at least a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote must be present (in person or by proxy) at the Annual Meeting to conduct the meeting, which is known as a "quorum" of shares. Even if you expect to attend, it is important that you vote your shares by submitting your proxy in advance.
Whether you hold your shares directly as the shareholder of record or through a broker, trustee, or other nominee ("in street name"), you may vote by proxy without attending the Annual Meeting in three different ways:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Internet: Shareholders may submit their proxy over the Internet by following the instructions provided on the proxy card or on the E-Proxy Notice. Shareholders will need to have the control number appearing on their proxy card or E-Proxy Notice available in order to submit their proxy over the Internet. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Telephone: Shareholders may submit their proxy by telephone, toll-free, by following the instructions provided on the proxy card or on the E-Proxy Notice. Shareholders will need to have the control number appearing on their proxy card or E-Proxy Notice available in order to submit their proxy by telephone. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Mail: Shareholders who receive a paper copy of a proxy card by mail may submit their proxy by signing, dating and returning the proxy card as promptly as possible in the envelope enclosed for that purpose. 
[END TABLE]
Shareholders can save the Company expense by submitting their proxy by telephone or over the Internet. If you submit your proxy by telephone or over the Internet, you do not need to also submit a proxy card, although you may do so as one method of changing your vote as described below. The method of voting will not limit a shareholder's right to attend the Annual Meeting.
RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement    | Each proxy will be voted in accordance with the shareholder's specifications. If you return a signed proxy card without providing voting instructions or do not designate a voting preference when using the other methods, your shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors. All proxies delivered pursuant to this solicitation are revocable at any time prior to the meeting at the option of the shareholder either by giving written notice to the Corporate Secretary at 9025 North Lindbergh Drive, Peoria, Illinois, 61615, or by timely delivery of a properly completed proxy, whether by proxy card or by Internet or telephone vote, bearing a later date, or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. All shares represented by valid, unrevoked proxies will be voted at the Annual Meeting. 
Assuming the presence, in person or by proxy, of a quorum, the election of directors (Proposal One) requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast. With respect to the election of directors, shareholders may vote in favor of all nominees, or withhold their votes as to all nominees, or withhold their votes as to specific nominees. Votes withheld are deemed present at the meeting and thus will be counted for quorum purposes and have the effect of a vote against the director.
The "Say-on-Pay" vote (Proposal Two) is advisory (not binding) in nature so there is no specified voting requirement for approval. However, the Board of Directors will consider that the shareholders have approved executive compensation on an advisory basis if this agenda item receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast (in person or by proxy). 
Assuming the presence, in person or by proxy, of a quorum, the proposal to ratify the selection of KPMG as the Company's independent accounting firm (Proposal Three) requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast. Shareholders may vote "For," "Against" or "Abstain" on this proposal. Abstentions are deemed present at the meeting, and thus will be counted for quorum purposes, but will have the same effect as a vote against the matter set forth in Proposal Three.
Brokers who hold shares for the accounts of their clients "in street name" may vote such shares either as directed by their clients or at their own discretion if permitted by the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and other organizations of which they are members. If an executed proxy is returned by a broker on behalf of its client that indicates the broker does not have discretionary authority as to certain shares to vote on one or more matters (a "broker non-vote"), such shares will be considered present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, but are not considered entitled to vote on that matter. Therefore, broker non-votes will not have any effect on any of the proposals being voted upon at the meeting. If your broker holds your shares "in street name" and you do not instruct your broker how to vote, your broker will have discretion to vote your shares on routine matters, such as Proposal Three, the ratification of the selection of the Company's independent public accounting firm. 
Your broker will not, however, have discretion to vote on non-routine matters absent direction from you. Among other matters, brokers are not entitled to use their discretion to vote uninstructed proxies in director elections or executive compensation matters. As a result, your broker will not be able to vote your shares on Proposals One and Two without your direction. Therefore, it is important that you provide your broker with voting instructions on all proposals. If your shares are held by your broker "in street name," you will receive a voting instruction form from your broker or the broker's agent asking you how your shares should be voted. Please complete the form and return it as instructed by the broker or agent. 
SHAREHOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE
Shareholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2019, the record date, shall be entitled to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting. As of the record date, the Company had 44,531,323  shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Common share ownership entitles the holder to one vote per share upon each matter to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting.

PROXY SOLICITATION
The Company will bear the cost of proxy solicitation. In addition to the use of the mail, proxies may be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile or other electronic means, by directors, officers or employees of the Company. No additional compensation will be paid to such persons for their services. In accordance with the regulations of the SEC and the NYSE, the Company will reimburse banks, brokerage firms, investment advisors and other custodians, nominees, fiduciaries and service bureaus for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding soliciting material to beneficial owners of the Company's Common Stock and obtaining their proxies or voting instructions.

PROPOSAL TWO: NON-BINDING, ADVISORY VOTE REGARDING THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and related SEC regulations require that we seek an advisory (non-binding) vote from our shareholders to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis ("CD&A"), compensation tables and related disclosures in this Proxy Statement.
As discussed in our CD&A starting on page 33, our executive compensation programs have been designed to provide a competitive total executive compensation program linked to Company performance that will attract, retain and motivate talented executives critical to the Company's long-term success.
The Executive Resources Committee of our Board ("ERC") developed an overall compensation philosophy that is built on a foundation of the following principles:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The focus is on the linkage between long-term shareholder value creation and executive pay; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Incentives for executives directly involved in underwriting are based on underwriting profit measured over a period of years consistent with the income and risk to the Company; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Compensation should reflect both the Company's and individual's performance; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· A meaningful element of equity-based compensation and significant executive equity holdings are important to ensure alignment of management and shareholder interests; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The Company's overall executive pay levels must be competitive in the marketplace for executive talent to enable the Company to attract, motivate and retain the best talent; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Appropriate safeguards must be in place to ensure annual incentives are aligned with long-term risk and value creation to protect against unnecessary and excessive risk to the Company. 
[END TABLE]
We are asking you to indicate your support for our executive compensation programs as described in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "Say-on-Pay" proposal, gives you the opportunity to express your views on our 2018 executive compensation policies and procedures for named executive officers. This non-binding vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the policies and procedures described in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, we ask the shareholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the CD&A, compensation tables and any related material disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement is hereby APPROVED.
Your vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the ERC or the Board. However, we value your opinions and to the extent there is any significant vote against the named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our shareholders' concerns. The ERC will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.
The Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as described in this Proxy Statement.
RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement    | PROPOSAL THREE: RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee has selected KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019, and the Board is asking shareholders to ratify that selection. Although current law, rules and regulations, as well as the Charter of the Audit Committee, require our independent auditor to be appointed, retained and supervised by the Audit Committee, the Board considers the selection of an independent auditor to be an important matter of shareholder concern and considers a proposal for shareholders to ratify such selection to be an important opportunity for shareholders to provide direct feedback to the Board on an important issue of corporate governance. If the appointment of KPMG is not ratified by shareholders, the Audit Committee will take such action, if any, with respect to the appointment of the independent auditor as the Audit Committee deems appropriate, which may include continued retention of such audit firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders.
Representatives of KPMG are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement, if they desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from the shareholders.
The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast is required for adoption of this proposal. 
The Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders vote "FOR" the proposal to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the current fiscal year.
FEES PAID TO THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Fees for services rendered by KPMG, the Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, for the past two fiscal years for each of the following categories of services, are set forth below:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES
The Company is committed to having sound corporate governance principles that are designed to ensure that the Board exercises reasonable business judgment in discharging its obligations to the Company and its shareholders. Corporate governance practices also help to ensure that full and transparent disclosures are made to the Company's shareholders and the SEC.
The Company's published Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are publicly available on the Company's website under the Investors section at www.rlicorp.com, outline the directors' responsibilities, which include attendance at shareholder, Board and committee meetings. Due to hazardous weather conditions, only two directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and were available to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders.
The Company has developed an orientation process for new directors and also encourages new directors to attend a director seminar in their first year as a director. Directors are required to maintain the necessary level of expertise to perform their responsibilities and to help ensure that they remain currently informed on corporate governance, financial and accounting practices, ethical issues for directors and management, industry related topics, and similar matters. Directors are encouraged to attend annually a forum or conference that will contribute to their performance on the Company Board and the Company reimburses Directors for the reasonable costs of attending director education programs.
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
The Board is required to affirmatively determine the independence of each director and to disclose such determination in the Proxy Statement for each Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company. The Board has established guidelines, which are set forth below, to assist it in making this determination, which incorporate all of the NYSE independence standards. Only independent directors serve on the Company's Audit Committee, Executive Resources Committee and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee.
It is the policy of the Board of Directors of the Company that a majority of its members be independent, which is also a requirement for listing on the NYSE. To be considered independent under the NYSE Listing Standards, the Board must affirmatively determine that a director or director nominee (collectively referred to as "director") has no material relationship with the Company (directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company), and also meets other specific independence tests. The Board examines the independence of each of its members once per year, and again if a member's outside affiliations change substantially during the year. With the exception of the Messrs. Michael and Stone, the Board has affirmatively determined that each director is independent within the meaning of the NYSE Listing Standards and the Company's Director Independence Standards.
The Board has established the following categorical standards, incorporating the NYSE's independence standards to assist it in determining director independence:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (a)      A Director will not be independent if:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (i)      the Director is, or has been within the last three years, an employee of RLI, or an immediate family member of the Director is, or has been within the last three years, an executive officer of RLI; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (ii)      the Director has received, or has an immediate family member who has received, during any 12-month period within the last three years, more than $120,000 in direct compensation from RLI, other than Director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service); 
[END TABLE]
RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement    | 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (iii)      (A) the Director is a current partner or employee of a firm that is RLI's internal or external auditor; (B) the Director has an immediate family member who is a current partner of such firm; (C) the Director has an immediate family member who is a current employee of such firm and personally works on RLI's audit; or (D) the Director or an immediate family member was within the last three years a partner or employee of such a firm and personally worked on RLI's audit within that time;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (iv)      the Director or an immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, employed as an executive officer of another company where any of RLI's present executive officers at the same time serves or served on that company's compensation committee; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (v)      the Director is a current employee, or an immediate family member is a current executive officer, of a company that has made payments to, or received payments from, RLI for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of $1 million, or 2 percent of such other company's consolidated gross revenues. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (b)      The following commercial and charitable relationships will not be considered to be material relationships that would impair a Director's independence:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (i)      if a Director, or an immediate family member of the Director, is an executive officer, director, employee or holder of an equity interest of a company that has made payments to, or received payments from, RLI for property or services in an amount which, in the last fiscal year, does not exceed the greater of $1 million, or 2 percent of such other company's consolidated gross revenues;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (ii)      if a Director, or an immediate family member of the Director, is an executive officer, director, employee or holder of an equity interest of a company that is indebted to RLI, or to which RLI is indebted, and the total amount of either company's indebtedness to the other does not exceed the greater of $1 million, or 2 percent of such other company's total consolidated assets;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (iii)      if a Director, or an immediate family member of the Director, is an executive officer, director or employee of a company in which RLI owns an equity interest, and the amount of RLI's equity interest in such other company does not exceed the greater of $1 million, or 2 percent of such other company's total shareholders' equity; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (iv)      if a Director, or an immediate family member of the Director, is a holder of an equity interest of a company of which a class of equity security is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and in which RLI owns an equity interest;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (v)      if a Director, or an immediate family member of the Director, is an executive officer, director, employee or holder of an equity interest of a company that owns an equity interest in RLI; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (vi)      if a Director, or an immediate family member of the Director, serves as an officer, director or trustee of a tax exempt organization, and the contributions from RLI to such tax exempt organization in the last fiscal year do not exceed the greater of $1 million, or 2 percent of such tax exempt organization's consolidated gross revenues. (RLI's automatic matching of employee charitable contributions will not be included in the amount of RLI's contributions for this purpose.) 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (c)      For relationships not covered by the standards in subsection (b) above, the determination of whether the relationship is material or not, and therefore whether the Director would be independent or not, shall be made by the Directors who satisfy the independence standards set forth in subsections (a) and (b) above. RLI is required to explain in its proxy statement the basis for any Board determination that a relationship was immaterial, despite the fact that it did not meet the categorical standards of immateriality set forth in subsection (b) above.

RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement    | DIRECTOR EVALUATION PROCESS
To ensure that thorough attention is given to individual and collective Directors' performance and optimizing the composition of our Board, the Board and Committees utilize an annual evaluation process. Each Director self-evaluates himself/herself, the performance of the Committees on which he/she serves, as well as the Board as a whole. Detailed composites are completed to obtain perspective on each Committee's performance in relationship to its respective Charter, effectiveness, functionality, areas of improvement and overall performance. The Annual Board Evaluation focuses on board processes, policies, effectiveness, strategy, and individual Director performance. This process is handled by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee.
Further, annually the Chairman of the Board and the Lead Director meet separately with each Director to discuss, among other matters, (1) recommendations to improve meetings; (2) Committees' structure and composition; (3) Board members' attributes and weaknesses; (4) compensation; and (5) tenure.  The Chairman of the Board and Lead Director summarize their discussions with the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee.
Based on the cumulative results of each Director's overall performance, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee reviews and evaluates the Board candidates and their respective qualifications in detail to determine if it is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to nominate each Director to stand for election. 
DIRECTOR NOMINATION POLICY
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee of our Board considers director candidates based upon a number of qualifications.  As minimum qualifications, a nominee should have:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· A reputation for the highest professional and personal ethics and values, fairness, honesty and good judgment; 
· A significant breadth of experience, knowledge and abilities to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities; 
· Been in a generally recognized position of leadership in his or her field of endeavor; and 
· A commitment to enhancing shareholder value. 
[END TABLE]
A nominee should not have a conflict of interest that would impair the nominee's ability to represent the interests of the Company's shareholders and fulfill the responsibilities of a director. 
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee conducts an annual assessment of the composition of the Board and its committees. In its annual assessment and when conducting a director search, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members with a goal of establishing diversity among directors reflecting, but not limited to, profession, background, experience, geography, skills, ethnicity, and gender.  The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is committed to actively seek highly qualified women and minority candidates for each director search it undertakes.  Annually, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will review this Policy and assess its effectiveness in bringing forth both diverse and non-diverse Board candidates that meet the qualifications and have the capabilities to provide strategic direction, governance and oversight to the Company.
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee relies upon recommendations from a wide variety of its business contacts, including current executive officers, directors, community leaders, and shareholders as sources for potential director candidates, and may also utilize third party search firms. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will consider qualified director candidates recommended by shareholders as further set forth under SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS on page 59, but the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee has no obligation to recommend such candidates.  Assuming the appropriate biographical and background material (including qualifications) is provided for candidates recommended by shareholders, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate those candidates by following substantially the same process and applying substantially the same criteria as for candidates recommended by other sources.

COMPANY POLICY ON RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company recognizes that related party transactions present a heightened risk of conflicts of interest and/or improper valuation (or the perception thereof) and therefore has adopted a written Related Party Transaction Policy which shall be followed in connection with all related party transactions involving the Company. The Related Party Transaction Policy generally requires approval by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee prior to the original or renewal effective date for all transactions above $10,000 to be entered into between the Company and its directors, officers, shareholders owning in excess of 5 percent of the Common Stock of the Company, and their family members and affiliates. In  2018, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee approved a related party transaction between the Company and SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. ("SS&C") as described immediately below.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In 2018, the transactions or series of similar transactions to which the Company was a party in which the amount involved exceeded $120,000 and in which any director, executive officer, or holder of more than 5 percent of the Common Stock of the Company (or any of their immediate family members) had a direct or indirect material interest, was the Company's transaction with SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. ("SS&C"). 
In 2013, the Company entered into a business arrangement with SS&C to provide investment portfolio accounting and data processing services. The contract was for a term of five years, expiring on October 1, 2018, but automatically renewing for a three year term unless cancelled by either party.

The Chairman and CEO of SS&C is the brother of Mr. Stone, a Director and former Officer of the Company's principal insurance subsidiaries.  The Company paid SS&C $314,022 in 2018.  This transaction falls within the purview of the Related Party Transaction Policy described in the previous paragraphs and is subject to review and approval by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee pursuant to that Policy. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee approved the renewal contract with SS&C for its three year term.

NONEMPLOYEE DIRECTOR DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN (DIRECTOR DEFERRED PLAN)
Prior to the beginning of each year, a nonemployee director may elect to defer the compensation otherwise payable or awarded to the director during the succeeding year pursuant to the Director Deferred Plan. Under the Director Deferred Plan, a Director is credited with RLI stock credits equal to the number of RLI shares that could be purchased by the amount of compensation deferred, with any cash dividend similarly converted to additional RLI stock credits. The Company transfers to a bank trustee, under an irrevocable trust established by the Company, cash equal to the compensation deferred which is used to purchase an equivalent amount of Company Common Stock to be held in the trust. Dividends on these shares are used to purchase additional shares of RLI stock. In general, Director Deferred Plan benefits are distributable, in the form of Company Common Stock, beginning when the director's status terminates.

DIRECTOR SHARE OWNERSHIP
Prior to January 1, 2018, Nonemployee Directors were encouraged to, within five years of their initial appointment as a Company director, own shares of the Common Stock of the Company having a value of not less than 500 percent of such director's Annual Board Retainer. Effective January 1, 2018 the ownership requirement was changed to a flat dollar value of $500,000 to be met within five (5) years of initial appointment to the Board.  Shares held directly and in Company benefit plans are counted to satisfy the guideline.    The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee monitors directors' share ownership.
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
Immediately following the 2018 Annual Shareholders Meeting, Mr. Michael was re-appointed Chairman of the Board in addition to his current officer positions of President and CEO of the Company.
The Company does not have a formal policy regarding separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board and chief executive officer. The Board believes that the decision whether to combine or separate such positions will vary from company to company and depends upon a company's particular circumstances at a given point in time.
The Board believes that a joint Board Chairman and chief executive officer position is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders given our current Board and Lead Director configuration. This structure promotes unified leadership, continuity, and direction for the Company. This combined position also provides a clear focus for management to execute the Company's strategy and business plan, while fostering clear accountability and decision-making in such roles. The Board believes the designation of an empowered "Lead Director" provides a counterbalancing governance structure and enables an appropriate balance between strategic execution and independent oversight of management.
The Lead Director (an independent director) is the Chairperson of the Board's Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee and is elected/confirmed by the Board's independent directors. The Lead Director (a) presides over executive sessions of the independent directors, (b) serves as a liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors, (c) assists in setting Board meeting agendas and schedules, (d) assists in determining information sent to directors for meetings, (e) may call meetings of the independent directors, (f) may consult with major shareholders if requested by the Chairman of the Board, (g) consults with the Chairman/CEO regarding results of annual performance reviews of the Board Committees and Board members, all as set forth in the Charter for the Lead Director position.
Several factors promote a strong and independent Board at our Company. Currently, all directors except for Messrs. Michael and Stone are independent as defined in the applicable NYSE listing standards (as adopted by the Company). The Audit, Executive Resources and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committees of our Board are comprised entirely of independent directors. Also, our independent directors meet quarterly in executive session without management present. Consequently, with our Lead Director position, we believe our Board continues to be strong and independent and provides appropriate counterbalance to a combined Chairman/CEO position.
RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement    | AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The following report by the Company's Audit Committee is required by the rules of the SEC to be included in this Proxy Statement and shall not be considered incorporated by reference in other filings by the Company with the SEC.
The Audit Committee is composed of five independent directors and operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors.
The primary role of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its oversight of (a) the Company's corporate accounting and reporting practices, (b) the quality and integrity of the Company's financial statements, (c) the performance of the Company's system of internal control over financial reporting, (d) the Company's compliance with related legal and regulatory requirements over financial reporting, (e) the qualifications, independence and performance of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP (the "Auditor"), including the selection of and performance of the lead engagement partner and other partners involved in the audit of the Company's financial statements, and (f) the performance of the Company's internal audit function. In addition to those primary roles, the Audit Committee also performs other roles and functions as outlined in its charter, including preliminary review of earnings releases and other activities. The Audit Committee also acts as the audit committee for each of the Company's insurance company subsidiaries. A more detailed description of the Audit Committee's roles, functions and activities is set forth in the Committee's charter, which is available on the Company's website under the Investors section at www.rlicorp.com.
The Board of Directors has determined that each of the members of the Audit Committee qualifies as "independent" within the meaning of the NYSE Listing Standards and the rules of the SEC. The Board of Directors has further determined that each of Messrs. Ahlmann, Angelina, Butler, Scanlan and Ms. Roberts is an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of the SEC rules.
The Audit Committee oversees the internal audit function of the Company, including the independence and authority of its reporting obligations, the proposed audit plans for the coming year and the coordination of such plans with the Auditor. The Company's Internal Audit Services department provides objective assurance and consulting services designed to add value and improve the organization's operational, financial and compliance controls. The Company's internal audit function operates under the terms of the RLI Internal Audit Services Charter, which is reviewed by the Audit Committee and approved by the Audit Committee's chair and the Company's CEO. To assist with this oversight, the Internal Audit Services department provides an annual risk-based audit plan to the Audit Committee and periodic reports are made to the Audit Committee summarizing results of internal audit activities.
The Audit Committee appoints and annually evaluates the performance of the Auditor and provides assistance to the members of the Board of Directors in fulfilling their oversight functions of the financial reporting practices, including satisfying obligations imposed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, and financial statements of the Company. It is not the duty of the Audit Committee, however, to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Company's financial statements are complete and accurate and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The Auditor is responsible for planning and conducting audits of the financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting; and the Company's management is responsible for preparing the financial statements, designing and assessing the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and determining that the Company's financial statements, including disclosures, are complete and accurate and in accordance with GAAP and applicable laws and regulations.
The Audit Committee contracts with and sets the fees paid to the Auditor. The fees for KPMG's audit services the past two fiscal years are set forth on page 18.
Audit fees relate to professional services rendered for the audit of consolidated financial statements of the Company, audits of the statutory financial statements of certain subsidiaries, review of quarterly consolidated financial statements and

Table of Contents assistance with review of documents filed with the SEC, including attestation as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.
There were no non-audit services provided by KPMG in 2018. Any non-audit services must be reviewed and preapproved by the Chair of the Audit Committee. The Chair will report such non-audit services to the Audit Committee no later than the next scheduled Committee meeting. 
The Audit Committee annually conducts evaluations of the Auditor to determine if it will recommend the retention of the Auditor for the next year. As part of the evaluation of the Auditor, the Audit Committee conducts periodic reviews and surveys to determine if the Auditor is meeting Committee expectations and providing appropriate audit services. A survey conducted in 2018 was created by a group of professional accounting and auditing organizations, including the National Association of Corporate Directors and the Center for Audit Quality and was completed by select RLI management. The Auditor evaluation includes topics such as: (a) quality of services and sufficiency of resources provided by the auditor; (b) communication and interaction with the auditor; and (c) auditor independence, objectivity and professional skepticism. The results of the Audit Committee's evaluation, including any resulting action items, are considered in the Audit Committee's decision regarding reappointment of the Auditor. Also, the results of the evaluation are discussed with the Auditor by the Audit Committee. In addition, the Audit Committee obtains and reviews, at least annually, a report by the Auditor describing; the firm's internal quality-control procedures; any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, and  peer review, of the firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within the preceding five years, respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm, and any steps taken to deal with any such issues; and (to assess the Auditor's independence) all relationships between the Auditor and the Company. The Audit Committee also reviews the most recently available Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") annual inspection reports of the Auditor, and KPMG's responses thereto, including quality improvement initiatives undertaken to address inspection report observations.
Pursuant to the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules of the PCAOB, the Auditor's lead engagement partner is required to rotate every five years. The current lead engagement partner is in the 4th year of the five-year rotation requirement for the 2018 audit.  In addition to the Audit Committee's evaluation of the Auditor, the Audit Committee also interviews and evaluates the experience of the audit partner and other supporting partners to help ensure they possess the requisite experience and knowledge to conduct and lead the audit team's integrated audit of the Company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee assesses the performance of the lead engagement partner and other supporting partners, to ascertain whether any audit quality matters were identified during the most recent quality assurance cycle conducted by regulators, peer reviews or internal quality reviews. 
Based upon the results of the evaluations noted above, the Audit Committee makes its recommendation regarding retention of the Auditor. KPMG has been the Company's Auditor continuously since 1983 and the Audit Committee has selected KPMG to be the Company's Auditor for fiscal 2019.
The Audit Committee, as a matter of good corporate governance, has directed management to solicit a request for proposal from several independent public accounting firms, including KPMG, to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2020. At the conclusion of the proposal process, the Audit Committee will select the firm that, in the Committee's belief, will provide a quality audit which serves the best interests of our shareholders.
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audit of the Company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting with management and the Auditor. The Audit Committee also discussed with the Auditor the matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Standard No. 16, Communication with Audit Committees. The Audit Committee received from the Auditor the written disclosures and letter required by the applicable PCAOB requirements regarding the Auditor's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. The Audit Committee discussed the Auditor's independence with the Auditor. Additionally, the Audit Committee promotes the Auditor's independence by ensuring that the lines of communication are always open and constant between the Auditor and the Audit Committee. The Chair of the Audit Committee is in contact with the Auditor numerous times throughout the year. This includes normal in-person meetings, 
RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement    |    31
Table of Contents executive sessions, telephonic meetings and periodically in between normally scheduled meetings. The purpose of this is to allow open and unobstructed access to the Audit Committee should the Auditor need to bring anything to the Audit Committee's attention.
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, as well as the Audit Committee's reliance on the representation of management that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements of the Company be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC.
The foregoing report has been approved by all members of the Audit Committee.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
INTRODUCTION
The Executive Resources Committee ("ERC") of the Company's Board of Directors, with the review and approval of the Board of Directors, administers specific compensation programs for senior executive officers and oversees other executive compensation programs and management succession and development processes. 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
With the exception of Gross Premiums Written, the following financial metrics are used as targets in our incentive plans and actual results are used to calculate annual incentives for our senior executive officers. These financial measures (other than Gross Premiums Written) are non-GAAP and should not be considered substitutes for GAAP measures.  We consider them key performance indicators and employ them as well as other factors in determining senior management incentive compensation. The calculation of these non-GAAP metrics can be found in the discussions below with respect to the incentive plans in which those metrics are used. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Our Results in 2018:            2018            2017          
  Gross Written Premium         $ 983.2 million         $ 885.3 million       
  Operating Earnings         $ 92.1 million         $ 102.2 million       
  (Net Earnings minus Realized Investment Gains Net of Tax)                           
  Combined Ratio         94.7         96.4       
  (Net Loss and Operating Expense/Net Premiums Earned)                           
  Operating Return on Equity         10.8%         12.5%       
  (Operating Earnings/Shareholder's Equity)                           
  Market Value Potential (MVP)         $ 12.1 million         $ 86.5 million       
  (After Tax Returns Above Cost of Capital)                           
  Five-Year Growth in Book Value: Rank Among Peer Companies         2/13         2/15       
[END TABLE]
In 2018, we continued to grow revenue and post solid underwriting and operating performance. Our top-line, reflected as gross premiums written, advanced $98 million (11%), as both mature and newer coverages experienced growth.  Premium growth helped in our achievement of $217.1 million in net cash flow from operating activities, a record amount for the Company. Our strong cash flow was used to support insurance operations and expand our investment portfolio and allowed us to return capital to our shareholders in the form of ordinary and special dividends. 
We achieved a 94.7 combined ratio, which included 4 percentage points of net catastrophe losses. (Combined ratio is a common industry measure of profitability defined as expenses and losses as a percentage of Net Premiums Earned.  Thus, a combined ratio below 100 signifies an underwriting profit.)  We expect the property and casualty insurance industry to post a combined ratio near 100 for 2018.  Our result not only beats the industry's projection but also represents our 23rd consecutive year of a combined ratio below 100. While events in 2018 and 2017 resulted in our two largest net catastrophe loss years in over two decades, we continued to post underwriting profits, once again proving the benefits of our underwriters' discipline and the benefits of a diversified product portfolio.
Market Value Potential ("MVP"), which is a measure of our after-tax returns above our cost of capital (explained in more detail on pages 37-38)  decreased to $12.1 million from $86.5 million last year.  While underwriting profit and investment income increased, unrealized losses from our equity investments, primarily driven by significant declines in the fourth quarter, adversely impacted MVP for 2018. The creation of MVP is a key financial metric in the annual incentive plans for the named executive officers and other executive officers.  Annual incentive plan payouts in 2018, therefore, were below 2017 levels due to the decline in MVP.   Although MVP declined for 2018, we compare our relative growth in book value over a five-year period to our peer companies and use that performance as a factor in calculating incentive compensation. For the five-year period ending in 2018, our rank remained at second among our peer companies, similar to 2017.
RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement    | KEY ATTRIBUTES OF RLI EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Performance-based compensation: Total executive compensation is directly linked to Company performance. As in prior years, all executives participate in an incentive plan, through which they are eligible to earn compensation based on achievement of Company financial objectives and personal objectives that are aligned with shareholder value creation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· At risk compensation: A significant portion of annual incentive compensation for our CEO, COO, CFO, Sr. Vice President, Operations and each product group vice president is paid over time through a bonus bank concept to provide an incentive for sustained shareholder value creation. Amounts credited to the bonus bank are reduced dollar-for-dollar, should negative results occur in a future period. As a result, net losses in a future period reduce the amount available in the bonus bank and could result in a negative balance. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Compensation based on relative company performance: Each year we conduct a review of executive compensation within an insurance peer group to ensure that the Company's executive compensation remains fair, competitive and consistent with the Company's absolute and relative performance. The MVP Program for the CEO, COO, CFO and Sr. Vice President, Operations includes an adjustment factor (positive and negative) for relative company performance. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Significant executive stock ownership: Our compensation programs encourage our employees to build and maintain an ownership interest in the Company. We have established specific executive stock ownership guidelines and our executive officers whose compensation is included in the Summary Compensation Table (referred to herein collectively as "named executive officers" or "NEOs"), as well as our other executive officers, currently maintain significant share ownership in the Company. As reflected on page 8, as of December 31, 2018, executive officers and Directors beneficially held 5.01% percent of Company shares, providing strong alignment with shareholders. 
[END TABLE]
The ERC believes that the Company's overall compensation approach provided meaningful incentives for the talented management team at the Company to provide outstanding results for shareholders again this year. 
HOW THE ERC OPERATES
ERC MEMBERS
From May 4, 2017 through May 3, 2018,  the members of the ERC were Messrs. McPheeters (Chair), Duclos, Graham, Restrepo and Scanlan.  After May 3, 2018, the members of the ERC were Messrs. Duclos (Chair), Graham, Restrepo and Scanlan. ERC members are nominated by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, elected by the Board and may be removed from the ERC by the Board at any time, with or without cause. The members of the ERC are independent directors under the independence standards developed by the Board, which incorporate all of the NYSE independence standards which are applicable to directors generally, and which are set out under the section entitled Corporate Governance and Board Matters on page 19. The Board annually determines the independence of each member of the ERC under those independence standards.
ERC RESPONSIBILITIES 
The ERC operates under a Charter, which can be found on the Company's website under the Investors section at www.rlicorp.com. The ERC Charter is reviewed annually by the ERC and any proposed changes to the Charter are submitted to the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee for recommendation to the full Board for approval. The ERC 
34    |    RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents is responsible to the Board for: (1) reviewing and providing advice regarding the Company's executive compensation; (2) reviewing and providing advice regarding the Company's management succession and development processes; (3) monitoring compensation actions by management below the executive level; (4) producing an annual report on executive compensation for approval by the Board for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement; and (5) reviewing the Company's employee benefit plans.
ERC MEETINGS 
The ERC held five meetings in 2018. The ERC also held a joint meeting with the Strategy Committee of the Board of Directors to discuss safeguards against unnecessary or excessive risk that could arise from the Company's executive compensation policies and practices. The agenda for each ERC meeting is established by the Chair of the ERC in consultation with other ERC members, and with Mr. Michael and Kathleen M. Kappes, Vice President, Human Resources.  ERC materials are prepared by Mr. Michael and Ms. Kappes with input from members of senior management and are reviewed and approved by the ERC Chair in advance of distribution to ERC members. The ERC meetings are attended by Mr. Michael, Ms. Kappes and from time-to-time, other members of senior management, who are excused from the meeting during the Committee's executive session.
RESPONSE TO 2018 SAY-ON-PAY VOTE 
At the May 2018 annual shareholder's meeting, we held a shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, referred to as a Say-on-Pay vote, with over 98 percent of shareholder votes cast on that item in favor of our executive compensation programs. We considered this vote to represent strong support by shareholders for our long-standing executive compensation policies and practices. In 2018, therefore, the ERC continued its general approach to executive compensation, as described above in "KEY ATTRIBUTES OF RLI EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION." 
INPUT FROM MANAGEMENT
Mr. Michael plays an important role in the ERC's consideration of executive compensation levels and the design of executive compensation plans and programs for other senior executive officers. For these individuals, Mr. Michael recommends the following components of executive compensation to the ERC for review and recommendation to the Board: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· annual base salary levels;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· annual incentive targets and financial and personal goals; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the form and amount of long-term incentives.  
[END TABLE]
Mr. Michael makes such compensation recommendations based on external market data; achievement of respective performance criteria by each executive; and his judgment related to internal pay equity among Company executives, potential for advancement, and contribution to team initiatives. Mr. Michael also relies upon the input of the senior leadership team when making such recommendations.
COMPENSATION CONSULTANT
The ERC Charter specifically provides that if a compensation consultant is to assist in the evaluation of CEO or senior executive compensation, the ERC has sole authority to retain and terminate the consulting firm including sole authority to approve the firm's fees and retention terms. Management also has authority to retain a compensation consultant, but may not retain the same compensation consulting firm retained by the ERC without approval in advance by the ERC. The ERC did not retain a compensation consultant in 2018. Management retained Willis Towers Watson in 2018 to provide advice from time to time with respect to elements of executive compensation. 
RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement    | OVERVIEW OF RLI EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
OBJECTIVES
The objective of the Company's executive compensation program is to provide a competitive total executive compensation program linked to Company performance that will attract, retain, and motivate talented executives critical to the Company's long-term success. 
ELEMENTS OF COMPANY EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Company's total executive compensation program is comprised of the following components, each of which is described in greater detail below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    1.      Total annual cash compensation consisting of: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (a)      Base salary; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (b)      Annual incentive awards under the MVP Program, which incorporates annual and long-term design features, for the CEO; COO; CFO; and Sr. Vice President, Operations; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (c)      Annual incentive awards under the Management Incentive Program ("MIP") for other home office executives; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (d)      Annual incentive awards under the Underwriter Profit Program for product group executives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    2.      Long-term incentive compensation granted under the LTIPs (as described herein); and under the MVP Program for the CEO; COO; CFO; and Sr. Vice President, Operations. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    3.      Limited perquisites. All Company executives are provided with travel accident insurance and are reimbursed for out of pocket costs for an annual health examination not covered by the Company's health plan. The CEO and COO are permitted to use the Company's fractionally-owned aircraft for personal use for an hourly rate approved by the Board of Directors, with maximum annual use limited to total charges of 6.5 percent of annual base salary. The Company does not provide any income tax gross-ups. 
[END TABLE]
BALANCE OF SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM COMPENSATION
The ERC works to balance short-term and long-term elements of total compensation, as described in the following sections. The goal is to provide a meaningful level of long-term compensation to align with long-term value creation and mitigate the risk that members of management make decisions or take actions solely to increase short-term compensation while adding excessive risk to the Company. In that regard, the ERC believes that a greater percentage of total compensation should be in the form of long-term compensation the more senior the role is. The Committee also takes into account the significant ownership of Company stock by Mr. Michael when determining his long-term incentive award.  
We consider those salary and annual incentive amounts earned in 2018 and paid in 2018 to be short-term compensation. MVP Program payments in 2018 made from amounts earned in prior years and credited to the bonus bank for prior year MVP Program awards; and the grant date fair value of stock options awards in 2018, on the other hand, are considered to 
36    |    RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents be long-term compensation. The following table compares the percentage of total compensation which is short-term in nature, to the percentage which is long-term in nature.

    (2)      Mr. Fick does not participate in the MVP Program, but instead participates in the MIP, which does not have a bonus bank or long-term payout feature, and consequently his long-term percentage is less than the other NEOs. 
[END TABLE]
MARKET VALUE POTENTIAL EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE PROGRAM (MVP PROGRAM) — GENERAL
MVP Defined. As discussed in further detail below, the MVP Program provides a mechanism with which the ERC can correlate incentive compensation to long-term shareholder value creation. The MVP Program uses an economic profit measure called "Market Value Potential" ("MVP"), which measures the after-tax returns earned by the Company above its cost of capital, as a gauge of shareholder value creation. MVP is defined as (1) the Actual Return (the increase in adjusted GAAP book value as defined immediately below), less (2) the Required Return (beginning capital multiplied by the blended cost of capital). If the Company does not earn the Required Return in a given year and MVP is negative, no incentive award is made pursuant to the MVP Program for that year.
For the purposes of the MVP Program, the increase or decrease in GAAP book value is calculated as ending capital less beginning capital. Ending capital is defined as ending GAAP book value, less unrealized gains or losses net of tax on available-for-sale fixed maturity investments, plus outstanding long-term debt instruments at the end of the period; and adjusted for capital transactions during the year. Beginning capital is defined as beginning GAAP book value, less unrealized gains or losses net of tax on available-for-sale fixed maturity investments, plus outstanding long-term instruments at the beginning of the period. The Company's blended cost of capital is defined as the weighted average of the cost of equity capital and the cost of debt capital. The cost of equity capital is the average ten-year U.S. Treasury Note rate, plus a market risk premium of five percent modified by the Company's ten-year beta versus the S&P 500 index. The Company's cost of debt capital is the forward market rate on its outstanding long-term debt.
MVP Program Participation. Participation in the MVP Program, percentage incentive awards and the formula to calculate MVP are recommended by the ERC and approved annually by the independent Directors of the Board for Mr. Michael and by the entire Board for other participants. In 2018, participation in the MVP Program was limited to Messrs. Michael, Kliethermes, Brown, and Ms. Klobnak. The Board has concluded based on the position responsibilities and ongoing assessment of individual performance against operational and financial goals that the senior executive management team (comprised of the CEO, COO, CFO and Sr. Vice President, Operations) is most responsible for the operating and investment decisions and actions that directly impact the creation of long-term shareholder value, and, therefore, should be rewarded with a portion of their incentive compensation being directly and exclusively tied to the creation of MVP. 
MVP Components. As discussed in more detail below, there are two components to the MVP Program. The first component, based on strategic objectives, represents annual compensation. The second component, based on financial objectives, is paid out over time out of amounts credited to a bonus bank, which is at risk of forfeiture based on future performance and as such represents long-term compensation. The component based on financial objectives is also adjusted based on a relative comparison of the Company's five-year growth in book value to that of its Peer Companies. (The 
RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement    |    37
Table of Contents
Company's relative growth in book value, in turn, is calculated by comparing its compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") in GAAP comprehensive earnings over the applicable five-year period to that of its Peer Companies. CAGR in comprehensive earnings is calculated based on publicly disclosed comprehensive earnings of Peer Companies for the five-year period ending at the third quarter of the fifth year.)
MVP Percentage Award. For 2018, each participant in the MVP Program received a MVP incentive award expressed as a percentage of MVP created by the Company in that calendar year. Each year the ERC confirms that the percentage awards remain appropriate by reviewing historical incentive award payouts, projected future payouts and resulting total compensation for MVP Program participants, which in turn, is compared to the performance of the Company necessary to achieve such payouts. The ERC compares the performance of the Company and total compensation of the MVP Program participants with comparable performance metrics and compensation at companies in the peer group. The MVP percentage award, expressed as a percentage of MVP, for each participant for 2018 was as follows, the same as for 2017: 2.5 percent for Mr. Michael, 1.8 percent for Mr. Kliethermes, 1.0 percent for Mr. Brown, and 1.0 percent for Ms. Klobnak. The ERC set the percentage incentive awards for 2018 based on the factors described above and based on the range of expected MVP to be created by the Company in 2018 and the projected incentive awards and incentive payouts that would result. 
Individual MVP Award payments during any fiscal year, including payments from amounts credited to a bonus bank in prior years, are capped at $7.5 million under the terms of the RLI Corp. Annual Incentive Compensation Plan approved by Shareholders in 2016 and amended in 2018. Pursuant to the Annual Incentive Compensation Plan, under which the MVP Program operates, the Board of Directors may exercise discretion to decrease MVP Awards based on such objective or subjective criteria it deems appropriate.
ANNUAL COMPENSATION
BASE SALARY
Executive base salaries are targeted to be at the median base salary for comparable positions in the insurance industry, taking into account performance, experience, potential and the level of base salary necessary to attract and retain top executive talent.
In 2018, the ERC set base salary ranges for the CEO, CFO and COO based on publicly available executive compensation data for 2018 from the following peer companies:

The ERC selected these Peer Companies based on its judgment. Each of the Peer Companies competes within the property and casualty insurance industry and sells a variety of specialty insurance products that serve both commercial entities and individuals that can generally be defined as specialty in nature, or targeted toward niche markets. The Peer Companies have established records of financial performance, and most have been publicly traded for at least five years, facilitating the comparison of the Company's financial performance to that of the Peer Companies. The ERC also reviews the market capitalization of the Company compared to the Peer Companies to ensure that the Company is at or near the median market capitalization among those companies. For the Peer Company comparison performed in 2018, the Company's market capitalization was sixth among thirteen companies within the peer group.
Each year, the ERC compares the relative ranking among the Company and Peer Companies based on the most recently available public data (2017 data reviewed in 2018) for base salaries and total compensation for the CEO, COO and CFO positions to the relative performance ranking for the following publicly available performance metrics for the prior year: price-to-book ratio; return on equity; combined ratio; and total shareholder return ("TSR") for one, three and five-year time frames to determine the overall competitiveness of the Company's executive compensation. The Company's rank among the Peer Companies for 2018, based on 2017 results, is shown in the table below:

Base salaries and total compensation for other NEOs and executive positions are established by reference to the publicly available survey data, including median base salary levels, for comparable executives in the insurance industry.
At the May 2018 Board meeting, when the annual review of base salaries was conducted by the ERC, Mr. Michael recommended no base salary increase for himself.  Based on an assessment of annual cash compensation levels (base salary and annual incentive payouts from the MVP Program), Mr. Michael recommended a 5.26% increase for Mr. Kliethermes and a 2.35% increase for Mr. Brown.  Mr. Michael also recommended a 4.62% increase for Ms. Klobnak and a 3.13% increase for Mr. Fick in light of the placement of their respective base salaries compared to other similar positions in the insurance industry. The ERC and Board approved Mr. Michael's recommendations. 
MARKET VALUE POTENTIAL EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE PROGRAM — ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION COMPONENT
Twenty percent of the preliminary MVP award calculated for each participant is evaluated against annual objectives and an achievement rating of 0 to 100 percent is assigned to that portion of the award. This amount represents the annual compensation component of the MVP Program award (The long-term incentive component of the MVP Program is explained under the section Long-Term Compensation on pages 41-43). For 2018, Messrs. Michael, Kliethermes, and Brown and Ms. Klobnak shared annual objectives related to the advancement of operational efficiencies through the strengthening of core infrastructure; the improvement of the customer experience; talent development; relative annual financial performance; and growth initiatives.  The annual objectives are established as difficult stretch goals, requiring superior effort and execution to achieve 100% on all goals.  The annual objectives component of an MVP award will only be paid if objectives are achieved and if positive MVP is created for shareholders. If MVP is positive and annual objectives are achieved, the annual objectives component of the award will be paid annually to provide direct linkage of annual incentive compensation for the achievement of those annual goals. However, if MVP is negative for a year, no MVP award will be made for that year with respect to the annual objectives component.
In 2016 and prior years, Ms. Klobnak participated in the MIP discussed immediately below.  Under the MIP, annual bonuses are paid out in their entirety, compared to annual bonuses under the MVP Program which are credited to a bonus bank, with 33 percent of the bonus bank paid out annually. As a transition from participation in MIP to the MVP Program, the ERC agreed that for 2017, Ms. Klobnak would be paid the greater of the bonus calculated under MIP or the MVP Program, with

For 2018, annual objectives were evaluated by the Committee and an 89 percent overall achievement factor was applied. The following annual incentive compensation was paid to each participant under the MVP Program:

MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAM (MIP) 
Participants in the MIP include home office vice presidents, assistant vice presidents and other senior managers. Awards are granted annually and expressed as a percentage of year-end base pay based on targets for three financial goals: operating return on equity ("ROE"), combined ratio, and MVP. Awards are based on actual results for these metrics and achievement of personal objectives. 
ROE and combined ratio are used as financial goals to provide an incentive to increase annual profitability. ROE is a ratio calculated as our operating earnings divided by our beginning equity adjusted for capital transactions such as share repurchases and special dividends. Operating earnings, in turn, are our net earnings minus realized investment gains or losses net of tax. Combined ratio is an expense measure and is calculated as the sum of our incurred losses and settlement expenses plus our policy acquisition costs and operating expenses, divided by our net premiums earned. The difference between the combined ratio and 100 reflects the per-dollar rate of underwriting income or loss. MVP is used as a financial goal as a proxy for shareholder value creation and is explained on pages 37-38. 
Actual awards for a year are paid in the first quarter of the following year. The ERC approves award levels for MIP participants at the vice president level, who are designated as executive officers under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Mr. Michael approves award levels for other MIP participants. 
For 2018, Mr. Michael recommended, and the ERC approved, a MIP maximum annual incentive opportunity for Mr. Fick of 90 percent of his year-end base salary, 72 percent of which was based on the achievement of financial goals of MVP, ROE and combined ratio and 18 percent of which was based on personal objectives related to strategic projects.

LONG-TERM COMPENSATION
MARKET VALUE POTENTIAL EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE PROGRAM — LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION COMPONENT AND FORFEITURE PROVISION (CLAWBACK)
The MVP Program is described on pages 37-38. Eighty percent of the preliminary MVP award calculated under that program (which will be positive if MVP is positive, or negative if MVP is negative) is subject to an assessment of Company performance compared to Peer Companies (the "financial component"). This represents the long-term component of the MVP award. The financial component of a preliminary award will be adjusted in a range from a 20 percent reduction (minimum) to a 25 percent increase (maximum) based on the Company's long-term performance relative to Peer Companies measured by five-year growth in book value per share. The Company's relative growth in book value is calculated by comparing its CAGR in GAAP comprehensive earnings over the applicable five-year period to that of its Peer Companies. CAGR in comprehensive earnings is calculated based on publicly disclosed comprehensive earnings of Peer Companies for the five-year period ending at the third quarter of the fifth year. The adjustment to the financial component is made according to the following schedule:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Adjustment of Preliminary Financial Award Based on  RLI's Relative Five-Year Book Value per Share Growth       
  Adjustment of Preliminary Financial Award Based on  RLI's Relative Five-Year Book Value per Share Growth       
  Relative Performance    Adjustment       
  90th percentile of peers or greater    125% (maximum)  
  60th percentile of peers    100% (target)  
  33rd percentile of peers or less    80% (minimum)  
[END TABLE]
As noted above, the Company must perform at the 60th percentile, above the median of long-term performance of Peer Companies, in order for 100 percent of the long-term financial component of an MVP award otherwise earned to be made. 
RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement    | The financial component of an MVP award earned is not immediately paid to participants; rather it is credited (if positive) or charged (if negative) to each participant's long-term bonus bank. A bonus bank, in turn, may be positive or negative based on prior year results. The bonus bank is paid annually at a rate of 33 percent of a positive bank balance, meaning that it will take more than 10 years to completely pay out an incentive award for a given year deposited into a bonus bank. 
Until paid out, all amounts in the MVP Program bonus bank are subject to a risk of forfeiture if future financial performance results in a negative MVP calculation. In other words, negative MVP charged to a bonus bank will reduce a positive balance in that bonus bank, effectively causing a forfeiture of such positive balance. If a bonus bank is negative after the financial component of an MVP award is credited or charged to a bonus bank, no award will be paid from the bank until it is positive as a result of future positive amounts credited to the bank. The forfeiture provision in the MVP Program bonus bank in the event of negative MVP, in effect, operates as a clawback for negative shareholder results by reducing the amount payable from the bonus bank when the Company has negative MVP. In light of the clawback feature of the MVP Program in the event of negative MVP, and given the lack of a regulatory framework for clawbacks under the Dodd-Frank Act, the ERC has decided to wait to implement broader clawback provisions until after such regulations are finalized.
The Company's MVP in 2018 was $12.1 million compared to MVP of $86.5 million in 2017. The following table shows the manner in which 2018 annual and long-term MVP award payouts and remaining at-risk bank balances were calculated for Messrs. Michael, Kliethermes, Brown and Ms. Klobnak.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS  
The Company has two long-term incentive plans which cover our award of equity/stock-based compensation to participants.  Those plans are the 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2010 LTIP") effective from 2010 to 2015, and the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2015 LTIP").  The 2010 LTIP is inactive and the 2015 LTIP is currently in effect. Together, these plans are sometimes referred to as "LTIPs".
RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement    | The 2010 LTIP was adopted in 2010. The 2015 LTIP, described immediately below, was adopted in 2015 and replaced the 2010 LTIP. Messrs. Michael, Kliethermes, Brown, Fick, and Ms. Klobnak have outstanding stock option awards under the 2010 LTIP and the 2015 LTIP.
The purpose of our LTIPs is to promote the interests of the Company and its shareholders by providing key personnel of the Company with an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the Company and rewarding them for achieving or exceeding the Company's performance goals. The grant of equity awards, the value of which is related to the value of the Company's Common Stock, aligns the interests of the Company's executive officers with that of the shareholders. The ERC believes this arrangement develops a strong incentive for Company executives to put forth maximum effort for the continued creation of shareholder value and long-term growth of the Company. 
Under the Company's 2015 LTIP, certain employees, officers and directors of the Company are eligible to receive equity awards in a variety of forms including non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance units, restricted stock awards and other equity awards. All executives at the Company are required to own a significant level of Company stock, stated as a multiple of base salary. Equity grants provide a means for executives to meet their ownership requirement. As explained further on page 48, executives are required to hold all net shares from an equity grant until their stock ownership level is met.
The ERC believes equity awards serve as incentives to executives to maximize long-term growth and profitability of the Company, an arrangement that benefits both the executives and shareholders. Equity awards also provide a means to attract and retain key employees. The ERC establishes and recommends to the independent Directors of the Board the annual equity award for Mr. Michael, which is established based on a review of long-term incentive compensation of CEO positions among the Peer Companies described above, an assessment of his performance and initiatives underway and a comparison of his equity awards compared to awards to other executives. A target range of the value of annual equity awards, expressed as a percentage of base salary based on peer company comparisons and executive compensation benchmarking surveys, has been established for all other Company executives. 
In 2018, the Company awarded long-term incentives in the form of non-qualified stock option grants to the NEOs in amounts recommended by the ERC and approved by the Board of Directors (independent Directors with respect to Mr. Michael's award). The ERC believes that non-qualified stock options provide an effective form of performance-based compensation to align the interests of NEOs and shareholders. In reaching that conclusion, the ERC considered the following: stock options provide more leverage than equity awards such as restricted stock; are directly aligned with shareholder interests since they provide rewards only with share price appreciation; and, are understood and supported by recipients.  Other Company employees eligible for long-term incentive awards received non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units in 2018.
The Company targets long-term incentives at approximately the median of competitive market data. Mr. Michael recommends to the ERC proposed long-term incentive awards within the target range for each executive officer based on the executive officer's position and a subjective assessment of the executive officer's individual performance and anticipated future contributions to the Company. The ERC considers Mr. Michael's recommendations and then approves and recommends stock option awards to the Board for approval. Options expire eight years after grant.
Stock options vest over five years at the rate of 20 percent per year, or upon termination of employment due to the death, disability, or qualified retirement of the recipient. Upon termination of employment (other than due to death, disability, or retirement), vested options must be exercised within the earlier of 90 days of termination or expiration of the option award, except that options are forfeited in the event the employment of an option recipient is terminated for cause.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP)
The Company's ESOP offers another performance-based means of retaining and motivating employees, including executive officers, who work 1,000 or more hours per year, by offering ownership in the Company on a long-term basis. The Board may approve an annual contribution to the ESOP based on the profitability of the Company that is used by the ESOP to purchase Common Stock on behalf of participating employees, including executive officers. For 2018, the ERC recommended and the Board approved a discretionary profit sharing contribution to the ESOP of 4.5 percent of participants' eligible compensation. In addition, plan forfeitures equal to 0.208 percent of eligible compensation were added to all participants' accounts.
401(K) PLAN
The Company sponsors a 401(k) Plan in which all employees, including executive officers, scheduled to work 1,000 or more hours per year, are entitled to participate. All participants receive a "safe harbor" annual contribution by the Company to their 401(k) accounts of three percent of eligible compensation. The Board may also approve discretionary profit sharing contributions to the 401(k) Plan. For 2018,  in addition to the safe harbor three percent annual contribution, the ERC recommended and the Board approved a discretionary profit sharing contribution to the 401(k) of 1.5 percent of participants' eligible compensation and plan forfeitures equal to 0.056 percent of eligible compensation were added to all participants' accounts. 
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN (DEFERRED PLAN)
Under the Company's Deferred Plan, an executive officer may elect to defer up to 100 percent of total cash compensation after payroll deductions. Upon an election by an executive officer to defer compensation (a "Participant"), the Company allocates to the Participant RLI stock credits equal to the number of shares that could be purchased with the amount deferred.  Additional RLI stock credits are allocated to a Participant's account equal to shares of RLI stock that could be purchased with dividends paid on RLI stock credited to a Participant's account.  The Company transfers cash equal to the amount deferred to a bank trustee under an irrevocable trust established by the Company, and the trustee purchases a number of shares of Common Stock of the Company representing an amount equal to the compensation deferred by the Participant. Dividends paid on the shares in such trust are used by the trustee to purchase additional shares of Common Stock of the Company, which are placed in the trust. The trust is considered to be a "Rabbi Trust" or grantor trust for tax purposes. The assets of the trust are subject to claims by the Company's creditors. The Deferred Plan generally provides that the shares credited to the Participant's account will be transferred to the Participant upon termination of employment over five years. Messrs. Michael, Kliethermes, Brown, Fick, and Ms. Klobnak did not elect to defer any income for 2018.  Messrs. Michael, Kliethermes, and Brown have deferred income under the Deferred Plan in prior years.
KEY EMPLOYEE EXCESS BENEFIT PLAN (KEY PLAN)
The purpose of the Key Plan is to restore benefits lost to certain executive officers under the ESOP and 401(k) Plan due to limitations on benefits contained in the Internal Revenue Code (a "Key Participant"). The Company determines the benefits the Key Participant would have earned in the 401(k) and ESOP but for the limitation in the Internal Revenue Code on the maximum compensation on which those benefits may be calculated, and then transfers such amount to a bank trustee under an irrevocable trust established by the Company. The trustee then purchases a number of shares of RLI stock having a value equal to the amount contributed to the trust. The trust is considered to be a "Rabbi Trust" or grantor trust for tax purposes. The assets of the trust are subject to claims by the Company's creditors. The Key Plan generally provides that dividends are credited to the Key Participant's account and reinvested in shares of Common Stock of the Company held in the Rabbi Trust. The shares credited to the Key Participant's account pursuant to the Key Plan will be paid upon termination of employment in five annual installments. Mr. Michael ceased active participation in the Key Plan in 2005. Dividends on his shares under the Key Plan continue to be credited to his account in the Key Plan. No other employee participates or has participated in the Key Plan, which is now frozen.

(1)     Mr. Michael has met the requisite age and years of service to qualify for retirement upon his departure from the Company.
The Company has not entered into any employment or severance agreements or arrangements with any of its executive officers that would compensate the executive officers for or after departing the Company. The following paragraphs describe the circumstances under which the retirement or other termination of employment will result in a payment to an NEO under the Company's annual and long-term incentive plans.
MVP/MIP. Under the Company's MVP Program, an employee must be employed on Bonus Payment Date in order to receive a bonus for that year, unless the employee's termination of employment was due to death, disability, or Retirement. Under the Company's MIP Program, an employee must be employed on the last calendar day of the year in order to receive a bonus for that year, unless the employee's termination of employment was due to death, disability, or Retirement.  Retirement requires: in order to receive a bonus payout for that year, or from a bonus bank if applicable, (1) the termination of employment of an employee who has reached age and years of service equal to or greater than 75 at the time of departure; or (2) the termination of employment of an employee who satisfies a non-competition covenant or other terms and conditions specified by the Company. The amounts in the above table show annual incentives payable upon termination of employment in the event of a death, disability, or Retirement assuming all NEOs would have met the definition of Retirement at year-end 2018, although only Mr. Michael has met the definition based on age and years of service.
46    |    RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
Upon the termination of employment of a participant qualifying as retirement, a positive MVP bonus bank calculated on the last day of the quarter during which the participant's employment ended will be paid to a participant in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month after termination if the participant is age 65 or older, and as a quarterly annuity starting after the first day of the seventh month after termination, and continuing to age 65 using the interest rate for the five-year Treasury Note in effect at the date of Retirement if the Participant's age is less than 65. A bonus bank balance will also be calculated at the end of the quarter prior to a participant's termination of employment and the Company may, in its discretion, pay the lower of the calculated bonus banks. All such payments upon a termination of employment qualifying as retirement are subject to ongoing restrictions on: the participant's employment in the insurance industry; solicitation of Company employees for employment elsewhere; solicitation of business away from the Company; and disclosure of confidential information of the Company. 
Long-Term Incentives. Under the terms of our LTIPs, stock option grants automatically vest upon the death or disability of an optionee, but will vest upon the Retirement of an optionee only if the underlying stock option agreement so provides. The awards of stock options to the NEOs, and all other stock option recipients at the Company, provide for the immediate vesting of outstanding unvested stock options in the event of a recipient's termination of employment qualifying as a retirement. Retirement is defined under the LTIPs as the termination of employment of a participant who has combined age and years of service of 75 or greater at the time of departure. Stock options must be exercised within the earlier of one year of the death of an optionee, or three years of the termination of employment due to the disability or Retirement of an optionee, and the original expiration date of the stock option award. In the event of the termination of employment of an optionee for reasons other than death, disability, or Retirement, vested options must be exercised within the earlier of 90 days of the termination of employment or the original expiration of the option award. In 2018, Mr. Michael's respective age and years of service exceeded 75. Accordingly, upon Mr. Michael's termination of employment with the Company, all of his respective unvested stock option grants will immediately vest, expiring on the earlier of the original expiration date or three years. 
For Cause. In the event of a termination for cause, all unpaid bonuses, amounts in a bonus bank, and unexercised stock options are forfeited.
Change in Control. In the event of a change in control of the Company, as defined under the 2015 LTIP, the Board must take one of two actions with respect to outstanding stock option awards. Under the first alternative, the Board must make appropriate provisions for the replacement of the outstanding awards by the substitution of equity based awards of the surviving company with substantially similar terms and conditions, with full vesting for qualifying terminations of employment, such as involuntary termination by the Company or termination by the employee with good reason, in either case, within two years following the fundamental change. Alternatively, the Board must permit the options to be exercised prior to the change in control, or cashed out as part of the change in control. For illustration purposes, the table shown on the previous page assumes the Board of Directors had exercised discretion as described above to cash out outstanding stock options granted by permitting each participant to exercise all outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2018 to realize the in-the-money value of those options.  
The 2016 RLI Corp. Annual Incentive Compensation Plan, which governs the MVP and MIP bonus program, includes a change in control provision, with "change in control" defined as in the 2015 LTIP.  The Annual Incentive Compensation Plan provides that upon change in control, any amounts credited to a bonus bank and any amounts earned during a full or partial performance period shall not be forfeited, but will be paid out as specified under the applicable bonus program.  The amounts shown in the table above show the full bonus bank balance under the MVP Program for Messrs. Michael, Kliethermes, Brown and Ms. Klobnak and the full year bonus under the MIP Program for Mr. Fick.
RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement    | STOCK OWNERSHIP/RETENTION GUIDELINE
It is the Company's belief that key executives should hold significant amounts of Company stock. The value of all shares owned or vested, including: those held outright; those in benefit plans; and the value of in-the-money vested stock options, must equal or exceed a multiple of their annual base salary, as shown below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Position            $ Value of Shares  
  CEO          6.0    x    Base Salary  
  COO          4.0    x    Base Salary  
  CFO; Executive VP          3.0    x    Base Salary  
  Senior Vice President          2.0    x    Base Salary  
  Vice President          1.5    x    Base Salary  
[END TABLE]
Executives to whom this Guideline applies are encouraged to reach their respective stock ownership level within five years of the date on which an individual assumes an executive position covered by this Guideline. Until an executive reaches the required ownership level, all net shares obtained from the exercise of stock options or other long-term incentive awards must be retained and may not be sold. The ERC reviews the progress of executives, to whom the Guideline applies, toward their stock ownership goal each year. All NEOs have met their respective stock ownership goals. 
The Company implemented a formal policy in 2015, paragraph 10 of the RLI Corp. Insider Trading Policy, prohibiting the NEOs from using financial instruments to reduce the risk of holding company stock (hedging); or from using Company shares for margin trading or collateral purpose.  At the time the policy was implemented, none of the NEOs had engaged in hedging, pledging, or margining shares of RLI stock. Paragraph 10 of the RLI Corp. Insider Trading Policy applies to Directors, Executive Officers (identified on the following page), and other officers of the Company at the level of Vice President or higher and provides as follows.
"Section 16 Reporting Persons, as well as all other officers of the Company at the Vice President level and higher, are prohibited from engaging in financial instruments (forward sales, purchase contracts, equity swaps, collars, exchange funds, etc.) that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Company Securities, including, without limitation, put options, call options and short sales ("hedging"). Such hedging transactions are speculative in nature and could improperly reduce individual risk, and therefore are inconsistent with the Company's risk management and corporate governance policies. 
Securities held in a stock trading account as collateral for a margin loan (a "margin account") or otherwise pledged as collateral for a loan ("pledging") are subject to sale without the owner's consent or even knowledge in some cases. Thus, a margin sale or foreclosure sale of Securities may occur at a time when the pledgor is aware of Material Non-Public Information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in such Securities. Consequently, Section 16 Reporting Persons are prohibited from using Company Securities as collateral in a margin account or otherwise pledging Company Securities as loan collateral. Other officers of the Company at the Vice President level and higher who are not Section 16 Reporting Persons may margin or pledge their Company Securities as collateral in margin accounts or otherwise for loan security, but subject to a maximum of 25% of their individual total Company Security holdings at any time. The preclearance procedures set forth in Section 11 below must be followed prior to using Company Securities as collateral in such events."
Other employees of the Company are not prohibited from hedging or pledging RLI shares, but may not enter into such a transaction during a Company Quiet Period established prior to each quarterly earnings release (and, which may be established, in connection with other transactions or events).

    (4)      Twenty percent of each option grant becomes exercisable one year after the date of the grant and each year thereafter in 20 percent increments. Options expire on the eighth anniversary of the grant date. The 2018 grants were granted pursuant to the 2015 LTIP. The stock option grants vest upon the death or the termination of employment of a stock option recipient due to disability or Retirement. Retirement is defined as termination of employment of an employee with combined age and years of service of 75 or greater. Under FASB ASC Topic 718, option awards to recipients who are current employees, but who qualify for retirement upon departure from the Company, must be expensed at the time of grant, rather than over the five-year vesting period. Because Mr. Michael's age and years of service exceeded 75 in 2006, the ERC decided to grant option awards to Mr. Michael beginning in 2006 on a quarterly basis to avoid a disproportionate expense in the quarter of grant if the option award was made in a single annual grant.

RATIO OF CEO TO MEDIAN EMPLOYEE TOTAL COMPENSATION 
As a result of the recently adopted rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, beginning with our 2018 Proxy Statement, the SEC requires disclosure of the CEO to median employee ratio of total compensation.
We determined the median employee for purposes of this disclosure by generating a report from our payroll system reflecting either the base salary, or wages and overtime, as appropriate, for the calendar year 2017 for every full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary employee (other than Mr. Michael), annualizing that amount for any full-time or part-time employee who had worked for less than a full year.  Because there were no changes to employee compensation arrangements (base salary, incentive programs, or retirement programs) in 2018 the same median employee identified in 2017 was used for purposes of calculating the pay ratio for 2018.
The median employee is an underwriter for the Company and is paid an annual salary, participated in the Company's Underwriter Incentive Program, and participated in the Company's retirement plans (401k and Employee Stock Ownership Plan.)  The median employee and Mr. Michael receive the same percentage contributions of their respective base salaries to the retirement plans, except that the salary on which Mr. Michael's contribution is based is capped pursuant to the IRS regulation at $275,000.  We calculated the median employee's total compensation for 2018 in the same manner used to calculate Mr. Michael's total compensation as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table at page 49.   For the median employee, we included base salary, annual incentive payout, and retirement contributions to the employee's accounts under the Company's retirement plans.  Amounts reflected in Mr. Michael's total compensation in the form of long-term incentive awards and limited perquisites did not apply to the median employee.

SAFEGUARDS AGAINST UNNECESSARY OR EXCESSIVE RISK
Management of the Company, including leaders in legal and human resources, undertook analysis of the Company's compensation structure considering the Company's compensation policies and practices with respect to the named executive officers, as well as the other employees of the Company, to determine whether incentives arising from compensation policies or practices relating to any of the Company's employees would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. This analysis was reviewed and discussed by the ERC and Strategy Committee in their joint meeting in 2018. Based on the analysis and discussions, the ERC and management concluded that the Company's compensation policies and practices do not create risks reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, and again confirmed that the mix of compensation types and time frames tend to align risk-taking with appropriate medium and long-term rewards for the Company. 
The following is a discussion of how the Company's compensation policies and practices for its employees will affect risk management practices and risk-taking incentives. The Company is in the business of insurance and therefore takes on the risk of others in return for appropriate premiums. The Company is therefore particularly sensitive to matching the annual incentives it pays to its employees with the long-term risk and value created by the insurance business it writes. The following discussion is broken into four areas: (1) Senior Management Compensation; (2) Underwriting Compensation; (3) Investment Practices; and (4) Employee and Executive Equity Ownership.
RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement    | SENIOR MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION
The Company's CEO, COO, CFO and Sr. Vice President, Operations participate in the MVP Program, an incentive program described in further detail on pages 37-38. The MVP Program balances risk and opportunity by incorporating a risk-based cost of capital target. The MVP Program contains three features which adjust, for longer-term considerations, the annual measure of shareholder value creation used to determine incentive awards. 
The first is a banking feature that deposits the financial component of MVP-based incentive awards (which may be positive or negative) into a "bonus bank," paying out 33 percent of the bonus bank's balance annually. A bonus bank balance is at risk based on future performance — future positive MVP will increase the bonus bank and payouts, while negative MVP will decrease the bank and payouts. By exposing the bonus bank balance to future performance, the MVP Program provides an incentive to sustain long-term shareholder value creation.
The second is a peer company adjustment factor applicable to the financial component of an MVP Program award that rates the relative performance of the Company to that of its peer group with respect to growth in book value over a five-year period.
The third is Board discretion to reduce awards resulting from excessively risky actions by management, or for other subjective or objective criteria. Additionally, the MVP Program includes a Board approval mechanism, which requires the prior approval of the independent directors of the Board of the financial portion of any annual award (positive or negative) contributed to a MVP bonus bank that exceeds 300 percent of a participant's base salary. This Board approval limit gives the Board the ability to reduce an award if the Board determines that MVP did not correspondingly increase shareholder value.
The ERC believes that the risk-based cost of capital target, long-term banking feature, peer company adjustment factor for five-year growth in book value and Board discretion to reduce incentive awards significantly reduce the likelihood that senior management will take high-risk actions solely to improve short-term financial results to the detriment of long-term performance.
UNDERWRITING COMPENSATION
Underwriters are paid annual incentives under one of two annual incentive programs, the Underwriter Profit Program ("UPP") or the Underwriter Incentive Plan ("UIP"). Participants in UPP, product group executives with oversight responsibility for respective product group underwriting, earn an annual incentive equal to a percentage of underwriting profit created. All other underwriters at the Company participate in UIP. UIP provides incentives based on specific performance factors such as individual and product group loss ratio, underwriting profit, combined ratio, Gross Premiums Written, and new business generation. 
To calculate underwriting profit for purposes of UPP and UIP, actual and estimated losses are subtracted from net premiums to ensure that the annual incentives based on underwriting profit reflect losses that occur over several years. For most products, actual and estimated losses are measured over a four to eight-year period. Over that four to eight-year period, only a partial incentive award is paid each year until all losses develop and a final underwriting profit figure can be determined for the applicable underwriting year. For earthquake insurance, modeled expected losses are used to calculate underwriting profit for incentive purposes since losses are typically experienced over a significantly longer period of time. The ERC believes that by subjecting premiums to risk of actual and estimated losses, the Company's underwriting incentive plans, UPP and UIP, ensure that the income and risk to the Company from underwriting results are closely aligned with the incentives paid to underwriters. In this manner, UPP and UIP are designed to ensure that underwriters are not given an incentive to produce short-term underwriting results without regard to the long-term income and risk consequences of their underwriting.

EMPLOYEE AND EXECUTIVE EQUITY OWNERSHIP
Finally, the Company has a long-standing employee ownership culture, reflected by its ESOP implemented in 1975. The ownership culture creates strong alignment between the interests of employees and shareholders to foster a long-term shareholder value creation perspective. To further support the employee ownership culture, the ERC has designed the executive compensation program to provide equity-based long-term incentives and has implemented a stock ownership guideline requiring significant levels of stock ownership for key executives, described in detail at page 48. The ERC believes that significant stock holdings by employees and executives provide a strong incentive to grow long-term shareholder value and to avoid actions that increase short-term results in a manner that prevents excessive and unnecessary risk to long-term results.
BOARD'S ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT
The Board's risk oversight is accomplished both at the full Board level and through its committee structure. The full Board discusses and considers risk management issues at each of its meetings. The Board will adjust its practices with respect to risk management oversight when it determines it needs to do so and will involve itself in particular areas or business circumstances where its proper exercise of oversight demands it. The Board's role in risk oversight is consistent with the Company's leadership structure, with the Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management having responsibility for assessing and managing the Company's risk exposure, and the Board and its committees providing oversight in connection with these efforts. 
The individual Committee responsibilities with respect to risk oversight are included in their respective Charters.  The Audit Committee has sole authority to retain and compensate outside auditors and reviews and monitors catastrophe management, reserving, reinsurance, regulatory environment, cybersecurity, vendors, and business continuity, among other things. The Company's Vice President, Internal Audit reports jointly to Mr. Michael, administratively, and to the Audit Committee, functionally, to ensure an open and effective line of communication with respect to Company risk oversight. In 2018, the Audit Committee and Strategy Committee met to discuss monitoring and safeguards against unnecessary or excessive risk that could arise from the Company's business practices in the areas over which the Audit Committee provides oversight. The Finance and Investment Committee oversees the Company's investment and corporate finance transactions, policies and guidelines, which includes the oversight of investment performance, investment risk exposure, and the Company's capital structure, among other activities. In 2018, the Finance and Investment Committee and Strategy Committee met to discuss monitoring and safeguards against unnecessary or excessive risk that could arise from the Company's financing and investment activities in the areas over which the Finance and Investment Committee provides 
RLI Corp. 2019 Proxy Statement    |    57
Table of Contents oversight. As discussed in more detail under "Safeguards Against Unnecessary or Excessive Risk," the ERC monitors and oversees executive compensation and incentive programs and associated goals, and, together with the Board, ascertains that such programs do not create the likelihood that employees will take unnecessary and excessive risks to maximize short-term gains to the detriment of long-term performance. The ERC and Strategy Committees met in 2018 to discuss safeguards against unnecessary and excessive risk related to executive compensation, talent, employee benefits, succession, and culture. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee provides oversight of the Company enterprise risk management in areas including, but not limited to corporate governance, regulatory, legislative and related matters, in coordination with other Board committees as appropriate. The Strategy Committee is responsible to the Board for oversight of the Company's corporate strategy and corporate growth/development, and overall enterprise risk management and associated risks, including underwriting risk, information technology risk, growth risk, and insurance market risk. Each of the Board committees works within their area of responsibility and coordinates with other committees, the full Board and executive management in risk management at the Company.
