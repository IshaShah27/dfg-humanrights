NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

The annual meeting of the stockholders ("Annual Meeting") of Bionik Laboratories Corp. ("we," "our," "us," "Bionik" or the "Company") will be held at the offices of the Company at 483 Bay Street, N105, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 2C9 on March 18, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time. The meeting will be held for the following purposes:
These items of business are more fully described in the proxy statement accompanying this notice. The Board of Directors fixed the close of business on January 28, 2019 as the record date for the determination of the holders of our common stock and Exchangeable Shares entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting. Accordingly, only stockholders of record on our books at the close of business on that date will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting and any adjournment and postponement thereof.
Stockholders are cordially invited to attend the Annual Meeting. If you wish to vote shares held in your name at the Annual Meeting, please bring your proxy card or voting instruction form (for holders of Exchangeable Shares), and picture identification to the meeting. Please note that Bionik shares may only be voted by the record owner of the shares, so the holders of Bionik shares held in the name of an intermediary and who wish to vote those shares in person at the meeting must obtain a valid proxy from the intermediary in order to vote the shares in person at the meeting.
Your vote is extremely important. We appreciate you taking the time to vote promptly.

PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
March 18, 2019
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Bionik Laboratories Corp. ("we," "our," "us," "Bionik" or the "Company"), to be voted at the annual meeting of stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held at the offices of the Company at 483 Bay Street, N105, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 2C9 on March 18, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, or at any adjournment or postponement of the meeting.
This proxy statement and form of proxy will first be sent to stockholders on or about February 13, 2019.
The cost of the Annual Meeting, including the cost of preparing and delivering this proxy statement and proxy, will be borne by us. We may use the services of our directors, officers, employees and contractors to solicit proxies, personally or by telephone, but at no additional salary or compensation. We will also request banks, brokers and others who hold our voting securities in nominee names to distribute proxy soliciting materials to beneficial owners and will reimburse such nominees for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses which they may incur in so doing.
Stockholders Entitled to Vote
The holders of record of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share ("Common Stock"), and the holder of the sole share of the Special Voting Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (the "Special Voting Preferred Stock"), as of January 28, 2019 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. The holder of the Special Voting Preferred Stock holds the share as trustee for the holders of exchangeable shares ("Exchangeable Shares") of our indirect subsidiary Bionik Laboratories Inc. ("Bionik Canada") as set forth in the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement among the Company, Bionik Canada and Computershare Trust Company of Canada (the "Trustee"), dated February 26, 2015 (the "Trust Agreement"). The Exchangeable Shares were issued in connection with the acquisition by us of Bionik Canada on February 26, 2015. The Exchangeable Shares have substantially the same economic and voting rights as our Common Stock, and holders are entitled to instruct the Trustee as to how to vote their Exchangeable Shares or they may attend the Annual Meeting and exercise their vote personally.
Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote. The one share of Special Voting Preferred Stock is entitled to an aggregate number of votes equal to the number of Exchangeable Shares issued and outstanding as of the record date. However, the Trustee will exercise each vote attached to the Special Voting Preferred Stock only on the basis of instructions received from the holders of record of the Exchangeable Shares. In the absence of instructions from a holder as to voting, the Trustee will not exercise any voting rights with respect to the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder. The holders of the Common Stock and the holder of the Special Voting Preferred Stock vote together as a single class.
Voting Your Shares 
Common Stock 
Holders of our Common Stock may elect to vote in one of three methods:
If your shares are held in "street name" (held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record), you will receive instructions from the holder of record. You must follow the instructions of the holder of record in order for your shares to be voted. Internet voting also will be offered to stockholders owning shares through certain banks and brokers. If your shares are not registered in your own name and you plan to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you should contact your broker or agent to obtain a legal proxy or broker's proxy card and bring it to the Annual Meeting in order to vote.
Exchangeable Shares 
Holders of Exchangeable Shares are receiving these proxy materials in accordance with the provisions of the Exchangeable Shares and the Trust Agreement. If you are a holder of record of Exchangeable Shares, there are two ways to vote your Exchangeable Shares:
Only holders of Exchangeable Shares whose names appear on the records of Bionik as the registered holders of Exchangeable Shares on the Record Date are entitled to instruct the Trustee as to how to exercise voting rights in respect of their Exchangeable Shares at the Annual Meeting. If on the Record Date your Exchangeable Shares were held, not in your name, but rather in the name of a Nominee, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and these proxy materials, if you have received them, are being forwarded to you by that Nominee. The Nominee holding your account is considered to be the stockholder of record for purposes of instructing the Trustee as to how to vote your Exchangeable Shares. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your Nominee on how to instruct the Trustee to vote your Exchangeable Shares.
Quorum and Votes Required to Approve Proposals
On January 28, 2019, there were a total of 2,337,964 shares of Common Stock and 273,574 Exchangeable Shares outstanding. The presence in person or by proxy of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares entitled to vote at the meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting.
Executed proxies that contain no instructions will be voted:
Other than the matters set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting accompanying this proxy statement, we know of no matters to be brought before the Annual Meeting.
Brokers and other nominees who hold Common Stock in "street name" and do not receive instructions from their clients on how to vote on a particular proposal are permitted to vote on routine proposals but not on non-routine proposals. The absence of votes from brokers on non-routine proposals are referred to as broker non-votes. Proposals such as the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm are considered routine. The election of directors and the proposal regarding the compensation of our named executive officers are non-routine. Thus, if stockholders do not give their broker or nominee specific instructions, their shares may not be voted for the election of directors or the proposal regarding compensation. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum.
There are different voting requirements for the various proposals:
Revocation of Proxy or Voting Instruction Form
If you are a holder of Common Stock, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the proxy is voted at the Annual Meeting. This can be done by either submitting another properly completed proxy (either card or through the internet) with a later date, sending a written notice of revocation to the Company with a later date or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. You should be aware that simply attending the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your previously submitted proxy; rather you must notify a Company representative at the Annual Meeting of your desire to revoke your proxy and vote in person. Written notice revoking a proxy should be sent to the tabulation agent or to Leslie Markow, Chief Financial Officer, at 483 Bay Street, N105, Toronto, Ontario Canada M5G 2C9.
If you are a holder of Exchangeable Shares, you have the right to revoke any instructions previously given to the Trustee by giving written notice of revocation of such instructions to the Trustee or by executing and delivering to the Trustee a later-dated voting instruction by 5:00 p.m., Eastern time on March 17, 2019, at the address indicated on the voting instruction form or for an adjourned meeting not less than 48 hours before the time set for the holding of the adjourned meeting.
YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. PLEASE RETURN THE PROXY BY MAIL PROMPTLY SO YOUR SHARES CAN BE REPRESENTED, EVEN IF YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE MEETING IN PERSON.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Communications to the Board of Directors
Our Board maintains a policy of reviewing and considering communications from our stockholders and other interested parties. Any interested party who desires to contact the Board may do so by fax, telephone, or regular mail addressed to the Board of Directors, c/o Leslie Markow, Chief Financial Officer, 483 Bay Street, N105, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 2C9; telephone: (416) 640-7887 x108, email: lm@bioniklabs.com. Such communications can be sent to the Board by mail in a sealed envelope addressed to an individual director, the non-management directors or the full Board. The Corporate Secretary will deliver the envelope unopened (1) if addressed to a director, to the director, (2) if addressed to the Board, to the Chairman of the Board who will report thereon to the Board, or (3) if addressed to the non-management directors, to the non-management directors. Stockholders can also send electronic communications to the Board via e-mail to Leslie Markow, our Chief Financial Officer, who will forward the communication to the intended recipient.
Our directors periodically review communications from stockholders and other interested parties and determine, in their discretion, whether the communication addresses a matter that is appropriate for consideration by the Board. While we do not have a formal policy regarding attendance of annual meetings, directors are encouraged to attend the annual meeting of stockholders and receive communications directly from stockholders at that time. At our last annual meeting, all of our directors who were directors at that time attended in person or by teleconference.
Board Leadership Structure, Committees and Risk Oversight
The business and affairs of the Company are managed under the direction of our Board which as of February 11, 2019 is comprised of Messrs. Auberton-Herve, Dusseux, Gaston-Dreyfus, Martin, Malone, Matine and Dr. Thevenon.
There have been no changes in any state law or other procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our Board.
Committees of the Board of Directors
Presently, the Board has two standing committees â the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. All members of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee are, and are required by the charters of the respective committees to be, independent as determined under Nasdaq Listing rules.
Audit Committee
On May 30, 2018, our Board formed an Audit Committee, of whom Messrs. Martin (Chairman), Malone and Matine are the members. Each of the members of the Audit Committee is independent, and the Board has determined that Messrs. Martin and Malone are each an "audit committee financial expert," as defined in SEC rules. The Audit Committee acts pursuant to a written charter which is available through our website at www.bioniklabs.com.
The primary functions of the Audit Committee are to assist the Board in overseeing (i) the effectiveness of the Company's accounting and financial reporting processes and internal controls and the audits of the Company's financial statements, (ii) the qualifications, independence, appointment, retention, compensation and performance of the Company's registered public accounting firm and (iii) the performance of the Company's internal audit department or department or person(s) having the equivalent responsibility and functions.
Compensation Committee
On May 30, 2018, our Board formed a Compensation Committee, of whom Messrs. Malone (Chairman) and Martin and Dr. Thevenon are the members. Each of the members of the Compensation Committee is independent. The Compensation Committee acts pursuant to a written charter which is available through our website at www.bioniklabs.com.
The primary functions of the Compensation Committee are to (i) review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to executive compensation, (ii) determine and review the CEO's and other executive officers' compensation, and (iii) make recommendations to the Board concerning (a) compensation and (b) adoption of equity incentive plans.
Risk Oversight
Companies face a variety of risks, including financial reporting, legal, credit, liquidity, and operational risk. The Board believes an effective risk management system will (1) timely identify the material risks that the Company faces, (2) communicate necessary information with respect to material risks to senior executives and, as appropriate, to the Board or relevant Board Committee (if any), (3) implement appropriate and responsive risk management strategies consistent with Company's risk profile, and (4) integrate risk management into Company decision-making.
The Board as a whole oversees risk management after receiving briefings provided by management and advisors as well as its own analysis and conclusions regarding the adequacy of the Company's risk management processes.
Board Meetings
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, our Board met 11 times. No director who served as such in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 attended less than 75% of the meetings held during such period.
Director Nominations and Qualifications
Our Board has no nominating committee. The Board has determined that director nominees could be selected, or recommended for our Board's selection, by the independent members of the Board. The Board does not currently have a charter or written policy with regard to the nomination process. The nominations of the directors standing for election at the Annual Meeting for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 were recommended and approved by our independent directors.
At this time, we do not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of any director nominees recommended by our stockholders because historically we have not received recommendations from our stockholders and the costs of establishing and maintaining procedures for the consideration of stockholder nominations would be unduly burdensome. However, any recommendations received from stockholders will be evaluated in the same manner that potential nominees recommended by Board members, management or other parties are evaluated. Any stockholder nominations proposed for consideration should include the nominee's name and qualifications for Board membership and should be addressed to: Leslie Markow, Chief Financial Officer, Bionik Laboratories Corp., 483 Bay Street, N105, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 2C9. We do not intend to treat stockholder recommendations in any manner different from other recommendations.
Qualifications for consideration as a director nominee may vary according to the particular areas of expertise being sought as a complement to the existing Board composition. However, in making its nominations, our Board as a whole considers, among other things, an individual's business experience, industry experience, financial background, breadth of knowledge about issues affecting our company, time available for meetings and consultation regarding company matters and other particular skills and experience possessed by the individual.
We do not currently employ an executive search firm, or pay a fee to any other third party, to locate qualified candidates for director positions.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy
We adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to, among other persons, our principal executive officers, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, and persons performing similar functions. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our website www.bioniklabs.com.
Director Independence
We use the definition of "independence" of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an "independent director" is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship, which, in the opinion of the Company's Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if:
Under such definitions, Messrs. Martin, Malone, Matine, Gaston-Dreyfus and Dr. Thevenon are considered independent directors.
Audit Report of the Board of Directors
The Board has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements of Bionik Laboratories Corp. for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, with management and have reviewed related written disclosures of MNP LLP, our independent accountants of the matters required to be discussed by SAS 114 (Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, AU Section 380), as amended, with respect to those statements. We have reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from MNP LLP required by regulatory and professional standards and have discussed with MNP LLP its independence in connection with its audit of our most recent financial statements. Based on this review and these discussions, the Board recommended that the financial statements be included in the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
We have also reviewed the various fees that we paid or accrued to MNP LLP during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 for services they rendered in connection with our annual audits and quarterly reviews, as well as for any other non-audit services they rendered.
The following table shows the fees for professional services rendered by MNP LLP for the audit of our financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and fees billed for other services rendered by MNP LLP during those periods:
Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our financial statements and review of the interim financial statements included in quarterly reports and services that are normally provided by the above auditors in connection with statutory and regulatory fillings or engagements. Audit-related fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the review of SEC filings or other reports containing the audited financial statements. Tax fees consist of fees to prepare the Company's federal and state income tax returns. Other fees relate to advisory services related research on accounting or other regulatory matters.
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
Our Board is in the process of adopting a policy on pre-approval of audit and permissible non-audit services.

Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End
The following table presents the outstanding equity awards held by each of the named executive officers as of the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, as adjusted to reflect the Company's one-for-one hundred fifty reverse stock split.
On February 25, 2015, 1,753 post-Acquisition Transaction common shares were issued to two former lenders connected with a $241,185 loan received and repaid in fiscal 2013. As part of the consideration for the initial loan, Mr. Prywata and Mr. Caires, a former executive of the Company, collectively transferred 2,098 common shares to the lenders. For contributing the common shares to the lenders, the Company intends to reimburse them 2,134 common shares; however these shares have not yet been issued.
Long-Term Incentive Plans and Awards
Since our incorporation on January 8, 2010 through March 31, 2018 we did not have any long-term incentive plans that provided compensation intended to serve as incentive for performance. No individual grants or agreements regarding future payouts under non-stock price-based plans have been made to any executive officer or any director or any employee or consultant since our inception through March 31, 2018.
Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans
We adopted, and a majority of our stockholders approved, the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan"). Under such plan, we may grant equity based incentive awards, including options, restricted stock, and other stock-based awards, to any directors, employees, advisers, and consultants that provide services to us or any of our subsidiaries on terms and conditions that are from time to time determined by us. An aggregate of up to 15% of our common stock and common stock reserved for issuance from the Exchangeable Shares are reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan, and options for the purchase of 170,675 shares of our common stock have been granted and are outstanding as of March 31, 2018. The purpose of the 2014 Plan is to provide financial incentives for selected directors, employees, advisers, and consultants of the Company and/or its subsidiaries, thereby promoting the long-term growth and financial success of the Company.
The table below sets forth information as of March 31, 2018 with respect to compensation plans under which our common stock or Exchangeable Shares are authorized for issuance, as adjusted to reflect the Company's one-for-one hundred fifty reverse stock split.
Director Compensation
The following table sets forth a summary of the compensation we paid to our non-employee directors during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.
Other than Mr. Auberton-Herve's annual fee as Chairman of $180,000, our non-employee directors are entitled to receive an annual cash payment of up to $20,000 (until February 2018) and thereafter $50,000 per annum, as well as reimbursement for expenses incurred by them in connection with attending Board meetings. The Company has accrued for these fees but has not paid any amounts other then $210,000 to Mr. Auberton-Herve during the year ended March 31, 2018, part of which related to consulting fees prior to him becoming Chairman. Our directors also are eligible for stock option grants. Mr. Matine and Dr. Thevenon were appointed to the Board subsequent to March 31, 2018.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
The following table shows the beneficial ownership of our Common Stock as of February 11, 2019 held by (i) each person known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent (5%) of our Common Stock; (ii) each director; (iii) each executive officer; and (iv) all directors and executive officers as a group, as adjusted to reflect the Company's one-for-one hundred fifty reverse stock split.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC, and generally includes voting power and/or investment power with respect to the securities held. Shares of Common Stock subject to options and warrants currently exercisable or which may become exercisable within 60 days of February 11, 2019 are deemed outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding such options or warrants for purposes of computing the number of shares and percentage beneficially owned by such person, but are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage beneficially owned by any other person. Except as indicated in the footnotes to this table, the persons or entities named have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of our Common Stock shown as beneficially owned by them.
The following table provides for percentage ownership assuming 2,611,538 shares are issued outstanding as of February 11, 2019, consisting of 2,341,460 shares of Common Stock and 270,078 Common Stock equivalents through the Exchangeable Shares. The percentages below also assume the exchange by all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares for an equal number of shares of our Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Exchangeable Shares. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each beneficial holder of our Common Stock is our corporate address.

PROPOSAL FOR
APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
(Proposal 2 on Proxy Card and Voting Instruction Form)
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, enables our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the rules of the SEC and commonly referred to as "Say-on-Pay." The Board has decided that it is a matter of good corporate governance to hold the advisory vote on compensation once every three years until the next advisory vote on frequency occurs. An advisory vote on the frequency of stockholder votes to approve executive compensation is required to be held at least once every six years. Accordingly, unless the Board modifies its policy on the frequency of future votes, we expect to have our next advisory vote on compensation at our 2021 meeting.
As described more fully under the heading "Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers" in this proxy statement, our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain our named executive officers who are critical to our success. The programs are designed to align the interest of our named executive officers with our stockholders and to fairly reward them for creating stockholder value and achieving our business objectives. We believe that the various elements of our executive compensation program work together to promote our goal of ensuring that total compensation should be related to our company performance and individual performance.
Stockholders are urged to read the section of this proxy statement entitled "Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers", which discusses and discloses our executive compensation policies, including the Summary Compensation Table which includes tabular and narrative information about the compensation of our named executive officers. This discussion includes information about the compensation of our named executive officers and our executive compensation programs for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Our Board believes that these programs are effective in implementing our compensation philosophy and in achieving our goals.
We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our executive compensation program as described in this proxy statement. This Say-on-Pay proposal gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 executive compensation. The vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and procedures described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we ask our stockholders, on an advisory basis, to approve the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Bionik Laboratories Corp. approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of its named executive officers, as disclosed in the proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Summary Compensation Table and any related narrative discussion.
The Say-on-Pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on our Company or our Board. However, our Board values the opinion of our stockholders and to the extent that there is any significant vote against the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement, we will consider our stockholders' concerns and our Board will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.
Vote Necessary to Approve Proposal 2
The affirmative vote of a majority of the  voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote is required to approve our executive compensation program. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the approval of our executive compensation program, as described in the "Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers" section of this proxy statement and proxies received by the Board of Directors will be so voted in the absence of instructions to the contrary.
PROPOSAL FOR
RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS
(Proposal 3 on Proxy Card and Voting Instruction Form)
On February 6, 2019, the Board approved the appointment of MNP LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm to conduct our financial audit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, and solicits the ratification of this appointment by the stockholders.
Neither MNP LLP, any of its members nor any of its associates, to the best of our knowledge, has any financial interest in our business or affairs, direct or indirect, or any relationship with us other than in connection with its duties as independent accountants. Representatives of MNP LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, where such representatives will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and are expected to be able to respond to appropriate questions.
Vote Necessary to Ratify Proposal 3
The affirmative vote of a majority of the   voting power of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote is required for the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the ratification of appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm as described in this Proposal Number 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm business.
We are not currently a party in any legal proceeding or governmental regulatory proceeding nor are we currently aware of any pending or potential legal proceeding or governmental regulatory proceeding proposed to be initiated against us that would have a material adverse effect on us or our business.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires the Company's officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than ten (10%) percent of a class of equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the principal exchange upon which such securities are traded or quoted. Reporting Persons are also required to furnish copies of such reports filed pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with the Company.
Based on our review of the copies of such forms received by us, and to the best of our knowledge, all executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders filed the required reports in a timely manner in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, except for Mr. Auberton-Herve, who failed to timely file his Form 3, Mr. Dusseux, who failed to timely file a Form 4 showing 1 transaction, Mr. Martin, who failed to timely file his Form 3, and Mr. Malone, who failed to timely file his Form 3.
PROPOSALS OF STOCKHOLDERS FOR PRESENTATION
AT THE NEXT ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
We anticipate that the next annual meeting of stockholders will be held in November, 2019. Any stockholder who desires to submit a proper proposal for inclusion in the proxy materials related to the next annual meeting of stockholders must do so in writing in accordance with our Amended and Restated Bylaws and Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, and it must be received at our principal executive offices no later than July 18, 2019 in order to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement for the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders. For proposals sought to be included in our proxy statement, the proponent must be a record or beneficial owner entitled to vote on such proposal at the next annual meeting and must continue to own such security entitling such right to vote through the date on which the meeting is held.
In order for any proposal that is not submitted for inclusion in next year's proxy statement (as described in the preceding paragraph) to be presented directly at next year's annual meeting, we must receive written notice of the proposal in a timely manner. If such notice is received, proxies may be voted at the discretion of management if we advise stockholders in next year's proxy statement about the nature of the matter and how management intends to vote on such matter.

This process is commonly referred to as "householding." The Company does not participate in householding, but some brokers may for stockholders who do not take electronic delivery of proxy materials. If your shares are held in a brokerage account and you have received notice from your broker that it will send one copy of the Notice or proxy materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or instruct your broker otherwise. If, at any time, you would prefer to receive a separate copy of the Notice or proxy materials, or if you share an address with another stockholder and receive multiple copies but would prefer to receive a single copy, please notify your broker. The Company promptly will deliver to a stockholder who received one copy of the Notice or proxy materials as a result of householding a separate copy upon the stockholder's written or oral request directed to Bionik Laboratories Corp., 483 Bay Street, N105, Toronto, Ontario Canada M5G 2C9; Telephone: (416) 640-7887 x108; Email: lmarkow@bioniklabs.com.

Alternatively, you may instruct the Trustee to give you or a person designated by you a proxy to exercise personally the voting rights attached to your Exchangeable Shares. To instruct the Trustee as to how you wish to exercise your voting rights, you must complete, sign, date and return the enclosed Voting Instruction Form to the Trustee by 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on March 17, 2019. The Trustee will not be obligated to act on any instructions received after that time.
You have the right to revoke any instructions to the Trustee by giving written notice of revocation to the Trustee or by executing and delivering to the Trustee a later-dated Voting Instruction Form. No notice of revocation or later-dated Voting Instruction Form, however, will be effective unless received by the Trustee prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on March 17, 2019.
Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please sign, date and return the Voting Instruction Form in the envelope provided in order to ensure that your Exchangeable Shares will be represented at the Annual Meeting.
Only registered holders of Exchangeable Shares are permitted to instruct the Trustee as to how to vote their Exchangeable Shares at the Annual Meeting or to attend and vote at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy as described above. You may be a beneficial owner of Exchangeable Shares (a "Non-Registered Holder") if your Exchangeable Shares are registered either:
Bionik Laboratories Corp. has distributed copies of the Notice of Meeting, the Proxy Statement and this Notice to Exchangeable Shareholders (collectively, the "meeting materials") to Intermediaries who are required to forward these meeting materials to Non-Registered Holders unless a Non-Registered Holder has waived the right to receive them. If you are a Non-Registered Holder who has not waived the right to receive meeting materials you will be given either:
(i)       a voting instruction form, which has already been signed by the Intermediary (typically by a facsimile, stamped signature) which specifies the number of Exchangeable Shares beneficially owned by you but which is otherwise uncompleted. This voting instruction form need not be signed by you. In this case, if you wish to direct the voting of the Exchangeable Shares held by you or attend and vote at the Annual Meeting (or have another person attend and vote on your behalf) you should properly complete the voting instruction form and deposit it with the Trustee prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on March 17, 2019; or
(ii)      a voting instruction form, which must be completed and signed by you in accordance with the directions on the voting instruction form.
The purpose of these procedures is to permit you, as a Non-Registered Holder, to direct the voting of the Exchangeable Shares you beneficially own or to attend and vote at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy. A Non-Registered Holder generally may revoke a voting instruction form given to an Intermediary by providing written notice to the Intermediary in a reasonable time period prior to the Annual Meeting. Non-Registered Holders should carefully follow the instructions of their Intermediaries and their service companies and contact their Intermediaries promptly if they need assistance.
