3. To approve an amendment and restatement of our certificate of incorporation to increase the total number of authorized shares of common stock from 113,000,000 shares to 226,000,000 shares and to remove certain provisions that are no longer applicable (the "Authorized Share Increase Proposal");

The Notice also contains instructions on how to request a printed copy of the proxy materials.

Record Date; Shares of Common Stock Outstanding and Entitled to Vote 
We have fixed the close of business on October 3, 2018 as the record date for determination of the holders of our common stock entitled to notice of and to attend and vote at the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. There were approximately 1,097 holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on the record date. At the close of business on the record date 71,115,444 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding. Each share of common stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote at the Annual Meeting on all matters properly presented at the Annual Meeting. See the section titled, "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management of MEI Pharma" in this proxy statement for information regarding persons known to our management to be the beneficial owners of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. 
Voting and Revocation of Proxies 
The proxy accompanying this proxy statement is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors of MEI Pharma for use at the Annual Meeting. 
If you are a stockholder of record of MEI Pharma as of the record date referred to above, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting, via the Internet by following the instructions provided in the Notice, via telephone by calling the toll-free number found on the proxy card, or vote by proxy using the enclosed proxy card. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person if you have already voted by proxy. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To vote in person:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If you hold shares in your name as the stockholder of record, you may vote those shares in person at the Annual  Meeting by giving us a signed proxy card or ballot before voting is closed. If you want to do that, please bring proof of identification with you to the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you submit a  proxy card for your shares in advance as described above, so your vote will be counted even if you later decide not to attend.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If you hold shares in street name through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may vote those shares in person at  the Annual Meeting only if you obtain and bring with you a signed proxy from your nominee giving you the right to vote the shares. To do this, you should contact your nominee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To vote on the Internet, go to the website indicated on the Notice to complete an electronic proxy card. You will  be asked to provide MEI Pharma's number and a control number from the enclosed proxy card. Your vote must be received by 1:00 a.m. (Pacific Time) on November 29, 2018 to be counted.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To vote over the telephone, dial the toll-free number on your proxy card or voting instruction form using a  touch-tone phone and follow the recorded instructions. You will be asked to provide MEI Pharma's number and control number from the enclosed proxy card. Your vote must be received by 1:00 a.m. (Pacific Time) on November 29, 2018 to be  counted.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To vote using the proxy card, simply mark, sign and date your proxy card and return it promptly in the  postage-paid envelope provided. If we receive your signed proxy card before the Annual Meeting, we will vote your shares as you direct.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held by your broker as your nominee (that is, in "street name"), you will need to obtain a proxy card from the institution that holds your shares and follow the instructions included on that proxy card regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your MEI Pharma shares. If you do not give instructions to your broker, your broker can vote your MEI Pharma shares with respect to "discretionary" items but not with respect to "non-discretionary" items. The proposals relating to the election of directors (Proposal No. 1), the approval of the Amended and Restated 2008 Equity Plan (Proposal No. 2), and the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers (Proposal No. 4) are non-discretionary items. On non-  discretionary items, for which you do not give your broker instructions, your broker will not vote your shares and, accordingly, the shares will be treated as broker non-votes. 
All properly executed proxies that are not revoked will be voted at the Annual Meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy. If a holder of our common stock executes and returns a proxy and does not specify otherwise, the shares represented by that proxy will be voted "FOR" Proposal No. 1 electing the three nominees to our Board of Directors; "FOR" Proposal No. 2 to approve the adoption of the 2008 Equity Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock that may be subject to awards and make certain other changes to the plan terms included in the plan document attached as Annex A; "FOR" Proposal No. 3 to approve an amendment and restatement of our certificate of incorporation to increase the total number of authorized shares of common stock from 113,000,000 shares to 226,000,000 shares and to remove certain provisions that are no longer applicable; "FOR" Proposal No. 4 to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to MEI Pharma's named executive officers; and "FOR" Proposal No. 5 ratifying the appointment of BDO USA, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. 
Our stockholders of record may change their votes at any time before their proxy is voted at the Annual Meeting in one of three ways. First, a stockholder of record can send a written notice to the Secretary of MEI Pharma stating that the stockholder would like to revoke its proxy. Second, a stockholder of record can submit new proxy instructions either on a new proxy card, by telephone or via the Internet. Third, a stockholder of record can attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. Attendance alone will not revoke a proxy. If a stockholder of record has instructed a broker to vote its shares of common stock, the stockholder must follow directions received from its broker to change those instructions. 
Quorum and Vote of MEI Pharma Stockholders Required 
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of one-third of the shares of the common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the Annual Meeting, we expect that the meeting would be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards a quorum. 
For Proposal No. 1, the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast is required to elect a director when a quorum is present. "Votes cast" excludes abstentions and any broker non-votes. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes (shares held by brokers that do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received voting instructions from their clients) will have no effect on the election of directors. 
For Proposals No. 2, 4 and 5, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal will be required for approval. An abstention with respect to these proposals will be deemed present, but will not be voted. Accordingly, an abstention will have the effect of a vote "against" the proposal. Broker non-votes on a proposal will have no effect on determining whether stockholders have approved the proposal. 
For Proposal No. 3 the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our shares of common stock will be required for approval. Abstentions (shares present at the meeting and voted "abstain") will have the effect of a vote "against" this proposal. 
At the record date for the Annual Meeting, the directors and executive officers of MEI Pharma owned less than 1% of the outstanding shares of MEI Pharma common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Solicitation of Proxies 
In addition to solicitation by mail, our directors, officers, employees and agents may solicit proxies from our stockholders by personal interview, telephone, telegram or otherwise. Arrangements will also be made with brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries who are record holders of our common stock for the forwarding of solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of our common stock. We will pay the cost of soliciting proxies, including reimbursing applicable brokers, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses they incur in connection with the forwarding of solicitation materials.  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS (PROPOSAL NO. 1) 
The Board of Directors has nominated Mr. Charles V. Baltic III, Dr. Nicholas R. Glover and Mr. Frederick W. Driscoll to serve as directors for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in fiscal 2022 and until their successors have been elected and qualified. Each of the nominees has consented to be named herein and to serve if elected. We do not know of anything that would preclude any nominee from serving if elected. If any nominee becomes unable to stand for election as a director at the Annual Meeting as a result of an event not anticipated by the Board of Directors, the proxy may be voted for a substitute designated by the Board of Directors. The identity and a brief biography of each nominee is set forth below. The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Charles V. Baltic III, Dr. Nicholas R. Glover and Mr. Frederick W. Driscoll are independent directors within the meaning of the listing standards of the NASDAQ Capital Market. 
Our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated by-laws provide that the authorized number of directors shall be determined by a resolution of the Board of Directors, but shall be between two and nine. The number of directors currently authorized by the Board of Directors is eight. Under our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with the classes serving three-year staggered terms. Each class contains, as near as possible, one-third of the whole number of directors, with members of each class holding office for a three-year term. There are currently three directors whose terms expire at the annual meeting to be held in fiscal 2020, two directors whose terms expire at the annual meeting to be held in fiscal 2021 and three directors whose terms expire at the Annual Meeting. 
Mr. Charles V. Baltic III, Dr. Nicholas R. Glover and Mr. Frederick W. Driscoll are members of the class of directors whose terms expire at the Annual Meeting.

Nominating and Governance Committee 
Mr. Baltic has served as Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee since September 2012. The other members of the Nominating Committee are Dr. White and Dr. Reynolds. MEI Pharma's Nominating and Governance Committee Charter is posted on its website at www.meipharma.com. The Nominating and Governance Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for assisting the Board of Directors in: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• identifying qualified individuals who possess the desired experience and skills to serve on the Board;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• proposing chairpersons and members on committees to the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• considering all qualified director candidates identified by the Nominating and Governance Committee, or by  stockholders, in the event any member of the Board of Directors does not wish to continue in service or if the Board of Directors decides not to re-nominate a member for  re-election;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• overseeing the Board evaluation process and evaluating the size and composition of the Board; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• evaluating any stockholder proposal and whether to recommend to the Board of Directors and whether the Company  shall support or oppose the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders who would like to propose an independent director candidate for consideration for nomination by the Board of Directors at next year's annual meeting of stockholders may do so by submitting the candidate's name, resume and biographical information to the attention of Brian G. Drazba, Secretary, MEI Pharma, Inc., 3611 Valley Centre Drive, Suite 500, San Diego, California 92130. All stockholder nominations received by the Secretary, which comply with the advance notice provisions of the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws, will be presented to the Nominating and Governance Committee for the same consideration as individuals identified by the Nominating and Governance Committee through other means. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews the prospective candidate's biographical information and assesses each candidate's independence, diversity, skills and expertise based on a variety of factors, including the following criteria: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the candidate has exhibited behavior that indicates he or she is committed to the highest ethical  standards;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the candidate has had broad business, governmental, non-profit or  professional experience that indicates that the candidate will be able to make a significant and immediate contribution to the Board of Directors' discussion and decision-making; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the candidate will be able to devote sufficient time and energy to the performance of his or her duties  as a director.  
[END TABLE]
 Application of these factors requires the exercise of judgment by members of the Nominating and Governance Committee when the Committee makes recommendations to the Board of Directors, and cannot be measured in a quantitative way. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers, as one factor among many, the diversity of Board candidates, which may include diversity of skills and experience as well as geographic, gender, age, and ethnic diversity. The Nominating and Governance Committee does not, however, have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying Board candidates. The Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors generally value the broad business experience and independent business judgment in the health care, life sciences and other fields of each member. Specifically, Dr. White is qualified for the Board based on her business and medical experience in the healthcare field, including oncology research. Mr. Driscoll is qualified for the Board based on his business experience in the pharmaceutical industry in the area of finance and his status as an "audit committee expert". Mr. Rueckert is qualified for the Board based on his business experience in the investment industry and his status as an "audit committee expert". Mr. Baltic is qualified for the Board based on his business experience in the health care investment banking industry. Dr. Reynolds is qualified for the Board based on his medical experience and experience in clinical development and regulatory and medical affairs. Dr. Glover is qualified for the Board based on his business experience and his drug development experience in the oncology field. Dr. Clemens is qualified for the Board based on his business and pharmaceutical industry experience in the areas of commercialization, strategic marketing, business development and drug development in oncology. Dr. Gold is qualified for the Board based on his experience as the Company's chief executive officer and other experience in clinical development and the pharmaceutical industry. 
In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee oversees compliance by the Company with its legal and regulatory obligations and periodically reviews: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's Insider Trading Policy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's Corporate Disclosure Policy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's restated certificate of incorporation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's amended and restated bylaws; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the independent status of directors.  
[END TABLE]
Director Independence 
The Board of Directors has determined the independence of each director in accordance with the elements of independence set forth in the NASDAQ listing standards. Based upon information solicited from each director, the Board of Directors has determined that each of Mr. Rueckert, Dr. White, Mr. Driscoll, Dr. Reynolds, Mr. Baltic, Dr. Glover and Dr. Clemens has no material relationship with MEI Pharma and is "independent" within the meaning of NASDAQ's director independence standards as currently in effect. In making the foregoing determinations, the Board of Directors has considered both the objective tests set forth in the NASDAQ independence standards and subjective measures with respect to each director necessary to determine that no relationships exist that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment by each such director in carrying out responsibilities of a director. Dr. Gold, as President and Chief Executive Officer, is not considered independent in accordance with NASDAQ's requirements. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Previously, the Board of Directors created the position of Lead Director to carry out the duties of the Chairman until the Nominating and Governance Committee identified, and the Board appointed, a director to the Chairman position. In December 2015, the Board of Directors eliminated the Lead Director position and elected Dr. White to the position of Chairman of the Board. Dr. White previously held the position of Lead Director since March 2013. 
The Board of Directors does not have a policy addressing whether the same person should serve as both the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board or if the roles should be separate. Our Board believes that it should have the flexibility to make its determination based upon what it considers to be the appropriate leadership structure for the Company at the time. The Board believes that its current leadership structure, with Dr. Gold serving   as President and Chief Executive Officer and Dr. White serving as Chairman of the Board is appropriate for the Company at this time. 
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
Risk is an integral part of the Board and Committee deliberations throughout the year. While the Board has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, various committees of the Board also have responsibility for risk management. In particular, the Audit Committee focuses on financial risk, including internal controls, and receives financial risk assessment reports from management. Risks related to the compensation programs are reviewed by the Compensation Committee. The Board is advised by these committees of significant risks and management's response through periodic updates. 
Stockholder Communications with the Board of Directors 
The Company's stockholders may communicate with the Board of Directors, including non-executive directors or officers, by sending written communications addressed to such person or persons in care of MEI Pharma, Inc., Attention: Secretary, 3611 Valley Centre Drive, Suite 500, San Diego, California, 92130. All communications will be compiled by the Secretary and submitted to the addressee. If the Board of Directors modifies this process, the revised process will be posted on the Company's website. 
Appointment of Directors 
The Company's restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide that the number of directors will be set by resolution of the board, but shall be between two and nine. The Company currently has eight directors. 
Under the Company's restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, directors are to be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders for a term of three years unless the director is removed, retires or the office is vacated earlier. The board is divided into three classes with respect to the term of office, with the terms of office of one class expiring each successive year. This classified board provision could discourage a third party from making a tender offer for the Company's shares or attempting to obtain control of MEI Pharma. It could also delay stockholders who do not agree with the policies of the Board of Directors from removing a majority of the Board of Directors for two years. 
A director may resign at any time. The resignation is effective upon receipt of notice. Any or all directors may be removed with or without cause by a resolution of stockholders entitled to vote to elect directors. Vacancies from resignation or removal or expansion of the size of the board may be filled by resolution of a majority of directors then in office or by a sole remaining director, and any director so appointed shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred. 
Attendance of Directors at Board Meetings and Shareholder Meetings 
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Board of Directors held a total of four meetings, and each director attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and of the meetings of each committee of the Board of Directors on which such director served. 
All directors are expected to attend the Company's annual meetings of stockholders. All directors then in office attended the annual meeting of stockholders held in December 2017. 
Code of Ethics 
The Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to the Company's directors and employees and the Company has posted the text of the policy on its website at www.meipharma.com.

2008 STOCK OMNIBUS EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN 
(PROPOSAL NO. 2) 
MEI Pharma's Amended and Restated 2008 Stock Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, which we refer to as the "2008 Equity Plan," was initially adopted in 2008 as the "MEI Pharma, Inc. 2008 Stock Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan." The MEI Pharma Board of Directors believes having stock available for grant to be a significant contributing factor to the continued success of MEI Pharma, by enabling the Company to attract, motivate and retain directors, officers, employees and advisors who are expected to contribute to its success and achieve its corporate goals, which the Company believes will benefit its stockholders. The Board of Directors was assisted by its independent compensation consultant FW Cook in determining an appropriate increase of the number of authorized shares under the 2008 Equity Plan. 
Effective upon the approval by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting, the MEI Pharma Board of Directors has amended and restated the 2008 Equity Plan, subject to the approval of our stockholders, to increase the number of shares of our common stock authorized for future grant under the 2008 Equity Plan by 8,903,794 shares from 2,896,206 shares available for new awards so that a total of 11,800,000 shares of our common stock will be available for new awards. As of the date stockholders approve this restatement, in addition to the shares subject to outstanding awards as of June 30, 2018 (the "Outstanding Shares Granted"), (i) 11,800,000 shares available for new awards, less (ii) one share for every one share that was subject to an option or Stock Appreciation Right ("SAR") granted after June 30, 2018 and 1.25 shares for every one share that was subject to a stock unit, stock award or other stock-based award ("Full Value Award") granted after June 30, 2018, will be authorized for grants made under the 2008 Equity Plan. If stockholders approve the amendment and restatement of the 2008 Equity Plan, then the total shares authorized for issuance under the plan as of June 30, 2018 will be 18,496,857, which is the sum of 11,800,000 shares available for issuance under future awards plus the Outstanding Shares Granted. The Outstanding Shares Granted consists of 6,281,615 shares of MEI Pharma stock options and 332,193 outstanding stock units, which Outstanding Shares Granted constitutes 6,696,856 plan shares if the 332,193 stock units are converted to shares under the 2008 Equity Plan using the 1.25 fungible ratio applicable to the amended and restated 2008 Equity Plan. 
We are also amending and restating the 2008 Equity Plan to make certain other changes to the plan terms included in the plan document attached as Annex A, including (i) to reflect the elimination of the deductibility of certain performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"), as a result of the adoption of the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and (ii) to provide that dividends and dividend equivalents will become vested and payable only if the underlying awards are vested and payable. 
We are seeking stockholder approval (i) in order to meet the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market, (ii) to confirm that the maximum grant date value of shares subject to awards granted to any non-employee director during any calendar year for services provided as a non-employee director, taken together with any cash fees paid or payable to such non-employee director for services performed as a non-employee director for such year, is $400,000 and (iii) in order for incentive stock options ("ISOs") to meet the requirements of the Code. 
The following table sets forth certain information about the 2008 Equity Plan as of June 30, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Number of shares relating to stock options outstanding as of June 30,  2018      6,281,615   
   Weighted average remaining term of outstanding options      7.3 years   
   Weighted average exercise price of outstanding options    $ 3.08   
   Number of Full Value Awards comprised of stock units outstanding as of  June 30, 2018      332,193   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Remaining number of authorized shares as of June 30, 2018 for future  grants before stockholder approval of new shares requested under Proposal No. 2      2,896,206   
   New Plan shares to be approved by stockholders under Proposal  No. 2      8,903,794   
   Total number of authorized shares as of June 30, 2018 for future grants  after approval of new shares requested under Proposal No. 2      11,800,000   
[END TABLE]
The request for stockholders to approve a total of 11,800,000 shares available for new awards under the 2008 Equity Plan (which is to be reduced by grants made after June 30, 2018) considers the Company's industry, size, volatility, and an estimate of the policies of some influential institutional stockholders and related vote advisory services. The amount of new stock plan dilution incurred by peer companies' stockholders was reviewed to estimate the equivalent new share amount under the 2008 Equity Plan. The proposed total number of shares available for issuance under new awards (11,800,000) was then determined at a level expected to be sufficient for between two and four years of expected new awards. 
The 2008 Equity Plan, as amended and restated, is set forth in Annex A to this proxy statement, and the following description of the 2008 Equity Plan, as amended and restated, is only intended to be a summary of the key provisions of the 2008 Equity Plan. Such summary is qualified in its entirety by the actual text of the 2008 Equity Plan, as amended and restated, to which reference is made. 
Description of the 2008 Equity Plan as Proposed to be Amended and Restated 
Purpose 
The purpose of the 2008 Equity Plan is to provide a means for us to attract, retain, motivate and reward present and prospective employees, non-employee directors and advisors by increasing their ownership interests in the Company. 
Administration of the 2008 Equity Plan 
The 2008 Equity Plan is generally administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, except that the Board of Directors will perform the committee's functions under the 2008 Equity Plan for purposes of grants of awards to members of the Board of Directors, and, to the extent permitted under applicable law and regulation, may perform any other function of the committee as well. The Compensation Committee (or Board of Directors, applicable) has the authority, among other things, to: (i) select the directors, officers, employees and advisors entitled to be granted awards under the 2008 Equity Plan; (ii) determine the types and amounts of awards, or combinations thereof, and whether such awards are to operate on a tandem basis or in conjunction with other awards; and (iii) determine the other terms and conditions of any award, including, without limitation, any restrictions or limitations on transfer, any vesting schedules or the acceleration thereof and any forfeiture provisions or waivers thereof; provided that no stock option or SAR shall have a term longer than ten years from the date of grant. 
The Compensation Committee's authority with respect to awards to employees who are not directors or executive officers may be delegated to our officers or managers, including our Chief Executive Officer. This delegation may be revoked at any time. 
As of October 3, 2018, 37 employees and seven non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the 2008 Equity Plan. However, because awards will be granted at the discretion of the Compensation Committee (or its delegate) or the Board, it is not possible to determine the benefits or amounts that will be received by any particular person in the future. 
Types of Awards 
MEI Pharma's present and prospective directors, officers, employees, and advisors and those of its subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible for awards under the 2008 Equity Plan. 
Under the 2008 Equity Plan, individual awards may take the form of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• stock options, the exercise price of which may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares  covered by such grant on the date of grant, measured at the closing market price of the  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     common stock on such date, and the exercise price may be paid in such manner as specified by the Compensation Committee, including in cash, by tendering shares already owned, through a  broker-assisted cashless exercise, through "net exercise" or by such other method as the Compensation Committee shall approve;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• SARs, the base price of which may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares covered by such  grant on the date of grant, measured at the closing market price of the common stock on such date;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• restricted stock, consisting of shares of MEI Pharma common stock that are subject to forfeiture based upon the  failure to satisfy employment-related restrictions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• restricted stock units;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• deferred stock, representing the right to receive shares of MEI Pharma common stock in the future;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• bonus stock and awards in lieu of cash compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• other awards, not otherwise provided for, denominated or payable in, or the value of which is based in whole or  in part upon the market or book value of, MEI Pharma stock, including Dividend Equivalents, as described below.  
[END TABLE]
Dividend Equivalents. Dividend equivalents consist of a right to receive cash, other awards or other property equal in value to dividends paid with respect to a specified number of shares of MEI Pharma stock. Dividend equivalents may only be granted in connection with Full Value Awards. Dividends and dividend equivalents related to Full Value Awards will only vest and be paid if and to the extent that the related Full Value Awards vest and are paid. 
Transferability of Awards 
No grant under the 2008 Equity Plan and no shares that have not been issued or as to which any applicable restriction, performance or deferral period has not lapsed, may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or with respect to grants other than ISOs, pursuant to a domestic relations order. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Compensation Committee may provide, in a grant letter, that a grantee may transfer nonqualified options to family members, or one or more trusts or other entities for the benefit of or owned by family members, consistent with the applicable securities laws, according to such terms as the Compensation Committee may determine; provided that the grantee receives no consideration for the transfer and the transferred option will continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the option immediately before the transfer. 
Cancelled, Forfeited and other Terminated Awards 
If and to the extent any stock-based awards are forfeited, terminated, or otherwise not paid in full, the shares subject to such grants (including grants made under the 2008 Equity Plan prior to the amendment and restatement effective date) will become available again for purposes of the 2008 Equity Plan. Shares of common stock surrendered in payment of the exercise price of an option (including options granted under the 2008 Equity Plan prior to the amendment and restatement effective date), or withheld for payment of taxes of any grant (including grants made under the 2008 Equity Plan prior to the amendment and restatement effective date), shall not be available for re-issuance under the 2008 Equity Plan. Upon the exercise of an option through a net exercise procedure, or upon the exercise of a SAR (including options and SARs granted under the 2008 Equity Plan prior to the amendment and restatement effective date), both for purposes of calculating the number of shares remaining available for issuance under the 2008 Equity Plan and the number of shares remaining available for exercise under such option or SAR, the number of such shares shall be reduced by the gross number of shares for which the option or SAR is exercised and without regard to any cash settlement of a SAR. Except as provided with respect to cash settlement of SARs, to the extent that any grants (including grants made under the 2008 Equity Plan prior to the amendment and restatement effective date) are paid in cash and not in shares of common stock, any shares   previously subject to such grants shall again be available for issuance or transfer under the 2008 Equity Plan and shall not count against the share limits for purposes of shares available under the 2008 Equity Plan. In addition, shares reacquired by the Company on the open market or otherwise using cash proceeds from the exercise of options (including options granted under the 2008 Equity Plan prior to the amendment and restatement effective date) will not be added to the shares available for future grants under the 2008 Equity Plan. 
Limits on Shares Authorized under the Plan and Size of Awards 
Overall Limit. As noted above, subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 3(b) and 12 of the 2008 Equity Plan, as of the date stockholders approve the restatement of the 2008 Equity Plan, in addition to the Outstanding Shares Granted underlying grants made on or prior to June 30, 2018 (i) 11,800,000 shares, less (ii) one share for every one share that was subject to an option or SAR granted after June 30, 2018 and 1.25 shares for every one share that was subject to a Full Value Award granted after June 30, 2018, will be authorized for grants to be made under the 2008 Equity Plan after June 30, 2018. The total number of shares authorized under the 2008 Equity Plan (including Outstanding Shares Granted) will equal 18,496,857. A maximum of 11,800,000 shares may be subject to ISOs (less any shares subject to ISOs granted on or prior to June 30, 2018). 
For each share that is subject to an option or SAR granted after June 30, 2018, the share limit referred above will be reduced by one share for every one share that was subject to an option or SAR and for each share that is subject to a Full Value Award granted after June 30, 2018, the limit is reduced by 1.25 shares for every one share that was subject to a Full Value Award. Any shares that again become available for grants under the 2008 Equity Plan are added as one share for every one share subject to options or SARs granted under the 2008 Equity Plan, and as 1.25 shares for every one share subject to Full Value Awards granted under the 2008 Equity Plan. 
Substitute awards (awards made or shares issued by the Company in assumption of, or in substitution or exchange for, awards previously granted, or the right or obligation to make future awards, in each case by a company acquired by the Company or any Company subsidiary or with which the Company or any subsidiary combines) will not reduce the shares authorized for grant under the 2008 Equity Plan, nor will shares subject to a substitute award be added to the shares available for issuance or transfer under the 2008 Equity Plan. Additionally, in the event that a company acquired by the Company or any Company subsidiary or with which the Company or any subsidiary combines has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by stockholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used for grants under the 2008 Equity Plan and will not reduce the shares authorized for grant (and shares subject to such grants will not be added to the shares available for grants); provided that grants using such available shares will not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and will only be made to individuals who were not employees or directors prior to such acquisition or combination. 
Limits per Participant. Notwithstanding any other provision of the 2008 Equity Plan to the contrary, effective upon the approval of the restatement of the 2008 Equity Plan by our stockholders, during any single calendar year, the aggregate grant date fair value (computed as of the date of grant in accordance with applicable financial accounting rules) of all grants to any non-employee director plus the sum of all cash payments paid or payable to such director for such year may not exceed $400,000. No other participant will be granted awards with respect to more than 4,000,000 shares of common stock during any calendar year. This limitation will be multiplied by two with respect to grants made to an employee during the first calendar year in which he or she commences employment or service with the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Adjustments for Changes in Common Stock and Certain Other Events 
In the event that the Compensation Committee determines that any recapitalization, forward or reverse split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of shares or other securities, stock dividend or other special, large and non-recurring dividend or distribution (whether in the form of cash, securities or other property), liquidation, dissolution, or other similar corporate transaction or event, affects our shares such that an adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of participants under the 2008 Equity Plan, then the committee shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the number and kind of shares of stock reserved and available for awards under the 2008 Equity Plan, including  shares reserved for ISOs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the number and kind of shares of stock specified in the annual  per-participant limitations under the 2008 Equity Plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the number and kind of shares that may be issued in respect of outstanding awards; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the exercise price, grant price or purchase price relating to any award (or, if deemed appropriate, the committee  may make provision for a cash payment, including, without limitation, payment based upon the intrinsic (i.e., in-the-money) value, if any, with respect to any  outstanding award).  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Compensation Committee shall make appropriate adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, awards (including, without limitation, cancellation of unexercised or outstanding awards, or substitution of awards using stock of a successor or other entity) in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting us or our financial statements, or in response to changes in applicable law, regulation, or accounting principles. 
Change of Control 
The vesting of awards in connection with a change of control or other event will be determined by the terms of the individual award agreement. 
In the event of a change in control, the Compensation Committee may take one or more of the following actions with respect to any or all outstanding grants: (i) require surrender of outstanding vested options and SARs in exchange for payment by the Company, in cash or shares, in an amount equal to the "spread" of each such award; (ii) provide for the cancellation of unvested grants for no consideration; (iii) provide for the cancellation of out-of-the-money grants for no consideration; (iv) after giving an opportunity to exercise outstanding options and SARs, terminate any or all unexercised awards; or (v) determine that outstanding options and SARs that are not exercised will be assumed by, or replaced with comparable options or rights by, the surviving corporation, (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation), and other outstanding grants that remain in effect after the change in control be converted to similar grants of the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation). 
Prohibition on Repricing 
Notwithstanding anything in the 2008 Equity Plan to the contrary, and other than pursuant to Section 13 of the 2008 Equity Plan that addresses equitable adjustments, the Compensation Committee will not without the approval of the Company's stockholders (a) lower the exercise price per share of an option (or grant price of a SAR) after it is granted, (b) cancel an option or SAR in exchange for an option or SAR with a lower exercise price, cash or another grant (other than in connection with a change in control), or (c) take any other action with respect to an option or SAR that would be treated as a repricing under the rules and regulations of the principal U.S. national securities exchange on which the shares are listed. 
Clawback and Recoupment 
All awards under the 2008 Equity Plan are subject to the applicable provisions of the MEI Pharma clawback or recoupment policy, as such policy may be in effect from time to time and are subject to recoupment as may be required by applicable law, regulation or exchange listing requirements. 
Amendment, Waiver and Termination 
The 2008 Equity Plan may be amended, altered, suspended, discontinued or terminated by the Board of Directors without stockholder approval unless such approval is required by law or regulation, including, without limitation, under the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which MEI Pharma's common stock is then listed or quoted. The Compensation Committee may waive any conditions or amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate any award under the 2008 Equity Plan. No such change to the 2008 Equity Plan or any award may, without the participant's consent, materially impair the rights of the participant under an outstanding award except as provided in the 2008 Equity Plan or applicable award agreement. 
Material Federal Income Tax Consequences 
The following is a brief description of the federal income tax consequences generally arising with respect to awards that may be granted under the 2008 Equity Plan. This discussion is intended for the information of MEI Pharma stockholders considering how to vote at the MEI Pharma Annual Meeting and not as tax guidance to   individuals who may participate in the 2008 Equity Plan. The summary does not address the effects of other federal taxes or taxes imposed under state, local or foreign laws. 
The grant of an option or SAR will create no tax consequences for the participant or MEI Pharma. A participant will not have taxable income upon exercising an ISO (except that the alternative minimum tax may apply), and MEI Pharma will receive no tax deduction at that time. Upon exercising an option other than an ISO, the participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the freely transferable and non-forfeitable stock received. In each case, MEI Pharma will generally be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the amount recognized as ordinary income by the participant. 
A participant's disposition of stock acquired upon the exercise of an option or SAR generally will result in capital gain or loss measured by the difference between the sale price and the participant's tax basis in such stock (or the exercise price of the option in the case of stock acquired by exercise of an ISO and held for the applicable ISO holding periods). Generally, there will be no tax consequences to MEI Pharma in connection with a disposition of stock acquired upon the exercise of an option or other award, except that MEI Pharma will generally be entitled to a tax deduction (and the participant will recognize ordinary taxable income) if stock acquired upon exercise of an ISO is disposed of before the applicable ISO holding periods have been satisfied. 
With respect to awards granted under the 2008 Equity Plan that may be settled either in cash or in stock or other property that is either not restricted as to transferability or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the participant generally must recognize ordinary income equal to the cash or fair market value of stock or other property received. MEI Pharma will generally be entitled to a tax deduction for the same amount. With respect to awards involving stock or other property that is restricted as to transferability and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the participant generally must recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the stock or other property received at the first time the stock or other property becomes transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs earlier. MEI Pharma will generally be entitled to a tax deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant. A participant may elect to be taxed at the time of receipt of the stock or other property rather than upon the lapse of restrictions on transferability or substantial risk of forfeiture, but if the participant subsequently forfeits such stock or property, the participant would not be entitled to any tax deduction, including capital loss, for the value of the stock or property on which the participant previously paid tax. Such election must be made and filed with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days after the receipt of the stock or other property. 
Under section 409A of the Code, an award under the 2008 Equity Plan may be taxable to the participant at 20 percentage points above ordinary federal income tax rates at the time the award becomes vested, plus interest and penalties, even if that is prior to the delivery of cash or stock in settlement of the award, if the award constitutes "deferred compensation" under section 409A of the Code and the requirements of section 409A of the Code are not satisfied. 
The 2008 Equity Plan provides that MEI Pharma has the right to require participants under the 2008 Equity Plan to pay it an amount necessary for it to satisfy its federal, state, local and foreign tax withholding obligations with respect to such awards. As amended, the 2008 Equity Plan will permit the Company to determine the tax withholding rates, which comply with withholding requirements then in effect, and which will not cause an adverse accounting consequence or cost to the Company. MEI Pharma may withhold from other amounts payable to such individual an amount necessary to satisfy these obligations. Unless the Compensation Committee or its designee determines otherwise, a participant may satisfy this withholding obligation by having shares acquired pursuant to the award withheld. 
Securities Authorized For Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans

(1)  Consists of stock options issuable under the 2008 Equity Plan, under which 10,186,000 shares of common stock  are authorized for issuance. The 2008 Equity Plan provides for the grant of options, stock units, stock awards and/or other stock-based or stock-denominated awards to the Company's non-employee directors,  officers, employees and advisors.  
(2)  In addition, there are 332,193 shares with respect to stock units granted under the plan. These stock units,  after applying the 2008 Equity Plan's fungible share ratio, reduce the number of plan securities available for issuance as of June 30, 2018, by 415,242 shares. Stock units granted after June 30, 2015 are counted as 1.25 plan shares  (fungible share ratio). At June 30, 2018, the number of securities remaining available for future issuance under the plan after giving effect to stock units is 2,896,206.  
[END TABLE]
New Plan Benefits 
Future benefits under the amended 2008 Equity Plan generally will be granted at the discretion of the Compensation Committee and are therefore not currently determinable. As of October 3, 2018, the closing price of the Company's common stock on NASDAQ was $3.97. 
During fiscal year 2018, stock option awards were granted to the named executive officers as set forth below under "Executive Compensation—Summary Compensation Table" and "—Grants of Plan-Based Awards." 
VOTE REQUIRED 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote is required to approve the amended and restated 2008 Equity Plan. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will be counted for the purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote "against" the proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. A failure to vote by not returning a signed proxy will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. 
RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE MEI PHARMA, INC. 2008 STOCK OMNIBUS COMPENSATION PLAN TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO AWARDS AND MAKE CERTAIN OTHER CHANGES INCLUDED IN THE PLAN DOCUMENT ATTACHED AS ANNEX A.  APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF 
INCORPORATION TO INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON 
STOCK TO 226,000,000 SHARES 
(PROPOSAL NO. 3) 
On September 14, 2018, our Board of Directors unanimously approved, subject to stockholder approval, an amendment and restatement of our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance by 113,000,000 shares of common stock, bringing the total number of shares of common stock authorized to 226,000,000 shares, and to remove certain provisions that are no longer applicable. These shares do not offer any preemptive rights. The text of the proposed Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, marked to show changes from our existing Restated Certificate of Incorporation, is attached hereto as Annex B. This proposal to amend and restate our certificate of incorporation, if approved, will become effective and the Company's number of shares of authorized common stock will be increased to 226,000,000 shares upon the filing of the certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the certificate of amendment, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
Reasons for the Amendment and Restatement 
Increase in Number of Authorized Shares 
The Board believes that it is desirable to have additional authorized shares of common stock available for possible future financings and acquisitions, the increase in the number of shares reserved under the Company's 2008 Equity Plan described in the Plan Increase Proposal (Proposal No. 2) and other general corporate purposes, as only 16,582,058 shares of common stock remained authorized and unreserved for issuance as of June 30, 2018. The Board believes that having such additional authorized shares of common stock available for issuance in the future will give the Company greater flexibility and may allow such shares to be issued without the expense and delay of a special stockholders' meeting unless such approval is expressly required by applicable law. Although such issuance of additional shares with respect to future financings and acquisitions may dilute existing stockholders, management believes that such transactions could increase the overall value of the Company to its stockholders. There are certain advantages and disadvantages of an increase in authorized common stock. 
The advantages include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The ability to raise capital by issuing capital stock in future financing transactions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To have shares of common stock available to pursue business expansion opportunities, if any.   
[END TABLE]
The disadvantages include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The issuance of authorized but unissued stock could be used to deter a potential takeover of the Company that may  otherwise be beneficial to stockholders by diluting the shares held by a potential suitor or issuing shares to a stockholder that will vote in accordance with the Board's desires. A takeover may be beneficial to our stockholders because, among  other reasons, a potential suitor may offer such stockholders a premium for their shares of stock compared to the then-existing market price. The Company does not have any plans or proposals to adopt provisions or enter into agreements that may have  material anti-takeover consequences.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Most of our stockholders do not have any preemptive or similar rights to subscribe for or purchase any additional  shares of common stock that may be issued in the future, and therefore, future issuances of common stock may, depending on the circumstances, have a dilutive effect on the earnings per share, voting power and other interests of existing stockholders  of the Company.  
[END TABLE]
Although an increase in the authorized shares of common stock could, under certain circumstances, have an anti-takeover effect, this proposal to adopt the amendment and restatement is not in response to any effort of which the Company is aware to accumulate common stock or obtain control of the Company. Nor is it part of a plan by management to recommend a series of similar amendments to the Board and stockholders. 
At present, other than granting equity incentives for our employees as described in the Plan Increase Proposal (Proposal No. 2), our Board of Directors has no immediate plans, arrangements or understandings to issue the additional shares of common stock. However, we desire to have the shares available to provide additional   flexibility to use our common stock for business and financial purposes in the future as well to have sufficient shares available to provide appropriate equity incentives for our employees. 
If the Company's stockholders do not approve the increase in authorized shares of common stock, then the Company will not be able to increase the total number of authorized shares of common stock from 113,000,000 to 226,000,000, and therefore, the Company would be limited in its ability to use shares of common stock for financings, acquisitions, issuing equity awards, or other general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2018, the Company had only 16,582,058 shares of common stock authorized and unreserved for issuance, which would be available for such purposes. 
Removal of Certain Provisions that are No Longer Applicable 
As of April 29, 2002, the date of the last restatement of the Company's certificate of incorporation, the Company was named Marshall Edwards, Inc. and was a subsidiary of Novogen Limited, an Australian company ("Novogen"). Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains certain provisions relating to certain potential opportunities and rights to indemnification of Novogen and certain of its affiliates. Such provisions were scheduled to expire when Novogen ceased to beneficially own shares of our common stock representing at least 20% of the total voting power of all classes of outstanding capital stock of the Company entitled to vote in the election of directors and no person who is a director or officer of the company is also a director or officer of Novogen. In December 2012, Novogen distributed all of the shares of our common stock owned thereby to its stockholders and ceased to beneficially own at least 20% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock and the Company's only director who then served as a director of Novogen ceased serving on the board thereof. Accordingly, such provisions expired. 
Prior to July 2, 2012, MEI Pharma, Inc. ("Old MEI") was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On July 2, 2012, pursuant to Section 253 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Old MEI merged with and into the Company and the Company changed its name to MEI Pharma, Inc. 
The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation reflects the removal of the expired provisions relating to certain potential opportunities and rights to indemnification of Novogen and certain of its affiliates and reflects the Company's name change that occurred in 2012. 
Interests of our Directors and Executive Officers 
Our directors and executive officers have no substantial interests, directly or indirectly, in the matters set forth in this proposed amendment and restatement, except to the extent of their ownership in shares of our common stock and securities convertible or exercisable for common stock. 
Vote and Board of Directors Recommendation 
Pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, this proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company entitled to vote on the proposal. Abstentions with respect to this proposal will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum and, if a quorum is present, will have the same practical effect as a vote against this proposal. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO 226,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND TO REMOVE CERTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ARE NO LONGER APPLICABLE.  ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
(PROPOSAL NO. 4) 
At our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders indicated their preference that we solicit a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of the named executive officers, commonly referred to as a "Say-on-Pay" vote, every year. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. 
The compensation of our named executive officers subject to the vote is disclosed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Philosophy and Objectives" section and the compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure contained in this proxy statement. As discussed in those disclosures, we believe that our compensation policies and decisions are focused on pay-for-performance principles, aligned with our stockholders' interests and consistent with current market practices. Compensation of our named executive officers is intended to enhance stockholder value by attracting, motivating and retaining qualified individuals to perform at the highest levels and to contribute to our growth and success. 
We urge stockholders to read the information below under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis", including the Company's Compensation Philosophy and Objectives as well as the related compensation tables and narrative, which describes in more detail how our executive compensation policies and procedures operate and are designed to achieve our compensation objectives. Our Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee believe that our compensation policies and practices are effective in implementing our compensation philosophy and in helping us achieve our corporate goals. 
Accordingly, our Board of Directors is asking the stockholders to indicate their support for the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this proxy statement by casting a non-binding advisory vote "FOR" the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to MEI Pharma, Inc. named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K in the Company's proxy statement for the fiscal year 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, including the discussion under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis", the compensation tables and the other narrative discussion is hereby APPROVED." 
Because the vote is advisory, it is not binding on us or our Board of Directors. Nevertheless, the views expressed by our stockholders, whether through this vote or otherwise, are important to us and our Board of Directors and, accordingly, our Board and the Compensation Committee intend to consider the results of this vote in making determinations in the future regarding executive compensation arrangements. 
Advisory approval of this proposal requires a majority of the votes cast by stockholders entitled to vote on the proposal voting "FOR" approval. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will be counted for the purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote "against" the proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. A failure to vote by not returning a signed proxy will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the compensation strategy, policies, programs and practices for the named executive officers identified in the Summary Compensation Table. For fiscal year 2018, the named executive officers consist of Daniel P. Gold, Ph.D., President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Brian G. Drazba, Chief Financial Officer, Robert D. Mass, MD, Chief Medical Officer, and David M. Urso, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and General Counsel, to whom we collectively refer in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis as our "executive officers." Mr. Urso was, subsequent to the close of our most recent fiscal year, promoted to the position of Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel on July 12, 2018. 
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
We believe that the performance of our executive officers significantly impacts our ability to achieve our corporate goals. We, therefore, place considerable importance on the design and administration of our executive officer compensation program. This program is intended to enhance stockholder value by attracting, motivating and retaining qualified individuals to perform at the highest levels and to contribute to our growth and success. Our executive officer compensation program is designed to provide compensation opportunities that are tied to individual and corporate performance. 
Our overall compensation philosophy has been to pay our executive officers an annual base salary and to provide opportunities, through cash and equity incentives, to deliver higher compensation if certain key performance goals are satisfied or exceeded. The main principles of our fiscal year 2018 compensation strategy included the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation decisions that are driven by a  pay-for-performance philosophy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation should reflect individual and corporate performance; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Target annual compensation is positioned to be competitive with a peer group of similar companies.

The Compensation Committee's Process 
The Compensation Committee acts on behalf of the Board with respect to fulfilling the Board's responsibilities to oversee the Company's compensation policies, plans and programs and reviewing and determining, as appropriate, the compensation to be paid to executive officers and directors. In achieving this task, the Compensation Committee (i) reviews and approves corporate performance goals and objectives that support and reinforce the Company's long-term strategic goals and compensation plans; (ii) establishes policies with respect to equity compensation arrangements, timing and pricing of equity awards for newly hired employees, promotions and annual grants for executive and non-executive employees and directors; (iii) reviews regional and industry-wide compensation practices and trends to assess the propriety, adequacy and competitiveness of the Company's executive compensation programs among comparable companies in the Company's industry; (iv) reviews and approves the terms of any employment agreements, severance agreements, change-of-control protections and any other compensatory arrangements of the executive officers; (v) performs and considers a compensation risk assessment; and (vi) considers shareholder feedback and Say-on-Pay voting results. 
With respect to compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee evaluates the Chief Executive Officer's performance in light of relevant performance goals and objectives, taking into account the policies of the Compensation Committee and, with respect to long-term incentive compensation, stockholder return and the results of the most recent stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves (or if appropriate, recommends to the Board for final determination and approval) individual and corporate performance goals and objectives of the Company's other executive officers. The Compensation Committee considers the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer with respect to the compensation of the Company's other executive officers. The Compensation Committee also makes recommendations to the Board with respect to this "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section and recommends that such section be included in any of the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements, proxy statements or information statements. 
The Compensation Committee meets at least once a year or more frequently as its members deem necessary or appropriate. Under the charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority, in its sole discretion, to   retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisors as the Compensation Committee may determine to assist in the performance of the Compensation Committee's duties and responsibilities, only after taking into consideration the factors prescribed by the SEC and NASDAQ that bear upon the adviser's independence. 
In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee's compensation decisions recognized the Company's performance was extraordinary in terms clinical trial successes and capital infusion into the Company. 
Setting Executive Compensation 
While the Compensation Committee considers peer group analysis as a component of its overall executive compensation decision process, it does not attempt to set executive compensation at a specific benchmark level, or percentile of compensation paid by other companies. The Compensation Committee determines the mix of compensation of each executive officer based on its review of such competitive data and an assessment of the individual's performance. We believe our approach to compensation does not encourage excessive risk-taking by the Company's executives. 
Our peer group of companies for fiscal year 2018, consists of 22 similar publicly-traded drug development companies, all approved by the Compensation Committee, with input from management and our compensation consultant. The peer group is composed of drug development companies with a similar market cap size, without material revenue from commercial products, and with emphasis on oncology drug development companies as follows: 
The Compensation Committee believes that, given the competitiveness of our industry and our company culture, our base compensation, cash incentives and equity programs reward the achievement of clearly defined corporate goals and objectives and are competitive to retain our existing executive officers and to hire new executive officers. 
The peer data were used as context for setting executive officer compensation in late fiscal year 2018 and for setting fiscal 2019 compensation. The Compensation Committee does not set a target benchmark, but in fiscal year 2018, the value of total direct compensation for all named executive officers was above the median of the peer group companies to recognize the success in clinical development and financing activities (compensation in recent years prior to fiscal 2018 had been set below the median of the peer group companies in recognition of performance and size at that time). 
Role of Stockholder Say-on-Pay Votes 
At our annual meeting of stockholders held in December 2017, approximately 91% of the shares voted at the meeting approved, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee considers input from stockholders, its compensation consultant and proxy advisors, when assessing its compensation philosophy and the components of its compensation program, giving further consideration to the level of attainment of corporate goals and to the compensation data of the Company's peer group so that compensation decisions are broadly consistent with market practice.  Elements of Compensation 
Each executive officer's compensation package is comprised of three key elements: (i) base salary, (ii) performance-based cash incentives and (iii) equity-based compensation. These elements of executive compensation are intended to align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders. 
Base Salary 
Base salaries serve to provide a fixed amount of compensation to our executive officers for successfully fulfilling their responsibilities. We establish base salaries for our executive officers when they join our Company or upon promotion. Base salaries for executive officers are reviewed and determined by the Compensation Committee on an annual basis, in consultation with our compensation consultant. All of the officers were provided a salary increase of no more than 4% in fiscal 2018 to keep pace with the cost of living while recognizing that the emphasis of the compensation program is performance based through cash incentives and equity awards. 
Performance-based Cash Incentives 
The Compensation Committee believes that allocating a meaningful amount of our executive officers' total cash compensation to the achievement of corporate goals and objectives aligns our executive officers' interests with those of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee establishes annual corporate incentive bonus targets for each of our executive officers. For fiscal year 2018, bonus targets were set at 50%, 40%, 40% and 40% of base salary for our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Medical Officer, Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel, and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. Our Chief Medical Officer currently works a 40% part-time schedule and his bonus is pro-rated accordingly. The annual corporate goals and objectives are generally critical path activities or strategic initiatives designed to enhance shareholder return. 
Equity-based Compensation 
The Compensation Committee believes that long-term value creation is achieved through an ownership culture that encourages performance by our executive officers through stock and stock-based awards. This is also our key retention strategy. Under our 2008 Equity Plan, which was amended in 2016 (and is subject to a proposal in this proxy statement to increase the number of authorized shares available for future awards thereunder and other amendments), we may award incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance shares and units. Stock options granted before the plan was amended in December 3, 2014 generally have five-year terms. Those granted after December 3, 2014 expire after 10 years, have an exercise price equal to the fair market value at grant, and typically vest 25% after one year and in equal monthly installments thereafter over the next 36 months and have a three-month post-termination exercise period. 
At the start of fiscal year 2018, we granted annual options to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Medical Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Operating Officer & General Counsel in the amount of 380,000, 135,000, 50,000 and 130,000 options, respectively. All option awards were granted with an exercise price of $2.83, which was the closing price on the date of grant. On June 22, 2018 we granted options to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Medical Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Operating Officer & General Counsel in the amount of an additional 380,000, 100,000, 130,000 and 130,000, respectively. All option awards were granted with an exercise price of $4.33, which was the closing price on the date of grant. The June 2018 options were granted to recognize fiscal 2018 success in terms of total shareholder return, clinical trial success and capital infusion in the Company during fiscal 2018. The Compensation Committee views options as naturally performance based because they do not reward the option holder unless the stock price increases after grant. 
The total compensation of each executive officer, which consisted of salary, bonus, and the grant date fair value of options was below the median of the peer group for all executive officers. 
Corporate Goals for Fiscal Year 2018 
Annual performance goals are set by the Compensation Committee, and they are as objective as possible in both their definition and their scoring at the end of the period. This is consistent with the multi-year timeline associated with the drug development business, where annual goals are milestones for a long-term value-creating development and regulatory approval process. The following is a description of the primary corporate goals for fiscal year 2018, which assisted the Compensation Committee in determining total compensation. Goal achievement was measured objectively and it was determined that the Company had met 95% of the goals, as follows:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Conduct the company's operations within the approved budget and maintain sufficient capital to fund internal  clinical development plan through an equity raise or licensing agreement ending the fiscal year with at least 18 months cash runway.

• Submit end-of-Phase II briefing  package to FDA regarding ME-401 registration study by June 30, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Benefits and Perquisites 
The Company offers benefit programs to its employees, including named executive officers, which includes paid-time off; health insurance, including a company funded HSA account and a Company sponsored 401(k) plan. Our executive officers generally do not receive any supplemental retirement benefits or perquisites, and participate in the above listed benefit programs on the same basis as other full-time employees. 
Severance and Change in Control Agreements 
Each of Dr. Gold's, Mr. Drazba's, Dr. Mass's and Mr. Urso's employment agreement provides for certain severance payments upon the applicable employee's termination by us other than for cause or by the applicable employee for good reason, as such terms are defined in the respective employment agreement. Upon such a termination of employment, we will: (i) make a payment to the applicable employee in lieu of notice in an amount equal to twelve months of such employee's base salary (as in effect at the time of such employee's termination from employment), and (ii) accelerate the vesting of the applicable employee's options so that such employee will be vested in the same number of shares of common stock subject to the options as if such employee had continued to be employed by us for an additional twelve months. Such payment and additional option vesting will be conditional upon the execution of a customary release of claims in favor of us and our affiliates, in a form prescribed by us. The payment in lieu of notice will be paid to the applicable employee in a single lump sum payment as soon as administratively practicable after the maximum review and revocation period for the release agreement as may be required under applicable law, if any, or such earlier date as determined in our sole discretion, but in no event more than 60 days after the applicable employee's termination of employment in the case of Dr. Gold, Mr. Drazba and Dr. Mass. If their employment had been terminated in accordance with the foregoing provisions on June 30, 2018, Dr. Gold, Mr. Drazba, Dr. Mass and Mr. Urso would have been entitled to payments in the amount of $592,250, $350,000, $458,350 (prorated to the current year's percentage work schedule) and $390,000 (giving effect to changes in his employment agreement subsequent to June 30, 2018 in connection with his promotion to Chief Operating Officer on July 12, 2018), respectively, and the vesting of options to purchase 485,448 shares, 178,600 shares, 93,958 shares, and 182,829 shares (giving effect to the changes in his employment agreement on July 12, 2018) of our common stock, respectively. 
In the event of a change in control of MEI Pharma, as defined in the 2008 Equity Plan, unless the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines otherwise, all of the options granted to Dr. Gold, Mr. Drazba, Dr. Mass and Mr. Urso will accelerate and become fully exercisable effective upon the date of the change in control. As of June 30, 2018, the intrinsic value of unvested stock options that would accelerate and become fully exercisable upon a change in control, computed by multiplying the difference between the closing price per share of our common stock on June 29, 2018 of $3.94 and the exercise price of each stock option vested as a result of the termination, by the number of accelerated stock options for Dr. Gold, Mr. Drazba, Dr. Mass and Mr. Urso, was $1,357,466, $541,062, $305,188 and $529,779 (giving effect to the changes in his employment agreement on July 12, 2018), respectively. 
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
The tax and accounting consequences to the Company of certain compensation elements are important considerations for the Compensation Committee when evaluating and recommending compensation packages for our executive officers. Generally, the Compensation Committee seeks to balance its objective to create an effective   compensation program that attracts, retains and rewards executives in order to maximize the return to stockholders with the need for appropriate tax and accounting consequences of such compensation. 
In addition to considering the tax consequences, the Compensation Committee considers the accounting consequences of its decisions, including the impact of expenses being recognized in connection with equity-based awards, in determining the size and form of different equity-based awards. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
SEC rules require us to disclose the total annual compensation of our principal executive officer for fiscal 2018, who was Daniel P. Gold, our President and Chief Executive Officer, the median of the total annual compensation of all employees other than our principal executive officer, as well as their ratio to each other (the "CEO Pay Ratio"). Total annual compensation for our principal executive officer and for the median of the total annual compensation of all employees is calculated in accordance with SEC rules applicable to the Summary Compensation Table. For fiscal 2018, these amounts were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our principal executive officer's total annual compensation: $2,985,416  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our median compensated employee's total annual compensation: $241,683  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• CEO Pay Ratio: 12 to 1  
[END TABLE]
In determining the median compensated employee, we chose June 30, 2018 as the determination date. As of this date, we had 31 employees, excluding our principal executive officer. We annualized compensation of employees who were not employed with us for the full fiscal year. In determining our median compensated employee and calculating the CEO Pay Ratio, we did not use any of the exemptions permitted under SEC rules, nor did we rely upon any material assumptions, adjustments or estimates. 
The Company believes that the CEO Pay Ratio set forth above is a reasonable estimate for fiscal 2018, determined in a manner consistent with SEC rules. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the CEO Pay Ratio based on that employee's total annual compensation permit companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exemptions and to make certain assumptions, adjustments or estimates that reflect their compensation policies. Accordingly, the CEO Pay Ratio may not be comparable to the pay ratios reported by other companies, which may have used different methodologies, assumptions, adjustments or estimates in calculating their pay ratios.

Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy and procedure for pre-approving all audit and non-audit services to be performed by our independent auditors. The policy requires pre-approval of all services rendered by our independent auditors either as part of the Audit Committee's approval of the scope of the engagement of the independent auditors or on a case by case basis. 
VOTE REQUIRED 
The ratification of the appointment of BDO USA, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 will require approval by the majority of the votes cast by the holders of the shares of our common stock voting in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders may vote either for or against or abstain from voting on the proposal to ratify the selection of BDO USA, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will be counted for the purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote "against" the proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. A failure to vote by not returning a signed proxy will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. 
In the event that the stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection of audit firms, but may decide not to change its selection. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit   Committee may appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that such a change would be in our stockholders' best interest. 
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF BDO USA, LLP TO ACT AS MEI PHARMA'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 2019.  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of MEI Pharma has furnished the following report on its activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The report is not deemed to be "soliciting material" or "filed" with the SEC or subject to the SEC's proxy rules or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, and the report shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any prior or subsequent filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that MEI Pharma specifically incorporates it by reference into any such filing. 
The Audit Committee oversees the financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial reporting process, principles and internal controls as well as preparation of our financial statements. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the members of the Audit Committee were Mr. Rueckert (Committee Chair), Mr. Baltic, Mr. Driscoll, who joined the Audit Committee on February 22, 2018, and Dr. Glover, each of whom is an independent director as defined by the applicable NASDAQ and SEC rules. The Audit Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. 
In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit Committee appointed independent auditors BDO USA for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with the independent auditors the overall scope and specific plans for their audit. The Audit Committee also reviewed and discussed with the independent auditors and with management MEI Pharma's audited financial statements and the adequacy of its internal controls. The Audit Committee met with the independent auditors, without management present, to discuss the results of our independent auditor's audits, their evaluations of MEI Pharma's internal controls and the overall quality of MEI Pharma's financial reporting. 
Although the Audit Committee has the sole authority to appoint the independent auditors, the Audit Committee will continue its practice of recommending that the Board of Directors ask the stockholders, at their annual meeting, to ratify their appointment of the independent auditors. 
The Audit Committee monitored the independence and performance of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 1301—Communications with Audit Committees. MEI Pharma's independent auditors have provided the Audit Committee with the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent auditors' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditor the independent auditor's independence. Based upon the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

Agreements with Helsinn 
On August 5, 2016, we entered into the Helsinn License Agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Helsinn was granted a worldwide exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pracinostat, and is primarily responsible for funding its global development and commercialization. As compensation for such grant of rights, we received payments of $20.0 million, including a $15.0 million upfront payment and a $5.0 million payment in March 2017. In addition, we are eligible to receive up to $444 million in potential regulatory and sales-based milestones, along with royalty payments on the net sales of Pracinostat, which, in the U.S., are tiered and begin in the mid-teens. Helsinn also agreed to reimburse us for certain third-party expenses related to research and development activities for Pracinostat. 
On August 5, 2016, we also entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Helsinn Investment Fund SA (the "Helsinn Equity Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Helsinn Equity Agreement, we issued 2,616,431 shares of common stock on August 16, 2016 in exchange for a $5.0 million investment. As a result of the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the Helsinn Equity Agreement, Helsinn Investment Fund SA became the holder of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, Helsinn and Helsinn Investment Fund SA may be deemed related persons under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND

OTHER MATTERS FOR STOCKHOLDERS 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires MEI Pharma's officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of the common stock of MEI Pharma to file initial reports of ownership of such securities and reports of changes in ownership of such securities with the SEC. Such officers, directors and 10% stockholders of MEI Pharma are also required by SEC regulations to furnish MEI Pharma with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
Based solely on MEI Pharma's review of the copies of such forms received by it with respect to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, all reports were filed on a timely basis.  Stockholder Proposals 
Stockholders who intend to present proposals at the Company's fiscal 2020 annual meeting of stockholders under SEC Rule 14a-8 must ensure that such proposals are received by the Secretary of the Company no later than June 14, 2019. Such proposals must meet the requirements of the SEC to be eligible for inclusion in the Company's fiscal 2018 proxy materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the date of annual meeting for fiscal 2019 is changed by more than 30 days from the date of the Annual Meeting for fiscal 2019, all stockholder proposals must be submitted a reasonable time before a solicitation is made. 
In accordance with our bylaws, stockholder proposals, including stockholder nominations for candidates for election as directors, that are intended to be presented by stockholders at the fiscal 2020 annual meeting of stockholders but not submitted for inclusion in the proxy statement for our fiscal 2020 annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8, must be received by us no earlier than August 1, 2019 and no later than August 31, 2019, unless we change the date of our fiscal 2020 annual meeting more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after November 29, 2019, in which case stockholder proposals must be received by us no earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to such annual meeting. 
Communication with the MEI Pharma Board of Directors 
MEI Pharma's stockholders may communicate with the Board of Directors, including non-executive directors or officers, by sending written communications addressed to such person or persons in care of MEI Pharma, Inc., Attn: Secretary, 3611 Valley Centre Drive, Suite 500, San Diego, California, 92130. All communications will be compiled by the Secretary and submitted to the addressee. If the Board of Directors modifies this process, the revised process will be posted on MEI Pharma's website. 
Delivery of this Proxy Statement to Multiple Stockholders with the Same Address 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. 
Householding of Proxy Materials for MEI Pharma Stockholders 
This year, a number of brokers with account holders who are MEI Pharma stockholders will be "householding" MEI Pharma's proxy materials. A single copy of this proxy statement will be delivered to multiple MEI Pharma stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected MEI Pharma stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you notify your broker or MEI Pharma that you no longer wish to participate in "householding." If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual report, you may (1) notify your broker, (2) direct your written request to: Investor Relations, MEI Pharma, Inc., 3611 Valley Centre Drive, Suite 500, San Diego, California, 92130, or (3) contact MEI Pharma's Chief Financial Officer, Brian G. Drazba, at: (858) 369-7100. Upon a written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, MEI Pharma will promptly deliver a separate copy of the annual report and proxy statement to a MEI Pharma stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the proxy statements was delivered. MEI Pharma stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their address and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their broker.

The Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee to provide Advisors, Employees and Non-Employee Directors that are providing, or have agreed to provide, services to the Company or its Affiliates, who are in a position to contribute to the long-term success of the Company or its Affiliates, with Grants. The Company believes that this incentive program will cause those Advisors, Employees and Non-Employee Directors to increase their interest in the welfare of the Company and its Affiliates, and aid in attracting, retaining and motivating Advisors, Employees and Non-Employee Directors of outstanding ability. 
The Plan was originally effective as of December 9, 2008 upon approval by the stockholders of the Company. The Plan was amended and restated effective October 21, 2011, but the share increase was effective December 1, 2011 upon approval by the stockholders of the Company.

During any calendar year, no Advisor or Employee may be granted awards that are intended to comply with the performance-based exception under Code section 162(m) and are denominated in cash under which  more than $3,000,000 may be earned for each 12 months in the performance period. Each of tThe limitations in this Section 3(e) shall be multiplied by two with respect to Grants made to an Employee during the first calendar year in which the Employee commences employment or service with the Company and its  subsidiaries. If a Grant is cancelled, the cancelled Grant shall continue to be counted toward the applicable limitation in this Section 3(e).  
[END TABLE]
Section 4. Administration of the Plan 
(a) Authority of the Compensation Committee. The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee shall have full and final authority to take the following actions, in each case subject to and consistent with the provisions of the Plan: 
A-8 
(i) to select the Advisors, Employees and Non-Employee Directors to whom Grants may be made; 
(ii) to determine the number of Shares subject to each such Grant; 
(iii) to determine the terms and conditions of any Grant made under the Plan; 
(iv) to determine whether to accelerate the exercisability of any or all applicable outstanding Grants at any time for any reason; 
(v) to determine the restrictions or conditions related to the delivery, holding and disposition of Shares acquired pursuant to a Grant; 
(vi) to prescribe the form of each Grant Letter; 
(vii) to adopt, amend, suspend, waive and rescind such rules and regulations and appoint such agents as the Compensation Committee may deem necessary or advisable to administer the Plan; 
(viii) to correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan and to construe and interpret the Plan and any Grant, Grant Letter or other instrument hereunder; and 
(ix) to make all other decisions and determinations as may be required under the terms of the Plan or as the Compensation Committee may deem necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. 
All Grants shall be made conditional upon the Grantee's acknowledgement, in writing or by acceptance of the Grant, that all decisions and determinations of the Compensation Committee shall be final and binding on the Grantee, his or her beneficiaries and any other Person having or claiming an interest under such Grant. 
(b) Manner of Exercise of Compensation Committee Authority. Any action of the Compensation Committee with respect to the Plan shall be final, conclusive and binding on all Persons, including the Company, its Affiliates, Grantees, or any Person claiming any rights under the Plan from or through any Grantee, except to the extent the Compensation Committee may subsequently modify, or take further action not inconsistent with, its prior action. If not specified in the Plan, the time at which the Compensation Committee must or may make any determination shall be determined by the Compensation Committee, and any such determination may thereafter be modified by the Compensation Committee. The express grant of any specific power to the Compensation Committee, and the taking of any action by the Compensation Committee, shall not be construed as limiting any power or authority of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may delegate to officers or managers of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company the authority, subject to such terms as the Compensation Committee shall determine, to perform such functions as the Compensation Committee may determine, to the extent permitted under applicable law. 
A-9 
(c) Limitation of Liability. Each member of the Compensation Committee shall be entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to him by any officer or other employee of the Company or any of its Affiliates, the Company's independent certified public accountants or any executive compensation consultant, legal counsel or other professional retained by the Company to assist in the administration of the Plan. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no member of the Compensation Committee, nor any officer or employee of the Company acting on behalf of the Compensation Committee, shall be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation taken or made in good faith with respect to the Plan, and all members of the Compensation Committee and any officer or employee of the Company acting on its behalf shall, to the extent permitted by law, be fully indemnified and protected by the Company with respect to any such action, determination or interpretation. 
Section 5. Options 
The Compensation Committee may grant Options to an Employee, Advisor or member of the Board upon such terms as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. The following provisions are applicable to Options: 
(a) Number of Shares. The Compensation Committee shall determine the number of Shares that will be subject to each Grant of Options to an Employee, Advisor or member of the Board. 
(b) Type of Option and Price. 
(i) The Compensation Committee may grant ISOs or Nonqualified Stock Options or any combination of the two, all in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. ISOs may be granted only to employees of the Company or its parent or subsidiary corporations, as defined in Code section 424. Nonqualified Options may be granted to Employees, Advisors or members of the Board. 
(ii) The Exercise Price of Shares subject to an Option shall be determined by the Compensation Committee and may be equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted. However, an ISO may not be granted to an Employee who, at the time of grant, owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company, or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company, as defined in Code section 424, unless the Exercise Price per Share is not less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant. 
(iii) Each ISO shall provide that, if the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of the grant with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by a Grantee during any calendar year, under the Plan or any other stock option plan of the Company or a parent or subsidiary of the Company, exceeds $100,000, then the Option, as to the excess, shall be treated as a Nonqualified Option. 
A-10 
(c) Option Term. The Compensation Committee shall determine the term of each Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term of any Option shall not exceed ten years from the date of grant. 
(d) Option Termination. Except as provided below, an Option may only be exercised while the Grantee is employed or engaged by the Company or any Affiliate as an Advisor, Employee or member of the Board. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee and set forth in a Grant Letter, Options shall terminate on the earliest of: 
(i) the date on which the Grantee is no longer employed or engaged by the Company and any Affiliate on account of the Grantee's termination for Cause. In addition, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 5, if the Compensation Committee determines that the Grantee has engaged in conduct that constitutes Cause at any time while the Grantee is employed or engaged by the Company and any Affiliate or after the Grantee's termination of employment or engagement, any Option held by the Grantee shall immediately terminate and the Grantee shall automatically forfeit all Shares underlying any exercised portion of an Option for which the Company has not yet delivered the Share certificates, upon refund by the Company of the Exercise Price paid by the Grantee for such Shares. Upon any exercise of an Option, the Company may withhold delivery of Share certificates pending resolution of an inquiry that could lead to a finding resulting in a forfeiture; 
(ii) the 91st day following the date the Grantee is no longer employed or engaged by the Company and any Affiliate for any reason other than Cause, death, or Disability; provided, however, that in all cases the portion of any Option that is not vested on the date of termination of employment or engagement shall terminate immediately upon such termination; 
(iii) the first anniversary of the date the Grantee's employment or engagement by the Company and any Affiliate terminates on account of the Grantee's death or Disability; provided, however, that the portion of any Option that is not vested on the date of such termination of employment or engagement shall terminate immediately upon such termination; 
(iv) the tenth anniversary of the date of grant as set forth in the Grant Letter; and 
(v) cancellation, termination or expiration of the Options pursuant to action taken by the Compensation Committee in accordance with Section 1312. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that on the last business day of the term of an Option (other than an ISO) (i) the exercise of the Option is prohibited by applicable law or (ii) Shares may not be purchased or sold by certain employees or directors of the Company due to the "black-out period" of a Company policy or a "lock-up" agreement undertaken in connection with an issuance of securities by the Company, the term of the 
A-11 
 Option shall be extended for a period of 30 days following the end of the legal prohibition, black-out period or lock-up agreement, to the extent permitted under Code section 409A. 
For purposes of the Plan, employment or engagement by the Company and any Affiliate shall mean employment or service as an Employee, Advisor or member of the Board (so that, for purposes of exercising Options, a Grantee shall not be considered to have terminated his employment or engagement until the Grantee ceases to be an Employee, Advisor and member of the Board), unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise. 
(e) Exercise of Options. Only the vested portion of any Option may be exercised. A Grantee may exercise an Option that has become exercisable, in whole or in part, by delivering a notice of exercise to the Company. The Grantee shall pay the Exercise Price for an Option as specified by the Compensation Committee (i) in cash, (ii) unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, by delivering Shares owned by the Grantee and having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise at least equal to the Exercise Price or by attestation (on a form prescribed by the Compensation Committee) to ownership of Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise at least equal to the Exercise Price, (iii) by payment through a broker in accordance with procedures permitted by Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board, or (iv) by such other method as the Compensation Committee may approve. In addition, in the event the Compensation Committee so determines, to the extent an Option is at the time exercisable for vested shares of Company Stock, all or any part of that vested portion may be surrendered to the Company for an appreciation distribution payable in Shares with a Fair Market Value at the time of the Option surrender equal to the dollar amount by which the then Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the surrendered portion exceeds the aggregate Exercise Price payable for those Shares. Shares used to exercise an Option shall have been held by the Grantee for the requisite period of time necessary to avoid adverse accounting consequences to the Company with respect to the Option. Payment for the Shares to be issued or transferred pursuant to the Option, and any required applicable withholding taxes, must be received by the Company by the time specified by the Compensation Committee depending on the type of payment being made, but in all cases prior to the issuance or transfer of such Shares. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Grant Letter may provide that if on the last day of the term of an Option the Fair Market Value of one Share exceeds the Exercise Price per Share, the Grantee has not exercised the Option (or a tandem SAR, if applicable) and the Option has not expired, the Option shall be deemed to have been exercised by the Grantee on such day with payment made by withholding Shares otherwise issuable in connection with the exercise of the Option. In such event, the Company shall deliver to the Grantee the number of Shares for which the Option was deemed exercised, less the number of Shares required to be withheld for the payment of the total Exercise Price and 
A-12 
required applicable withholding taxes; provided, however, any fractional Share shall be settled in cash. 
Section 6. Stock Awards 
The Compensation Committee may issue or transfer Shares to an Employee, Advisor or member of the Board under a Stock Award, upon such terms as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. The following provisions are applicable to Stock Awards: 
(a) General Requirements. Shares issued or transferred pursuant to Stock Awards may be issued or transferred for consideration or for no consideration, and subject to restrictions or no restrictions, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may, but shall not be required to, establish conditions under which restrictions on Stock Awards shall lapse over a period of time or according to such other criteria as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, including, without limitation, restrictions based upon the achievement of specific pPerformance gGoals. The period of time during which the Stock Awards will remain subject to restrictions will be designated in the Grant Letter as the "Restriction Period." 
(b) Number of Shares. The Compensation Committee shall determine the number of Shares to be issued or transferred pursuant to a Stock Award and the restrictions applicable to such Shares. 
(c) Requirement of Employment or Service. If the Grantee is no longer employed or engaged by the Company or any Affiliate during a period designated in the Grant Letter as the Restriction Period, or if other specified conditions are not met, the Stock Award shall terminate as to all Shares covered by the Grant as to which the restrictions have not lapsed, and those Shares must be immediately returned to the Company. The Compensation Committee may, however, provide for complete or partial exceptions to this requirement as it deems appropriate. 
(d) Restrictions on Transfer and Legend on Stock Certificate. During the Restriction Period, a Grantee may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of the Shares of a Stock Award except under Section 1413(b) below. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, the Company will retain possession of certificates for Shares of Stock Awards until all restrictions on such Shares have lapsed. Each certificate for a Stock Award, unless held by the Company, shall contain a legend giving appropriate notice of the restrictions in the Grant. The Grantee shall be entitled to have the legend removed from the stock certificate covering the Shares subject to restrictions when all restrictions on such Shares have lapsed. The Compensation Committee may determine that the Company will not issue certificates for Stock Awards until all restrictions on such Shares have lapsed. 
(e) Right to Vote and to Receive Dividends. Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, during the Restriction Period, the Grantee shall have the right to vote Shares of Stock Awards and to receive any dividends or other distributions paid on 
A-13 
 such Shares, subject to any restrictions deemed appropriate by the Compensation Committee, including, without limitation, the achievement of specific pPerformance goalsGoals. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, any cash dividends, stock and any other property (other than cash) distributed as a dividend or otherwise with respect to any unvested Stock Award that vests based on achievement of performance goals shall either (i) not be paid or credited or (ii) be accumulated and subject to restrictions and risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the Shares underlying the Stock Award with respect to which such cash, stock or other property has been distributed and shall not be paid unless and untilat the time such restrictions and risk of forfeiture lapse. 
(f) Lapse of Restrictions. All restrictions imposed on Stock Awards shall lapse upon the expiration of the applicable Restriction Period and the satisfaction of all conditions, if any, imposed by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may determine, as to any or all Stock Awards, that the restrictions shall lapse without regard to any Restriction Period. 
Section 7. Stock Units 
The Compensation Committee may grant Stock Units, each of which shall represent one hypothetical Share, to an Employee, Advisor or member of the Board, upon such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. The following provisions are applicable to Stock Units: 
(a) Crediting of Units. Each Stock Unit shall represent the right of the Grantee to receive a Share or an amount of cash based on the value of a Share, if and when specified conditions are met. All Stock Units shall be credited to bookkeeping accounts established on the Company's records for purposes of the Plan. 
(b) Terms of Stock Units. The Compensation Committee may grant Stock Units that are payable if specified performance Performance Ggoals or other conditions are met, or under other circumstances. Stock Units may be paid at the end of a specified performance period or other period, or payment may be deferred to a date authorized by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee shall determine the number of Stock Units to be granted and the requirements applicable to such Stock Units. 
(c) Requirement of Employment or Service. If the Grantee is no longer employed or engaged by the Company or any Affiliate prior to the vesting of Stock Units, or if other conditions established by the Compensation Committee are not met, the Grantee's Stock Units shall be forfeited. The Compensation Committee may, however, provide for complete or partial exceptions to this requirement as it deems appropriate. 
(d) Payment With Respect to Stock Units. Payments with respect to Stock Units shall be made in cash, Shares or any combination of the foregoing, as the Compensation Committee shall determine. 
A-14 
Section 8. Stock Appreciation Rights 
The following provisions are applicable to SARs: 
(a) General Requirements. The Compensation Committee may grant SARs to an Employee, Advisor or member of the Board separately or in tandem with any Option (for all or a portion of the applicable Option). Tandem SARs may be granted either at the time the Option is granted or at any time thereafter while the Option remains outstanding; provided, however, that, in the case of an ISO, SARs may be granted only at the time of the grant of the ISO. The Compensation Committee shall establish the base amount of the SAR at the time the SAR is granted, which shall be equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the date of grant of the SAR. The base amount of each SAR shall be equal to the per Share Exercise Price of the related Option, provided such Exercise Price is equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the date of grant of the SAR or, if there is no related Option, an amount equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the date of grant of the SAR. No SAR shall have a term that is greater than ten years. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that on the last business day of the term of a SAR (x) the exercise of the SAR is prohibited by applicable law or (y) Shares may not be purchased or sold by certain employees or directors of the Company due to the "black-out period" of a Company policy or a "lock-up" agreement undertaken in connection with an issuance of securities by the Company, the term shall be extended for a period of 30 days following the end of the legal prohibition, black-out period or lock-up agreement, to the extent permitted under Code section 409A. 
(b) Tandem SARs. In the case of tandem SARs, the number of SARs granted to a Grantee that shall be exercisable during a specified period shall not exceed the number of Shares that the Grantee may purchase upon the exercise of the related Option during such period. Upon the exercise of an Option, the SARs relating to the Shares covered by such Option shall terminate. Upon the exercise of SARs, the related Option shall terminate to the extent of an equal number of Shares. 
(c) Exercisability. A SAR shall be exercisable during the period specified by the Compensation Committee in the Grant Letter and shall be subject to such vesting and other restrictions as may be specified in the Grant Letter. The Compensation Committee may accelerate the exercisability of any or all outstanding SARs at any time for any reason. SARs may only be exercised while the Grantee is employed or engaged by the Company or Affiliate or during the applicable period after termination of employment or engagement as described in Section 5(c) above. A tandem SAR shall be exercisable only during the period when the Option to which it is related is also exercisable. 
A Grant Letter may provide that if on the last day of the term of a SAR the Fair Market Value of one Share exceeds the base amount per Share of the SAR, the Grantee has not exercised the SAR or the tandem Option (if applicable), and the SAR has not 
A-15 
 otherwise expired, the SAR shall be deemed to have been exercised by the Grantee on such day. In such event, the Company shall make payment to the Grantee in accordance with this Section, reduced by the number of Shares (or cash) required for applicable withholding taxes; any fractional Share shall be settled in cash. 
(d) Grants to Non-Exempt Employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SARs granted to persons who are non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, may not be exercisable for at least six months after the date of grant (except that such SARs may become exercisable, as determined by the Compensation Committee, upon the Grantee's death, Disability or retirement, or upon a Change in Control or other circumstances permitted by applicable regulations). 
(e) Value of SARs. When a Grantee exercises SARs, the Grantee shall receive in settlement of such SARs an amount equal to the value of the stock appreciation for the number of SARs exercised. The stock appreciation for a SAR is the amount by which the Fair Market Value of the underlying Share on the date of exercise of the SAR exceeds the base amount of the SAR as described in subsection (a) above. 
(f) Form of Payment. The appreciation in a SAR shall be paid in Shares, cash or any combination of the foregoing, as the Compensation Committee shall determine. For purposes of calculating the number of Shares to be received, Shares shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the SAR. 
Section 9. Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards 
The Compensation Committee may grant Cash-Based Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards to any Employee, Advisor or member of the Board, on such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee shall determine. Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards may be awarded subject to the achievement of pPerformance Ggoals or other conditions and may be payable in cash, Company Stock or any combination of the foregoing, as the Compensation Committee shall determine. 
Section 10. Dividend Equivalents
The Compensation Committee may grant Dividend Equivalents in connection Stock Units or Other Stock-Based Awards. No Dividend Equivalents or dividends may be granted in connection with Options or SARs. Dividend Equivalents may be paid currently or accrued as contingent cash obligations and may be payable in cash or Shares, and upon such terms as the Compensation Committee may establish, including, without limitation, the achievement of specific performance Performance goalsGoals. Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 10, any Dividend Equivalents granted in connection with unvested Stock Units or Other Stock-Based Awards that are subject to specified performance goals shall be payable only if and to the extent the underlying Stock Units or Other Stock-Based Awards are payable, as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
Section 11. Qualified Performance-Based Compensation 
A-16 
The Compensation Committee may determine that Stock Awards, Stock Units, Cash-Based Awards, Other Stock-Based Awards and Dividend Equivalents granted to an Employee shall be considered "qualified performance-based compensation" under Code section 162(m). The following provisions shall apply to Grants of Stock Awards, Stock Units, Cash-Based Awards, Other Stock-Based Awards and Dividend Equivalents that are to be considered "qualified performance-based compensation" under Code section 162(m): 
(a) Performance Goals.
(i) When Stock Awards, Stock Units, Cash-Based Awards, Other Stock-Based Awards or Dividend Equivalents that are to be considered "qualified performance-based compensation" are granted, the Compensation Committee shall establish in writing (A) the objective performance goals that must be met, (B) the performance period during which the performance will be measured, (C) the threshold, target and maximum amounts that may be paid if the performance goals are met, and (D) any other conditions that the Compensation Committee deems appropriate and consistent with the Plan and Code section 162(m). 
(ii) The business criteria may relate to the performance of the Company, or the performance of a parent company, a subsidiary, division, business segment or business unit of the Company or a subsidiary, or based upon performance relative to performance of other companies or upon comparisons or any of the indicators of performance relative to performance of other companies, or any combination of the foregoing. Any performance goals that are financial metrics, may be determined in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), in accordance with accounting principles established by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB Principles"), or may be adjusted when established to include or exclude any items otherwise includable or excludable under GAAP or under IASB Principles. The Compensation Committee shall use objectively determinable performance goals based on one or more of the following criteria: stock price, earnings per share, net earnings, operating earnings, earnings before income taxes, EBITDA (earnings before income tax expense, interest expense, and depreciation and amortization expense), return on assets, shareholder return, return on equity, growth in assets, unit volume, sales or market share, or strategic business criteria consisting of one or more objectives based on meeting specified revenue goals, market penetration goals, geographic business expansion goals, cost targets or goals relating to acquisitions or divestitures; pre- or after-tax income or loss (before or after allocation of corporate overhead and bonus); appreciation in and/or maintenance of the price of the Shares or any other publicly-traded securities of the Company; improvement in or attainment of expense levels or working capital levels, including cash, inventory and accounts receivable; general and administrative expense savings; year-end cash; regulatory achievements (including submitting or filing applications or other documents with regulatory authorities or receiving approval of any such applications or other documents and passing pre-approval inspections (whether of
A-17 
the Company or the Company's third-party manufacturer) and validation of manufacturing processes (whether the Company's or the Company's third-party manufacturer's); clinical achievements (including initiating clinical studies, initiating enrollment, completing enrollment or enrolling particular numbers of subjects in clinical studies, completing phases of a clinical study (including the treatment phase), or announcing or presenting preliminary or final data from clinical studies, in each case, whether on particular timelines or generally); strategic partnerships or transactions (including in-licensing and out-licensing of intellectual property); establishing relationships with commercial entities with respect to the marketing, distribution and sale of the Company's products (including with group purchasing organizations, distributors and other vendors); co-development, co-marketing, profit sharing, joint venture or other similar arrangements; financing and other capital raising transactions (including sales of the Company's equity or debt securities); debt level year-end cash position; competitive market metrics; timely completion of new product roll-outs; sales or licenses of the Company's assets (including its intellectual property, whether in a particular jurisdiction or territory or globally, or through partnering transactions); royalty income; implementation, completion or attainment of measurable objectives with respect to research, development, manufacturing, commercialization, products or projects, acquisitions and divestitures. The Compensation Committee may provide for exclusion of the impact of an event or occurrence which the Compensation Committee determines should appropriately be excluded, including (A) restructurings, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and other unusual, infrequently occurring or non-recurring charges, (B) an event either not directly related to the operations of the Company, Company subsidiary, division, business segment or business unit or not within the reasonable control of management, or (C) the cumulative effects of tax or accounting changes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
(b) Establishment of Goals. The Compensation Committee shall establish the performance goals (and any exclusions) in writing either before the beginning of the performance period or during a period ending no later than the earlier of (i) 90 days after the beginning of the performance period or (ii) the date on which 25% of the performance period has been completed, or such other date as may be required or permitted under applicable regulations under Code section 162(m). The performance goals shall satisfy the requirements for "qualified performance-based compensation," including the requirement that the achievement of the goals be substantially uncertain at the time they are established and that the goals be established in such a way that a third party with knowledge of the relevant facts could determine whether and to what extent the performance goals have been met. The Compensation Committee shall not have discretion to increase the amount of compensation that is payable upon achievement of the designated performance goals. 
(c) Announcement of Grants. The Compensation Committee shall certify and announce the results for each performance period to all Grantees after the announcement  
A-18 
of the Company's financial results for the performance period. If and to the extent that the Compensation Committee does not certify that the performance goals have been met, the grants of Stock Awards, Stock Units, Cash-Based Awards, Other Stock-Based Awards and Dividend Equivalents for the performance period shall be forfeited or shall not be made, as applicable. If Dividend Equivalents are granted as "qualified performance-based compensation" under Code section 162(m), a Grantee may not accrue more than $1,000,000 of such Dividend Equivalents during any calendar year. 
(d) Death, Disability or Other Circumstances. The Compensation Committee may provide that Stock Awards, Stock Units, Cash-Based Awards, Other Stock-Based Awards and Dividend Equivalents shall be payable or restrictions on such Grants shall lapse, in whole or in part, in the event of the Grantee's death or Disability during the performance period, or under other circumstances consistent with the Treasury regulations and rulings under Code section 162(m). 
Section 1211. Deferrals 
The Compensation Committee may permit or require a Grantee to defer receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Grantee in connection with any Stock Units, Cash-Based Awards, or Other Stock-Based Awards. If any such deferral election is permitted or required, the Compensation Committee shall establish rules and procedures for such deferrals and may provide for interest or other earnings to be paid on such deferrals. The rules and procedures for any such deferrals shall be consistent with applicable requirements of Code section 409A. 
Section 1312. Adjustment Upon Changes in Capitalization. 
In the event any recapitalization, forward or reverse split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase, exchange or issuance of Shares or other securities, any stock dividend or other special and nonrecurring dividend or distribution (whether in the form of cash, securities or other property other than a regular cash dividend), liquidation, dissolution, or other similar transactions or events, affects the Shares or the value thereof, then the Compensation Committee shall make such adjustment, in such manner as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of Grantees under the Plan, including adjustment in (i) the number and kind of Shares deemed to be available thereafter for Grants under Section 3, (ii) the number and kind of Shares that may be delivered or deliverable in respect of outstanding Grants, and (iii) the price per share or the applicable market value of such Grants. In addition, the Compensation Committee shall make such adjustments as are appropriate in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Grants (including, without limitation, cancellation of Grants in exchange for the in-the-money value, if any, of the vested portion thereof, cancellation of unvested Grants for no consideration, cancellation of out-of-the-money Grants for no consideration, substitution of Grants using securities of a successor or other entity, acceleration of the time that Grants expire, or adjustment of performance targets) in recognition of unusual or 
A-19 
 nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, a Change in Control or an event described in the preceding sentence) affecting the Company or any Affiliate of the Company or the financial statements of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company, or in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles. Any adjustments to outstanding Grants shall be consistent with Code section 409A or 424, to the extent applicable. Any adjustments determined by the Compensation Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
Section 1413. Restrictions on Shares. 
(a) Restrictions on Issuing Shares. No Shares shall be issued or transferred under the Plan unless and until all applicable legal requirements have been complied with to the satisfaction of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee shall have the right to condition any Grant on the Grantee's undertaking in writing to comply with such restrictions on any subsequent disposition of the Shares issued or transferred thereunder as the Compensation Committee shall deem necessary or advisable as a result of any applicable law, regulation or official interpretation thereof. 
(b) Transfer Restrictions. 
(i) Nontransferability of Grants. Except as provided below, only the Grantee may exercise rights under a Grant during the Grantee's lifetime. No Grant under the Plan and no Shares that have not been issued or as to which any applicable restriction, performance or deferral period has not lapsed, may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, except (A) by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or (B) with respect to Grants other than ISOs, pursuant to a domestic relations order. When a Grantee dies, the personal representative or other Person entitled to succeed to the rights of the Grantee may exercise such rights. Any such successor must furnish proof satisfactory to the Company of his or her right to receive the Grant under the Grantee's will or under the applicable laws of descent and distribution. 
(ii) Transfer of Nonqualified Stock Options. Notwithstanding (i) above, the Compensation Committee may provide, in a Grant Letter, that a Grantee may transfer Nonqualified Options to family members, or one or more trusts or other entities for the benefit of or owned by family members, consistent with the applicable securities laws, according to such terms as the Compensation Committee may determine; provided that the Grantee receives no consideration for the transfer of the Nonqualified Option and the transferred Nonqualified Option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Nonqualified Option immediately before the transfer. 
(c) ISO Notice. A Grantee shall notify the Company of any disposition of Shares acquired upon exercise of an ISO if such disposition occurs within one year of the date of such exercise or within two years of the date of grant of such ISO. The Company may impose such procedures as it determines may be necessary to ensure that such notification is made. 
A-20 
(d) Requirements for Issuance or Transfer of Shares. No Shares shall be issued or transferred in connection with any Grant made hereunder unless and until all legal requirements applicable to the issuance or transfer of such Shares have been complied with to the satisfaction of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee shall have the right to condition any Grant on the Grantee's undertaking in writing to comply with such restrictions on his or her subsequent disposition of the Shares as the Compensation Committee shall deem necessary or advisable, and certificates representing such Shares may be legended to reflect any such restrictions. Certificates representing Shares issued or transferred under the Plan may be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other restrictions as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate to comply with applicable laws, regulations and interpretations, including any requirement that a legend be placed thereon. 
Section  1514. Withholding of Taxes.

In addition, in the event of a Change in Control, the Compensation Committee may take one or more of the following actions with respect to any or all outstanding Grants: the Compensation Committee may (i) require that Grantees surrender their outstanding vested Options and SARs in exchange for one or more payments by the Company, in cash or Shares as determined by 
A-21 
 the Compensation Committee, in an amount equal to the amount by which the then Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Grantee's unexercised, vested Options and SARs exceeds the Exercise Price of the vested Options or the base amount of the vested SARs, as applicable, (ii) provide for the cancellation of unvested Grants for no consideration, (iii) provide for the cancellation of out-of-the-money Grants for no consideration, (iv) after giving Grantees an opportunity to exercise their outstanding Options and SARs, terminate any or all unexercised Options and SARs at such time as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, or (v) determine that outstanding Options and SARs that are not exercised shall be assumed by, or replaced with comparable options or rights by, the surviving corporation, (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation), and other outstanding Grants that remain in effect after the Change in Control shall be converted to similar grants of the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation). Such surrender or termination shall take place as of the date of the Change in Control or such other date as the Compensation Committee may specify (subject to consummation of the Change in Control). 
Section  1716. General Provisions 
(a) Grant Letter. Each Grant shall be evidenced by a Grant Letter. The terms and provisions of such Grant Letters may vary among Grantees and among different Grants made to the same Grantee. 
(b) No Right to Employment. The making of a Grant in any year shall not give the Grantee any right to similar grants in future years, any right to continue such Grantee's employment relationship with the Company or its Affiliates, or, until Shares are issued, any rights as a stockholder of the Company. All Grantees shall remain subject to discharge to the same extent as if the Plan were not in effect. For purposes of the Plan, a sale of any Affiliate of the Company that employs or engages a Grantee shall be treated as the termination of such Grantee's employment or engagement, unless the Grantee shall otherwise continue to provide services to the Company or another subsidiary of the Company as an employee or director. 
(c) No Fractional Shares. No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Grant. Except as otherwise provided under the Plan, the Compensation Committee shall determine whether cash, other awards or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of such fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated. 
(d) No Funding. No Grantee, and no beneficiary or other Persons claiming under or through the Grantee, shall have any right, title or interest by reason of any Option to any particular assets of the Company or Affiliates of the Company, or any Shares allocated or reserved for the purposes of the Plan or subject to any Grant except as set forth herein. The Company shall not be required to establish any fund or make any other segregation of assets to assure satisfaction of the Company's obligations under the Plan. 
A-22 
(e) Governing Law; Jurisdiction. The Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. To the extent the Grantee is a party to an employment agreement with the Company or any of its subsidiaries that provides for binding arbitration of employment disputes, then any disputes between the Company and such Grantee arising under the Plan shall be arbitrated in accordance with the procedures set forth in such employment agreement. 
(f) Compliance with Law. The Plan, the exercise of Options and SARs and the obligations of the Company to issue or transfer Shares under Grants shall be subject to all applicable laws and regulations, and to approvals by any governmental or regulatory agency as may be required. With respect to Persons subject to section 16 of the Exchange Act, it is the intent of the Company that the Plan and all transactions under the Plan comply with all applicable provisions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors under the Exchange Act. In addition, it is the intent of the Company that ISOs comply with the applicable provisions of Code section 422,that the Plan comply with the applicable provisions of Code section 162(m) and that, to the extent applicable, Grants be exempt from or comply with the requirements of Code section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation Committee makes no representation that the Grants awarded under the Plan shall be exempt from or comply with Code section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Code section 409A from applying to Grants awarded under the Plan. To the extent that any legal requirement of section 16 of the Exchange Act or Code sections 422, 162(m) or 409A as set forth in the Plan ceases to be required under section 16 of the Exchange Act or Code sections 422, 162(m) or 409A, that Plan provision shall cease to apply. To the extent applicable, if on the date of a Grantee's "separation from service" (as such term is defined under Code section 409A), Shares (or shares of any other company required to be aggregated with the Company for purposes of Code section 409A and its corresponding regulations) are publicly-traded on an established securities market or otherwise and the Grantee is a "specified employee" (as such term is defined in Code section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and its corresponding regulations) as determined by the Compensation Committee (or its delegate) in its discretion in accordance with the requirements of Code sections 409A and 416, then all Grants that are deemed to be deferred compensation subject to the requirements of Code section 409A and payable within six months following such Grantee's "separation from service" shall be postponed for a period of six months following the Grantee's "separation from service" with the Company, to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of penalty taxes thereunder. The Compensation Committee may revoke any Grant if it is contrary to law or modify a Grant to bring it into compliance with any valid and mandatory government regulation. The Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, agree to limit its authority under this Section 
A-23 
(g) Grants made in Connection with Corporate Transactions and Otherwise. Nothing contained in the Plan shall be construed to (i) limit the right of the Compensation Committee to make Grants under the Plan in connection with the acquisition, by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of the business or assets of any corporation, firm or association, including Grants to employees thereof who become Employees, or (ii) limit the right of the Company to grant stock options or make other awards outside of the Plan. The Compensation Committee may make a Grant to an employee of another corporation who becomes an Employee by reason of a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of stock or property, reorganization or liquidation involving the Company, in substitution for awards made by such corporation. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Compensation Committee may establish such terms and conditions of the new Grants as it deems appropriate, including setting the Exercise Price of Options at a price necessary to retain for the Grantee the same economic value as the prior options. 
(h) Application of Company Clawback Policy. All Grants under the Plan are subject to the applicable provisions of the Company's clawback or recoupment policy approved by the Board or the Compensation Committee; as such policy may be in effect from time to time, and will be subject to recoupment as may be required by applicable law, regulation or listing exchange. 
Section  1817. Amendment or Termination. 
(a) Amendment. The Board may amend or terminate the Plan at any time; provided, however, that the Board shall not amend the Plan without stockholder approval if such approval is required in order to comply with the Code or other applicable law (including Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act), or to comply with applicable stock exchange requirements; and further provided that the Board may not, without the approval of the Company's stockholders, to the extent required by such applicable law, amend the Plan to (a) increase the number of Shares that may be the subject of Grants under the Plan (except for adjustments pursuant to Section 1312), (b) expand the types of awards available under the Plan, (c) materially expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, (d) amend Section 5 and Section 8 to eliminate the requirements relating to minimum exercise price, minimum grant price and stockholder approval, (e) increase the maximum permissible term of any Option or the maximum permissible term of a SAR, (f) add performance goals to Section 11, (gf) increase any of the limitations in Section 3, or (hg) amend Section 1817(b). 
(b) No Repricing Without Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, and other than pursuant to Section 1312, the Compensation Committee shall not without the approval of the Company's stockholders (a) lower the Exercise Price per Share of an Option (or grant price of a SAR) after it is granted, (b) cancel an Option or SAR in exchange for an Option or SAR with a lower Exercise Price, cash or another Grant (other than in connection with a Change in Control), or 
A-24 
 (c) take any other action with respect to an Option or SAR that would be treated as a repricing under the rules and regulations of the principal U.S. national securities exchange on which the Shares are listed. 
(c) Stockholder Re-Approval Requirement. If Stock Awards, Stock Units, Cash-Based Awards, Other Stock-Based Awards or Dividend Equivalents are granted as "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 11 above, the Plan must be reapproved by the stockholders no later than the first stockholders meeting that occurs in the fifth year following the year in which the stockholders previously approved the provisions of Section 11, if required by Code section 162(m) or the regulations thereunder. 
(dc ) Termination of Plan. The Plan shall terminate on December 3November 28, 20284, unless the Plan is terminated earlier by the Board or is extended by the Board with the approval of the stockholders; provided, however, in no event may an ISO be granted more than ten years after the date of the adoption of the Plan by the Board. 
(ed ) Termination and Amendment of Outstanding Grants. A termination or amendment of the Plan that occurs after a Grant is made shall not materially impair the rights of a Grantee unless the Grantee consents or unless the Compensation Committee acts under Section 1716(f) above. The termination of the Plan shall not impair the power and authority of the Compensation Committee with respect to an outstanding Grant. Whether or not the Plan has terminated, an outstanding Grant may be terminated or amended under Section 1716(f) above or may be amended by agreement of the Company and the Grantee consistent with the Plan. 
(f) Prior Plan. Any Grants made under the Plan prior to the Restatement Effective Date shall be governed by the terms of the Plan in effect at the time each such Grant was made, including the requirement that the Compensation Committee be composed of "outside directors" as defined under Code section 162(m) and related Treasury Regulations with respect to any action taken after the Restatement Effective Date with respect to Grants made under the Plan before such date and that are intended to meet the requirements of the performance-based compensation exception for purposes of Code section 162(m), unless further amended in accordance with the terms of the Grant and such version of the Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, any Grants made under the Plan on or after the Restatement Effective Date, shall be subject to the terms of the Plan in effect on and after the Restatement Effective Date.

The right to indemnification conferred herein shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in defending any such action in advance of its final disposition (an "Advancement of Expenses"); provided, however, that if, but only if and then only to the extent, the DGCL requires, an Advancement of Expenses incurred by an indemnitee hereunder shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (an "Undertaking"), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (a "Final Adjudication") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Article FOURTH or otherwise.

If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also
B-5 
the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an Advancement of Expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (ii) any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses only upon a Final Adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard for indemnification, if any, set forth in the DGCL.

In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an Advancement of Expenses hereunder, or brought by the Corporation to recover an Advancement of Expenses pursuant to the terms of an Undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such Advancement of Expenses, under this Article FOURTH or otherwise, shall be on the Corporation.] 
[(iii) The rights to indemnification and to the Advancement of Expenses conferred in this Article FOURTH shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire by any statute, this Certificate of Incorporation, the Corporation's By-Laws, or any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.]

The foregoing right of indemnification shall in no way be deemed exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such officer or director may be entitled under any statute, this Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws of the Corporation or any agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 
B-6 
SEVENTH: No person who is or was a director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director unless, and only to the extent that such director is liable (i) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL or any amendment thereto or successor provision thereto, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. This article shall not eliminate or limit the liability or a director for any act or omission occurring prior to the date when this article becomes effective. No amendment to, repeal or adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this article shall apply to or have any effect on the liability of any director of the Corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment, repeal, or adoption of an inconsistent provision. 
EIGHTH: Any and all right, title, interest and claim in or to any dividends declared by the Corporation, whether in cash, stock or otherwise, which are unclaimed by the stockholder entitled thereto for a period of six (6) years after the close of business on the payment date, shall be and be deemed to be extinguished and abandoned, and such unclaimed dividends in the possession of the Corporation, its transfer agents or other agents or depositaries, shall at such time become the absolute property of the Corporation, free and clear of any and all claims of any persons whatsoever. 
NINTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the Corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between the Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on application in a summary way of the Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof, or on the application of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of any receiver or receivers appointed for the Corporation under Section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of the Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and to any reorganization of the Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of the Corporation, as the case may be, and also on the Corporation. 
TENTH: Board of Directors. 
(a) Number of Directors. The total number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall be determined in accordance with the By-laws of the Corporation, but shall not be less than two (2) nor more than nine (9).

B-7 
 shall be divided into three classes with respect to the term of office, each class to contain, as near as may be possible, one-third of the whole number of the Board, with the terms of office of one class expiring each successive year. At each annual meeting of stockholders, the successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that time shall be elected by the stockholders to serve until the annual meeting of stockholders held three years next following and until their successors shall be elected and qualified. 
(ii) In the event of any intervening changes in the authorized number of directors, the Board of Directors shall designate the class or classes to which the increases or decreases in directorships shall be apportioned and may designate one or more directorships as directorships of another class in order more nearly to achieve equality of number of directors among the classes; provided, however, that no such apportionment or redesignation shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. 
(c) Vacancies. Subject to the limitations prescribed by law and this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, all vacancies in the office of director, including vacancies created by newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors, may be filled only by a vote of a majority of the directors then holding office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; and any director so elected shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the new directorship was created or the vacancy occurred and until such director's successor is duly elected and shall qualify or until such director's earlier resignation or removal. 
(d) Amendment to this Paragraph. In addition to any requirements of law or of any other provisions of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than eighty percent (80%) of the total number of votes eligible to be cast by the holders of all outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote thereon shall be required to amend, alter, rescind or repeal any provision of this Article TENTH. 
(e) Written Ballot. Unless and to the extent that the By-Laws so provide, elections of directors need not be by written ballot.
