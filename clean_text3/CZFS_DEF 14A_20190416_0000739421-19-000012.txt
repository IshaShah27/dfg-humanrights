 Presentation & Recommendations:  The final summary report is reviewed and discussed with the full Board by the Governance and Nominating Committee.  
[END TABLE]
The Governance and Nominating Committee considers the following criteria in selecting nominees for initial election or appointment to the Board:         financial, regulatory and business experience; familiarity with and participation in the local community; integrity, honesty and reputation; dedication to the Company and its shareholders; independence; and any other factors the Governance and         Nominating Committee deems relevant, including age, residence, geographies, size of the Board of Directors and regulatory disclosure obligations.  Further, when         identifying nominees to serve as director, the Governance and Nominating Committee seeks to create a Board that is strong in its collective knowledge and has a diversity of skills and experience with respect to accounting and finance, management         and leadership, vision and strategy, business operations, business judgment, industry knowledge, agri-business experience and knowledge, current or previous SEC filing company board experience, and corporate governance. 
                In addition, prior to nominating an existing director for re-election to the Board of Directors, the Governance and Nominating Committee considers         and reviews an existing director's Board and committee attendance and performance, length of Board service, experience, skills and contributions that the existing director brings to the Board, equity ownership in the Company, and independence.
                Process for Identifying and Evaluating Nominees. The process the Governance and Nominating Committee follows when it identifies and evaluates individuals         to be nominated for election to the Board of Directors is as follows:
                Identification.  For purposes of identifying nominees for the Board         of Directors, the Governance and Nominating Committee relies on personal contacts of the committee and other members of the Board of Directors as well as its knowledge of members of the Bank's local communities.  The           Governance and Nominating Committee will also consider director candidates recommended by shareholders in accordance with the policy and procedures set forth above.  The Governance and Nominating Committee has         not previously used an independent search firm in identifying nominees. 
                Evaluation.  In evaluating potential nominees, the Governance and         Nominating Committee determines whether the candidate is eligible and qualified for service on the Board of Directors by evaluating the candidate under the selection criteria set forth above.  In addition, the         Governance and Nominating Committee will conduct a check of the individual's background and interview the candidate.
                Consideration of Recommendations by Shareholders.  It is the policy of the Governance and         Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company to consider director candidates recommended by shareholders who appear to be qualified to serve on the Company's Board of Directors.  The         Governance and Nominating Committee may choose not to consider an unsolicited recommendation if no vacancy exists on the Board of Directors and the Governance and Nominating Committee does not perceive a need to increase the size of the Board of         Directors.  In order to avoid the unnecessary use of the Governance and Nominating Committee's resources, the Governance and Nominating Committee will consider only those director candidates recommended in         accordance with the procedures set forth below. 
Procedures to be             Followed by Shareholders.  To submit a         recommendation of a director candidate to the Governance and Nominating Committee, a shareholder should submit the following information in writing, addressed to the Secretary of the Company at the main office of the Company: 
                1.     The         name and address of the person recommended as a director candidate;
                2.     All         information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;
                3.     The         written consent of the person being recommended as a director candidate to be named in the Proxy Statement as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected;
  4.     As to the person making the recommendation, the name and         address, as they appear on the Company's books, of such person, and number of shares of common stock of the Company owned by such person; provided, however, that if the person is not a registered holder of the Company's common stock, the person should submit his or her name and address along with a         current written statement from the record holder of the shares that reflects the recommending person's beneficial ownership of the Company's common stock; and
  5.       A statement disclosing whether the person making the recommendation is acting with or on behalf of any         other person and, if applicable, the identity of such person.
                In order for a director candidate to be considered for nomination at the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the recommendation must be         received by the Governance and Nominating Committee at least 120 calendar days prior to the date the Company's Proxy Statement was released to shareholders in connection with the previous year's Annual Meeting, advanced by one year.
Director Compensation
                The following table sets forth information concerning         the compensation of non-employee directors during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
(1)     Reflects the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 – Share Based Payment.  The         amounts were calculated based upon the Company's stock price of $62.93 on the date of grant.  For applicable directors, stock award amounts represent grants of 150 shares of common stock made under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and granted in 2018.
(2)              Consists of a life insurance benefit, holiday gifts, and spouse expense at a director retreat. 
(3)              Director Kunes was appointed to the Board December 18, 2018.
(4)     Includes a split dollar life insurance benefit of $4,741.
The foregoing table reflects the following arrangements:
                Fees.  During 2018, our directors, except for Directors Coolidge, Black, Richards and van der Hiel, received the following fees for service         on our Board of Directors: $500 for attending a board meeting and strategic retreat or training session; $21,840 annual retainer; $300 monthly fee for committee meeting attendance; $160 for participation in a Board conference call; and $200 for         attending an advisory board meeting.  Additionally, committee chairpersons for Credit Committee, Audit and Examination Committee, Compensation/Human Resource Committee, and Governance and Nominating Committee         receive a $2,000 annual retainer.   Director Coolidge, who serves as the Company's and the Bank's Chairman, and Director van der Hiel, who serves as the Company's and Bank's Vice Chairman, received a fixed         annual sum of $51,966 and $40,720 respectively, in lieu of all director's fees and committee member fees in 2018.  Directors Coolidge and van der Hiel also receive an advisory board fee of $200 per attended         meeting.  
                Deferred               Compensation Plan.  The Company maintains the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan as a vehicle for non-employee directors to defer         retainers and meeting fees.  Participants are eligible for a distribution under the plan upon the earlier of death, disability, or separation from service as a non-employee director of the Company.  At the election of each participant, distributions are made in either a lump sum or in a series of five annual installments.  In addition, the plan provides for         distributions in the event of an unforeseeable emergency as such term is defined under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.  Directors Landy and Kosa are currently participating in the plan.  
                Life               Insurance.  In addition to these fees, each active director is provided a $100,000 life insurance benefit.  Once a director retires, insurance coverage continues but the benefit declines as the age of the retired director increases.  Total premiums paid in 2018 for life insurance         on behalf of the current and retired directors was $2,183.
Stock Awards.  Non-employee directors received grants of stock under our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan. 
Meetings of the Board of Directors
                The Board of Directors oversees all of the Company's business, property and         affairs.  The Chairman of the Board and the executive officers keep the members of the Board informed of the Company's business through discussions at Board meetings and by providing them reports and other         materials.  During 2018, the Company's Board of Directors held nine regular meetings.  Each of the directors attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which he/she served. 
 Meetings of the Advisory Boards / Regional Board
                The Board of         Directors utilizes advisory boards or a regional board in communities currently served by the Bank.  The advisory and regional boards are composed of well-respected people from the community, the office         manager or market executive, and a member of the Board of Directors (who serves as a non-voting member of the advisory or regional board).  The Board member serves as a communication link to share, with the advisory or regional board, the appropriate information occurring at Board of Directors' meetings, as well as communicating to the Board of Directors advisory or regional board issues and suggestions.  Advisory or regional boards meet monthly.  A fee         of $200 is paid for attendance at the monthly advisory board or regional board meeting. 
Attendance at the Annual Meeting
                           The Company expects its directors to attend annual meetings of shareholders.  All but         one director attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
AUDIT-RELATED MATTERS
Report of the Audit and Examination Committee
                The Audit and Examination Committee met with management periodically during the year to consider the adequacy of the         Company's internal controls and the objectivity of its financial reporting. The Audit and Examination Committee discussed these matters with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and with appropriate Company financial         personnel and internal auditors. The Audit and Examination Committee also discussed with the Company's senior management and independent registered public accounting firm the process used for certifications by the Company's Chief Executive Officer         and Chief Financial Officer which are required for certain Company filings with the SEC.
                The Audit and Examination Committee meets with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal         auditors, the Chief Financial Officer, the Vice President of Finance, and the Risk/Compliance Officer on a number of occasions, each of whom has unrestricted access to the Audit and Examination Committee.  
                Management has primary responsibility for the Company's financial statements and the overall reporting process,         including the Company's system of internal controls.
                The independent registered public accounting firm audited the annual financial statements prepared by management,         expressed an opinion as to whether those financial statements fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and discussed with the Audit         and Examination Committee any issues the independent registered public accounting firm believed should be raised with the Audit and Examination Committee.
                The Audit and Examination Committee reviewed with management and S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. the Company's audited financial         statements, as well as the audit of management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting and met separately with both management and S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. to discuss and review those financial statements and reports prior to         issuance.  Management has represented, and S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. has confirmed, to the Audit and Examination Committee, that the financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted         accounting principles.
                The Audit and Examination Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from S.R. Snodgrass, P.C.         required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding S.R. Snodgrass, P.C.'s communications with the Audit and Examination Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. its         independence.  The Audit and Examination Committee also discussed with S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 1301.  The Audit and Examination Committee implemented a procedure to monitor auditor independence, reviewed audit and non-audit services performed by S.R. Snodgrass, P.C., and discussed with the auditors their         independence.
In reliance on these reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit and Examination Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the         Company's audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.  The Audit and Examination Committee and the         Board have also recommended the selection of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.

Policy on Audit and Examination Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
                The Audit and Examination Committee is responsible         for appointing and overseeing the work of the independent auditing firm.  In accordance with its charter, the Audit and Examination Committee approves, in advance, all audit and permissible non-audit services         to be performed by the independent auditing firm.  Such approval process ensures that the external auditor does not provide any non-audit services to the Company that are prohibited by law or regulation.
                In addition, the Audit and Examination Committee has established a policy regarding pre-approval of audit and permissible non-audit services         provided by the independent auditing firm.  Management's requests that particular services by the independent auditing firm be pre-approved under the auditor services policy must be specific as to the         particular services to be provided.
                The request may be made with respect to either specific services or a type of service for predictable or recurring services.
                During the year ended December 31, 2018, all audit and non-audit services were approved, in advance, by the Audit and Examination Committee in         compliance with these procedures.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Overview
                The following discussion provides a description of our decision-making process and philosophy for compensating our named executive officers in         2018. This discussion also describes the material components of each named executive officer's total compensation package and details the reasoning behind the decisions made in 2018. This discussion should be read together with the compensation         tables for our named executive officers located in the "Executive Compensation" section of this proxy statement. 
Executive Summary
                         It is the intent of the Compensation/Human Resource Committee to provide our named executive officers with a total compensation package that is market competitive, promotes the achievement of our strategic objectives and is aligned with         operating and other performance metrics to support long-term shareholder value. In addition, we have structured our executive compensation program to include elements that are intended to create an appropriate balance between risk and reward.
Fiscal Year 2018 Company Performance
2018 represented strong results for the Company for both earning levels and performance metrics, particularly compared to peer. The         financial results for 2018 represent the highest level of profitability in the Company's history, and are a reflection of the execution of our strategic plan and outstanding customer service.  Our emphasis on         growth is evidenced by our continued loan and deposit growth during 2018.  
2018 highlights include:
• Earning levels.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, net income totaled $18.0 million, which compares to net income of $13.0 million for         the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $5.0 million or 38.5%.    Financial results for 2018 were significantly impacted by strong revenue growth as total interest income increased $8.7 million, or         18.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year.  Net income for 2017 was negatively impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted last December which lowered the federal corporate         income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.  As a result, the carrying value of net deferred tax assets was reduced, which increased income tax expense by $1.5 million.  The reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate contributed favorably to our financial performance for 2018.  While income before provision for income taxes         increased $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year, the provision for income taxes decreased from $6.0 million $2.4 million, which reflects the lower tax rates and the $1.5 reduction in deferred tax assets         recorded in the prior year.
• Solid performance metrics.  Basic earnings per share of $5.14 for 2018 compares to $3.70 last year.  Return          on equity for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 13.00% and 10.04%, while return on assets was 1.29% and 1.03%, respectively. 
• Growth.   Total assets increased $68.8 million or 5.1% to close the year at $1.431 billion as of December 31, 2018, compared to $1.362         billion at December 31, 2017.  Net loans ended 2018 at $1.069 billion, an increase of 8.1% or $80 million of organic growth.  Total dollar value of loans extended in 2018 was $300 million which encompassed over 1,800 loans.  Total deposits ended         2018 at $1.185 billion, an increase of 7.3% or $80 million.  
• Asset quality.   Asset quality remains solid, although non-performing assets increased from $11.8 million as of December 31, 2017 to $14.4         million as of December 31, 2018.  The ratio of non-performing assets to total loans was 1.33% at December 31, 2018 compared to 1.18% last December.  Annualized net charge-offs remain low at .02% for 2018.
• Shareholder return.  Cash dividends paid increased 5.4% for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulting in $1.74 per share being paid,         compared to $1.65 per share being paid for the year ended December 31, 2017.  
Fiscal Year 2018 Compensation Decisions 
                Against the backdrop of our solid financial performance and shareholder return, the Compensation/Human Resource Committee, along with our Chief         Executive Officer/President, took the following actions related to our named executive officers' compensation and benefit arrangements for 2018: 
• Chief Executive Officer/President.  The Board of Directors conducted a performance review of our Chief Executive         Officer/President during 2017 for purposes of determining his 2018 compensation.  The Board of Directors concluded that our Chief Executive Officer/President continues to exhibit strong business and leadership         skills and is moving the Company in a direction that continues to enhance long-term shareholder value.  Therefore, the Company allowed the term of our Chief Executive Officer/President's employment agreement         to extend through June 2021.  In addition, effective January 1, 2018, the Board of Directors increased the annual base salary of our Chief Executive Officer/President by 9.0% to $425,000.
• Other Named Executive Officers.  Our Chief Executive Officer/President conducted a performance review for our other named         executive officers and determined that the officers continue to contribute greatly to the success of the Company and its affiliates.  Therefore, the Company allowed the terms of the change in control         agreements with our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer/Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President/Chief Credit Officer to extend through January 19, 2022, the terms of the Executive Vice President/Chief Lending Officer         to extend through December 20, 2021, and the terms of Executive Vice President Richards to extend through December 9, 2021.  In addition, effective January 1, 2018, the Board of Directors increased the annual         base salary for our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer/Chief Financial Officer by 8.4% to $260,000, and effective January 1, 2018 increased our Executive Vice President/Chief Credit Officer annual base salary by 3.0% to $229,685.
Additionally, effective January 1, 2018, the Chief Executive Officer/President increased the annual base salary for our Executive Vice President/Chief Lending Officer by         6.6% to $162,000, and set the 2018 annual base salary for Executive Vice President Richards at $210,000.
• Annual Incentives.  As a result of our strong financial performance and the successful achievement of individual performance         goals, our named executive officers earned awards under our Annual Incentive Plan for 2017 and the awards were distributed in the second calendar quarter of 2018.   The awards (if any) under the Annual         Incentive Plan for 2018 have not yet been determined; however, the Compensation/ Human Resource Committee expects the plan calculations to be made and awards determined (if any) by March 2019.  See "Performance-Based Compensation" for additional information on the Annual Incentive Plan for 2018.  See also "Grants of           Plan-Based Awards During 2018" for information on potential incentive awards under the Annual Incentive Plan for 2018. 
Compensation Philosophy
                Our compensation and benefits program for our named executive officers is designed to provide a competitive compensation package which includes         a performance-based component that is paid in cash and Company stock.  Specifically, the program is designed to accomplish the following objectives:
• Align the interests of executives with the interests of shareholders in the creation of long-term         shareholder value;
• Reinforce key business objectives and deliver executive benefits in a cost-effective manner; 
• Encourage management ownership of our common stock; and
• Attract and retain talented members of senior management.
                Management and our Compensation/Human Resource Committee work together to ensure that our named executive officers are held accountable and         rewarded for delivering superior performance and enhanced shareholder returns.   
Elements of Our Compensation and Benefits Program
                To achieve our objectives, we structured a compensation and benefit program that provides our named         executive officers with the following:
• Base salary;
• Performance-based cash compensation through our Annual Incentive Plan;
• Long-term equity awards through our Annual Incentive Plan;
• Retirement benefits; and
• Employment and change in control agreements.
                The elements of a named executive officer's total compensation package will vary depending upon the executive's job position and         responsibilities.
Base Salary
                Base salaries are used to reward our executives for performing             the core responsibilities of their positions and to provide them with a level of security with respect to a portion of their total compensation.  The Compensation/Human Resource Committee considers             compensation information sourced by SNL Financial, American Bankers Association Compensation and Benefits Survey Report, and Mercer Financial Services, as provided by our compensation consultants, when determining base salaries for our named             executive officers, along with other factors, such as an executive's qualifications, experience, position responsibilities and performance in relation to established goals.  See "Peer Group" for information on the financial institutions that make up our peers for 2018.  The Compensation/ Human Resource Committee reviews the base salaries for             our named executive officers on an annual basis.    
Performance-Based Compensation 
                Our Annual Incentive Plan is designed to recognize and reward participants for their collective and individual contributions to our         success.  The objectives of the plan are to: (i) reward results, not effort; (ii) align our strategic plan, budget and shareholder interests with participant performance; (iii) motivate and reward participants         for achieving and potentially exceeding performance goals; (iv) align incentive pay with performance; (v) enable us to attract and retain the talent needed to drive our success, and (vi) encourage teamwork across the Company and Bank.  The Compensation/Human Resource Committee in consultation with executive management administers the plan.  All of our named executive         officers participated in the Annual Incentive Plan during 2018.  The Annual Incentive Plan awards (if any) will be paid out in cash and grants of restricted stock in accordance with the terms of the plan.
                The incentive award opportunities noted below are shown as a percentage of base salary.  For         purposes of the Annual Incentive Plan, "base salary" is defined as compensation earned by a participant for services rendered, excluding the following items: profit sharing contributions, discretionary incentive compensation, cash payments received         for waiving employer-paid health insurance, cell phone allowances and fringe benefits.

                The performance period under the Annual Incentive Plan is the calendar year.  However, the         administrative procedures necessary to calculate the awards under the plan have not yet been completed for 2018.  The Company expects to receive the peer group data necessary to calculate the Plan incentive         awards (if any) by the end of March 2019.   If target or maximum performance measures are achieved, plan participants will receive a payout under the Annual Incentive Plan.  If          our named executive officers receive a payout under the Annual Incentive Plan, the payout will be distributed in cash and through grants of restricted shares of Company common stock.  The percentage of stock         and cash distributed will depend upon the executive's achievement of his or her performance goals and job position.   See "Grants of Plan-Based Awards During 2018"         for information on potential payouts under the Annual Incentive Plan.
Performance Measures under the Annual             Incentive Plan for 2018
                There are two (2) categories in which performance is         measured under the Annual Incentive Plan: Company/Bank performance and branch/departmental performance.  The Company/Bank performance goals focus on core measures of profitability, risk and compliance, credit         quality and efficiency of Company and Bank resources.
For 2018, our Company/Bank goals consisted of return on equity compared with a regional peer group (using a three year average for 2018), efficiency ratio (compared to a         regional peer group using a three year average for 2018), net interest income growth (compared to a regional peer group using a three year average for 2018), classified assets to capital (compared to a regional peer group using a three year average         for 2018), and non-performing loans to total loans (compared to a regional peer group using a three year average for 2018).  An overall satisfactory regulatory rating, and individual employee performance         review rating of competent are required and are incentive plan qualifiers.  Should these measures not be met, no incentive award is granted.  Branch goals included         various measures, most notably loan and deposit growth, and branch profitability targets.  Departmental goals included various projects, strategic initiatives and work performance measurements.  The plan's components have varying weights assigned as well as varying award opportunities based upon job function.  
The following chart sets forth the 2018 goal weighting for our named executive officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Position   Company/Bank   Branch/Departmental  
 Chief Executive Officer/President   85%   15%  
 Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer/Chief Financial Officer     80%  20%
 Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer/Chief Financial Officer     80%  20%
 Executive Vice President/Chief Credit Officer   65%   35%  
 Executive Vice President/Chief Lending Officer   60%   40%  
 Executive Vice President Richards   60%   40%  
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Equity Incentives/Stock Grant Practices 
                Equity incentives are one of the most important elements of the total compensation package for our named executive officers.  The purpose of these awards is to attract and retain superior talent, further align employees and non-employee directors with shareholder interests, closely link employee and non-employee compensation with our         performance, and maintain high levels of executive and non-employee director stock ownership.  It is our intent to use the grant of restricted stock as the primary vehicle for providing long-term incentive         compensation opportunities to our named executive officers and for aligning their interests with those of our shareholders.  In general, vesting of restricted stock awards under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan         is tied to continued service.  The grants of restricted stock are largely tied to satisfaction of performance goals set forth under our Annual Incentive Plan.  See "Performance-Based Compensation" for information on specific performance goals for our named executive officers.  Generally, restricted stock awarded to our named         executive officers is subject to a three (3) year vesting schedule. Shares of restricted stock vest ratably over a three-year period commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant and continuing each anniversary date thereafter.  The 2016 Equity Incentive Plan Award Agreements for our named executive officers provide that vesting will accelerate in the event of death, disability, retirement, change in control or involuntary termination         without cause.
                The Compensation/Human Resource Committee's process with respect to the determination of grant dates is made after carefully considering our         timing of earnings releases and/or other material nonpublic information to ensure that there is no manipulation of the market to an executive's benefit.  Similarly, we never time the release of material nonpublic information to affect the value of         executive compensation.  In general, the release of such information reflects established timetables for the disclosure of material nonpublic information such as earnings reports or, with respect to other         events reportable under federal securities laws, the applicable requirements of such laws with respect to timing of disclosure.
Retirement Benefits
                We provide retirement benefits         to our named executive officers through our tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, our tax-qualified defined contribution plan, and non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans ("SERPs").  Effective          January 1, 2008, we converted our traditional defined benefit pension plan to an account balance-based pension plan, which is also referred to as a cash balance plan.  Under our cash balance plan, participants         are credited with a percentage of their compensation each year and, upon termination of employment, may receive their benefit in a lump sum or in monthly installments.  Our tax-qualified defined contribution         plan ("401(k) plan") provides our eligible employees with a vehicle to defer a portion of their compensation and invest their elective deferrals in a variety of investment funds.  In addition, the 401(k) plan         provides for an employer safe harbor matching contribution to eligible participants equal to 100% of a participant's elective deferrals that are not in excess of 1% of the participant's compensation, plus 50% of the participant's elective deferrals         that exceed 1% of compensation.  In no event will the employer safe harbor matching contributions exceed 3.5% of a participant's compensation in a plan year.  We view our         retirement benefits as a means of providing financial security to our employees after they have spent a substantial portion of their careers with us.  
  In addition to our cash balance plan and 401(k) plan, we also provide our Chief             Executive Officer/President, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer/Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President/Chief Credit Officer with SERP benefits.  The SERPs serve to help us             attract and retain executive talent by providing each executive with a supplemental retirement benefit equal to a specific percentage (Chief Executive Officer/President 16.4%, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer/Chief Financial             Officer 13.6%, and Executive Vice President/Chief Credit Officer 14.7%) multiplied by the average annual cash compensation earned by each executive during the three (3) completed calendar years preceding the executive's termination of             employment.  The SERP benefits are intended to provide supplemental retirement benefits to the executives.  Under the defined benefit pension plan, tax qualifications             are limited by certain IRS provisions.  We believe providing SERP benefits to our top management is consistent with the retirement benefits provided to similarly-situated executives in our peer group.  See "Executive Compensation—Retirement Benefits".
                We have also implemented a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to provide supplemental funds for retirement for eligible employees through         discretionary annual contributions made by the Bank.  The Bank implemented the plan in December 2018.
Employment and Change in Control Agreements
                We currently maintain an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer/President that we believe is         consistent with the agreements provided to senior executive officers in our peer group.  The Compensation/Human Resource Committee believes that the employment agreement with our Chief Executive         Officer/President serves the interests of our Company and its shareholders by providing stability in management, outlining the terms and conditions of employment and ensuring that if a change in control is ever under consideration, our Chief         Executive Officer/President will be able to advise our board of directors about the potential transaction in the best interests of shareholders, without being unduly influenced by personal considerations of losing his job.  See "Executive Compensation—Employment Agreement".
                In addition to the employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer/President, we also maintain change in         control agreements with our Chief Credit Officer, our Chief Lending Officer, our Chief Operating Officer/Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Retail Banking Officer, and Executive Vice President Richards.  These         change in control agreements provide the executives with certain protections and benefits in the event of a change in control and help maintain stability in management during a change in control transaction.  See          "Executive Compensation—Change in Control Agreements".
Role of Compensation/Human Resource Committee
                The Compensation/Human Resource Committee reviews and approves all of the elements of compensation for our Chief         Executive Officer/President, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer/Chief Financial Officer, and Executive Vice President/Chief Credit Officer annually to ensure we are competitive in the market place and that the mix of benefits         accurately reflects our compensation philosophy.  The Compensation/Human Resource Committee operates under a written charter that establishes its responsibilities.  The         Compensation/Human Resource Committee reviews the charter annually to ensure that the scope of the charter is consistent with the Compensation/Human Resource Committee's role.  Under the charter, the         Compensation/Human Resource Committee is also charged with general responsibility for the oversight and administration of the Bank and Company sponsored compensation and benefit plans.  The charter also         authorizes the Compensation/Human Resource Committee to engage consultants and other professionals without management approval to the extent deemed necessary to discharge its responsibilities.  During 2018,         the Bank retained the services of Compensation Advisors to assist the Compensation/Human Resource Committee in performing its various duties within industry practice.  Compensation Advisors advised the         committee on compensation programs for senior management and executives of the Bank.
                When making compensation decisions, the Compensation/Human Resource Committee considers salary survey data to understand compensation paid to         similarly situated executives in our peer group.  See "Peer Group" for a list of the publicly traded financial institutions that make up our peers.  In addition to peer data, our Compensation/Human Resource Committee also looks at internal pay equity, individual and company performance and relative shareholder return when making compensation decisions.  
Role of Management
                Management provides data, analyses, input and recommendations to the Compensation/Human Resource Committee through our Chief Executive         Officer/President.  The Compensation/Human Resource Committee gives significant weight to our Chief Executive Officer/President's evaluation of each named executive officer's performance and recommendation of         appropriate compensation.  However, our Chief Executive Officer/President does not participate in any decisions relating to his own compensation.  The Vice President,         Human Resource/Training Manager provides our Chief Executive Officer/President with salary survey data for purposes of considering base pay adjustments for our Executive Vice President/Chief Lending Officer and Executive Vice President Richards.  The Chief Executive Officer/President provides the Board of Directors with salary survey data for purposes of considering base pay adjustments for our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer/Chief         Financial Officer, and Executive Vice President/Chief Credit Officer.
Role of Compensation Consultant
                During 2018, the Bank retained the services of Compensation Advisors to assist the Compensation/Human Resource         Committee in performing its various duties within industry practice.  Compensation Advisors advised the committee on compensation programs for senior management and executives of the Bank.  Additionally, the Committee utilized data provided by SNL Financial, American Bankers Association Compensation and Benefits Survey Report, Mercer Financial Services, and L.R. Webber Associates, Inc. to evaluate         the salary ranges and incentive awards for our named executive officers.  
Peer Group
                The Compensation/Human Resources Committee considers information about the practices and financial performance of         its peers when making compensation decisions.  The Compensation/Human Resources Committee reviews our peer group and determines if adjustments are necessary to reflect the business model and demographics of         the Company.  Our incentive peer group is disclosed by the Compensation/Human Resource Committee, but we might use information from other institutions when looking at compensation.  In 2018, our incentive peer group consisted of the following community banks and thrifts in Pennsylvania and New York with total assets between $1 billion and $2.8 billion:

Executive Perquisites
                We annually review the perquisites that we make available to our named executive officers.  The primary perquisites for our named executive         officers are certain club dues.  
Stock Ownership           Guidelines
                We do not maintain stock ownership guidelines for our named executive officers.  However, all of our         named executive officers participate in our Annual Incentive Plan and we believe they generally maintain a meaningful interest in our Company stock through their participation in the plan and through individual purchases outside the plan.  See "Stock Ownership" for information on Company stock owned by our named executive officers.
Tax and Accounting Considerations
                In consultation with our advisors, we evaluate the tax and accounting treatment of each of our compensation programs at the time of adoption         and on an annual basis to ensure an understanding of the financial impact of the program on the Company and the Bank.

CEO Pay Ratio
The Compensation/Human Resources Committee monitors the relationship between the compensation of our executive officers and of our non-managerial         employees.  This is the second year we are disclosing the ratio of the pay of our Chief Executive Officer/President to our median employee (pay ratio).  To determine the         median employee, we considered all employees, including full-time, part-time and seasonal employees employed as of the last day of our fiscal year, December 31, 2018. We also considered all wages earned for the fiscal year, including:
· • Regular pay for salaried and hourly employees.
· • Wages for overtime.

                The Company and the Bank are parties to an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer/         President.  The employment agreement provides for a three-year term, which automatically renews on June 1st of each year to         maintain a three-year term, unless either party notifies in writing the other party at least 90 days prior to June 1st of such party's intent not to renew the         agreement beyond the existing term, or the agreement is terminated by the Company, the Bank or our Chief Executive Officer/President in accordance with its terms.  The current term of the employment agreement         expires on June 1, 2021.  The employment agreement provides for an annual salary review, however in no event may the base salary be reduced below the base salary in effect at the time of such review.  Our Chief Executive Officer/President's current base salary under his employment agreement is $450,500.  In addition to base salary, the employment agreement provides for,         among other things, participation in various employee benefit plans as well as furnishing certain fringe benefits available to similarly-situated executive personnel.  
                The employment agreement contains a restrictive covenant which prohibits our Chief Executive Officer/         President from engaging in employment that would compete with the services provided by the Company and the Bank.  In addition, the restrictive covenant contains a non-solicitation clause.  The duration of the restrictive covenant varies based on the circumstances of the executive's termination of employment.  In the event our Chief Executive Officer/President         is terminated by the Company or the Bank for Cause (as defined in the agreement) the term of the restrictive covenant is one (1) year from the executive's termination date.  In the event the executive         voluntarily resigns with or without Good Reason (as defined in the agreement) or the Company or Bank terminates his employment without Cause, the term of the restrictive covenant will be two (2) years from his termination date.  In the event of termination following a Change in Control (as defined in the agreement) which results in the payment of severance under the employment agreement, the executive will be subject to the restrictive         covenant for a period of three (3) years following his termination of employment.  The employment agreement provides for an exception to the restrictive covenant in the event the executive's employment is         terminated by the Company or the Bank for Cause or he terminates his employment for Good Reason.  Under these circumstances, the executive may engage in the practice of public accounting and will not be deemed         in violation of the restrictive covenant in his employment agreement.  See "Executive Compensation - Potential Post-Termination Benefits" for information on         termination benefits provided under the employment agreement.
Change in Control Agreements
                The Bank (and the Company as guarantor) are parties to change in control agreements with our Executive Vice         President and Chief Operating Officer/Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President/Chief Credit Officer. Each agreement provides for a three-year term, which automatically renews on January 19th of each year to maintain a three-year term, unless either party notifies in writing the other party at least 90 days prior to January 19th of such party's intent not to renew the agreement beyond the existing term, or the agreement is terminated by the Bank or Executive for reasons set forth in the agreement.  The current         term of the change in control agreements expires on January 19, 2022.  
The Bank (and the Company as guarantor) are parties to a change in control agreement with our Executive Vice President/Chief Lending Officer, and         Senior Vice President/Chief Retail Banking Officer.   This agreement provides for a three-year term, which automatically renews on December 20th of each year to maintain a three-year term, unless either party notifies in writing the other party at least 90 days prior to December 20th of         such party's intent not to renew the agreement beyond the existing term, or the agreement is terminated by the Bank or Executive for reasons set forth in the agreement.  The current term of the change in         control agreement expires on December 20, 2021. 
Additionally, the Bank (and the Company as guarantor) are parties to a change in control agreement with Executive Vice President Richards.  This agreement provides for a three-year term, which automatically renews on December 9th of each year to maintain a three-year         term, unless either party notifies in writing the other party at least 90 days prior to December 9th of such party's intent not to renew the agreement beyond the         existing term, or the agreement is terminated by the Bank or Executive for reasons set forth in the agreement.  The current term of the change in control agreement expires on December 9, 2021.

We maintain the Annual Incentive Plan for the purpose of aligning the employee incentive goals         with our overall strategic plan.  The Annual Incentive Plan requires participants to satisfy two components:  corporate goals; and departmental/branch performance goals.  For 2018, our Company/Bank goals consisted of return on equity compared with a regional peer group (using a three year average for 2018), efficiency ratio (compared to a regional peer group using a three year         average for 2018), net interest income growth (compared to a regional peer group using a three year average for 2018), classified assets to capital (compared to a regional peer group using a three year average for 2018), and non-performing loans to         total loans (compared to a regional peer group using a three year average for 2018).  An overall satisfactory regulatory rating, and individual employee performance review rating of competent are required and         are incentive plan qualifiers.  Should these measures not be met, no incentive award is granted.  Branch goals included various measures, most notably loan and deposit         growth, and branch profitability targets.  Departmental goals included various projects, strategic initiatives and work performance measurements. 
The plan's components have varying weights assigned, as well as varying award opportunities based upon job function.  The performance         period for the Annual Incentive Plan for 2018 began on January 1, 2018 and ended on December 31, 2018.  However, the Company is unable as of the date of this proxy statement to certify as to the satisfaction         of the performance goals for 2018.  For 2018, the weighting for Mr. Black's incentive award was 85% corporate goals and 15% branch/departmental goals, with a maximum payout of 65% of eligible compensation.  For 2018, the weighting for Mr. Jones' incentive award was 80% corporate goals and 20% branch/departmental goals, with a maximum payout of 55% of eligible compensation.  For          2018, the weighting for Mr. Osborne's incentive award was 65% corporate goals and 35% branch/departmental goals, with a maximum payout of 35% of eligible compensation.  For 2018, the weighting for Mr. Wilson's         incentive award was 60% corporate goals and 40% branch/departmental goals, with a maximum payout of 25% of eligible compensation.  For 2018, the weighting for Mr. Richards' incentive award was 60% corporate         goals and 40% branch/departmental goals, with a maximum payout of 25% of eligible compensation.  
For named executive officers, incentive payments are made in cash and in the form of restricted stock.  The grants of restricted stock         vest ratably over a three-year period commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant and continuing each anniversary date.  For all named executives, the eligible compensation will be distributed 70%         in cash and 30% in restricted stock.   Once issued, the awards of restricted stock granted in connection with the Annual Incentive Plan are subject to the terms and         conditions of the underlying equity incentive plan.
2016 Equity Incentive Plan.    The 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2016 Plan") permits the Company, under the supervision of the Compensation/ Human Resource Committee, and subject to         the approval of the Board of Directors, to make equity-based awards to employees and non-employee directors.  The 2016 Plan provides for awards of both restricted stock and awards of stock without restrictions         or other conditions.  The purpose of these stock awards is to attract and retain competitively superior people, further align employees and non-employee directors with shareholder interest, closely link         employee and non-employee compensation with the Company's performance, and maintain high levels of executive and non-employee stock ownership.  The 2016 Plan also provides a component of the total compensation         package offered to employees and reflects the importance placed on motivating and rewarding superior results with long-term incentives.

Retirement Benefits
Account Balance Pension Plan.   Effective January 1, 2008, the Bank converted its traditional noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan into a tax-qualified account balance pension plan, which is referred to as a cash balance           plan.  Participants in the former pension plan who were eligible employees (as defined in the plan) automatically became participants in the cash balance plan.  Under           the cash balance plan, a participant's account is the sum of the participant's opening balance (which is his or her benefit under the former defined benefit plan) and annual allocations and interest credits.  The            Bank credits each participant with an annual allocation if the participant has at least 1,000 hours of service with the Bank during the plan year.  Each annual allocation is determined based on a percentage           of the participant's "compensation" (as defined in the plan) and varies based on a participant's age.  Annual cash balance plan allocations range between 3% and 8% of participant             compensation.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreement.  The Bank maintains non-tax-qualified supplemental executive retirement agreements ("SERPs") with its President/Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer/ Chief Financial Officer, and its Chief Credit         Officer (collectively the "executives"). The SERPs provide each executive with an annual retirement benefit for a period of 15 years following separation from service (other than for cause) on or after attaining age 62. This retirement benefit         equals a benefit percentage (16.4%, 14.7% and 13.6% for our President/Chief Executive Officer, Chief Credit Officer, and Chief Operating Officer/Chief Financial Officer, respectively) multiplied by the average annual cash compensation during the         three completed calendar years preceding the termination of employment.  Subject to the terms of the SERP, the executive may elect to receive the retirement benefit in an actuarially equivalent lump sum         payment.  All of our named executive officers are 100% vested in their accrued SERP benefit. 
The Bank maintains a non-tax qualified executive deferred compensation plan ("Deferred Compensation Plan") for eligible         employees designated by the board of directors.  Each of the named executive officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan.  Under the Deferred         Compensation Plan, each year the Bank may credit an annual contribution to a participant's deferred compensation account as of January 1.  The Bank may also credit other discretionary contributions to a         participant's deferred compensation account from time to time.  Amounts credited to a participant's account under the plan accrue earnings monthly equal to the highest deposit rate of the Bank.  Participants vest in contributions made to the accounts on the earlier of (i) the fifth anniversary of the contribution or (ii) the date they both complete 15 years of service and attain age 55.  Participants also become 100% vested in their accounts upon their death or disability and upon a change in control of the Bank or the Company.  Distributions are made from         the Deferred Compensation Plan in either a lump sum or installments following a participant's separation from service, death or upon a change in control.  Participants forfeit all benefits under the plan if         the Bank terminates their employment for cause.

SERP          participants and Deferred Compensation Plan participants will not receive any benefit upon termination for cause.

In the event that the Company or the Bank chooses         to terminate Mr. Black's employment for reasons other than for cause or, in the event of Mr. Black's resignation from the Company or the Bank for good reason, the Company shall pay Mr. Black a lump sum amount equal to two (2) times Mr. Black's base         salary, minus applicable taxes and withholdings. In addition, for a period of one (1) year from the date of termination, Mr. Black shall receive continued health, life and disability insurance coverage under the same terms in effect during the one         year prior to his termination.   Except as provided below, Mr. Jones, Mr. Osborne, Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Richards receive no benefit under their change in control agreements in the event the Company terminates         them without cause or the executives terminate employment for good reason prior to a change in control. All outstanding restricted stock awards will vest if the executive is terminated by the Company or the Bank without cause.  Participants in the Annual Incentive Plan must be employed by the Bank on the date the benefits are paid.  Therefore,          if a participant terminates employment without cause or for good reason prior to payment under the Annual Incentive Plan, all rights to plan benefits are forfeited, unless otherwise determined by the Committee administering the plan.  SERP participants will receive their vested accrued early termination benefit upon termination by the Company without cause or by the executive for good reason if they separate from service before age 62 and         their normal retirement benefit if they separate from service on or after attaining age 62.  Deferred Compensation Plan participants receive their vested account balance upon their separation from service.  
         Payments Made Upon Disability.  Under the terms         of Mr. Black's employment agreement, if his employment is terminated due to a disability, Mr. Black will be entitled to the same benefit as provided by the Company's long-term disability plan. Mr. Jones, Mr. Osborne, Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Richards         receive no benefit under their change in control agreements in the event the executives are terminated due to a disability; however, the executives will receive a benefit under the Company's long-term disability plan if they meet the requirements         of the plan upon termination.  All unvested restricted stock awards vest upon termination of employment due to disability.  If a participant in the Annual Incentive Plan terminates his or her service with the Bank due to a disability prior to distribution of the award, the executive's award will be prorated based on the period of         active employment with the Bank.  SERP participants become fully vested and will receive their accrued early termination benefit upon termination due to disability if they separate from service before age 62         and their normal retirement benefit if they separate from service on or after attaining age 62.  Deferred Compensation Plan participants become 100% vested upon disability and receive their vested account         balance upon their separation from service.  
    Payments Made Upon Death.  Under the employment agreement, Mr. Black's estate is entitled to receive any         compensation accrued, but unpaid, as of the date of the executive's death.  Mr. Jones, Mr.         Osborne, Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Richards receive no death benefit under their change in control agreements. All unvested restricted stock awards vest upon death of an award recipient.  In addition, if a participant in the Annual Incentive Plan dies prior to distribution of an award, the executive's award will be prorated based on the period of active employment with the Bank.  If a SERP participant dies prior to a separation from service, the SERP participant's beneficiary will receive the normal retirement benefit the participant would have received if he were deemed to have attained         his normal retirement age (age 62) immediately prior to his death.  If he dies after a separation from service, his beneficiary will receive the remaining benefits that would have been made to the participant.  Deferred Compensation Plan participants become 100% vested upon death with benefits paid to their beneficiary in a lump sum within 60 days.  disability.  
            Payments Made Upon a Change in Control.  In the event of a termination         of employment in connection with a change in control, Mr. Black's employment agreement provides him with a lump sum amount equal to 2.99 times his base salary.  In addition, for a period of 18 months from the         date of termination or until Mr. Black secures substantially similar benefits through other employment, whichever shall occur first, Mr. Black is entitled to continued health, life and disability insurance coverage under the same terms in effect         during the one year prior to his termination.   
            Under the change in control agreement, if, within one year following a change in control, Mr. Jones, Mr. Osborne, Mr. Wilson or Mr. Richards is involuntarily terminated, the executive's         title, responsibilities, or salary are reduced, or for reductions or changes in the executive's duties, location of employment or benefits as set forth in the agreement, the executive shall be entitled to receive a lump sum amount equal to one time         the executive's base salary.  In addition, for a period of 18 months from the date of termination or until the executive secures substantially similar benefits through other employment, whichever shall occur first, the executive shall receive a         continuation of health care, life and disability insurance in effect prior to his termination.
            Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code provides that severance payments that equal or exceed three times         an individual's base amount are deemed to be "excess parachute payments" if they are contingent upon a change in control (the "Section 280G Limitation").  An individual's base amount is equal to an average of the individual's Box 1, Form W-2 compensation for the five years preceding the year a change in control occurs (or such lesser number of years if the         individual has not been employed for five years).  Individuals receiving excess parachute payments are subject to a 20% excise tax on the amount of the payment in excess of the base amount, and the employer         may not deduct such amount for federal tax purposes.  The employment and change in control agreements limit payments made to the executives in connection with a change in control to amounts that will not         exceed the limits imposed by Section 280G.  
In addition, all outstanding restricted stock awards will vest upon a change in control.  SERP participants         who have not separated from service and have not attained their normal retirement age (age 62) prior to a change in control will receive their normal retirement benefit (determined without regard to their age or years of service at the time of the         change in control) paid in an actuarial equivalent lump sum within ten days of the change of control.  Participants that have attained their normal retirement age will receive their normal retirement benefit         after their separation from service.  Deferred Compensation Plan participants become 100% vested and will receive their account balance in a lump sum within 30 days following a change in control.
Payments Upon Retirement.  In addition to the tax-qualified retirement benefits and non-qualified retirement benefits set forth in "Pension Benefits" above, participants in the Annual Incentive Plan who         retire from the Bank will receive a prorated payout based on the period of the participant's active employment only.  Deferred Compensation Plan participants receive their vested account balance following a         separation from service.
Potential Post-Termination Benefits Table.    The amount of compensation payable to each named executive officer upon the occurrence of certain events is noted in the table below.  The amounts shown assume that such         termination was effective as of December 31, 2018, and thus include amounts earned through such time and are estimates of the amounts that would be paid to the executives upon their termination.  The amounts         shown relating to unvested stock awards are based on $55.55 per share, which was the fair market value of Company common stock on December 31, 2018.  The actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the         time of such executive's separation from the Company.  The tables do not include the executives' account balances in the Bank's tax-qualified retirement plan to which each executive has a non-forfeitable interest.

(2)        Represents the value of the executive's early retirement benefit which fully vests         upon his termination due to disability.
(3)        Messrs.          Black and Jones had not attained age 62, therefore their benefit represents their vested early retirement benefit based on the extent to which their normal retirement benefit should be accrued by the Bank under generally accepted accounting         principles as of the date of his termination of employment.  Mr. Osborne has reached age 62, therefore, his benefit represents         his normal retirement benefit.  Mr. Wilson is fully vested under the Deferred Compensation Plan because of his age and years of service with the Bank.
(4)        Amount         includes base compensation and the value of continued health, life and disability coverage for the period of time specified in the agreement.
(5)        The amount shown does not reflect adjustments that could be made to the executive's total change in control severance payment to         ensure the executive's severance payment would not be deemed an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.
OTHER INFORMATION           RELATING TO DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
                Section 16(a)         of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of the Company's common stock, to file reports of ownership and changes of ownership with the Securities and         Exchange Commission.  Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.
                Based solely on the Company's review of         the copies of the reports it has received and written representations provided to it from the individuals required to file the reports, the Company believes that each of its executive officers and         directors has complied with applicable reporting requirements for transactions in the Company's common stock during the year ended December 31, 2018.  
Policies and Procedures for Approval of Related Persons Transactions 
                The Company maintains a Policy and Procedures Governing Related Persons Transactions, which is a written policy and set of procedures for the         review and approval or ratification of transactions involving related persons. Under the policy, related persons consist of directors, director nominees, executive officers, persons or entities known to us to         be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of any outstanding class of voting securities of the Company, or immediate family members or certain affiliated entities of any of the foregoing persons.  
Transactions covered by the policy consist of any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, in         which: 
• the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year; 
• the Company is, will or may be expected to be a participant; and 
• any related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 
The policy excludes certain transactions, including: 
• any compensation paid to an executive         officer of the Company if the Compensation/Human Resource Committee of the Board of Directors approved (or recommended that the Board approve) such compensation; 
• any compensation paid to a director         of the Company if the Board or an authorized committee of the Board approved such compensation; and 
• any transaction with a related person         involving consumer and investor financial products and services provided in the ordinary course of the Company's business and on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable services provided to unrelated third         parties or to the Company's employees on a broad basis (and, in the case of loans, in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002). 
     Related person transactions will be approved or ratified by the Audit and Examination         Committee. In determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Audit and Examination Committee will consider all relevant factors, including: 
• whether the terms of the proposed transaction are at         least as favorable to the Company as those that might be achieved with an unaffiliated third party; 
• the size of the transaction and the amount of         consideration payable to the related person; 
• the nature of the interest of the related person; 
• whether the transaction may involve a conflict of         interest; and 
• whether the transaction involves the provision of         goods and services to the Company that are available from unaffiliated third parties. 
                A member of the Audit and Examination Committee who has an interest in the transaction will abstain from voting on the         approval of the transaction, but, if so requested by the Chair of the Committee, may participate in some or all of the discussion relating to the transaction. 
Transactions with Related Persons
                Loans               and Extensions of Credit.  The Bank makes loans to persons affiliated with the Company and the Bank in the normal course of its business.  During 2018, all Bank loans to related persons (as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission rules) were made in the ordinary course of business, made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as         those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with other persons not related to the Bank and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.   
                The Company's policies require that any loan to a director that would cause         his/her aggregate loan relationship to exceed $300,000 be approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors.  Any loan to an executive officer in the aggregate greater         than $100,000 must be approved in advance by a majority vote of the Board of Directors. 
SUBMISSION OF BUSINESS PROPOSALS AND SHAREHOLDER NOMINATIONS
                The Company must receive proposals that shareholders seek to include in the Proxy Statement for the Company's next Annual Meeting no later than         November 7, 2019.  If next year's Annual Meeting is held on date more than 30 calendar days from April 16, 2020, a shareholder proposal must be received by a reasonable time before the Company begins to print         and mail its proxy solicitation for such Annual Meeting.  Any shareholder proposals will be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
                The Company's Bylaws provide that for a shareholder to make         nominations for the election of directors or proposals for business to be brought before a meeting of shareholders, a shareholder must deliver written notice of such nominations and/or proposals to the Corporate Secretary not less than 90 days and         not more than 120 days before the date of the meeting; provided that if less than 100 days notice or prior public disclosure of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, such notice must be delivered not later than the close of the tenth day         following the day on which notice of the meeting was mailed to shareholders or such public disclosure was made.
SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS
                The Company encourages shareholder communications to the Board of Directors and/or individual directors.  Communications           regarding financial or accounting policies may be made to the Chairman of the Audit and Examination Committee, E. Gene Kosa, at First Citizens Community Bank, 15 South Main Street, Mansfield, Pennsylvania 16933.  Other           communications to the Board of Directors may be made to the Chairman of the Governance and Nomination Committee, Rinaldo A.

Communications to individual directors may be made to such director at the principal office at First Citizens Community Bank, 15 South Main Street, Mansfield, Pennsylvania 16933.
MISCELLANEOUS
                The Company will pay the cost of this proxy         solicitation.  The Company will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them in sending proxy materials to the beneficial owners of the         Company common stock.  In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, directors, officers and regular employees of the Company may solicit proxies personally, by email or by telephone without receiving additional         compensation. 
                A COPY OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WITHOUT EXHIBITS, FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, AS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND         EXCHANGE COMMISSION, WILL BE FURNISHED WITHOUT CHARGE TO PERSONS WHO WERE SHAREHOLDERS AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON FEBRUARY 25, 2019 UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO MICKEY L. JONES, TREASURER, CITIZENS FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC., 15 SOUTH MAIN STREET,         MANSFIELD, PENNSYLVANIA 16933-1590.
                If you and others who share your address own shares in street name, your broker or other holder of record may be sending only one Annual Report on         Form 10-K and Proxy Statement to your address.  This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs.  However, if a shareholder         residing at such an address wishes to receive a separate Annual Report on Form 10-K or Proxy Statement in the future, he or she should contact the broker or other holder of record.  If you own your shares in         street name and are receiving multiple copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Proxy Statement, you can request householding by contacting your broker or other holder of record.
