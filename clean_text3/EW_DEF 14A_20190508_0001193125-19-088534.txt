          Dear Fellow Stockholders:   On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank you for your investment in Edwards. The Board takes seriously its oversight responsibilities,  including its oversight of Edwards' corporate strategy designed to generate stockholder value. Edwards' strong long-term financial performance is a testament to the strength of this strategy.   The Board strives to maintain a highly independent, balanced, and  diverse set of directors that collectively possess the expertise to ensure effective oversight of our business. I have been a regular participant alongside management in our active engagement program, through which we engage in a regular dialogue  with a broad cross-section of stockholders. The Board greatly values the views of stockholders, and the feedback we receive is regularly discussed with the full Board, and has become an integral part of our decision-making process on a number of  important matters. For example, we have made enhancements to our corporate governance practices over the past few years, and stockholder feedback has been a critical part of this evolution.   Since our 2018 Annual Meeting, our engagement team has reached out to  stockholders representing approximately 59% of Edwards' shares outstanding to continue our dialogue on key items of stockholder interest, including corporate governance, compensation, and sustainability. Sustainability has in recent years been  a key topic of discussion in our stockholder conversations, and it is an area of increasing focus for the Board as well. We regularly have discussions on our progress against Edwards' sustainability principles at our meetings, and my fellow  directors and I are happy to report that we have received numerous recognitions for our sustainability and environmental practices in 2018.   As in prior years, we have continued to discuss best practices on corporate governance issues with our stockholders. This year, in response to feedback  received through our engagement efforts, we expanded the responsibilities assigned to our Lead Independent Director role. While the updated Lead Independent Director role aligns with the duties I have historically performed, the Board believed it  was important to make clear within our formal governing documents what we (and our stockholders) consider to be core leadership responsibilities.   Thank you for your trust and continued support.   Sincerely,        Wesley W. von Schack Lead Independent Director

ACTIVE STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM (Page 11)  
Edwards' Board and management are committed to engaging with Edwards' stockholders and incorporating feedback into their decision-making processes. Throughout the year, our CEO, CFO, and Vice President of Investor Relations meet by phone and face-to-face with current and prospective stockholders to discuss Edwards' strategy, business, and financial results. Our Corporate Secretary and Investor Relations teams, together with other members of management and, from time to time, our Lead Independent Director, engage stockholders to solicit their views and feedback on corporate governance, compensation and other related matters and to discuss the issues that matter most to our stockholders. Stockholder feedback is shared with the Board and its committees, which enhances our corporate governance practices, facilitates future dialogue between stockholders and the Board and provides additional transparency to our stockholders. Since the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders , our Corporate Secretary and Investor Relations teams contacted our top 
     Edwards Lifesciences Corporation    |    2019 Proxy Statement     iii stockholders representing approximately 56% of our outstanding shares and engaged with stockholders representing approximately 32% of shares outstanding. In this engagement, we received feedback from stockholders on a range of topics including corporate governance, compensation, and sustainability. 
Over time, we have amended our Charter and Bylaws to adopt various stockholder rights and to align our corporate governance practices with our stockholders' interests.

Our Board recognizes the importance of our sustainability initiatives and the need to provide effective oversight. Our Compensation and Governance Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") maintains formal oversight responsibilities with regular discussions at meetings of the full Board. Through a well-established framework and cross-functional Sustainability Council with leaders from across the organization, we continue to build on our disclosure reflecting the recognition of sustainability within our businesses' core strategy—and our belief that sustainability is essential to long-term growth. 
We received numerous recognitions for our sustainability and environmental responsibilities practices in 2018, some of which are highlighted below:

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (Page 23) 
Executive Summary.    Edwards is the global leader in patient-focused medical innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring. Driven by a passion to help patients, we partner with the world's leading clinicians and researchers and invest in research and development to transform care for those impacted by structural heart disease or require hemodynamic monitoring during surgery or in intensive care. Edwards Lifesciences has a proud six-decade history as a leader in these areas. Since our founder, Lowell Edwards, first dreamed of using engineering to address diseases of the human heart, we have steadily built a company on the premise of imagining, building, and realizing a better future for our patients. 
Pay-for-Performance Philosophy.    The Compensation Committee strives to create a pay-for-performance culture and strongly believes that executive compensation should be tied not only to performance, but also directly to the successful implementation of our corporate strategy. As a direct result of our strategy, we have introduced new therapies such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, rapid-deployment surgical heart valves and noninvasive advanced hemodynamic monitoring, all while achieving our stated financial and operating objectives. Managing our business well in a challenging, highly regulated, dynamic environment requires talented and energetic leaders who champion our strategy and deliver on our commitments.

2018 Financial and Operating Performance.    Overall, we achieved positive financial results and operating performance in 2018, meeting or exceeding our expectations for sales growth, net income growth, and free cash flow generation. We also made important progress on future advancements for patients. 
     Edwards Lifesciences Corporation    |    2019 Proxy Statement     v 
Strong underlying1 sales growth of 10% was driven by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Clinician and patient preferences for our innovative transcatheter aortic valve therapies, including the best-in-class Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve;  
• Continued adoption of our newer premium aortic surgical valves, INSPIRIS RESILIA and Edwards INTUITY Elite; and   
• Broad use of our critical care technologies, including the ongoing rollout of our HemoSphere smart monitoring platform.   
[END TABLE]
Profitability was also strong in 2018, even as we continued to invest aggressively in our innovation initiatives and infrastructure. Utilizing significant savings in the reduction of our effective tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we hired new employees, accelerated research and development initiatives, and contributed more to employee retirement accounts. We directed a significant portion of our infrastructure investment toward the creation of a new product category dedicated to developing transcatheter solutions for the many patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid valve diseases. 
Stock Performance.    As a general indicator of our pay-for-performance culture, the Compensation Committee considers how Edwards' cumulative total return to stockholders ("TSR") compares to both the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Health Care Equipment Index. The table below illustrates our 5-year cumulative TSR on common stock with the cumulative total returns of the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Health Care Equipment Index.

2018 Annual Incentive Plan Outcomes and Long-Term Incentives.    The three measures used to evaluate financial achievement under our annual cash incentive plan were revenue growth, net income and free cash flow, all computed on a non-GAAP basis. Our financial performance resulted in financial achievement at 112% of target under the cash incentive plan. In addition, our overall achievement of KODs for 2018 was 106%. Accordingly, our cash incentive plan for corporate employees funded at 119% of target. Final incentive amounts for the Named Executive Officers ("NEOs") for 2018 also took into account each employee's individual performance. The PBRSUs that vested in 2018 were based on Edwards' TSR compared to that of companies in a subset of the S&P Health Care Equipment Select Industry Index (the "SPSIHE Subset") as discussed in more detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement. The payout of these PBRSUs tracked the strong performance of our stock over the three-year period and paid out at 175% of target.

Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Stockholders Meeting to be Held on May 8, 2019

Revocation of Your Proxy 
If you are a holder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by delivering written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of the Company by submitting a subsequently dated proxy by mail, telephone or the Internet in the manner described above under "How to Vote," or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not itself revoke an earlier submitted proxy. If you hold your shares in street name, you must follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or nominee to revoke your voting instructions, or, if you have obtained a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting, by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
Any change to your proxy or voting instructions that is provided by telephone or the Internet must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. ET on May 7, 2019, except that if you are voting shares held in one of our 401(k) plans, the deadline is 11:59 p.m. ET on May 5, 2019. 
Broker Voting 
Brokers holding shares of record for their customers are entitled to vote on certain routine matters, such as the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 3), without instructions from their customers. However, these brokers are generally not entitled to vote on certain non-routine matters, including the election of directors, matters relating to equity compensation plans or executive compensation, and certain corporate governance proposals, unless their customers submit voting instructions. If you hold your shares in street name through a broker and the broker does not receive your voting instructions, the broker will not be permitted to vote your shares in its discretion on any of the proposals at the Annual Meeting other than the proposal to ratify the appointment of PwC (Proposal 3). If you do not submit voting instructions and your broker votes your shares on Proposal 3 in its discretion, your shares will constitute "broker non-votes" on each of the other proposals. 
Quorum 
The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum to transact business at the Annual Meeting. Shares represented at the Annual Meeting are counted toward a quorum even if the holder of such shares abstains from voting. Shares held through brokers are not counted toward a quorum unless the broker has authority to vote, and votes such shares, upon at least one matter at the Annual Meeting. 
Vote Required on Proposals

BOARD OF DIRECTORS MATTERS 
PROPOSAL 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR 
General.    Our Board currently consists of eight directors forming one single class of directors, and all directors will be standing for election for a one-year term at the Annual Meeting. 
The Board has nominated the eight individuals identified below for election to the Board, to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are elected and qualified, or until their earlier resignation or removal. 
Each of the nominees standing for election has consented to serve as a director if elected. However, if any nominee becomes unable or unwilling for good cause to serve before the election, the shares represented by proxy may be voted for a substitute nominee designated by the Board. No arrangement or understanding exists between any nominee and any other person or persons pursuant to which any nominee was or is to be selected as a director or nominee, and none of our directors has any family relationship with any other director or with any of our executive officers. More information regarding the Board, the committees of the Board, director independence, and related matters follows this Proposal 1. 
Identification and Evaluation of Director Candidates.    Our Board carefully considers the skills, experiences, and diversity of its members as part of its robust director evaluation and Board refreshment process. Even though our Compensation Committee makes recommendations to the Board regarding candidates for election as directors of the Company, all members of the Board are very engaged in the process of, and discussions regarding, refreshment. 
The Compensation Committee maintains formal criteria for selecting director nominees who will best serve the interests of the Company and its stockholders. These criteria are described in more detail below under "Board Criteria and Diversity Policy." In addition to these requirements, the Compensation Committee also evaluates whether the candidate's skills and experience are complementary to the existing Board members' skills and experience, recognizing that the Board's skills evolve in order to align with the Company's strategy as well as emerging risks and opportunities. Some or all of the members of the Compensation Committee interview candidates that meet the criteria, and the Compensation Committee selects nominees that it believes best suit the needs of the Board. 
As a result of the Board's thoughtful and deliberate process of refreshment, the Board has elected five new directors since 2014. This process has involved the participation of all directors to take advantage of their broad range of expertise and experience as part of the decision-making process. 
The Compensation Committee has retained and pays fees to an executive search firm to assist in identifying and evaluating director candidates for the Board. The Compensation Committee will consider qualified candidates for director nominees suggested by the Company's stockholders. Stockholders can suggest qualified candidates for director nominees by writing to the Corporate Secretary of the Company at One Edwards Way, Irvine, California 92614. Submissions received that meet the criteria described below are forwarded to the Compensation Committee for further review and consideration. The Compensation Committee does not intend to evaluate candidates proposed by stockholders any differently than other candidates. 
Board Criteria and Diversity Policy.    Our Board, led by the Compensation Committee, is responsible for assessing, identifying, evaluating, and, ultimately, recommending to the stockholders, individuals qualified to be directors of the Company. We believe that diverse backgrounds and experiences strengthen Board performance and promote long-term stockholder value creation. 
The Compensation Committee's charter sets forth the membership criteria against which potential director candidates are evaluated. These written membership criteria state that the Company "seeks a board with diversity of background among its members, including diversity of experience, gender, race, ethnic or national origin, and age." In performing this responsibility, the Compensation Committee considers women and minority candidates consistent with the membership criteria and the Company's non-discrimination policies.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the ability to hold independent opinions and express them in a constructive manner.  
[END TABLE]
Of equal importance, the Compensation Committee and the Board seek individuals who are compatible and able to work well with other directors and executives. The satisfaction of these criteria is implemented and assessed through ongoing consideration of directors and potential nominees by the Compensation Committee and the Board, with a discussion of Board succession planning held at regularly scheduled meetings of the Board and certain specially called meetings. These discussions have included reviews of current director skills against an established skills matrix and consideration of each director's retirement horizon, as well as the Board's self-evaluation and peer evaluation processes, as described below under "Board Evaluations." Based upon these activities and its review of the current composition of the Board, the Compensation Committee and the Board believe that the nominating criteria have been satisfied. As a result, the Board believes its members represent diverse backgrounds and experience that are aligned with our Company's strategy, including financial, industrial, entrepreneurial, and international experience. 
Board Evaluations.    The Board conducts an annual Board and Committee self-evaluation every July or August, soliciting each director's views on, among other things, Board and Committee performance and effectiveness, size, composition, agenda, processes and schedule. In addition, the directors conduct annual peer evaluations focusing on each individual director's personal interactions and skills. This is a robust process that culminates in one-on-one meetings during which peer feedback is provided to each director by the General Counsel. Our Board views the self- and peer-evaluation processes as an integral part of its commitment to cultivating excellence and best practices in its performance. 
Board Retirement Policy.    As set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board has adopted a retirement policy that no director shall stand for election to the Board after reaching the age of 75.

Active Stockholder Engagement Program.    The Board and management are committed to engaging with Edwards' stockholders and incorporating feedback into their decision-making processes. Throughout the year our CEO, CFO and Vice President of Investor Relations meet, by phone and face-to-face, with current and prospective stockholders to discuss Edwards' strategy, business and financial results. Our Corporate Secretary and Investor Relations teams, together with other members of management and, from time to time, our Lead Independent Director, engage stockholders to solicit their views and feedback on corporate governance, compensation and other related matters and to discuss the issues that matter most to our stockholders. Stockholder feedback is shared with the Board and its committees, which enhances our corporate governance practices, facilitates future dialogue between stockholders and the Board and provides additional transparency to our stockholders.

Director Independence.    Under the corporate governance rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), a majority of the members of the Board must satisfy the NYSE criteria for independence. No director qualifies as independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, stockholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company). The Board has determined that each of Mr. Gallahue, Ms. Heisz, Dr. Link, Mr. Loranger, Ms. Marsh, Mr. Valeriani and Mr. von Schack is independent under the NYSE rules. Mr. Mussallem is not independent as a result of his position as our Chief Executive Officer. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines.    Our Board has adopted a set of Corporate Governance Guidelines (the "Governance Guidelines") to assist the Board and its committees in performing their duties and serving the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Governance Guidelines cover topics including, but not limited to, director selection and qualification, director responsibilities and operation of the Board, director access to management and independent advisors, director compensation, director orientation and continuing education, succession planning, recoupment of performance-based compensation and the annual evaluations of the Board. The Governance Guidelines are available on our website at www.edwards.com under "Investors—Corporate Governance." 
Board Leadership Structure.    The independent directors evaluate the Board's leadership structure on a regular basis to ensure that the approach continues to provide independent oversight of the Company and serves the best interests of stockholders. 
Our Chief Executive Officer also serves as the Chairman of the Board. Our Board believes it has been and continues to be effective for our Company. Under this model, the Company has experienced strong financial and operational growth over

 its 19 years as a public company, most recently providing a cumulative TSR of 366% to stockholders from 2013 to 2018. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is seen by customers, business partners, investors and others as providing strong leadership for the Company in the communities we serve and in our industry. Our Board believes that our current leadership structure is effective because it fosters a constructive and cooperative relationship between the independent directors and management that allows our Board to most effectively carry out its oversight duties. Our Board also believes that, given its size and constructive working relationships, changing the existing structure would not improve the Board's performance. The directors bring a broad range of leadership experience to the boardroom and regularly contribute to the thoughtful discussion involved in overseeing the affairs of the Company. All directors are well-engaged in their responsibilities, express their views, and are open to the opinions expressed by other directors. 
Our Board believes that it is important to have an active, engaged and independent Board. Our Governance Guidelines provide that a substantial majority of our Board and all of the members of our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee will be independent under the applicable rules of the NYSE. All members of our Board, other than the Chairman, are independent. In order to assure that the independent directors are not inappropriately influenced by management, the non-management members of the Board meet in executive session, without management, in conjunction with each regularly scheduled in-person meeting of the Board and each committee, and otherwise as deemed necessary. These executive sessions allow directors to speak candidly on any matter of interest, without the CEO or other members of management present. 
Lead Independent Director's Role and Responsibilities.    Our Governance Guidelines provide that if our Chairman is not independent, our independent directors shall annually select an independent director to serve as Lead Independent Director (formerly referred to as our presiding director). Each year, the Lead Independent Director's performance is assessed. As part of this review, the Compensation Committee evaluates the criteria for nominees for the Lead Independent Director role and assesses any needed changes. In selecting the Lead Independent Director, the Committee considers relevant leadership, operational and corporate governance experience, relationships with other Board members and external commitments. In addition, the Lead Independent Director is expected to have a thorough understanding of the Company's business operations and history. 
Mr. von Schack is currently designated as the Lead Independent Director and, as such, he presides at the executive sessions of the Board. 
In discharging his responsibilities under our Governance Guidelines, Mr. von Schack:

Board Role in Risk Oversight.    Effective risk oversight is an important priority of the Board. Its role includes understanding the critical risks in the business, allocating the responsibilities for risk oversight among the full Board and its committees, evaluating the Company's risk management processes and facilitating open communication between management and the directors. 
While the Board oversees risk management, the Company's management is charged with managing risk and bringing to the Board's attention emerging risks as well as the most material risks. We have robust internal processes that facilitate the identification and management of risks and assure regular communication with the Board and the Audit Committee. 
At least once per quarter, the Company's management provides the full Board with an analysis of the Company's most significant risks.

The Board implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and through delegation to its committees. Both committees play significant roles in carrying out the risk oversight function. 
The Audit Committee oversees risks related to the financial statements, the financial reporting process and accounting matters. It also regularly reviews Edwards' risk management processes and enterprise-wide risk management, focusing primarily on manufacturing processes and supplier quality, product development processes and systems, continuity of our operations and regulatory compliance. The Audit Committee also regularly reviews treasury risks (insurance, credit, debt, currency risk and hedging programs), legal and compliance risks, information technology infrastructure and cyber-security risk, and other risk management functions. In addition, the Audit Committee considers risks to the Company's reputation and related to the maintenance of a confidential anonymous reporting hotline for ethical and compliance issues. The Audit Committee periodically receives reports on, and discusses, the risk management and escalation process and reviews significant risks and exposures with the subject matter experts in management, the internal auditors, or the independent public accountants who identity the risks and report them to the Audit Committee. 
The Compensation Committee considers risks related to succession planning, the attraction and retention of talent and risks relating to the design of compensation programs and arrangements. As part of its normal review of these risks, the Compensation Committee considers the Company's compensation policies and practices to determine if their structure or implementation provides incentives to employees to take unnecessary or inappropriate risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Compensation Committee also reviews compensation and benefits plans affecting employees, in addition to those applicable to executive officers. The Compensation Committee has determined that the implementation and structure of the compensation policies and practices do not encourage unnecessary and inappropriate risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Compensation Committee further determined that the Company's compensation programs and practices appropriately encourage employees to maintain a strong balance sheet, improve operating performance and create value for stockholders, without encouraging unreasonable or unrestricted risks. In making these determinations, the Compensation Committee considered the views of the Company's compensation staff, legal counsel and internal audit team, as well as its Compensation Consultant (as defined below). In addition, the Compensation Committee oversees risks associated with the Company's political activities and expenditures, as well as its sustainability practices. 
The full Board considers strategic risks and opportunities and regularly receives reports from the committees regarding risk oversight in their areas of responsibility. Our Board believes that the processes it has established for overseeing risk would be effective under a variety of leadership frameworks and therefore do not materially affect its choice of leadership structure as described under "Board Leadership Structure" above. 
Meetings of the Board.    During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Board held seven meetings. Each director attended at least 75% of the total of all meetings of the Board and any applicable committee held during the period of his or her tenure in 2018. 
The Company encourages, but does not require, its directors to attend annual meetings of stockholders. All of our then-current directors attended the 2018 annual meeting. 
Board Composition.    Our Board has fixed the number of directors at eight. 
The ages of our directors range from 55 to 74, with an average age of approximately 66. We believe in a balanced approach to director tenure that allows the Board to benefit from a mix of newer directors who bring fresh perspectives and seasoned directors who bring continuity and a deep understanding of our business. Director lengths of service on our Board range from approximately 3 years to approximately 18 years, with an average tenure of approximately 7 years. 25% of our directors are female. None of our directors currently serve on the boards of directors of more than two other public companies. 
Committees of the Board.    To facilitate independent director review, and to make the most effective use of the directors' time and capabilities, we have established the Audit Committee and the Compensation and Governance Committee. The Board is permitted to establish other committees from time to time as it deems appropriate.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
Edwards' Sustainability Report discusses our programs and practices designed to promote ethical business practices, good corporate governance, and the well-being and health of our environment, employees, and the communities in which we live and work. We conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment through engagement with internal and external stakeholders that identified the sustainability topics that matter most for the Company. Sustainability targets were set that align with our five Corporate Aspirations. Our team continues to assess and report progress on our targets annually. We also expanded our Sustainability Metrics at-a-Glance, a snapshot of our ESG data, to provide additional data, and we developed Governance Maps that show the process used to establish accountability in one overarching, interactive graphic to illustrate Edwards' internal responsibility structures for managing our material topics. Each section describes who is involved when we set, execute, and communicate our strategy. 
Our Board recognizes the importance of our sustainability initiatives and the need to provide effective oversight. Our Compensation Committee maintains formal oversight responsibilities with regular discussions at meetings of the full Board. Through a well-established framework and cross-functional Sustainability Council with leaders from across the organization, we continue to build on our disclosure reflecting the recognition of sustainability within our businesses' core strategy—and our belief that sustainability is essential to long-term growth. 
We received numerous recognitions for our sustainability and environmental responsibilities practices in 2018, some of which are highlighted below:

The annual equity award is granted on the day after our annual meeting. The option exercise price is the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. Options are valued as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and the RSUs are valued at the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. 
On May 18, 2018, each nonemployee director who was serving on that date received 1,655 RSUs as an annual grant (the grant-date fair value of such award was $224,997, determined as noted in footnote (2) to the Director Compensation Table above). 
These RSUs vest 100% upon the earlier of the completion of one year of service on the Board measured from the grant date, or the date of the next annual meeting, subject to earlier vesting in the event of the nonemployee director's death or disability. Once the RSUs vest, the shares must be held until the nonemployee director no longer serves on the Board. 
Prior to 2017, upon a nonemployee director's initial election to the Board, the new nonemployee director received a grant of the numbers of RSUs or stock options determined by dividing $200,000 by the fair value of a share on the grant date for RSUs, or the fair value of an option on the grant date, estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and in either case rounding up to the nearest whole share, provided that in no event shall such number exceed twenty thousand (20,000) shares. Initial stock option awards vest one-third each year over three years from the grant date, subject to the nonemployee director's continued service on the Board, and subject to earlier vesting in the event of the nonemployee director's death or disability. The exercise price of an option is the closing price of our common stock on the date of the award. With respect to initial stock option awards granted after May 14, 2013, the shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of the options must be held until the nonemployee director no longer serves on the Board. 
Deferral Election Program.    In lieu of all or part of a nonemployee director's annual cash retainer, the director may elect to receive either stock options or restricted stock awards under the Nonemployee Directors Program. If a director makes a timely election to receive stock options, such options are granted on the date the cash retainer would otherwise have been paid, and the number of shares subject to the option is equal to four times the number of shares that could have been purchased on the grant date with the amount of the director's cash retainer that was foregone to receive the award. The options are exercisable and vested in full on the grant date, and the exercise price per share is the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. If a director makes a timely election to receive a restricted share award, the shares are granted on the date the cash retainer would otherwise have been paid, and the number of shares granted is equal to the portion of the cash retainer to be paid in the form of restricted shares divided by the fair market value per share of the common stock on the grant date. The restrictions on the restricted shares lapse upon the earlier of (1) the one-year anniversary of the grant date or (2) the date of the next regular annual meeting of stockholders at which members of the Board are to be elected. 
On May 18, 2018, Ms. Heisz and Mr. Loranger each received 1,913 stock options in lieu of his or her annual cash retainer (the grant-date fair value of each such award was $56,294, determined as noted in footnote (2) to the Director Compensation Table above). On the same date, Messrs. Gallahue and von Schack, and Dr. Link each received a grant of 479 restricted shares in lieu of his annual cash retainer (the grant-date fair value of each such award was $65,120, determined as noted in footnote (2) to the Director Compensation Table above).  
Directors' Stock Ownership Guidelines and Holding Requirement.    Under the stock ownership guidelines, each nonemployee director is expected to own shares of our common stock equal to $360,000. This amount equals almost six times the annual cash retainer received by each nonemployee director. Stock that is counted toward meeting the guideline includes any shares owned outright, restricted stock, RSUs and 25% of the value of vested, in-the-money stock options. Upon vesting or exercise of equity awarded after 2011, each director is required to hold the underlying common stock (net of any shares sold to cover the exercise price and applicable taxes) until the director's Board service ends. The holding requirement does not apply to equity awards directors elect to receive in lieu of their cash retainers. 
Expense Reimbursement Policy.    Directors are reimbursed for travel expenses related to their attendance at Board and committee meetings as well as for the costs of attending director continuing education programs. 
The Board may change compensation arrangements for nonemployee directors from time to time.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes and provides disclosure about the objectives and policies underlying our executive compensation programs. 
Executive Summary 
Edwards is the global leader in patient-focused medical innovations for structural heart disease, as well as critical care and surgical monitoring. Driven by a passion to help patients, we collaborate with the world's leading clinicians and researchers to address unmet healthcare needs, working to improve patient outcomes and enhance lives. 
Pay-for-Performance Philosophy.    The Compensation Committee strives to create a pay-for-performance culture and strongly believes that executive compensation should be tied not only to performance but also directly to the successful implementation of our corporate strategy. 
We embrace a corporate strategy that puts patients first and creates value with therapies that transform care. We execute our strategy by focusing on the right thing for patients, identifying unmet clinical needs and developing breakthrough therapies, doing so in a way that establishes trusted relationships with our stakeholders. As a direct result of our strategy, we have introduced new therapies such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, rapid-deployment surgical heart valves and noninvasive advanced hemodynamic monitoring, all while achieving our stated financial and operating objectives, and strengthening our leadership positions. Managing our business well in a challenging, highly regulated, dynamic environment requires talented and energetic leaders who champion our strategy and deliver on our commitments. 
Our executive compensation programs are designed to emphasize performance-based compensation, reward financial performance and the implementation of our corporate strategy, and align the financial interests of our executives with those of our stockholders.

2018 Financial and Operating Performance.    Overall, we achieved outstanding financial results and operating performance in 2018, meeting or exceeding our expectations for sales growth, net income growth, and free cash flow generation. We also made important progress on future advancements for patients. 
Strong underlying1 sales growth of 10% was driven by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Clinician and patient preferences for our innovative transcatheter aortic valve therapies, including the best-in-class Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continued adoption of our newer premium aortic surgical heart valves, INSPIRIS RESILIA and Edwards INTUITY Elite; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Broad use of our critical care technologies, including the ongoing rollout of our HemoSphere smart monitoring platform.   
[END TABLE]
Profitability was also strong in 2018, even as we continued to invest aggressively in our innovation initiatives and infrastructure. Utilizing significant savings in the reduction of our effective tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we hired new employees, accelerated research and development initiatives, and contributed more to employee retirement accounts. We directed a significant portion of our infrastructure investment toward the creation of a new product category dedicated to developing transcatheter solutions for the many patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid valve diseases.

Stock Performance.    One indicator of our pay-for-performance culture is the relationship of our NEOs' total direct compensation to total stockholder return. Over the past five years, on average, 88% of the CEO's total direct compensation has been performance-based, and 74% is tied to the performance of Edwards' stock. As a general indicator, the Compensation Committee considers how Edwards' cumulative total return to stockholders compares to both the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Healthcare Equipment Index. The table below illustrates our Company's 5-year cumulative total stockholder return on common stock with the cumulative total returns of the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Health Care Equipment Index. The cumulative total return listed below assumes an initial investment of $100 at the market close on December 31, 2013 and reinvestment of dividends. Stockholder returns over the indicated period should not be considered indicative of future stockholder returns.

2018 Annual Incentive Plan Outcomes and Long-Term Incentives.    The three measures used to evaluate financial achievement under our annual cash incentive plan were revenue growth, net income and free cash flow, all computed on a non-GAAP basis. Our financial results resulted in financial achievement at 112% of target under the cash incentive plan. In addition, our overall achievement of KODs for 2018 was 106%. Accordingly, our cash incentive plan for corporate employees funded at 119% of target. Final incentive amounts for the NEOs for 2018 also took into account each employee's individual performance, as more fully described below under "Elements of Compensation—Annual Cash Incentive Payment." 
The PBRSUs awarded to NEOs in 2015 that vested in 2018 were based on Edwards' TSR over a three-year performance period relative to the TSR of the SPSIHE subset for that same period. The payout of these PBRSUs tracked the strong performance of our stock after the three-year period and paid out at 175% of target, as more fully described under "Elements of Compensation—Determination as to 2015 PBRSU Awards."

Consideration of Say-on-Pay Vote Results.    At our 2018 annual meeting, our stockholders cast an advisory vote on the compensation of our NEOs (a "say-on-pay" vote). Approximately 94% of the votes cast on this proposal voted in favor of our NEO compensation. We believe this vote reflects stockholders' continued strong support of compensation programs for our NEOs. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the results of say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions for the NEOs. 
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives for NEOs.    Our compensation programs are designed to attract, retain, motivate and engage executives with superior leadership and management capabilities to enhance stockholder value. Within this overall philosophy, our objectives are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• offer programs that place a higher emphasis on performance-based compensation than fixed compensation;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align the financial interests of executives with those of our stockholders; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide compensation that is competitive.

We strongly believe that a significant amount of compensation for the NEOs should be composed of short-term and long-term incentives, or at-risk pay, to focus the executives on near-term goals and strategic initiatives. The amount of such short-term and long-term incentive compensation is dependent on achievement of our annual goals, individual performance, and long-term increases in the value of our stock. The target total direct compensation for each NEO consists of (i) base salary, (ii) Incentive Pay Objective (as defined under "Elements of Compensation—Annual Cash Incentive Payment" below), and (iii) long-term incentive awards (presented in the charts below using their grant-date fair values). 
The charts below illustrate the percentage weighting of each compensation vehicle that comprise the 2018 target total direct compensation for the CEO and the average for the other NEOs. 
Compensation Process.    The Compensation Committee is responsible for discussing, evaluating and approving the compensation of the CEO and the other NEOs, including the specific objectives and target performance levels to be included in our executive compensation plans. The CEO and other members of the executive leadership team develop our Strategic Imperatives as well as the KODs that measure our achievement of these imperatives. The Board reviews and approves the Strategic Imperatives and KODs at the start of every year. The CEO provides input to the Compensation Committee after year-end regarding achievement of our Strategic Imperatives and KODs and the way results were achieved. In addition, the CEO and the Corporate Vice President of Human Resources provide recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding compensation of the NEOs (other than the CEO). The Compensation Committee then determines the compensation of the CEO and reviews and approves the compensation of the other NEOs. 
The CEO and the Corporate Vice President of Human Resources are invited to, and regularly attend, Compensation Committee meetings as non-voting guests. The Compensation Committee regularly meets in executive session without participation by the CEO or other management representatives. Meetings of the Compensation Committee may only be called by members of the Compensation Committee. In addition, our CEO and Corporate Vice President of Human Resources meet with the Compensation Consultant in preparation for Compensation Committee meetings, and the Compensation Consultant also regularly attends Compensation Committee meetings and participates in executive sessions with the Compensation Committee. 
Independent Compensation Consultant.    The Compensation Consultant, Semler Brossy Consulting Group, has been retained by and reports to the Compensation Committee and provides executive and director compensation consulting services to the Compensation Committee. 
Semler Brossy's responsibilities for fiscal 2018 generally included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

The Compensation Consultant does not provide any other services to the Board or the Company. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of the Compensation Consultant pursuant to the NYSE rules and determined that the Compensation Consultant is independent, and free of conflicts of interest with us or any of our directors or executive officers. 
Use of Competitive Data.    We generally position each NEO's target total direct compensation to approximate the median for comparable positions at competitive peer companies. However, in determining the appropriate positioning level of each NEO's target total direct compensation and each component of compensation for an NEO, the Compensation Committee also takes into account its assessment of the Company's or business unit's general performance, as applicable for each executive, and the executive's tenure, experience, level of individual performance and potential to contribute to our future growth. Accordingly, an NEO's actual compensation may be higher or lower than the median for the position based on the Compensation Committee's assessment of these other factors. If the Compensation Committee determines that changes are appropriate, it has the flexibility to make adjustments for one or more executives. 
Consistent with our philosophy of emphasizing pay for performance, annual cash incentive payments are designed to be above Incentive Pay Objectives when we exceed our goals and below the Incentive Pay Objectives when we do not achieve our goals. In the event threshold levels of performance are not attained, no annual incentive payment is earned. 
For purposes of establishing the value of equity awards, stock options are valued as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. RSUs and PBRSUs are valued at the fair market value of the underlying shares on the grant date. Except as otherwise noted above or described below, the Compensation Committee's executive compensation determinations are subjective and the result of the Compensation Committee's business judgment, which is informed by the experiences of the members of the Compensation Committee as well as the input from the Compensation Consultant and peer group data provided by the Compensation Consultant. In order to establish competitive compensation market data for the NEOs, the Compensation Consultant uses public proxy information from companies primarily in the medical technology industry. These peer companies are chosen based on the Compensation Committee's assessment of their market capitalization, revenue, business focus, complexity, geographic location and the extent to which the Compensation Committee believes they compete with us for executive talent (the "Comparator Group"). The composition of the Comparator Group is reviewed periodically to monitor the appropriateness of the profiles of the companies included so that the group continues to reflect our competitive market and provides statistical reliability. 
The review of the Comparator Group for pay decisions in 2018 was conducted in July 2017. After evaluating a series of qualitative and quantitative factors among other publicly traded U.S. companies in our industry, including scale, talent, business, and operational characteristics and overlap among peers, the Compensation Committee determined to make no changes to the Comparator Group used to make 2018 executive compensation decisions other than the removal of St. Jude Medical, Inc. because it was acquired by Abbott Laboratories on January 4, 2017. For 2018, the Comparator Group consisted of the following companies:

As of June 30, 2017, Edwards ranked at the 57th percentile of this group in terms of market capitalization. Compensation data are generally regressed for market capitalization to ensure that the data are not distorted by larger companies. Regression analysis is a commonly used technique to size-adjust data, which allows for more statistically valid comparisons. The key measure used in our regression model is market capitalization. Based on this measure, the regression formula correlates and adjusts the raw data for base salary, total cash compensation and total direct compensation to predict those items based on the market capitalization for each of the Comparator Group companies. 
Although data from the Comparator Group are the primary data input for compensation decisions for the NEOs, consideration is given to compensation data for companies in healthcare-related industries as reported in nationally recognized Radford Global Technology and Global Lifesciences Compensation Surveys. The Compensation Committee considers both survey data that is healthcare-specific and also general industry data for companies within a similar size scope to Edwards. The Compensation Committee believes it is appropriate to refer to these additional data because we compete with these types of companies for executive talent. 
When compared to similar positions at our 2018 Comparator Group companies, our target total direct compensation and the elements of compensation (base salary, annual cash incentive, and long-term incentive award value) approximated or were below the median for all of the NEOs. 
Elements of Compensation.    The compensation package for each NEO consists primarily of (a) base salary; (b) an annual cash incentive payment based on attainment of pre-established financial measures, operating goals, and individual performance; and (c) long-term stock-based incentive awards. Each of these three components of compensation is intended to promote one or more of our objectives of designing executive compensation that is performance-based, is competitive, and aligns the interests of the executives with our stockholders as further described in the Elements of Compensation Summary chart below.

Base Salary. The Compensation Committee generally reviews each NEO's base salary in February and any approved changes are effective with the first pay period in April. The base salary for the CEO is established in a similar manner and is described more fully under "Employment and Post-Termination Agreements" below. Base salaries paid to the NEOs increased between 3.0% and 5.5% in 2018 over the level in effect in 2017 to help maintain market competitiveness and based on the Compensation Committee's assessment of internal roles and contributions.  
Annual Cash Incentive Payment.    All of the NEOs and many other management and non-management-level salaried employees (approximately 11,100 employees) participated in the 2018 Edwards Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"). 
The Compensation Committee utilizes the Incentive Pay Objective so that the total cash compensation (base salary plus incentive payment for expected performance) for the NEOs will be at approximately the median of the Comparator Group.

 The Compensation Committee establishes for each NEO the amount of incentive payment that will be earned for expected performance, referred to as the "Incentive Pay Objective." The Compensation Committee then considers performance results to determine the actual cash incentive payments. As described below, in applying its discretion, the Compensation Committee may reduce, but may not increase, the cash incentive payment. 
The accompanying "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2018" table reports the maximum amounts payable and the Incentive Pay Objective (called the "Target" in the table) established for each NEO. 
The Incentive Plan for NEOs in 2018 provided that achievement at the threshold of any one of three Company financial measures (revenue growth, net income and free cash flow) would result in initial funding for the Incentive Plan. Then, the Compensation Committee applied its discretion in a two-step process to determine the final annual cash incentive payments for the NEOs. Each of these two steps is discussed below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Incentive Plan Funding   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee, after consultation with management, sets annual incentive performance goals each year for achievement of financial measures and KODs. Financial measures are non-GAAP calculations generally on the same basis as contained in our financial guidance, subject to further adjustment to account for material developments during the year. In February 2018, the Compensation Committee initially established the financial measures at the minimum, target, and maximum levels set forth in the chart below. 
Incentive Plan funding is determined after results of achievement of the predetermined financial measures and KODs are known. 
The following illustration shows how the Incentive Plan is funded.

After evaluating actual achievement of 67 different metrics and milestones underlying these KODs, the Board determined in its judgment that overall KOD performance for 2018 was 106%. 
Based on the formula above, combining financial performance of 112% with KOD performance of 106%, the Compensation Committee arrived at an actual calculated Incentive Plan funding of 119%. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Individual Performance   
[END TABLE]
Individual performance objectives for the CEO are established collaboratively by the CEO and the Compensation Committee, and the individual performance objectives for the other NEOs are established collaboratively by the CEO and each such executive. The Compensation Committee believes each executive has an appropriate number of meaningful individual performance objectives. The individual performance objectives are chosen to create goals, the attainment of which is designed to implement our strategic and operating plans, with a focus on the achievement of the financial measures and operational goals within each executive's individual area of responsibility. 
These objectives are considered in the aggregate to determine an overall performance assessment for each NEO for the purposes of determining compensation. Although some of the individual performance objectives are expressed in qualitative terms that require subjective evaluation, objectives also include several quantitative measures. However, the assessment of the overall performance for each NEO involves a subjective process. The CEO reviews the performance of each NEO (other than the CEO) with the Compensation Committee and recommends a performance assessment for each executive. The Compensation Committee assesses the CEO's performance. The Compensation Committee then exercises subjective judgment, reviewing the individual performance objectives, the overall performance of the individual executive against all of his or her individual objectives, taken together, and the executive's performance relative to the environment and to other executives. There is no formal weighting of the individual performance objectives. Individual performance may impact an executive's cash incentive payment, subject to an overall cap on incentive payments of 200% of the Incentive Pay Objective.

Committee Review Process.    The Compensation Committee generally meets each February to review and approve annual incentive payments for the prior year and to set incentive performance targets for the current year. The Compensation Committee may adjust the incentive payment levels based on financial measure achievement, KOD achievement, individual performance, and TSR. In February 2019, after reviewing the Company's 2018 performance versus financial and operational goals, TSR performance, and business unit performance, the Compensation Committee awarded incentive payments to the NEOs that ranged from 115% to 133% of the Incentive Pay Objectives for the NEOs. The amount awarded to each NEO for 2018 is reported in the accompanying "Summary Compensation" table. The incentive payments were paid in March 2019. 
Long-Term Incentive Awards.    The mix of long-term incentive awards granted to our NEOs in 2018 included stock options, PBRSUs and RSUs. The Compensation Committee views stock options as performance-based equity compensation, tying our executives' pay directly to stockholder value creation over the long term because the value of our common stock must increase after the date of grant of the options in order for the options to have any value. Having a seven-year time horizon, stock options also promote the retention of our executives and are consistent with our focus on top-line growth, innovation and our longer-term investment horizon and product pipeline. PBRSU awards measure relative TSR, which the Compensation Committee believes is a straightforward and objective metric for our stockholders to evaluate our performance against the performance of other companies and to align with stockholder interests. As the RSU awards have value regardless of stock price performance, they help promote the stability and retention of a strong executive team over the longer term (vesting schedules generally require continuous service over multiple years, as described below). 
Of the total 2018 long-term incentive awards granted to each of our NEOs, the values of stock options were weighted 55%, PBRSUs were weighted 25%, and time-based RSUs were weighted 20%. We believe measuring a combination of absolute TSR (through stock options) and relative TSR (through PBRSUs), and providing stock-denominated time-based vesting RSUs, results in a balance between these incentives that appropriately aligns our executives' pay with stockholder value while promoting the stability and retention of the executive team. Given the different risk and reward characteristics of these three types of awards and our executive compensation philosophy, the Compensation Committee believes that the equity awards granted to executives should comprise a greater proportion of stock options and PBRSUs relative to RSUs.

Stock Options.    Stock options granted in 2018 to Mr. Ullem, Ms. Szyman and Mr. Wood vest annually over four years and have a seven-year term. Stock options granted to Mr. Mussallem and Mr. Bobo vest monthly over 36 months, consistent with the vesting standards established by the Company for its stock option grants to executives who are retirement-eligible, and have a seven-year term. Stock options granted during 2018 have an exercise price equal to the closing price on the day of the regular Board meeting held on the next day following Compensation Committee approval. 
PBRSUs.    PBRSUs awarded in 2018 are based on relative TSR performance as measured for the performance period beginning April 30, 2018 and ending April 30, 2021. The percentage of the target PBRSU awards that will vest at the end of the three-year performance period depends on the percentage by which our TSR exceeds or falls short of the median TSR (calculated assuming dividend reinvestment) of the SPSIHE Subset (as defined below). The chart below illustrates the maximum, target and threshold performance levels and the PBRSU payout at each level.

[END TABLE]
The maximum and threshold performance levels applicable to the awards were set at levels that the Compensation Committee believed were consistent with the historical 75th and 25th percentile levels, respectively, for the TSRs of the SPSIHE Subset. The "SPSIHE Subset" is a subset of 28 companies in the S&P Healthcare Equipment Select Industry Index that are also on the S&P 500 Index or S&P 400 Midcap Index. We believe this group is a strong comparator for performance purposes as it includes companies of comparable size with similar business models. 
RSUs.    RSUs awarded in 2018 to the NEOs vest 50% on the third and fourth anniversaries of the award date, subject to continued employment of the award recipient through the applicable vesting date. 
At the Compensation Committee meeting immediately preceding the stockholder meeting in May of each year, the Compensation Committee generally determines the size of the long-term incentive award for each NEO. In keeping with our commitment to provide a total compensation package that emphasizes at-risk components of pay, long-term incentives for 2018 comprised, on average, 68% of the value of the NEO's total direct compensation package. 
For 2018, the CEO evaluated each NEO's performance (other than his own), as discussed previously (see "Compensation Process" above), and established specific recommendations for the Compensation Committee's consideration. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee established awards for the NEOs (other than the CEO) based on these recommendations and the Committee's assessment of the factors noted above for each executive. The Compensation Committee evaluated the CEO's performance using the same criteria as discussed above in "Compensation Process" to establish the appropriate award for the CEO. Equity awards are granted under the Long-Term Stock Program, which was last approved by the stockholders in May 2017. The equity awards granted to the NEOs for 2018 are set forth in the accompanying "Grants of Plan – Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2018" table below. 
Value of Equity Awarded in 2018.    As described above, for purposes of establishing the value of equity awards, the Compensation Committee values stock options as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and RSUs and PBRSUs are valued at the fair market value of the underlying shares on the grant date with the value of PBRSUs based on the "target" level of performance. Under applicable accounting rules, however, the grant-date fair value of the PBRSUs awarded to our NEOs is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model. The PBRSUs are included as compensation for our NEOs in the "Summary Compensation Table" based on this valuation methodology. For information on the assumptions used in this fair value computation, refer to Note 13 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in the 2018 Annual Report. The Compensation Committee does not apply the Monte Carlo simulation when it determines the number of PBRSUs to be awarded to an executive (instead basing the value of a PBRSU on the fair market value of the underlying "target" number of shares on the grant date) to simplify the award process and provide more consistent award sizing (based on the number of shares subject to the awards) from year to year.

The following chart shows the values of the PBRSU awards approved by the Compensation Committee in 2018 that were used to determine the number of shares subject to the awards (based on the $135.83 closing price per share of our common stock on the grant date for PBRSUs, calculated at the "target" level of performance and without taking the Monte Carlo simulation pricing model into account), as well as the accounting grant-date fair value of the PBRSUs we are required to use under applicable SEC rules to report in the "Summary Compensation Table" (calculated as noted in the footnotes to the "Summary Compensation Table," and including the impact of the Monte Carlo simulation pricing model).

The Compensation Committee determined that as of April 30, 2018 our relative TSR was at the 78th percentile, higher than the maximum level and, accordingly, 175% of the target award for each executive vested. Amounts realized by our NEOs attributable to these awards can be found in the "Option Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal Year 2018" table below. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines and Holding Requirement.    Under our guidelines, executives are expected to own shares of Edwards' stock as follows:

Stock ownership guidelines were established to create additional owner commitment and to emphasize stockholder value creation. Expected ownership levels are adjusted as the executives' annual base salaries change. Executives who have not met the guidelines must hold 50% of the net shares of our common stock acquired in connection with the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and RSU awards (after satisfaction of applicable taxes and, in the case of options, payment of the exercise price) until the guidelines are met. In the event an executive achieved the guideline but was unable to maintain the ownership level due to a decline in the price of our common stock, the 50% holding requirement is reinstated.

Prohibition on Pledging and Hedging.    We have adopted a policy prohibiting all members of the Board, all employees with a title of "vice president" equivalent or above, and any employee designated as a "Designated Insider" from time to time under our insider trading policy, from (1) holding the Company's securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging the Company's securities as collateral for a loan, and (2) entering into short sales, options, puts, calls and sales against the box, as well as hedging of the Company's securities or derivative transactions including swaps, forwards, futures, collars and exchange funds. To our knowledge, none of our NEOs have engaged in hedging or pledging with respect to our common stock. 
Market Timing of Equity Awards.    We do not have any program, plan or practice to time equity grants in coordination with the release of material information. Annual equity awards for the NEOs are generally approved at the Compensation Committee meeting in May of each year and awarded on the date of the Board meeting immediately following that Committee Meeting. Any other equity awards to the NEOs, including grants to new hires, are generally made on the date of the next regularly scheduled Board meeting. 
Benefits and Perquisites.    The NEOs are eligible to participate in employee benefit programs generally offered to other of our employees employed in the same jurisdiction as the NEO including, for all NEOs employed in the United States, the Edwards Lifesciences Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan ("401(k)"), which provides for a Company matching contribution. In 2018, we increased the matching contribution so that contributions are matched dollar for dollar up to the first 4% of cash compensation, and 50% on the next 2%. In addition, we provide certain other perquisites to our NEOs described below that are not generally available to our employees. 
The Compensation Committee conducts an annual review of the competitiveness of our perquisite program, including its individual components and levels, against the perquisite programs of companies in the Comparator Group. As a result of these reviews, the Compensation Committee may make adjustments from time to time in the benefits and perquisites provided as it determines to be appropriate. 
We believe that providing perquisites enhances the competitiveness of the executive's compensation in a relatively inexpensive way. These perquisites are described below and reported in the "Summary Compensation Table." 
Our perquisite program for the NEOs includes the following: 
Car Allowance.    An annual car allowance is paid as follows: $13,200 for the CEO, and $10,800 for the other NEOs. It is intended to cover expenses related to the lease, purchase, insurance and maintenance of a vehicle, and mileage for business use. The car allowance is provided in recognition of the need to have executives visit customers, business partners and other stakeholders in order to fulfill their job responsibilities. 
Executive Physical Examination.    The Company paid up to $3,649 for each annual executive physical examination received by an NEO. This benefit encourages the proactive management of the executive's health, helping best position the executive team to be able to address the ongoing and day-to-day issues we face. 
Perquisite Allowance.    NEOs receive a fixed annual allowance for certain expenses. The CEO receives $40,000 (including one club membership that is being used for corporate business purposes, at a cost of $6,190 in 2018), and the other NEOs each receive $20,000. This benefit recognizes the diverse nature of expenses that have a business nexus that may be incurred by our executives. The allowance may also be used to cover certain personal financial, estate and tax planning costs, as we believe that it is appropriate for the executives to have professional assistance in managing their total compensation, permitting them to focus their full attention on growing and managing our business. 
Deferred Compensation.    We have adopted a deferred compensation plan for the NEOs and certain other management employees to enable them to save for retirement by deferring their income and the associated tax to a future date or termination of employment. Under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "EDCP"), return on compensation deferred by participants is based on investment alternatives selected by the participant. We believe that the EDCP is comparable to similar plans offered by companies in the Comparator Group. 
The amounts deferred and accrued under the EDCP for the NEOs are reported below in the "Summary Compensation Table" and the "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans" table.

Employment and Post-Termination Agreements.    We have entered into an employment agreement with the CEO, as well as change-in-control severance agreements (the "change-in-control severance agreements") with the CEO and our other NEOs as discussed below. Mr. Bobo, Mr. Ullem, Ms. Szyman and Mr. Wood are eligible to participate in a general severance plan for eligible employees to receive severance benefits upon an involuntary termination of employment due to the elimination of their position or a reduction in workforce. 
Chief Executive Officer Employment Agreement.    We entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Mr. Mussallem on March 9, 2009, which was approved by the Compensation Committee and provides for, among other things, his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, an annual base salary, bonus and long-term incentive awards as determined by the Board, and, in certain circumstances, severance payments upon termination of employment. The agreement renews automatically for successive one year terms. 
Mr. Mussallem's base salary is reviewed and may be adjusted annually based on the Compensation Committee's review of the Comparator Group data in consultation with the Compensation Consultant, and Mr. Mussallem's performance. The Compensation Committee followed the same philosophy and programs described above for executives in determining 2018 compensation for Mr. Mussallem. In addition, the Compensation Committee reviewed a tally sheet, which affixed a dollar amount to all components of Mr. Mussallem's compensation, including current compensation, equity awards and benefits. 
The Compensation Committee believes, after reviewing Mr. Mussallem's total direct compensation, individual performance, and contribution to our financial results during 2018, that Mr. Mussallem's total compensation and each component thereof were in line with our compensation philosophy and objectives. 
If Mr. Mussallem's employment is involuntarily terminated by us without "cause," as defined in the employment agreement, we are required to pay certain severance benefits, provided he is not receiving the severance benefits under his change-in-control severance agreement. The material terms of the severance arrangement are described in the section "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" below. 
Change-in-Control Severance Agreements.    We have entered into agreements with the NEOs pursuant to which such individuals will be provided certain payments and benefits in the event of termination of employment following a change in control of the Company. We believe that these agreements enhance the likelihood of retaining the services of the executives in the event we were to become an acquisition target and allow the NEOs to continue to focus their attention on our business operations, stockholder value and the attainment of long-term and short-term objectives without undue concern over their employment or financial situations. The material terms of the agreements are described in the section "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control," below. 
We believe that the level of severance payments is fair and reasonable based on the value we would derive from the services provided by the executives with change-in-control severance agreements prior to, and following, a change in control. 
Tax Implications – Policy Regarding Section 162(m).    Federal income tax law generally prohibits a publicly-held company from deducting compensation paid to a current or former NEO that exceeds $1 million during the tax year. Certain awards granted by the Company before November 2, 2017 that were based upon attaining pre-established performance measures set by the Committee, as well as amounts payable to former executives pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017, may qualify for an exception to the $1 million deductibility limit. There can be no assurance that any compensation the Committee intended to be deductible will in fact be deductible. Although the potential deductibility of compensation is one of the factors the Committee notes when designing the Company's executive compensation program, the Committee has the flexibility to take any compensation-related actions it determines are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, including awarding compensation that will not be deductible for tax purposes. 
The Compensation Committee recognizes the importance of preserving our ability to design compensation programs to attract and retain skilled and qualified individuals in a highly competitive market. The Compensation Committee will continue to design salary, annual incentive bonuses and long-term incentive compensation in a manner that the Compensation Committee believes prudent or necessary to hire and retain our NEOs, and may approve non-deductible compensation arrangements for our executive officers from time to time when it believes that these other considerations outweigh the benefit of the tax deductibility of the compensation.

2019 Compensation Decisions.    At its February 2019 meeting, the Compensation Committee approved average base salary increases of approximately 3.9% for the NEOs to maintain market competitiveness.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The "Summary Compensation Table" quantifies the value of the different forms of compensation earned by or awarded to our NEOs for 2018. The primary elements of each NEO's total compensation reported in the table are base salary, annual bonus and long-term equity incentives consisting of stock options, PBRSUs and RSUs. NEOs also received the other benefits listed in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "Summary Compensation Table," as further described in the footnotes to the table. 
The "Summary Compensation Table" should be read in conjunction with the tables and narrative descriptions that follow. A description of the material terms of each NEO's base salary and annual bonus is provided immediately following the "Summary Compensation Table." The "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2018" table, and the accompanying description of the material terms of the stock options, PBRSUs, and RSUs granted in 2018, provides information regarding the long-term equity incentives awarded to NEOs in 2018. The "Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End" and "Option Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal Year 2018" tables provide further information on the NEOs' potential realizable value and actual value realized with respect to their equity awards. 
2018 Summary Compensation Table 
The following table sets forth a summary, for the years indicated, of the compensation of the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and our three other most highly compensated executive officers whose total compensation for 2018 was in excess of $100,000 and who were serving as executive officers at the end of 2018. No other executive officers that would have otherwise been includable in the table on the basis of total compensation for 2018 have been excluded by reason of their termination of employment or change in executive status during that year.

The EDCP provides the NEOs and certain other employees with the opportunity to defer specified percentages (up to 25%) of their cash compensation and receive matching employer contributions that could not be deferred or contributed to the 401(k) because of the limitations under such plan imposed by the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). The EDCP also permits the participants to defer up to 100% of their annual cash incentive bonus and an additional 55% of their base pay, but we do not match the employee contribution above 25%. Participants may elect deferred amounts to be paid either in

Deferrals are credited with gains or losses based on the performance of one or more investment alternatives selected by the participant from among investment funds chosen by the Compensation Committee or its delegate. Investment elections made for each plan year may not be revoked, changed or modified except as permitted under the EDCP, and subject to applicable law. No actual investments will be held in the participants' accounts and participants will at all times remain general unsecured creditors of the Company with respect to their account balances. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
Included below is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the only agreements we have entered into with our NEOs that provide for certain payments and benefits in connection with a termination of their employment, other than benefits that are part of employee benefit plans that apply on the same terms to all salaried employees. Also described below are the terms of the Long-Term Stock Program with respect to outstanding equity awards in the event of a change in control of the Company. 
Change-in-Control Severance Agreements.    We have entered into change-in-control severance agreements with each of the NEOs and certain other executives. The change-in-control severance agreements entered into with Messrs. Mussallem, Bobo and Wood were subject to an initial term ending December 31, 2013, and the change-in-control severance agreements entered into with Ms. Szyman and Mr. Ullem were subject to initial terms ending December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The change-in-control severance agreements are subject to automatic one-year extensions each year unless we provide notice that the agreement will not be extended. Under the terms of the change-in-control severance agreement, each executive is entitled to receive certain severance payments if, at any time during the period commencing six months prior to and ending on the date that is 24 months following a change in control, the executive incurs a "qualifying termination" of employment. For these purposes, a "qualifying termination" means (i) the executive is involuntarily terminated by us without cause or (ii) the executive voluntarily terminates employment for good reason. 
For purposes of the change-in-control severance agreements, "cause" generally includes (1) certain willful and deliberate material breaches by the executive of the executive's duties and responsibilities that are not timely remedied; (2) the executive engaging in conduct that is willfully, demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company that is not timely remedied; or (3) the executive being convicted of, or pleading guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony that adversely affects the reputation of the executive or the Company. 
For the NEOs other than Mr. Mussallem, "good reason" generally includes (1) a material change of the executive's responsibilities or status or the assignment of the executive to duties materially inconsistent with such responsibilities or status; (2) a relocation in excess of 50 miles of the executive's principal job location; (3) a reduction of the executive's base salary, incentive plans or benefits; (4) our failure to require any successor company to assume the obligations under the agreement; or (5) a material breach by the Company of the material terms of the agreement. For Mr. Mussallem, "good reason" generally has the same meaning described above, except that the definition also includes that following a change in control (1) Mr. Mussallem is no longer a member of the Board or fails to be nominated for reelection to the Board; or (2) Mr. Mussallem and the Company (or any successor company) have not mutually agreed (within five business days following a change in control) on the terms and conditions of his continued employment. 
In the event of a qualifying termination, the executive would be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to the sum of (1) two times (three times in the case of Mr. Mussallem) the annual base salary as of the time of termination (or during the 12 months preceding the change in control, if higher); (2) two times (three times in the case of Mr. Mussallem) the Incentive Pay Objective for the year of termination (or the dollar amount of the actual bonus paid in the preceding year, if higher); (3) a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination; (4) all then-outstanding and unvested long-term incentive awards would generally be subject to accelerated vesting; and (5) continued participation in our medical and dental plans for three years following termination of employment. In addition, the executive would be entitled to reasonable outplacement services. If any such payments or benefits would constitute a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code, then such payments and benefits would be reduced to the extent necessary to assure that the executive receives only the greater of (1) the amount of the payments which would not constitute a parachute payment, or (2) the amount which yields the greatest after-tax benefit after taking into account any excise taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Code. The change-in-control severance agreements do not provide for tax gross-up payments. Receipt of these severance benefits is conditioned upon the executive executing and not revoking a general release of any claims in favor of the Company.

The change-in-control severance agreements for the NEOs other than Mr. Mussallem provide that, in the event the executive is entitled to benefits under our Severance Pay Plan (the "Severance Plan"), which is described below, and the executive also has a qualifying termination under the change-in-control severance agreement, the executive will be entitled to the benefits under the change-in-control severance agreement only, and installment payments under the Severance Plan will immediately terminate without offset or reduction for any benefits already received under the Severance Plan. In the event Mr. Mussallem becomes entitled to the benefits under his change-in-control severance agreement following the time at which he became entitled to certain severance benefits under the terms of his employment agreement (which is described below), any then-remaining severance benefits under his employment agreement will immediately terminate and he will only be entitled to benefits under his change-in-control severance agreement, and the amount of certain severance benefits payable under his change-in-control severance agreement will be reduced by the amount of the severance benefits previously paid under his employment agreement. 
Employment Agreement with CEO.    On March 9, 2009, the Company entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Mr. Mussallem pursuant to which he is eligible to receive benefits in connection with certain termination circumstances. If Mr. Mussallem's employment is terminated without cause, we will pay him the sum of (1) two times his highest base salary in the preceding 12 months; (2) the higher of one times his maximum target bonus for the year of termination, or two times the actual bonus paid in the preceding year; (3) a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination; and (4) an amount equal to the cost of continued medical and dental coverage for up to 24 months. Mr. Mussallem will not be entitled to receive any such payments if he receives payments under his change-in-control severance agreement and, as described above, any severance benefits Mr. Mussallem may receive under his change-in-control severance agreement will be offset by any benefits he received under his employment agreement. For purposes of Mr. Mussallem's employment agreement, "cause" generally includes (1) the executive willfully engaging in conduct that is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company; or (2) the executive's conviction of a felony. 
If Mr. Mussallem's employment is terminated due to retirement, disability or death, he will receive his pro-rated bonus for the year of termination and additional benefits as determined in accordance with our benefit plans. 
For a period of 24 months following his termination of employment, Mr. Mussallem may not employ or solicit for employment any of our employees or consultants. 
Severance Pay Plan.    We maintain the Severance Plan, under which the NEOs (other than Mr. Mussallem) and certain other employees are eligible to receive severance benefits in connection with a termination of the individual's employment due to elimination of his or her position or a reduction in the size of our workforce. Benefits paid to an NEO (other than Mr. Mussallem) under the Severance Plan consist of cash severance equal to one and one-half times the executive's "monthly compensation" (as defined in the Severance Plan), plus 4% of the monthly compensation multiplied by the number of whole months of service completed as of the date of termination. In no event will this cash severance exceed two times the annual compensation received in the preceding 12 months. See "Change-in-Control Severance Agreements" section above for a description of the treatment of Severance Plan benefits if an NEO is also entitled to severance benefits under the change-in-control severance agreement. 
Acceleration of Equity Awards.    Pursuant to the terms of the Long-Term Stock Program applicable to awards granted prior to May 2015, in the event of a change in control of the Company, all outstanding stock options, restricted stock, RSUs and PBRSUs held by all employees (including the NEOs) will vest in full. This provision was amended as to awards granted since May 2015 such that both a change in control and a specified termination of employment (a "double-trigger") are required, or the awards must be terminated in the change-in-control transaction, in order for vesting of the awards to accelerate in connection with the change-in-control transaction. 
Estimated Payments.    The following tables set forth the estimated payments and benefits that would have been payable to the NEOs under the terms of their agreements as described above had their employment been terminated on December 31, 2018 under the termination circumstances indicated below. Unless otherwise noted, all cash payments would be made in a lump sum and would be paid by us or our successor. The amounts set forth in these tables represent estimates and forward-looking information that is subject to substantial variation based on the timing of the applicable triggering event. We caution the reader to consider these limitations in reviewing the following tables.

We have also assumed that outstanding and unvested stock options, RSUs and PBRSUs held by the executive accelerated and became vested (to the extent required in the circumstances) on the applicable event. If the awards were accelerated in connection with a change in control pursuant to which the awards were to be terminated, the value of the acceleration would be the same as the applicable value indicated below for "Qualifying Termination in Connection with a Change in Control" assuming that the change in control occurred on December 31, 2018. In these circumstances, there would be no additional value for the accelerated vesting of the awards in connection with a termination of employment if the awards had previously accelerated because of the change in control.

(1)  Under the change-in-control severance  agreements, payments and benefits will be reduced to the extent necessary to ensure that the executive receives only the greater of (1) the amount of the payments which would not constitute a parachute payment or (2) the amount which  yields the executive the greatest after-tax amount of benefits after taking into account any excise taxes imposed on the executive under Section 4999 of the Code. The value of each executive's  severance benefits presented on the table assumes that no such reduction in benefits would be required.

CEO Pay Ratio 
Pursuant to the Exchange Act, we are required to disclose in this Proxy Statement the ratio of the total annual compensation of our CEO to the median of the total annual compensation of all of our employees (excluding our CEO). Based on SEC rules for this disclosure and applying the methodology described below, we have determined that our CEO's total compensation for 2018 was $10,278,949, and the median of the total 2018 compensation of all of our employees (excluding our CEO) was $49,936. Accordingly, we estimate the ratio of our CEO's total compensation for 2018 to the median of the total 2018 compensation of all of our employees (excluding our CEO) to be 206 to 1.
The median employee that was to be used for purposes of calculating the ratio above was the same employee (the "2017 median employee") that was identified as the median employee for purposes of the CEO pay ratio disclosure included in the proxy statement for our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2017 Pay Ratio Disclosure") because, except as noted in the next sentence, there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements since the 2017 median employee was identified that we believe would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure. However, because the 2017 median employee was on a leave of absence for a portion of 2018, we believe the impact of that leave on the 2017 median employee's total compensation for 2018 would result in a significant change to the pay ratio disclosure. Accordingly, and as permitted by SEC rules, we substituted another employee, whose total compensation for 2017 was substantially similar to the 2017 median employee's total compensation for 2017 based on the compensation measure used to select the median employee for purposes of the 2017 Pay Ratio Disclosure, as the median employee for purposes of this disclosure. 
The total compensation for 2018 for that median employee, and the total compensation for 2018 for our CEO, as included in the first paragraph of this pay ratio disclosure were determined using the same rules that apply to reporting the compensation of our Named Executive Officers (including our CEO) in the "Total" column of the Summary Compensation Table. The SEC's pay ratio disclosure rules permit the use of estimates, assumptions, and adjustments, and the SEC has acknowledged that pay ratio disclosures may involve a degree of imprecision. We believe that the foregoing pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the SEC's pay ratio disclosure rules.

PROPOSAL 2 – ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the related rules of the SEC, we are providing our stockholders with the opportunity to vote, on an advisory, non-binding basis, on the executive compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this Proxy Statement (including in the compensation tables and narratives accompanying those tables as well as in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis"). 
As described more fully in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, retain, motivate, and engage executives with superior leadership and management capabilities. High-caliber talent is critical to our success and we strive to provide compensation that is competitive. Our strong pay-for-performance culture is reflected below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A significant portion of executive compensation is performance based;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our performance goals consist of a mix of company-wide financial, operating, and strategic measures as well as personal  objectives designed to further the Company's annual and long-term business performance; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We strive to align the interests of our executives with the interests of our stockholders, with a significant portion of  executive compensation being in the form of equity awards with a value dependent upon our stock price.  
[END TABLE]
We urge stockholders to read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 25, which describes in more detail how our executive compensation policies and procedures are designed and operate to achieve our compensation and strategic objectives, as well as the "Summary Compensation Table" and other related compensation tables and narrative appearing on pages 42 through 54. The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that the policies, procedures, and compensation programs described in these sections have contributed to the Company's long-term performance. 
In the advisory vote at our 2018 annual meeting, approximately 94% of the votes cast by our stockholders supported our executive compensation policies and procedures. 
Even though we have regularly received strong support for our executive pay practices, the Compensation Committee continues to engage in periodic reviews of our executive compensation and benefits programs and makes changes as appropriate to reflect our compensation philosophy and objectives, and to take into account stockholder feedback. 
In 2018, we achieved significant growth and exceeded our financial goals, including non-GAAP revenue, net income and free cash flow, the three measures of achievement under our annual cash incentive plan. In February 2019, after reviewing the Company's 2018 performance versus financial and operational goals, TSR performance, and business unit performance, the Compensation Committee awarded incentive payments to the NEOs that ranged from 115% to 130% of the Incentive Pay Objectives for the NEOs.
Another indicator of our pay-for-performance culture is the relationship of the NEOs' total direct compensation to TSR. Over the past five years, on average, 88% of the CEO's total direct compensation is performance-based, and 74% is tied to the performance of Edwards' stock. Our stock price has increased 366% over the past five years, 94% over the past three years, and 36% over the past year. 
We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our NEO compensation programs as described in the Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our NEOs' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described in the Proxy Statement. 
Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the NEOs, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure included in the Proxy Statement."

     PROPOSAL 2 – ADVISORY VOTE TO  APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION   
[END TABLE]
The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board, and it will not be construed as overriding a decision by the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board, or creating or implying any additional fiduciary duty. However, the Board and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and will consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. Our current policy is to provide our stockholders with an opportunity to approve the compensation of the NEOs each year at the annual meeting. It is expected that the next such vote will occur at the 2020 annual meeting. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NEOS, AS DESCRIBED IN THE PROXY STATEMENT.

AUDIT MATTERS 
PROPOSAL 3 – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Representatives of PwC are expected to attend the Annual Meeting and will be available to respond to appropriate questions and to make a statement if they so desire. In addition to the annual audit services, PwC performs certain non-audit services for us. Although we are not required to seek stockholder approval of the appointment of PwC, the Board believes that it is consistent with good corporate governance practices to ask stockholders to ratify the appointment. If the appointment is not ratified, the Audit Committee will explore the reasons for stockholder rejection and will reconsider the appointment. In addition, even if stockholders ratify the Audit Committee's appointment of PwC, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may still appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm if it believes that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. 
PwC has been our independent registered public accounting firm since 1999, serving in that capacity and reporting on our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting continuously through the 2018 fiscal year. 
In considering whether to reappoint PwC, the Audit Committee evaluated PwC's performance and considered the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PwC's global capabilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the results of the Company's annual assessment of PwC's performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PwC's and the audit engagement team's independence;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the quality, timeliness, and candor of PwC's communications with the Audit Committee and management;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the appropriateness of PwC's fees;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PwC's tenure as our independent registered public accounting firm;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the controls and processes in place that help ensure PwC's continued independence; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the provision of non-audit services provided by PwC to the Company  during 2018 was compatible with their independence.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee maintains oversight over PwC by holding regular private sessions with PwC, performing annual evaluations, and being directly involved in the selection of new lead audit partners pursuant to SEC rules requiring that a new lead audit partner be designated in the normal course every five years to bring a fresh perspective to the audit engagement. A new partner was so designated in advance of the 2015 audit. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM. 
Fees Paid to Principal Accountants.    During 2018 and 2017, PwC was retained to provide services in the following categories and amounts (in millions): 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Audit Fees.    Amounts paid under "Audit Fees" include aggregate fees for the audit of our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, the three quarterly reviews of the Company's reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings, and services in connection with statutory and regulatory filings. 
Audit-Related Fees.    Amounts paid under "Audit-Related Fees" were for miscellaneous audit and consulting services.

[END TABLE]
Tax Fees.    Amounts paid under "Tax Fees" in 2018 were for tax compliance ($0.7) million and other tax services ($0.6) million, and in 2017 were for tax compliance ($0.9) million and other tax services ($0.7) million. 
All Other Fees.    There were immaterial fees paid under "All Other Fees" in 2018 and 2017. 
Pre-Approval of Services.    The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm in order to assure that the provision of such services does not impair the auditor's independence. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee at least annually reviews and provides general pre-approval for the services that may be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm; the term of the general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of approval, unless the Audit Committee specifically provides for a different period. If the Audit Committee has not provided general pre-approval, then the type of service requires specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee does not delegate to management its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm, but may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The annual audit services, engagement terms, and fees are subject to the specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. One hundred percent (100%) of audit and non-audit services performed by PwC in 2018 and 2017 were approved by the Audit Committee. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee comprises the three directors named below, each of whom meets the enhanced independence standards for Audit Committee members as set forth in applicable rules of the NYSE and the SEC. The Board has designated each member of the Audit Committee as an "audit committee financial expert" under applicable rules of SEC. Additional information regarding the Audit Committee, its responsibilities and meetings are described above in the section entitled "Board of Directors Matters – Corporate Governance Policies and Practices – Committees of the Board." 
Management is responsible for our internal controls, financial reporting process and compliance with laws, regulations and ethical business practices. Our independent registered public accounting firm, PwC, is responsible for performing an independent audit of our annual consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, as well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. 
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee has discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees." The Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm under applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence. 
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, and relying thereon, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the financial statements referred to above be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for filing with the SEC. 
The Audit Committee: 
Leslie S. Heisz (Chair) 
Kieran T. Gallahue 
Wesley W. von Schack 
This report shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the SEC, or incorporated by reference in any document so filed, whether made before or after the date hereof, except to the extent we specifically request that it be treated as soliciting material or it is specifically incorporated by reference therein.

OTHER MATTERS AND BUSINESS 
PROPOSAL 4 – STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING INDEPENDENT CHAIR POLICY 
A stockholder has submitted the proposal and supporting statement set forth below in accordance with the rules of the SEC. 
The Board and the Company disclaim any responsibility for its content. We will furnish, orally or in writing as requested, the name, address and claimed share ownership of the stockholder that submitted this proposal promptly upon oral or written request to the Company's Corporate Secretary. 
Proposal 4 – Independent Board Chairman 
Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as a policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next Chief Executive Officer transition, implemented so it does not violate any existing agreement. 
If the Board determines that a Chairman, who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chairman who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above. 
This proposal topic won 50%-plus support at 5 major U.S. companies in 2013 including 73%-support at Netflix. These 5 majority votes would have been still higher if all shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice. 
This proposal is more important to Edwards Lifesciences shareholders because we do not have a Lead Director. We have a presiding director which is like having a passive Lead Director. It is important to the succession planning efforts of our Board of Directors include a transition to an independent Board Chairman. 
An independent Chairman is best positioned to build up the oversight capabilities of our directors while our CEO addresses the challenging day-to-day issues facing the company. The roles of Chairman and CEO are fundamentally different and should be held by 2 directors, a CEO and a Chairman who is completely independent. 
Please vote yes: 
Independent Board Chairman – Proposal 4 
The Board has carefully considered the above stockholder proposal and believes that it is unnecessary and not in the best interests of stockholders. The Board recommends that stockholders vote "AGAINST" this proposal for the following reasons: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's current leadership structure and corporate governance practices provide strong  independent oversight and have been expanded in response to stockholder feedback.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board's independent leadership structure is evaluated on a regular basis to ensure that  the approach continues to provide effective independent oversight of the Company and serves the best interests of stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The independent directors should have the flexibility to determine whether to separate or combine  the Chairman and CEO roles in light of the circumstances at the time and not be restricted to a single rigid approach.  
[END TABLE]
The Company's current leadership structure and corporate governance practices provide strong independent oversight and have been expanded in response to stockholder feedback. 
Our Board firmly believes it is essential to have an active, engaged and independent Board, and maintains strong governance practices to ensure that it continues to provide effective independent oversight and serves the best interests of the Company's stockholders.

   OTHER MATTERS AND  BUSINESS     
[END TABLE]
Our Governance Guidelines provide that if our Chairman is not independent, our independent directors will annually select an independent director to serve as Lead Independent Director. Wesley von Schack currently serves as Lead Independent Director and formerly served as our Presiding Director. Based on feedback received from our stockholders through our active engagement program, the Board recently expanded the role of the Presiding Director position and, in light of the additional responsibilities, renamed the position Lead Independent Director. The new Lead Independent Director has a number of key duties and responsibilities including the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• serving as the principal liaison between the independent members of the Board and the Chairman and other members of  management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approving Board meeting agendas and relevant information provided to the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approving Board meeting schedules to ensure there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• coordinating the activities of the independent directors, including calling meetings of the independent directors as  necessary and appropriate to address their responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• providing feedback to management from the Board's executive sessions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• providing advice, counsel and support to the Chairman; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• consulting and directly communicating with major stockholders, as appropriate, including participation in the  Company's stockholder outreach efforts.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to having a Lead Independent Director, all members of our Board are independent directors, other than our CEO Michael Mussallem. Our Board's independent oversight is further enhanced by the standing Board committees, which are composed entirely of independent directors. The directors bring a broad range of leadership experience to the boardroom and thoughtfully contribute to the discussions involved in overseeing the affairs of the Company. All directors are very engaged in their responsibilities, freely express their views, and are open to the opinions expressed by other directors. 
The Board adheres to governance practices that promote the active, independent oversight of the Company. For example, the independent directors regularly meet in executive session at all in-person Board and committee meetings, led by the Lead Independent Director during which they discuss matters relating to the Company and the functioning of the Board. In addition, we have adopted a number of other governance practices in response to stockholder feedback, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• adopting proxy access;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reducing the ownership threshold for stockholders to call special meetings;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• de-classifying the Board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• adopting majority voting in uncontested director elections.  
[END TABLE]
The Board's independent leadership structure is evaluated on a regular basis to ensure that the approach continues to provide effective independent oversight of the Company and serves the best interests of stockholders. 
The independent directors evaluate the Board's leadership structure on a regular basis. They incorporate stockholder feedback into their deliberations on this topic. Each year, the Lead Independent Director's performance is assessed. As part of this review, the Compensation Committee evaluates the criteria for nominees for the Lead Independent Director role and assesses any needed changes. In selecting the Lead Independent Director, the Committee considers relevant leadership, operational and corporate governance experience, relationships with other Board members and external commitments. In addition, the Lead Independent Director is expected to have a thorough understanding of the Company's business operations and history. 
At this time, our Board continues to believe that the current leadership structure is effective for our Company and in the best interests of our stockholders. We maintain a Lead Independent Director with robust and clearly defined responsibilities to provide strong independent oversight. Our Chairman provides the Company and the Board with strong leadership and continuity of expertise in the Company's business operations and corporate governance practices. Given our Chairman's extensive institutional knowledge, he is in the best position to facilitate the flow of communications and business information between Board members and between the Board and management.

Our Board also believes that our current leadership structure is effective because it fosters a constructive and cooperative relationship between the independent directors and management that allows our Board to most effectively carry out its oversight duties. The independent directors regularly engage with members of management as a part of its succession planning and risk oversight responsibilities. Our independent directors spend time with our company leaders, including executive officers, business group leaders and functional leaders in a variety of formats. In addition, directors have freedom to access all employees and have made site visits to meet local management. 
The independent directors should have the flexibility to determine whether to separate or combine the Chairman and CEO roles in light of the circumstances at the time and not be restricted to a single rigid approach. 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board can and will change its leadership structure if it determines that doing so is appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders at any given time. We believe it is in the stockholders' best interests to allow the Board this flexibility rather than be limited to the rigid requirements of the stockholder proposal. It is under this model that the Company has experienced strong financial and operational growth. As discussed above (see "Proposal 1 – Election of Directors"), our Board strives to maintain a highly independent, balanced, and diverse set of directors with the collective skills, expertise, and experience to ensure proper oversight of the Company. Accordingly, our Board is best positioned to evaluate and consider its leadership structure as the Company's circumstances evolve over time. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "AGAINST" THIS PROPOSAL REGARDING INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN.

APPENDIX A 
EDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION 
Non-GAAP Financial Information 
We report our financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). We also use non-GAAP historical financial measures. The Company uses the term "adjusted sales" or "underlying growth rate" when referring to non-GAAP sales information, which excludes foreign exchange fluctuations, the conversion to a consignment inventory system for surgical heart valves ("SHV"), and the positive impact of transcatheter heart valve therapy ("THVT") stocking sales in Germany and the negative impact of de-stocking. 
Fluctuations in exchange rates impact the comparative results and sales growth rates of the Company's underlying business. Management believes that excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations from its sales growth provides investors a more useful comparison to historical financial results. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations has been detailed in the "Reconciliation of Sales" table below. 
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making, forecasting future results, and evaluating current performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations by investors that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and facilitate comparability to historical periods. 
Non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP historical financial measure used herein to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided in the table below. 
The items described below are adjustments to the GAAP financial results in the reconciliation that follows: 
SHV Consignment Conversion.    In the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2018, the Company recorded a sales return reserve of $34.7 million, $28.4 million, $14.4 million, and $5.0 million respectively, related to its conversion to a consignment inventory system for surgical heart valves. 
THVT Germany Stocking Sales.    In the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded $61.8 million in net stocking sales to customers in Germany, as these customers elected to purchase additional inventory in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from intellectual property litigation. In the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, these customers consumed on a net basis $22.5 million, $17.0 million, and $20.9 million respectively, of their stocking inventory. In the first quarter of 2018, these customers consumed on a net basis $8.0 million of their stocking inventory.
