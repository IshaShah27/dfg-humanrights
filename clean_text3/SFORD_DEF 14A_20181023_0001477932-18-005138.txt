Common Stock 
The shares of our common stock presently outstanding, and any shares of our common stock issues upon exercise of stock options and/or common stock purchase warrants, will be fully paid and non-assessable. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share owned on all matters voted upon by shareholders, and a majority vote is required for all actions to be taken by shareholders. In the event we liquidate, dissolve or wind-up our operations, the holders of the common stock are entitled to share equally and ratably in our assets, if any, remaining after the payment of all our debts and liabilities and the liquidation preference of any shares of preferred stock that may then be outstanding. The common stock has no preemptive rights, no cumulative voting rights, and no redemption, sinking fund, or conversion provisions. Since the holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, holders of more than 50% of the outstanding shares can elect all of our Directors, and the holders of the remaining shares by themselves cannot elect any Directors. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds legally available for such purpose, subject to the dividend and liquidation rights of any preferred stock that may then be outstanding. 
Each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders.
Preferred Stock
On October 21, 2010, we amended our Articles of Incorporation in New Jersey to authorize 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.10. The designations, rights, and preferences of such preferred stock are to be determined by the Board of Directors. On November 15, 2010, we changed our domicile from the state of New Jersey to the state of Wyoming.
In addition to the 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized, on January 10, 2011, 100 shares of preferred stock were designated as Series A Preferred Stock and 100,000,000 shares were designated as Series B Preferred Stock. The bylaws under the Wyoming Incorporation were amended to reflect the rights and preferences of each additional new designation.
The Series A Preferred Stock collectively has voting rights equal to eighty percent of the total current issued and outstanding shares of common stock. If at least one share of Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, the aggregate shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have voting rights equal to the number of shares of common stock equal to four times the sum of the total number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding, plus the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock (or other designated preferred stock) which are issued and outstanding. In February 2011, we issued three shares of non-convertible Series A preferred stock valued at $329,000 per share, or $987,000 in aggregate, for voting purposes only, to the three members of our management team at one share each. The issued and outstanding shares of the Series A preferred stock have voting rights equal to eighty percent of the total issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. This effectively provided them, upon retention of their Series A Preferred Stock, voting control on matters presented to our shareholders. Mark Kay, along with Ramarao Pemmaraju and George Waller, has irrevocably waived any conversion rights.
The Series B Preferred Stock have preferential liquidation rights in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, such liquidation rights to be paid from our assets not delegated to parties with greater priority at $1.00 per share or, in the event an aggregate subscription by a single subscriber of the Series B Preferred Stock is greater than $100,000,000, $0.997 per share. The Series B Preferred Stock shall be convertible to a number of shares of common stock equal to the price of the Series B Preferred Stock divided by the par value of the Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.10. The Series B Preferred Stock has ten votes on matters presented to our shareholders for one share of Series B Preferred Stock held.

Committees
We have two committees: the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. At this time, there are no members of either Committee and the Board of Directors performs the acts of the Committees. None of our current directors are deemed "independent" directors as that term is used by the national stock exchanges or have the requisite public company accounting background or expertise to be considered an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined under Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
It is anticipated that the principal functions of the Audit Committee will be to recommend the annual appointment of our auditors, the scope of the audit and the results of their examination, to review and approve any material accounting policy changes affecting our operating results and to review our internal control procedures.
It is anticipated that the Compensation Committee will develop a Company-wide program covering all employees and that the goals of such program will be to attract, maintain, and motivate our employees. It is further anticipated that one of the aspects of the program will be to link an employee's compensation to his or her performance, and that the grant of stock options or other awards related to the price of the common shares will be used in order to make an employee's compensation consistent with shareholders' gains. It is expected that salaries will be set competitively relative to the technology development industry and that individual experience and performance will be considered in setting salaries.
At present, executive and director compensation matters are determined by a majority vote of the board of directors.
We do not have a nominating committee. Historically our entire Board has selected nominees for election as directors. The Board believes this process has worked well thus far particularly since it has been the Board's practice to require unanimity of Board members with respect to the selection of director nominees. In determining whether to elect a director or to nominate any person for election by our stockholders, the Board assesses the appropriate size of the Board of Directors, consistent with our bylaws, and whether any vacancies on the Board are expected due to retirement or otherwise. If vacancies are anticipated, or otherwise arise, the Board will consider various potential candidates to fill each vacancy. Candidates may come to the attention of the Board through a variety of sources, including from current members of the Board, stockholders, or other persons. The Board of Directors has not yet had the occasion to, but will, consider properly submitted proposed nominations by stockholders who are not our directors, officers, or employees on the same basis as candidates proposed by any other person.
Code of Ethics.
We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. Our code of ethics contains standards that are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
