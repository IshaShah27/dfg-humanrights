Stock options granted to Mr. Michel have a strike price of $28.94 (the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant), vest ratably on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant (June 18, 2018), and expire ten years from the date of grant.  
 (2)   RSUs vest in full on the third anniversary of the date of grant.   
 (3)   Value of PSUs issued at target. PSUs vest in a range of 0-150% of target on the third anniversary of the date of grant. The number of shares that vest will be determined by performance against pre-set three-year performance targets for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, each weighted 50%. Vesting amounts may be adjusted upward or downward by up to 10% based upon the Company's total shareholder return over the same period relative to the Russell 3000 Index. In no event, however, will the number of PSUs that vest exceed 150% of target.   
 (4)   All awards granted to Mr. Mallard were cancelled upon his departure from the Company in November 2018.
