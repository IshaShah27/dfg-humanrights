WELLS FARGO MULTI-SECTOR INCOME FUND PROXY STATEMENT

If you wish to attend the Meeting in person, please call the Fund's             proxy solicitor, Computershare Fund Services, at (866) 434-5625 for instructions.

IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON FEBRUARY 11, 2019.
You may obtain a copy of this proxy statement, the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the proxy card and                the Annual Report for the Fund for the period ended October 31, 2018 without charge by visiting the website indicated on your proxy card.
 Proxy Solicitation 
The Board intends to bring before the Meeting the matter set forth in the accompanying notice. Holders of common shares ("Shares")             of the Fund ("Shareholders") are being asked to vote for the re-election of Messrs. Timothy Penny and James Polisson and Ms.             Pamela Wheelock as Trustees. You can vote by returning your properly executed proxy card in the envelope provided or you may             vote by telephone or Internet by following the instructions at the end of this proxy statement. When you complete and sign             your proxy card, the proxies named will vote on your behalf at the Meeting (or any adjournments thereof) exactly as you have             indicated. If you return a signed proxy card but no choice is specified, your Shares will be voted FOR the election of each             of the nominees named in the enclosed proxy card. If any other matters are properly presented at the Meeting for action, the             persons named as proxies will vote in accordance with the views of management of the Fund. Shareholders, including a broker             who may hold Shares on your behalf, may revoke a proxy prior to the Meeting by giving timely written notice of such revocation             to the Fund at the address above, by submitting a subsequent proxy timely and in accordance with the methods prescribed by             this proxy statement, or by attending the Meeting and voting in person.
The Fund's Third Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the "Declaration") provides that the holders of             thirty-three and a third percent (33 1/3%) of the Shares issued and outstanding, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute             a quorum for the transaction of business at the Meeting. With regard to the election of Trustees, votes may be cast FOR all             nominees or votes may be WITHHELD either with respect to all of the nominees or any individual nominee. Abstentions, broker             non-votes (i.e., Shares held by brokers or nominee entities as to which (i) instructions have not been received from the beneficial             owners or other persons entitled to vote and (ii) the broker or nominee entity does not have discretionary voting power on             a particular matter), and votes that are withheld will count for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present but will             have no effect with respect to the election of Trustees.
The vote of a plurality of the votes cast by Shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting and entitled             to vote is required for the election of Trustees.
In the event a quorum is not present at the Meeting or a quorum is present but sufficient votes to approve a proposal are             not received, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitation             of proxies as to a proposal. The persons named as proxies will vote in favor of an adjournment those votes that may be voted             in favor of the proposal. The persons named as proxies will vote against any such adjournment those votes marked as withheld.             The Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the Shares             represented at the Meeting, either in person or by proxy; or by the chair of the Meeting, in his or her discretion. Abstentions             and broker non-votes will not be voted on a motion to adjourn.
Any proposal for which sufficient favorable votes have been received by the time of the Meeting may be acted upon and considered             final regardless of whether the Meeting is adjourned to permit additional solicitation with respect to any other proposal.             In certain circumstances in which the Fund has received sufficient votes to approve a matter being recommended for approval             by the Board, the Fund may request that brokers and nominee entities, in their discretion, withhold or withdraw submission             of broker non-votes in order to avoid the need for solicitation of additional votes in favor of the proposal.
The Fund will bear the costs typically associated with the election of Trustees. Solicitation may be undertaken by mail, telephone,             facsimile and personal contact. The Fund has engaged Computershare Fund Services to solicit proxies from brokers, banks, other             institutional holders and individual Shareholders for a fee of approximately $3,418, plus expenses. This fee will be borne             by the Fund.
 Voting Securities and Principal Holders Thereof 
Shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2018 are entitled to vote at the Meeting or any adjournment thereof to the extent set forth in this proxy statement. As of December 7, 2018, the Fund had outstanding 31,451,494 Shares. Each Share is entitled to one vote for each dollar, and a fractional vote for each fraction of a dollar as to any             matter on which the Share is entitled to vote.
Listed below are entities that have made filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") disclosing beneficial             ownership of 5% or more of the outstanding Shares of the Fund as of December 7, 2018. The filings are available at the SEC's website (www.sec.gov).

[END TABLE]
As of December 7, 2018, the officers and Trustees of the Fund as a group beneficially owned in the aggregate less than 1% of the Shares of the Fund             and, together with their immediate family members, less than 1% of the outstanding securities of Wells Fargo & Company ("Wells             Fargo"), the parent company of Wells Fargo Funds Management, LLC ("Funds Management"), the Fund's investment adviser. Additionally, the             officers and Trustees of the Fund as a group beneficially owned in the aggregate less than 1% of the outstanding securities             of the Fund's sub-advisers, Wells Capital Management Incorporated ("Wells Capital") and First International Advisors, LLC             ("FIA").
 I. ELECTION OF TRUSTEES (PROPOSAL 1) 
The Board has nominated three persons for election to the Fund's Board. Each of these nominees currently serves on the Fund's Board and is thus sometimes             referred to as a "nominee Trustee". In accordance with the Declaration, the Trustees have been divided into three classes             (each a "Class"): Class I, Class II and Class III. The Trustees in each Class serve until the annual meeting for the year             indicated: Class I, 2020, Class II, 2021 and Class III, 2022 or, if later, until their respective successors are elected and             qualified. At each subsequent annual meeting, the persons elected to the Class of Trustees whose terms are expiring will generally             be nominated for a three-year term. Staggered terms are adopted by many closed-end fund boards and can have the effect of             promoting greater stability and long-term perspective. Staggered terms also have the effect of limiting the ability of other             entities or persons to acquire control of a board by delaying replacement of a majority of the board. If any nominee Trustee             for any reason becomes unable to serve or is unwilling to serve, the persons named as proxies in the enclosed proxy card,             in consultation with the Board, will vote for the election of such other person or persons as they may consider qualified.             Each of the three nominee Trustees has agreed to continue to serve as a Trustee on the Board if elected by Shareholders. The             nominee Trustees for Class III are expected to serve the full term until the 2022 annual meeting.
The Board of the Fund proposes the following nominee Trustees for election at the Meeting:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Trustee     Class     Expiration of Term if Elected   
  Timothy Penny     Class III    20221  
  James Polisson     Class III    20221  
  Pamela Wheelock     Class III    20221  
 1     Or, if later, until their respective successors are elected and qualified.   
[END TABLE]
You cannot vote by proxy for anyone other than the three nominee Trustees currently proposed to serve on the Board.

 The Board of Trustees and Its Leadership Structure 
Overall responsibility for oversight of the Fund rests with the Board. The Board has engaged Funds Management to manage the             Fund on a day-to day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing Funds Management and other service providers in the operation             of the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), applicable provisions             of Delaware law, other applicable laws and the Declaration.
The Board is currently composed of ten members, each of whom is not an "interested person" of the Fund, as defined in the             1940 Act (an "Independent Trustee"). The Board currently conducts regular in-person meetings five times a year. In addition,             the Board may hold special in-person or telephonic meetings or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that             may arise or require action between regular meetings.
The Independent Trustees have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight responsibilities.             The Board has appointed an Independent Trustee to serve in the role of Chairman. The Chairman's role is to preside at all             meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with respect to governance-related matters with service providers, officers,             attorneys, and other Trustees generally between meetings. The Chairman may also perform such other functions as may be delegated             by the Board from time to time. Timothy Penny serves as Chairman of the Board. In order to assist the Chairman in maintaining             effective communications with the other Trustees and Funds Management, the Board has appointed a Chair Liaison to work with             the Chairman to coordinate Trustee communications and to help coordinate timely responses to Trustee inquiries relating to             board governance and fiduciary matters. The Chair Liaison serves for a one-year term, which may be extended with the approval             of the Board. Ms. Freeman serves as Chair Liaison. Except for any duties specified herein or pursuant to the Declaration,             the designation of Chairman or Chair Liaison does not impose on such Independent Trustee any duties, obligations or liability             that are greater than the duties, obligations or liability imposed on such person as a member of the Board generally.
The Board also has established a Nominating and Governance Committee, an Audit Committee and a Valuation Committee to assist             the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Fund and from time to time may establish informal             working groups to review and address the policies and practices of the Fund with respect to certain specified matters. Additionally,             the Board has established an investment team to review in detail the performance of the Fund, to meet with portfolio managers,             and to report back to the full Board. The Board occasionally engages independent consultants to assist it in evaluating initiatives             or proposals. The Board believes that the Board's current leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board             to exercise informed and independent judgment over matters under its purview, and it allocates areas of responsibility among             committees of Trustees and the full Board in a manner that enhances effective oversight. The leadership structure of the Board             may be changed, at any time and in the discretion of the Board, including in response to changes in circumstances or the characteristics             of the Fund.
As noted above, the Board has established a standing Nominating and Governance Committee, a standing Audit Committee and a             standing Valuation Committee to assist the Board in the oversight and direction of the business and affairs of the Fund. The             Nominating and Governance Committee and Audit Committee operate pursuant to charters approved by the Board. The Valuation             Committee's responsibilities are set forth in Valuation Procedures approved by the Board. Each Independent Trustee is a member             of the Fund's Nominating and Governance Committee, Audit Committee and Valuation Committee.
Nominating and Governance Committee. Except with respect to any trustee nomination made by an eligible Shareholder or Shareholder group as permitted by applicable             law and applicable provisions of the Declaration and By-Laws of the Fund, the Nominating and Governance Committee shall make             all nominations for membership on the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee shall evaluate each candidate's qualifications             for Board membership and his or her independence from the Fund's investment adviser and sub-adviser and, as it deems appropriate,             other principal service providers. Olivia Mitchell serves as the Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee.
The Nominating and Governance Committee has adopted procedures by which a Shareholder may properly submit a nominee recommendation             for the Nominating and Governance Committee's consideration, which are set forth in Appendix A to the Fund's Nominating and             Governance Committee Charter. The Shareholder must submit any such recommendation (a "Shareholder Recommendation") in writing             to the Fund, to the attention of the Fund's Secretary, at the address of the principal executive office of the Fund. The Nominating             and Governance Committee has full discretion to reject candidates recommended by Shareholders, and there is no assurance that             any such person properly recommended and considered by the Nominating and Governance Committee will be nominated for election             to the Board. For more information relating to Shareholder recommendations, please see the Fund's Nominating and Governance             Committee Charter attached as Exhibit A.
The Nominating and Governance Committee may from time-to-time propose nominations of one or more individuals to serve as members             of an "advisory board," as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(1) of the 1940 Act.
Valuation Committee. The Board has delegated to the Valuation Committee the authority to take any action regarding the valuation of portfolio             securities that the Valuation Committee deems necessary or appropriate, including determining the fair value of securities             between regularly scheduled Board meetings in instances where that determination has not otherwise been delegated to the valuation             team ("Management Valuation Team") of Funds Management. The Board considers for ratification at each quarterly meeting any             valuation actions taken during the previous quarter by the Valuation Committee or by the Management Valuation Team other than             pursuant to Board-approved methodologies. Any one member of the Valuation Committee may constitute a quorum for a meeting             of the committee.
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee oversees the Fund's accounting and financial reporting policies, including their internal controls over             financial reporting; oversees the quality and objectivity of the Fund's financial statements and the independent audit thereof;             and interacts with the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm on behalf of the full Board and with appropriate             officers of the Fund. Judith M. Johnson serves as the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The Board and individual committees met the following number of times during the most recently completed fiscal year:

The Board of Trustees and Risk Oversight
The Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational, and valuation risks, among others.             Day-to-day risk management functions are subsumed within the responsibilities of Funds Management, the sub-advisers and other             service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), who carry out the Fund's investment management and business affairs.             Each of Funds Management, the sub-advisers and other service providers have their own, independent interest in risk management,             and their policies and methods of carrying out risk management functions will depend, in part, on their individual priorities,             resources and controls.
Risk oversight forms part of the Board's general oversight of the Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and Committee             activities. The Board recognizes that it is not possible to identify all of the risks that may affect the Fund or to develop             processes and controls to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects. As part of its regular oversight of the Fund,             the Board, directly or through a Committee, interacts with and reviews reports from, among others, Funds Management, sub-advisers,             the Chief Compliance Officer of the Fund, the independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund, and internal auditors             for Funds Management or its affiliates, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by the Fund and relevant risk functions. The             Board, with the assistance of its investment teams, reviews investment policies and risks in connection with its review of             the Fund's performance. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who oversees the implementation and testing of             the Fund's compliance program and reports to the Board regarding compliance matters for the Fund and its principal service             providers. In addition, as part of the Board's periodic review of the Fund's advisory, sub-advisory and other service provider             agreements, the Board may consider risk management aspects of their operations and the functions for which they are responsible.             With respect to valuation, the Board oversees a management valuation team comprised of officers of Funds Management, has approved             and periodically reviews valuation policies applicable to valuing the Fund shares and has established a valuation committee             of Trustees. The Board may, at any time and in its discretion, change the manner in which it conducts its risk oversight role.
Qualifications of Trustees
The Declaration does not set forth any specific qualifications to serve as a Trustee. The Charter and the Statement of Governance             Principles of the Nominating and Governance Committee also do not set forth any specific qualifications, but do set forth             certain factors that the Nominating and Governance Committee may take into account in considering Trustee candidates and a             process for evaluating potential conflicts of interest, which identifies certain disqualifying conflicts.
Among the attributes or skills common to all Trustees are their ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss             information provided to them, to interact effectively with the other Trustees, Funds Management, the Fund's sub-advisers,             other service providers, counsel and the independent registered public accounting firm, and to exercise effective and independent             business judgment in the performance of their duties as Trustees. Each Trustee's ability to perform his or her duties effectively             has been attained through the Trustee's business, consulting, public service, professional and/or academic positions and through             experience from service as a board member of the Fund and the other funds in the Fund Complex (and/or in other capacities,             including for any predecessor funds), other registered investment companies, public companies, and/or non-profit entities             or other organizations. Each Trustee's ability to perform his or her duties effectively also has been enhanced by his or her             educational background, professional training, and/or other life experiences. The specific experience, qualifications, attributes             and/or skills that led to the conclusion that a Trustee should serve as a Trustee of the Fund are as set forth below.

Consideration of Diversity by the Nominating and Governance Committee
The Nominating and Governance Committee takes the overall diversity of the Board into account when considering and evaluating             nominees for Trustee. While the Nominating and Governance Committee has not adopted a specific policy on diversity or a particular             definition of diversity, when considering nominees, the Nominating and Governance Committee generally considers the manner             in which each nominee's professional experience, background, skills in matters that are relevant to the oversight of the funds             (e.g., investment management, distribution, accounting, trading, compliance, legal), and general leadership experience are             complementary to the existing Trustees' attributes.
Nominating and Governance Committee
The members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are "independent" as defined in the NYSE American Exchange's listing standards. The Board has adopted a written Nominating and Governance Committee Charter which is attached to this             proxy statement as Exhibit A. The Nominating and Governance Committee Charter describes the Nominating and Governance Committee             functions. The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews the Nominating and Governance Committee Charter at least annually             and may recommend changes to the Board.
The Board has approved a policy pursuant to which the Board may consider nominees for election as Trustees, which is described             further in the Nominating and Governance Committee Charter. The policy states the minimum nominee qualifications, the process             for identifying and evaluating trustee nominees and the process for considering nominees recommended by Shareholders.
 Communications with Board Members 
The Board has approved a policy for communications with Board members. Any Shareholder who wishes to send a communication             to the Board should send the communication to the Wells Fargo Multi-Sector Income Fund Board of Trustees, 525 Market Street, 12th Floor, San Francisco, California 94105. If a Shareholder wishes to send a communication             directly to an individual Trustee or to a committee of the Fund's Board, the communication should be specifically addressed             to such individual Trustee or committee and sent to the above address.
 Trustee Attendance Policy at Annual Shareholder Meetings 
Funds that are listed on the NYSE American Exchange are required each year to hold an Annual Meeting of Shareholders. It is the policy of the Fund to encourage at least one             Trustee to attend each such Annual Meeting of Shareholders either in person, by video conference, or by teleconference. Ms.             Jane A. Freeman and Messrs. Isaiah Harris, Jr. and James G. Polisson attended the previous year's Annual Meeting of Shareholders             telephonically.

 Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Fund's Trustees, principal executive officers and certain other persons ("Reporting             Entities") to file reports regarding ownership of, and transactions in, the Fund's securities with the SEC. Copies of the             required filings must also be furnished to the Fund. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund believes that all reports             required to be filed by the Reporting Entities were filed on a timely basis. For the prior fiscal year, Ms. Jane Freeman,             a Trustee of the Fund, completed a transaction involving common shares of the Fund on May 16, 2017 and failed to file a Form             4 before the end of the second business day following the day on which the transaction was executed. A Form 5 was filed on             January 17, 2018 to report the transaction.
Forms 3, 4, and 5 for the officers and Trustees of the Fund may be accessed through the Wells Fargo Funds website at www.wellsfargofunds.com.

KPMG LLP ("KPMG"), Two Financial Center, 60 South Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, has been approved by the Trustees of             the Fund as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Fund for the current fiscal year ending October 31, 2018.
The Audit Committee of the Board unanimously recommended the selection of KPMG, and the Board unanimously approved such selection,             at meetings held on November 9, 2018.
The Fund's Audit Committee has established and adopted policies and procedures whereby the Audit Committee Chairperson is             authorized to pre-approve: (1) audit services to the Fund; (2) non-audit tax or compliance consulting or training services             provided to the Fund by its independent registered accounting firm if the fees for any particular engagement are not anticipated             to exceed a specified dollar amount; and (3) non-audit tax or compliance consulting or training services provided by the independent             registered public accounting firm to the Fund's investment adviser and its adviser affiliates (where pre-approval is required             because the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund) if the fee for any particular             engagement is not anticipated to exceed a specified dollar amount. For any pre-approval sought from the Chairperson, the adviser             shall prepare a brief description of the proposed services. If the Chairperson approves such service, he or she shall sign             the statement prepared by the adviser, and such written statement shall be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next             regularly scheduled meeting.
A representative of KPMG, if requested in advance by any Shareholder, will be present via telephone at the Meeting to respond             to appropriate questions from Shareholders and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she chooses to do so.             Absent such a Shareholder request, it is not expected that such representative will be present at the Meeting.
In approving the selection of KPMG for the Fund, the Audit Committee considered, in addition to other practices and requirements             relating to the selection of the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, whether any services performed by KPMG             for the Fund and the investment adviser and for certain related parties for which KPMG received non-audit fees are compatible             with maintaining the independence of KPMG as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm.
On December 20, 2018, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Fund's audited financial statements for             the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with KPMG the matters required to be             discussed by Statements on Auditing Standards, No. 114, Communication with Audit Committees. The Audit Committee has received             the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding certain             communications, and has discussed with KPMG its independence. Based on these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee             recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the annual report to Shareholders for the previous             fiscal year for filing with the SEC.
The following table presents fees billed for professional audit services rendered by KPMG for the audit of the Fund's annual             financial statements for the past two fiscal years and for fees billed for other services rendered by KPMG to the Fund. There             were no fees paid to KPMG during the fiscal years where the de minimis exception was used.

The Board has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee which is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit B. The             Audit Committee reviews the charter at least annually and may recommend changes to the Board.
 Other Business 
As of the date of this proxy statement, neither the Fund's officers nor Funds Management are aware of any other business to             come before the Meeting other than as set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders. If any other business is             properly brought before the Meeting or any adjournment thereof, the persons named as proxies in the enclosed proxy card will             vote in accordance with the views of management of the Fund.
 Required Vote for Proposal   
The vote of a plurality of the votes cast by Shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting is required             for the election of trustees.
 Notice 
A Certificate of Trust in respect of the Fund is on file with the Secretary of the State of Delaware. As provided in the Declaration,             the obligations of any instrument made or issued by any Trustee or Trustees or by any officer or officers of the Fund are             not binding upon any of them or the Shareholders individually, but are binding only upon the assets and property of the Fund.
 Shareholder Proposals 
Proposals intended to be presented by a Shareholder at the annual meeting of Shareholders to be held in 2020 must be received             by the Fund's Secretary at the Fund's principal executive office by September 3, 2019 in order to be considered for inclusion             in the Fund's proxy statement and proxy card relating to that meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. If a             Shareholder wishes to present a proposal at the annual meeting of Shareholders to be held in 2020 without having the proposal             included in the Fund's proxy statement, including a proposal to nominate any persons for election to the Board, such proposal             must be delivered to the Fund's Secretary at the Fund's principal executive office not earlier than the close of business             on September 3, 2019 and not later than the close of business on October 2, 2019. Timely receipt or delivery of a proposal             does not necessarily mean that such proposal will be included in the Fund's proxy statement or presented at the meeting, given             that such inclusion and presentation are subject to various conditions and requirements, including those specified by applicable             law and by the Fund's governing documents. The Chair of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge a nomination or other proposal             by a Shareholder that is not made in the manner described above.
THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE FUND UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF EACH NOMINEE AS A TRUSTEE.

Exhibit A
WELLS FARGO FUNDS TRUST  WELLS FARGO MASTER TRUST  WELLS FARGO VARIABLE TRUST  WELLS FARGO GLOBAL DIVIDEND OPPORTUNITY FUND  WELLS FARGO INCOME OPPORTUNITIES FUND  WELLS FARGO MULTI-SECTOR INCOME FUND  WELLS FARGO UTILITIES AND HIGH INCOME FUND CHARTER OF THE NOMINATING AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEES
Nominating and Governance Committee Membership
The Nominating and Governance Committee of each Trust (the "Committee") shall be composed only of Trustees who are not "interested             persons" of the Trusts, or of any investment adviser or principal underwriter of the Trusts or any series thereof (a "Fund"),             as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Independent Trustees").
Board Nominations
1. Except with respect to any trustee nomination made by an eligible shareholder or shareholder group as permitted by applicable             law (and, with respect to each Trust that is a registered closed-end management investment company ("Closed-End Fund"), in             accordance with the By-Laws of such Closed-End Fund), the Committee shall make all nominations for membership on the Board             of Trustees of each Trust. The Committee shall evaluate each candidate's qualifications for Board membership and his or her             independence from the Funds' investment adviser(s) and principal underwriter(s) and, as it deems appropriate, other principal             service providers. Any person nominated to serve as an Independent Trustee must not be, on the effective date of his or her             appointment or election, an "interested person" of the Trusts, or of any investment adviser or principal underwriter of the             Funds, as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, and, with respect to each Closed-End Fund, such person must also             satisfy, on such date, applicable independence requirements of the listing standards of securities exchanges on which shares             of such Closed-End Fund are traded.
a. The Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering Trustee candidates, including (but not limited             to): (i) availability and commitment of a candidate to attend meetings and perform his or her responsibilities on the Board,             (ii) relevant industry, business, professional and related experience, (iii) educational background, (iv) financial expertise,             (v) an assessment of the candidate's ability, judgment and expertise, and (vi) overall diversity of the Board's composition.
b. The Committee will consider and evaluate nominee candidates properly submitted by shareholders on the same basis as it             considers and evaluates candidates recommended by other sources. Appendix A to this Charter, as it may be amended from time             to time by the Committee, sets forth procedures that must be followed by shareholders to submit properly a candidate for nomination             by the Committee. Shareholder recommendations not properly submitted in accordance with the requirements of Appendix A will             not be considered for nomination by the Committee.
2. Process for evaluating potential conflicts of interest of Independent Trustee candidates.
a. As a threshold matter, the background of a candidate to serve as an Independent Trustee must be reviewed to confirm that             the person meets or, on the effective date of his or her appointment or election will meet, the technical requirements for             being a non-interested Trustee under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and, with respect to Independent Trustee candidates             for the Board of each Closed-End Fund, that such person satisfies or, on the effective date of his or her appointment or election             will satisfy, applicable independence requirements of the listing standards of securities exchanges on which shares of such             Closed-End Fund are traded.
b. In addition to satisfying the applicable technical requirements set forth in 2.a., above, the candidate's business and             personal connections (as reflected in the responses to questions in the Trustees' and Officers' Questionnaire completed by             each current and prospective Trustee) must be reviewed to confirm that they do not create any actual or potential impairment             to the person's independence with respect to the Funds.
c. With respect to any candidate, the Committee shall elicit such information from senior management that the Committee deems             appropriate, if any, to evaluating the merits of the candidate.
d. Disqualifying factors:
i. No candidate shall be nominated for membership on the Board if, upon appointment or election to the Board, that candidate             serves or has agreed to serve on the board of any registered investment company outside of the Wells Fargo Funds family (Asset             Allocation Trust shall be considered to be a part of the Wells Fargo Funds family solely for the purposes of this Committee             Charter), unless otherwise approved by the Committee. If any existing Trustee accepts a position on the board of any such             other registered investment company, such Trustee shall promptly resign from membership on the Board, unless an exception             from this policy is expressly approved by the Committee.
ii. No candidate shall be nominated for membership on the Board if that candidate serves or has agreed to serve as an officer,             partner, employee or in any similar capacity with a firm that serves as an investment adviser, sub-adviser or principal underwriter             of any registered investment company outside of the Wells Fargo Funds family. If any existing Trustee accepts such a position             with such a firm, such Trustee shall promptly resign from membership on the Board. Similarly, if a candidate serves in such             a capacity for a registered investment adviser or registered broker-dealer, but that firm currently does not serve as an investment             adviser, sub-adviser or principal underwriter for any such registered investment company, such candidate shall be nominated             only upon the express agreement that he or she would resign from the Board in the event that his or her firm subsequently             undertakes such a role for any registered investment company outside of the Wells Fargo Funds family.
iii. No candidate shall be nominated for membership on the Board if that candidate serves on the board of a firm that serves             as an investment adviser, sub-adviser or principal underwriter of any registered investment company outside of the Wells Fargo             Funds family, unless an exception from this policy is expressly approved by the Committee. If any existing Trustee accepts             a position on the board of any such an investment adviser, sub-adviser or principal underwriter, such Trustee shall promptly             resign from membership on the Board, unless an exception from this policy is expressly approved by the Committee. Similarly,             if a candidate serves on the board of a registered investment adviser or registered broker-dealer, but that firm currently             does not serve as an investment adviser, sub-adviser or principal underwriter of any such registered investment company, such             candidate shall be nominated only upon the express agreement that he or she would, unless an exception from this policy is             expressly approved by the Committee, resign from the Board in the event that his or her firm subsequently undertakes such             a role for any registered investment company outside of the Wells Fargo Funds family.
3. The Committee shall review the composition of the Board when it deems it appropriate to do so to determine whether it may             be appropriate to recommend adding individuals with different backgrounds or skill sets from those already on the Board and/or             recommend expanding or contracting the size of the Board.
Committee Nominations and Functions
1. The Committee shall propose nominations for membership on all committees and shall review committee assignments when it             deems it appropriate to do so.
2. The Committee shall review as necessary the responsibilities of any committees of the Board, whether there is a continuing             need for each committee, whether there is a need for additional committees of the Board, and whether committees should be             combined or reorganized. The Committee shall make recommendations for any such action to the Board. With respect to any committee             of the Board of a Closed-End Fund, the powers, functions, size, membership and other aspects of the committee shall conform             with any applicable requirements of the By-Laws of such Closed-end Fund.
Nominating and Governance Committee Chairman
1. Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee.
a. Only a Trustee who is an Independent Trustee may serve in the role of Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee.
b. In addition to any powers and duties specified in this Charter, the Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee's             role is to preside at all meetings of the Committee and to act as a liaison with respect to governance-related matters with             service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Committee members generally between meetings.
c. The Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee shall be entitled to receive an additional annual fee in such amount,             and payable in such frequency and manner, determined from time to time by the Board, for the additional work and time devoted             by the Chairman of the Nominating and Governance Committee.
2. Except for any duties specified herein or pursuant to a Trust's charter document, the designation of Chairman of the Nominating             and Governance Committee does not impose on such Trustee any duties, obligations or liability that are greater than the duties,             obligations or liability imposed on such person as a member of the Board generally.
Compensation
1. The Committee shall periodically review and recommend any appropriate changes to trustee compensation to the Board.
Fund Share Ownership
1. The Committee shall periodically review and recommend any appropriate changes in respect of policies regarding share ownership             in Wells Fargo Funds by Trustees.

Advisory Trustee Nominations
1. The Committee may from time-to-time propose nominations of one or more individuals to serve as members of an "advisory             board," as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Advisory Trustees"). An individual             shall be eligible to serve as an Advisory Trustee only if that individual meets the requirements to be an Independent Trustee             and does not otherwise serve the Trusts in any other capacity. Any Advisory Trustee shall serve at the pleasure of the Board             and may be removed, at any time, with or without cause, by the Board. An Advisory Trustee may be nominated and elected as             a Trustee, at which time he or she shall cease to be Advisory Trustee. Any Advisory Trustee may resign at any time.
Other Powers and Responsibilities
1. The Committee shall review this Charter at least annually and recommend changes, if any, to the Board.
2. The Committee shall periodically review and address matters relating to the engagement and independence of legal counsel             employed by the Independent Trustees and shall recommend any appropriate actions to the Board.
3. The Committee shall have the resources and authority to discharge its responsibilities, including authority to retain special             counsel and other experts or consultants, advisers or employees at the expense of the appropriate Fund(s).
4. In consultation with independent legal counsel to the Independent Trustees, the Committee shall consider the processes             to be undertaken by the Board in connection with the annual assessment of the performance of the Board and the committees             of the Board pursuant to rule 0-1(a)(7)(v) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and under any applicable listing requirements.
5. The Committee shall set forth and periodically review governance principles for the Board and its committees and shall             recommend changes, if any, to the Board. Those principles have been outlined in a separate document (Statement of Governance             Principles).

7. If the Committee's membership does not include all of the Trustees, the Committee will report on actions taken at its meetings             to the Board.
8. The Committee shall have such further responsibilities as are given to it from time to time by the Board.

Appendix A
Procedures for Shareholders to Submit Nominee Candidates
A shareholder of any series of the Trust must follow the following procedures in order to submit properly a nominee candidate             recommendation for the Committee's consideration.
The shareholder must submit any nominee candidate recommendation (a "Shareholder Recommendation") in writing to the Trust,             to the attention of the Trust's Secretary, at the address of the principal executive offices of the Trust.
The Shareholder Recommendation must include: (i) a statement in writing setting forth (A) the name, age, date of birth, business             address, residence address and nationality of the person recommended by the shareholder (the "candidate"); (B) the series             (and, if applicable, class) and number of all shares of the Trust owned of record or beneficially by the candidate, as reported             to such shareholder by the candidate; (C) any other information regarding the candidate called for with respect to director             nominees by paragraphs (a), (d), (e) and (f) of Item 401 of Regulation S-K or paragraph (b) of Item 22 of Rule 14a-101 (Schedule             14A) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission             (or the corresponding provisions of any regulation or rule subsequently adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission             or any successor agency applicable to the Trust); (D) any other information regarding the candidate that would be required             to be disclosed if the candidate were a nominee in a proxy statement or other filing required to be made in connection with             solicitation of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations             promulgated thereunder; and (E) whether the recommending shareholder believes that the candidate is or will be an "interested             person" of the Trust (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended) and information regarding the candidate             that will be sufficient for the Trust to make such determination; (ii) the written and signed consent of the candidate to             be named as a nominee and to serve as a Trustee if elected; (iii) the recommending shareholder's name as it appears on the             Trust's books; (iv) the series (and, if applicable, class) and number of all shares of the Trust owned beneficially and of             record by the recommending shareholder; and (v) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the recommending             shareholder and the candidate and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the recommendation             is being made by the recommending shareholder. In addition, the Committee may require the candidate to interview in person             and furnish such other information as it may reasonably require or deem necessary to determine the eligibility of such candidate             to serve as a Trustee of the Trust. With respect to each Closed-End Fund, the Shareholder Recommendation also must comply             with any timing or additional requirements applicable to shareholder nominations, as set forth in the By-Laws of such Closed-end             Fund. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency with respect to the requirements applicable to a Shareholder Recommendation             as between those established in these procedures and those in the By-Laws of a Closed-End Fund, the requirements of the By-Laws             of such Closed-End Fund shall control.

WELLS FARGO FUNDS TRUST  WELLS FARGO VARIABLE TRUST  WELLS FARGO MASTER TRUST  WELLS FARGO GLOBAL DIVIDEND OPPORTUNITY FUND  WELLS FARGO INCOME OPPORTUNITIES FUND  WELLS FARGO MULTI-SECTOR INCOME FUND  WELLS FARGO UTILITIES AND HIGH INCOME FUND    AUDIT COMMITTEES CHARTER
1. Composition. The Audit Committees ("Committees") of the Boards of Trustees (the "Boards") of Wells Fargo Funds Trust, Wells Fargo Variable             Trust, and Wells Fargo Master Trust (collectively, the "Open-End Trusts"), Wells Fargo Global Dividend Opportunity Fund ("EOD"),             Wells Fargo Income Opportunities Fund ("EAD"), Wells Fargo Multi-Sector Income Fund ("ERC"), and Wells Fargo Utilities and             High Income Fund ("ERH") (collectively, the "Closed-End Funds" and together, with the Open-End Trusts, the "Trusts") shall             be composed entirely of Trustees who are not "interested persons" of the Trusts or of any series thereof, or of any investment             adviser or principal underwriter, as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"). The Committees of the Closed-End             Funds (the "Closed-End Fund Committees") shall have at least three members who are "independent" as that term is interpreted             under Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and under the listing standards of each exchange on             which shares of the Closed-End Funds are traded, except as otherwise set forth by statute, rule, or listing standard. The             full Boards shall designate the members of the Committees, after due consideration of nominations, if any, from the Governance             Committee, and shall either designate the Chairman or shall approve the manner of selection of the Chairman. Except for any             duties specified herein or pursuant to a Trust's charter document, the designation of Chairman of the Audit Committee does             not impose on such Trustee any duties, obligations or liability that are greater than the duties, obligations or liability             imposed on such person as a member of the Committees and the Boards in the absence of such designation.
The Boards shall determine as often as they deem appropriate whether any member of the Committees is an "audit committee financial             expert" as defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR. Any member of the Committees who is determined to be such an expert shall not             bear any duties, obligations or liabilities that are greater than the duties, obligations and liabilities imposed on such             member as a member of the Committees and the Boards in the absence of such determination.
2. Primary Responsibilities. The primary responsibilities of the Committees are:
to oversee the accounting and financial reporting policies of the Trusts or their series, as applicable (a Trust or any such                   series being referred to as a "Fund", and collectively as the "Funds"), including their internal controls over financial reporting                   and, as a Committee deems appropriate, the internal controls over financial reporting of key service providers;
to oversee the quality and objectivity of the Funds' financial statements and the independent audit thereof;
to interact with the Funds' registered public accounting firm (the "Auditors") on behalf of the Boards, and to interact with                   the appropriate officers of the Trusts, and the investment managers, advisers, sub-advisers, administrators (collectively,                   "Management") and other key service providers other than the Auditors regarding accounting and financial reporting matters;
to oversee, or, as appropriate, assist with the Board's oversight of, the Funds' compliance with legal and regulatory requirements                   that relate to the Funds' accounting and financial reporting, internal controls and independent audits; and to approve the engagement of the Auditors and the approval of their fees annually and, in connection therewith, to review                   and evaluate the qualifications, independence and performance of the Auditors.
The function of the Committees is oversight. Management is responsible for: (1) the preparation, quality and objectivity of             the Funds' financial statements; (2) the implementation of appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies;             and (3) the design and maintenance of internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with all applicable accounting             standards, laws and regulations. The Auditors are responsible for planning and carrying out a proper audit and review other             procedures under applicable auditing standards. Nothing in this Charter shall be construed to reduce the responsibilities             or liabilities of Management or the Auditors.
Although the Committees are expected to take a detached and questioning approach to the matters that come before them, any             review of the Funds' financial statements by the Committees is not an audit, nor does any review by the Committees substitute             for the responsibilities of Management for preparing, or the Auditors for auditing, the Funds' financial statements. Members             of the Committees are not employees of the Funds and, in serving on these Committees, are not, and do not hold themselves             out to be, acting as accountants or auditors. As such, it is not the duty or responsibility of the Committees or their members             to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews or procedures. In addition, the authority and responsibilities             set forth in this Charter do not reflect or create any duty or obligation of the Committees to plan or conduct any audit,             to determine or certify that any Fund's financial statements are complete, accurate, fairly presented, or in accordance with             generally accepted accounting principles or applicable laws, or to guarantee any report of the Auditors.
In discharging their duties, the members of the Committees are entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements,             including financial statements and other financial data prepared or presented by: (1) one or more officers of the Trusts whom             the member reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; (2) legal counsel, the Auditors or other             public accountants, or other persons as to matters the member reasonably believes are within the person's professional or             expert competence; or (3) another Board committee on which the member does not sit.
3. Duties and Powers. To carry out their responsibilities, the Committees shall have the following duties and powers, to be discharged in such             a manner as the Committees deem appropriate, in their sole discretion:
to approve the engagement of the Auditors to annually audit and provide audit and tax services necessary to support their                   audit opinion on a Fund's financial statements, to recommend to those Trustees who are not "interested persons" of the Fund                   (as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Act) the selection, retention or termination of the Auditors and, in connection                   therewith, to review and evaluate matters brought to their attention potentially affecting the independence and capabilities                   of the Auditors;
to approve the engagement of the Auditors to provide non-audit services to a Fund, or to its investment adviser (not including                   a sub-adviser whose role is primarily investment management and is sub-contracted or overseen by another investment adviser)                   ("covered adviser") or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser ("control                   affiliate") that provides ongoing services to the Fund, if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial                   reporting of the Fund;
to implement any policies and procedures for pre-approval of the engagement of the Auditors as are set forth in this Charter                   to provide audit or non-audit services to a Fund and/or to provide non-audit services to a covered adviser or a control affiliate                   that provides ongoing services to the Fund, which services relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the                   Fund, provided in either case that the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular services covered;
to consider whether the provision by the Auditors of non-audit services to a covered adviser or a control affiliate that provides                   ongoing services to the Fund, which services were not required to be pre-approved by the Committees, is compatible with maintaining                   the Auditors' independence;
to assess the Auditors' independence at least annually, in connection with which, the Committees shall receive and review                   a report by the Auditors disclosing all relationships that may affect the Auditors' independence, including the disclosures                   required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Rule 3526 or any other applicable auditing standard and any                   relationships of the Auditors' affiliates that could reasonably be thought to bear on the independence of the Auditors;
to receive from, to review and to discuss with the Auditors, and with Management and other key service providers to the extent                   the Committees deem appropriate, the matters about which PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16 (Codification of PCAOB Statements                   on Auditing Standards) requires communication, including those specifically mentioned in this Charter;
to review the arrangements for and scope of the Funds' annual audits and any special audits;
to review and approve the fees proposed to be charged to the Funds by the Auditors for all audit and non-audit services;
to meet with, and consider information and comments from, the Auditors with respect to the Funds' financial statements and                   the Funds' accounting and financial reporting policies, procedures and internal controls (including the Funds' critical accounting                   policies and practices and any adjustments to a Fund's financial statements recommended by the Auditors), and to consider                   Management's responses to any such comments and, to the extent the Committees deem necessary or appropriate, to promote improvements                   in the quality of the Funds' accounting and financial reporting;
to review the form of engagement letter used by the Funds to engage the Auditors for all audit and non-audit services;
to oversee the resolution of any material disagreements between Management and the Auditors regarding financial reporting                   that are brought to the Committees' attention;
to review with the Funds' principal executive officer and/or principal financial officer, in connection with their certifications                   of any filings by the Funds on Form N-CSR or any successor form, any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of                   disclosure controls and procedures or material weaknesses therein or in internal controls over financial reporting and any                   reported evidence of fraud involving Management or any other key service providers or any of their employees who have a significant                   role in the Funds' disclosure controls and procedures;
to investigate or initiate investigation of reports of improprieties or suspected improprieties in connection with the Funds'                   accounting or financial reporting;
to report their activities to the respective Boards on a regular basis and to make such recommendations with respect to the                   matters described above and other matters as the Committees may deem necessary or appropriate;
to inquire of the Auditors and Management as to whether appropriate staffing levels are being maintained within the audit                   engagement team, internal accounting and administration staff; and to perform such other functions and to have such powers as may be necessary or appropriate in the efficient and lawful discharge                   of the foregoing.
4. All Closed-End Fund Committees. The Closed-End Fund Committees shall be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of             the work of any Auditor engaged (including resolution of disagreements between Management and the Auditor regarding financial             reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other audit, review or attest services for             the Closed-End Funds, and each such Auditor must report directly to its respective Closed-End Fund Committee.
The Closed-End Fund Committees shall also establish procedures for (1) the receipt, retention, and treatment of complaints             received by the Closed-End Funds regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters; and (2) the confidential,             anonymous submission by employees of the Closed-End Funds, the Closed-End Funds' investment adviser, administrator, principal             underwriter (if any) or any other provider of accounting-related services for the Closed-End Funds, of concerns regarding             questionable accounting or auditing matters.
Each of the Closed-End Fund Committees shall have the power, in addition to the responsibilities, duties and powers included             elsewhere in this Charter, to be discharged in such a manner as the Committee deems appropriate in its sole discretion, to             review such disclosures or statements made by the respective Closed-End Fund Committee in the Closed-End Funds' annual or             semi-annual report or proxy statement.
5. NYSE American Closed-End Fund Committees. Any Closed-End Fund with shares listed on the NYSE American exchange (formerly NYSE MKT) (the "NYSE American") must comply             with applicable listing standard requirements.1, Accordingly, each member of an audit committee of a fund listed on the NYSE American ("NYSE American Closed-End Fund Committee")             must be able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a company's balance sheet, income statement,             and cash flow statement. Further, at least one member of a NYSE American Closed-End Fund Committee must be "financially sophisticated,"             as such term is defined in the listing standards of the NYSE American.2
The purpose of a NYSE American Closed-End Fund Committee includes, in addition to the responsibilities, duties and powers             included elsewhere in this Charter, overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes and audits of the Closed-End             Fund. NYSE American Closed-End Fund Committees must actively engage in a dialogue with the Auditors with respect to any disclosed             relationships or services that may impact the objectivity and independence of the Auditors and are responsible for taking,             or recommending that the Boards take, appropriate action to oversee the independence of the Auditors. Committee members must             not have participated in the preparation of the financial statements of the Closed-End Fund at any time during the three years             prior to appointment to the NYSE American Closed-End Fund Committee. The NYSE American Closed-End Fund Committees shall meet             on a regular basis, as often as necessary to fulfill their responsibilities, including at least annually in connection with             the issuance of audited financial statements.
6. New York Stock Exchange Closed-End Fund Committees. Any Closed-End Fund with shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") must comply with applicable listing standard             requirements.3, Accordingly, each member of an audit committee of a fund listed on the NYSE ("NYSE Closed-End Fund Committee") must be "financially             literate" (or become so within a reasonable time after his or her appointment to the committee).4, Further, at least one member of an NYSE Closed-End Fund Committee must have "accounting or related financial expertise".5
The purpose of a NYSE Closed-End Fund Committee includes, in addition to the responsibilities, duties and powers included             elsewhere in this Charter, assisting with the Board's oversight of the integrity of the Closed-End Fund's financial statements,             the Closed-End Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications and independence of the Closed-End             Fund's Auditors, and the performance of the Closed-End Fund's internal audit functions (if any) and Auditors.
The NYSE Closed-End Fund Committee shall have the following duties and powers, in addition to the responsibilities, duties             and powers included elsewhere in this Charter, to be discharged in such a manner as the Committee deems appropriate, in its             sole discretion:
to obtain and review at least annually a report from the Auditors describing (1) the accounting firm's internal quality-control                   procedures, (2) any material issues raised (a) by the Auditors' most recent internal quality-control review or peer review                   or (b) by any governmental or other professional inquiry or investigation performed within the preceding five years respecting                   one or more independent audits carried out by the firm, and any steps taken to address any such issues, and (3) all relationships                   between the Auditors and the Closed-End Fund to assess the Auditor's independence;6
to meet to review and discuss with Management the Closed-End Fund's audited annual and unaudited semi-annual financial statements,                   as well as "Management's Discussion of Fund Performance", if included in its Form N-CSR;
to discuss any press releases regarding the Closed-End Fund's investment performance, distributions and/or other financial                   information about the Closed-End Fund, as well as any financial information provided to analysts or rating agencies. The NYSE                   Closed-End Fund Committee may discharge this responsibility by discussing the general types of information to be disclosed                   by the Fund and the form of presentation (i.e., a case-by-case review is not required) and need not discuss in advance each                   such release of information;
to discuss guidelines and policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management;
to review with the Auditors any audit problems or difficulties encountered in the course of their audit work and Management's                   responses thereto;7
to set clear policies for the hiring by the Closed-End Fund of employees or former employees of the Closed-End Fund's Auditors,                   to the extent that the Closed-End Fund intends to have employees;
to report regularly to the Closed-End Fund Board; and to consider whether to recommend to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the annual report for the                   Closed-End Fund.
The performance of the NYSE Closed-End Fund Committee shall be reviewed at least annually by the Committee or by the Board             and may be conducted as part of the Board's annual self-assessment. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, no member of             the NYSE Closed-End Fund Committee may serve on the audit committee of more than two other public companies.8
7. Meetings. Unless otherwise specified in this Charter, each Committee shall meet at least twice annually, and is empowered to hold special             meetings as circumstances require. The Committees shall record minutes of their meetings and shall invite Trustees who are             not members of the Committees, Management, counsel and representatives of service providers to attend meetings and provide             information as the Committees, in their sole discretion, consider appropriate. The Committees shall periodically meet separately             in executive session with the Auditors. Meetings of the Committees may be conducted in person, telephonically, or via video-conference.
8. Auditor Pre-Approval. The Auditors are hereby pre-approved to provide the following services: (a) audit newly created Funds; (b) perform "agreed             upon procedures" reviews and/or provide comfort letters in connection with Fund reorganizations; (c) review special Fund registration             statement filings; (d) provide comments to regulatory filings; and (e) perform non-audit services for a Fund, and for the             Fund's covered adviser and its control affiliates that provide ongoing services to the Fund where the engagement relates directly             to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund, provided that any such non-audit services fall within the specified             categories of services listed on Tab A, which have been separately approved by the Committees, and that the fees for such             services do not exceed the pre-approved dollar amounts listed on Tab A. To the extent that the non-audit services or fees             would fall outside of the aforementioned pre-approvals, such services or fees may be pre-approved by the Committees, or by             the Chairman pursuant to delegated authority in accordance with Section 9 below.
9. Pre-Approval Procedure. The Chairman of the Committees is authorized to pre-approve: (1) audit services to the Funds; (2) non-audit tax or other             categories of services identified in Section 8 above or compliance consulting or training services provided to the Funds by             the Auditors if the fees for any particular engagement are not anticipated to exceed $50,000; and (3) non-audit tax or compliance             consulting or training services provided by the Auditors to a Fund's covered adviser and its control affiliates (where pre-approval             is required because the control affiliate provides ongoing services to the Fund and the engagement relates directly to the             operations and financial reporting of the Fund) if the fee to the Auditors for any particular engagement is not anticipated             to exceed $50,000. For any such pre-approval sought from the Chairman, Management shall prepare a brief written statement             describing the proposed services. If the Chairman approves of such service, he or she shall sign the statement prepared by             Management or otherwise evidence in writing his or her approval, which may be given by electronic mail. Such written statement,             or the written engagement for the proposed services described in the statement, shall be reported to the full Committees at             their next regularly scheduled meeting.
10. Availability. The Committees shall be available to meet with the Treasurer and other appropriate officers of the Trusts, and with internal             accounting staff, and individuals with internal audit responsibilities, for consultation on audit, accounting, and related             financial matters.
11. Resources. The Committees shall be given the resources and shall have the authority appropriate to discharge their responsibilities,             including the authority to retain special or independent counsel and other experts, advisors or consultants at the expense             of the appropriate Fund(s) and to determine the appropriate funding for payment of compensation to Auditors for the purpose             of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other audit, review or attest services for a Fund and the Committees'             ordinary administrative expenses that are necessary or appropriate in carrying out their duties.
12. Miscellaneous. The Committees shall review and reapprove this Charter as often as they deem appropriate, but not less often than annually,             and recommend any changes that they deem appropriate to the Boards. The Committees shall have such further responsibilities             as are given to them from time to time by the Boards. The Committees shall consult as they deem appropriate with Management,             the Auditors and counsel as to legal or regulatory developments affecting their responsibilities, as well as relevant tax,             accounting and industry developments. The actions taken at meetings of the Committee shall be recorded in the minutes of such             meetings. If the Committees'membership does not include all of the Trustees, the Committees will report on actions taken at             their meetings to the Boards. The Committees shall have such further responsibilities as are given to them from time to time             by the Boards.
Nothing in this Charter shall be interpreted as diminishing or derogating the responsibilities of the Boards.
