 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 COMPENSATION PROGRAM OVERVIEW   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Elements of our Compensation Program Philosophy  
 Variable Cash Compensation      We believe in using variable cash compensation to motivate and reward performance for our NEOs.  
 Focus on Corporate Goals      We strive to provide compensation that is directly related to the achievement of our corporate goals, which we measure through financial earnings, individual management objectives and free cash flow goals.  
 Carefully Monitor External Market Practices      We monitor market practices so that our programs reflect the realities of the competitive market to ensure we are paying for performance. At the same time, we must also ensure we can attract the top talent necessary to drive results through our diversified business strategy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 What We Do       How We Do It  
 We Pay for Performance      We tie a significant portion of our executives' annual pay opportunity to objective performance metrics and continue to monitor our pay mix to ensure the performance-based portion is consistent with that of our peers.  
 We Target Pay Competitively      We seek to target compensation within a competitive range of the market median and only deliver greater compensation when warranted by actual superior performance. Conversely, we deliver lower compensation when performance results do not meet our threshold expectations. We review our pay and performance alignment compared to our peers annually to understand where our programs are working and where we can continue to make improvements.  
 We Enforce Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines      Each of our executives is expected to own shares of the Company's common stock with a value ranging from one to six times the executive's base salary, depending on position.  
 We Utilize Meaningful Vesting Conditions for Equity Awards      Equity awards, including performance-based awards, have three-year ratable vesting periods from the date of grant.  
 We Impose a "Clawback Policy"      We can recover any performance-based cash or equity award where, as a result of an accounting restatement, the performance goals were later determined not to have been achieved. In addition, we can recover equity awards made to an employee in cases where the Company has to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance by the Company with financial reporting requirements and the restatement is the result of misconduct that resulted from the employee knowingly having engaged in that misconduct, the employee's gross negligence, or the employee knowingly or through gross negligence having failed to prevent misconduct.  
 We Utilize an Independent Compensation Consulting Firm      The Compensation Committee utilizes Willis Towers Watson, an independent compensation consulting firm, to assist the Committee in determining compensation.  
 We Don't Permit Hedging      We prohibit our directors and employees, including our NEOs, from engaging in short sales, transactions in derivative securities (including put and call options), or other forms of hedging and monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars, equity swaps, exchange funds and forward sale contracts, that allow the holder to limit or eliminate the risk of a decrease in the value of our securities.  
 We Don't Permit Pledging      We prohibit our directors and officers, including our NEOs, from holding our securities in margin accounts, pledging our securities as collateral or maintaining an automatic rebalance feature in savings plans, deferred compensation or deferred fee plans, to avoid sales of our securities on behalf of an individual related to margin calls, loan defaults and automatic rebalances, which may occur when the individual has material nonpublic information regarding the Company.  
 We Don't Offer Single-Trigger "Change of Control" Payments      For those NEOs who have employment agreements, the agreements provide that in the case of a "change of control" the NEO only receives severance payments in connection with a termination of their employment.  
 We Don't Provide Tax Gross-Ups      We do not provide for tax gross-up payments for a change of control in employment agreements, or for other benefits.

 COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION AND PEER GROUP REVIEW
