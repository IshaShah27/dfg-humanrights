Governance and Compensation ChangesOver our more than 180-year history, one of the things we have learned is the inevitability of change. As a result, we regularly assess what we do to determine how we can adapt and improve. This approach applies to our corporate governance and compensation plans as much as it does to our manufacturing processes and product innovation. Here is a summary of the changes we have made in recent years.
[BEGIN TABLE]
—We adopted a bylaw in 2016 allowing shareholders meeting certain requirements to nominate directors and have such nominees included in the proxy statement, commonly referred to as "proxy access." —In 2017, we increased the retirement age for board members to 75 to reflect recent industry trends and to provide stability in the composition of our board.      —The performance goals for our short-term incentive plan were significantly increased for 2018 to align more appropriately to our current enterprise strategy. —The modifier for the long-term incentive cash plan was changed to a multiplicative payout modifier that will allow for upside potential when total shareholder return (TSR) is above the 50th percentile. —Performance Stock Units (PSUs) will now be based solely on a revenue growth metric. TSR as a standalone metric will apply only to the cash portion of the long-term award. —The consolidated financials of the Wirtgen acquisition are excluded from the Equipment Operations Operating Return on Operating Assets (OROA) and Shareholder Value Added (SVA) for calculating variable compensation for fiscal 2018 and 2019 to allow for integration and to determine appropriate incentive metrics. Wirtgen is included in the revenue component of the variable pay metrics to incent executive leadership to drive for successful integration and continued growth of the business.
 Fiscal 2018 Performance Highlights Deere & Company achieved net sales and revenues of $37.358 billion—our second-best year. Net income, while impacted by adjustments and other one-time accruals related to the U.S. tax reform legislation in December 2017, climbed 10 percent to $2.368 billion, or $7.24 per share, compared with $2.159 billion, or $6.68 per share, in 2017. Sound execution was aided by improvements to our cost structure put in place in 2017. Performance also benefited from a broad product lineup, one that makes Deere the No. 1 manufacturer of agriculture, forestry, and road-construction equipment and a leader in the construction and turf care equipment industries. For more information regarding our fiscal 2018 financial performance, please see our Annual Report, which is available at www.proxyvote.com.  Deere made acquisitions during the year that are expected to play an important role in our future: Wirtgen Group, industry leader in road-construction equipment (December 2017) KingAgro, manufacturer of carbon-fiber products (March) PLA, a South American manufacturer of sprayers, planters, and other equipment (September) Other highlights include: Generated $1.86 billion in economic profit, or SVA Returned nearly $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases Invested almost $1.7 billion in research and development

 NET SALES AND REVENUES (Millions)         NET INCOME(1) (Millions)         SHAREHOLDER VALUE ADDED(2)(3) (Millions)         DEERE SHARE PRICE (at fiscal year-end) 
 Worldwide net sales and revenues rose 26% in 2018 due to improving market conditions as well as the addition of the Wirtgen Group. 2018 results include 10 months of Wirtgen sales.     Net income, though negatively impacted by tax change provisions, improved to $2,368 million, up 10% from 2017. This represents the fifth-highest total in company history. Without the tax change provisions, net income for the year would have been $3,073 million.   Shareholder Value Added (SVA) jumped for the year—up nearly 45%—as a result of higher operating profit and sound asset management. SVA represents operating profit less an implied charge for capital.   Deere share price ended year at $133, unchanged from 2017 and up 53% from 2016. Quarterly dividends increased 15% during the year and were raised again in December 2018. 
(1)  Net income attributable to Deere & Company 
(2)  SVA is a non-GAAP measure. See page 21 of the Annual Report for details 
(3)  Amounts for 2016 & 2017 were restated due to the company adopting Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post-retirement Benefit Cost in 1Q 2018. 
[END TABLE]
CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES (Millions)
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Consolidated cash flow from operations totaled a healthy $1.8 billion after roughly $1.3 billion in voluntary contributions  to U.S. pension and other post-employment benefit plans. Cash flow funded strategic projects and acquisitions and paid roughly  $1.8 billion to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases.

Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation HighlightsOur compensation programs and practices are designed to create incentive opportunities for advancing our shareholders' long-term interests. We use metrics that align with our business strategy and motivate our executives to create value for shareholders at all points in the business cycle. For fiscal 2018, we had three separate variable pay components (described below) — Short-Term Incentive (STI), Long-Term Incentive Cash (LTIC), and Long-Term Incentive (LTI) — which stimulate complementary behaviors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The equipment operations OROA calculation excludes the assets from our Financial Services segment and certain corporate assets. Corporate assets are primarily the equipment operations' retirement benefits, deferred income tax assets, marketable securities, and cash and cash equivalents. ROE is based solely on the Financial Services segment. See Appendix B for details.  
(2)  Wirtgen is excluded from both the equipment operations OROA and SVA calculations for FY18 variable pay to allow time for assimilation. See Appendix B for details. 
[END TABLE]
For information about the metrics we use to measure compensation and the resulting payouts, see the Executive Summary of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A).
The table below highlights the 2018 compensation for the CEO and, on average, for the named executive officers (NEOs) as disclosed in the Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table. The table also shows how much compensation was delivered in cash (versus equity) and the significant portion that is performance-based and therefore at risk.

Election of Directors
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Item 1 - Election of Directors 
[END TABLE]
How We Identify and Evaluate Director Nominees The Corporate Governance Committee of the Board is responsible for screening candidates and recommending director nominees to the full Board. The Board nominates the slate of directors for election at each Annual Meeting of Shareholders and elects directors to fill vacancies or newly-created Board seats.
The Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates recommended by shareholders, directors, officers, and third-party search firms. If you wish to nominate a director, please review the procedures described under "Additional Information – 2020 Shareholder Proposals and Nominations" in this Proxy Statement. The Corporate Governance Committee evaluates all candidates in the same manner, regardless of the source of the recommendation.
Deere's Corporate Governance Policies, which are described in the "Corporate Governance" section of this Proxy Statement, establish the general criteria and framework for assessing director candidates. In particular, the Corporate Governance Committee considers each nominee's skills, experience, international versus domestic background, and age, as well as legal and regulatory requirements and the particular needs of the Board at the time. In addition, the Board assesses the diversity of its members and nominees as part of an annual performance evaluation by considering, among other factors, diversity in expertise, experience, background, ethnicity, and gender. We believe a Board composed of members with complementary skills, qualifications, experiences, and attributes is best equipped to meet its responsibilities effectively.
Any director who experiences a material change in occupation, career, or principal business activity, including retirement, must tender a resignation to the Board. Upon recommendation from the Corporate Governance Committee, the Board may decline to accept any such resignation. Directors must retire from the Board upon the first Annual Meeting of Shareholders after reaching the age of 75, except as approved by the Board.
Director Nominees The Corporate Governance Committee has recommended and the Board has nominated each of Samuel R. Allen, Vance D. Coffman, Alan C. Heuberger, Charles O. Holliday, Jr., Dipak C. Jain, Michael O. Johanns, Clayton M. Jones, Gregory R. Page, Sherry M. Smith, Dmitri L. Stockton, and Sheila G. Talton to be elected for terms expiring at the Annual Meeting in 2020. All of the nominees are current members of the Board, but Deere's Certificate of Incorporation and good governance practices require all members of the Board to be elected annually.
We have confidence that this talented slate of nominees will lead Deere capably in the year ahead. We discuss the nominees' professional backgrounds and qualifications in the short biographies that follow.
Table of Contents
Board Diversity The Corporate Governance Committee believes that our Board is most effective when it embodies a diverse set of viewpoints and practical experiences. To maintain an effective Board, the Corporate Governance Committee considers how each nominee's particular background, experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills will contribute to Deere's success. As shown below, the independent members of our Board have a range of viewpoints, backgrounds, and expertise.

Our Values At Deere, our actions are guided by our core values: integrity, quality, commitment, and innovation. We strive to live up to these values in everything we do — not just because it is good business, but because we are committed to strong corporate governance. We are committed to strong corporate governance as a means of upholding these values and ensuring that we are accountable to our shareholders.
Director Independence The Board has adopted categorical standards (see Appendix A) that help us evaluate each director's independence. Specifically, these standards are intended to assist the Board in determining whether certain relationships between our directors and Deere or its affiliates are "material relationships" for purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) independence standards. The categorical standards establish thresholds, short of which any such relationship is deemed not to be material. In addition, each director's independence is evaluated under our Related Person Transactions Approval Policy, as discussed in the "Review and Approval of Related Person Transactions" section. Deere's independence standards meet or exceed the NYSE's independence requirements.
Table of Contents
In November 2018, we reviewed the independence of each then-sitting director, applying the independence standards set forth in our Corporate Governance Policies. The reviews considered relationships and transactions between each director (and the director's immediate family and affiliates) and Deere, Deere's management, and Deere's independent registered public accounting firm. Based on this review, the Board affirmatively determined at its regular December 2018 meeting that no director other than Mr. Allen has a material relationship with Deere and its affiliates and that each director other than Mr. Allen is independent as defined in our Corporate Governance Policies and the NYSE's listing standards. Mr. Allen is not an independent director because of his employment relationship with Deere.
Board Leadership StructureThe Chairman of the Board also serves as Deere's Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes that combining the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles is the most appropriate structure for Deere at this time for three reasons:
Presiding DirectorVance D. Coffman has served as our independent Presiding Director since the 2016 Annual Meeting.
The Presiding Director is elected by a majority of the independent directors upon a recommendation from the Corporate Governance Committee. The Presiding Director is appointed for a one-year term beginning upon election and expiring upon the selection of a successor.
The Board has assigned the Presiding Director the following duties and responsibilities:
[BEGIN TABLE]
—  Preside at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors; 
[END TABLE]
The Board believes the role of the Presiding Director exemplifies Deere's continuing commitment to strong corporate governance and Board independence.
Board MeetingsUnder Deere's bylaws, regular meetings of the Board are held at least quarterly. Our typical practice is to schedule at least one Board meeting per year at a company location other than our World Headquarters so directors have an opportunity to observe different aspects of our business first-hand. The Board met six times during fiscal 2018.
Directors are expected to attend Board meetings, meetings of committees on which they serve, and shareholder meetings. More to the point, directors are expected to spend the time needed and meet as frequently as necessary to properly discharge their responsibilities. During fiscal 2018, all incumbent directors attended 75% or more of the meetings of the Board and committees on which they served. Overall attendance at Board and committee meetings was 98%. All directors then in office attended the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in February 2018.
Table of Contents
Each Board meeting normally begins or ends with a session between the CEO and the independent directors. This provides a platform for discussions outside the presence of the non-Board management attendees. The independent directors may meet in executive session, without the CEO, at any time, but such non-management executive sessions are scheduled and typically occur at each regular Board meeting. The Presiding Director presides over these executive sessions.
Board Committees The Board has delegated some of its authority to five committees: the Executive Committee, the Audit Review Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Governance Committee, and the Finance Committee.
The Board approved the rotation of certain directors' committee memberships effective February 2016. The Board believes that committee rotation is generally desirable to ensure that committees regularly benefit from new perspectives.
Each of our Board committees has adopted a charter that complies with current NYSE rules relating to corporate governance matters. Copies of the committee charters are available at www.deere.com/corpgov and may also be obtained upon request to the Deere & Company Shareholder Relations Department. Each committee (other than the Executive Committee, which did not meet in 2018 and of which Mr. Allen serves as chair) is composed solely of independent directors.
The committee structure and memberships described below reflect the changes that became effective in February 2017.  Every committee other than the Executive Committee regularly reports on its activities to the full Board.

Board Oversight of Risk Management The Board believes that strong and effective internal controls and risk management processes are essential for achieving long-term shareholder value. The Board, directly and through its committees, is responsible for monitoring risks that may affect Deere.
RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH We maintain a structured risk management approach to facilitate our strategic business objectives. To that end, we identify and categorize risks and then escalate them as needed. Our internal risk management structure is administered by a Management Risk Committee consisting of the CEO and his direct reports. This committee provides periodic reports to the Board regarding Deere's risk management processes and reviews with the Board high-priority areas of enterprise risk.
Dedicated risk management reports typically take place at regularly scheduled Board meetings each February and August, and risk management topics are discussed as needed at other Board and committee meetings.
BOARD AND COMMITTEE RISK OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES Each Board committee is responsible for oversight of risk categories related to its specific area of focus, while the full Board exercises ultimate responsibility for overseeing the risk management function as a whole and has direct oversight responsibility for many risk categories, including cyber security risks.
The areas of risk oversight exercised by the Board and its committees are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Full Board   Oversees overall risk management function and regularly receives and evaluates reports and presentations from the chairs of the individual Board committees on risk-related matters falling within each committee's oversight responsibilities. 
 Audit Review Committee   Monitors operational, strategic, and legal and regulatory risks by regularly reviewing reports and presentations given by management, including our Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Vice President, Internal Audit, as well as other operational personnel. Regularly reviews our risk management practices and risk-related policies (for example, Deere's risk management and insurance portfolio, and legal and regulatory reviews) and evaluates potential risks related to internal control over financial reporting and information system risks.

Regularly reviews our risk management practices and risk-related policies (for example, Deere's risk management and insurance portfolio, and legal and regulatory reviews) and evaluates potential risks related to internal control over financial reporting and information system risks. 
 Compensation Committee   Monitors potential risks related to the design and administration of our compensation plans, policies, and programs, including our performance-based compensation programs, to promote appropriate incentives that do not encourage executive officers or employees to take unnecessary and/or excessive risks. 
 Corporate Governance Committee   Monitors potential risks related to our governance practices by, among other things, reviewing succession plans and performance evaluations of the Board and CEO, monitoring legal developments and trends regarding corporate governance practices, monitoring the Code of Business Conduct, and evaluating potential related person transactions. Monitors risks relating to environmental factors, as well as product safety and other compliance matters. 
 Finance Committee   Monitors operational and strategic risks related to Deere's financial affairs, including capital structure and liquidity risks, and reviews the policies and strategies for managing financial exposure and contingent liabilities. Monitors potential risks related to funding our U.S. qualified pension plans (other than the defined contribution savings and investment plans) and monitors compliance with applicable laws and internal policies and objectives.

Shareholder Outreach To ensure the continued delivery of sustainable, long-term value to our shareholders, we engage in regular dialogue with them. During 2018, we discussed governance, executive compensation, and other issues with shareholders representing more than 40% of our outstanding shares. The Board considers feedback from these conversations during its deliberations, and we regularly review and adjust our corporate governance structure and executive compensation policies and practices in response to comments from our shareholders.
Communication with the Board If you wish to communicate with the Board, you may send correspondence to: Corporate Secretary, Deere & Company, One John Deere Place, Moline, Illinois 61265-8098. The Corporate Secretary will submit your correspondence to the Board or the appropriate committee, as applicable.
You may communicate directly with the Presiding Director by sending correspondence to: Presiding Director, Board of Directors, Deere & Company, Department A, One John Deere Place, Moline, Illinois 61265-8098.
Corporate Governance Policies Because we believe corporate governance is integral to creating long-term shareholder value, our Board of Directors has adopted company-wide Corporate Governance Policies, which are periodically reviewed and revised as appropriate to ensure that they reflect the Board's corporate governance objectives.

We have structured the compensation of our non-employee directors with the following objectives in mind:
[BEGIN TABLE]
—  Recognize the substantial investment of time and expertise necessary for the directors to discharge their duties to oversee Deere's global affairs 
[END TABLE]
We pay non-employee directors an annual retainer. In addition, committee chairpersons and the Presiding Director receive fees for assuming those responsibilities. Directors who are employees receive no additional compensation for serving on the Board. We do not pay committee member retainers or meeting fees, but we do reimburse directors for expenses related to meeting attendance.
To supplement their cash compensation and align their interests with those of our shareholders, non-employee directors are awarded restricted stock units (RSUs) after each Annual Meeting. A person who serves a partial term as a non-employee director will receive a prorated retainer and a prorated RSU award.
Compensation for non-employee directors is reviewed annually by the Corporate Governance Committee. At its December 2016 and December 2018 meetings, the Board approved compensation as noted below for non-employee directors as recommended by the Corporate Governance Committee. The cash components are effective on January 1 following approval and the equity component is effective for the annual award in March following approval.
The following chart describes amounts we pay and the value of awards we grant to non-employee directors:
Under our Non-employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan, directors may choose to defer some or all of their annual retainers until they retire from the Board. For deferrals through December 2016, a director could elect to have these deferrals invested in either an interest-bearing account or an account with a return equivalent to an investment in Deere common stock. For deferrals effective in January 2017 and later, directors may choose from a list of investment options, none of which yields an above-market earnings rate.
Our stock ownership guidelines require each non-employee director to own Deere common stock equivalent in value to at least three times the director's annual cash retainer. This ownership level must be achieved within five years of the date the director joins the Board. Restricted shares (regularly granted to non-employee directors prior to 2008), RSUs, and any common stock held personally by the non-employee director are included in determining whether the applicable ownership threshold has been reached. Each non-employee director has achieved stockholdings in excess of the applicable multiple as of the date of this Proxy Statement.
We require non-employee directors to hold all equity awards until the occurrence of one of the following triggering events: retirement from the Board, total and permanent disability, death, or a change in control of Deere combined with a qualifying
Table of Contents termination of the director. Directors may not sell, gift, or otherwise dispose of their equity awards before the occurrence of a triggering event. While the restrictions are in effect, non-employee directors may vote their restricted shares (but not shares underlying RSUs) and receive dividends on the restricted shares and dividend equivalents on the RSUs.
In fiscal 2018, we provided the following compensation to our non-employee directors:

The following table shows the number of shares of Deere common stock beneficially owned as of December 31, 2018, (unless otherwise indicated) by:

The Board has adopted a written Related Person Transactions Approval Policy that assigns our Corporate Governance Committee the responsibility for reviewing, approving, or ratifying all related person transactions.
The written Related Person Transactions Approval Policy is concerned with three types of "related persons": 
Each year, our directors and executive officers complete questionnaires designed to elicit information about potential related person transactions. In addition, the directors and officers must promptly advise our Corporate Secretary if there are any changes to the information they previously provided. After consultation with our General Counsel, management, and outside counsel, as appropriate, our Corporate Secretary determines whether any transaction is reasonably likely to be a related person transaction. Transactions deemed reasonably likely to be related person transactions are submitted to the Corporate Governance Committee for consideration at its next meeting, unless action is required sooner. In such a case, the transaction would be submitted to the Chairperson of the Corporate Governance Committee, whose determination would be reported to the full committee at its next meeting.
When evaluating potential related person transactions, the Corporate Governance Committee or its Chairperson, as applicable, considers all reasonably available relevant facts and circumstances and approves only those related person transactions determined in good faith to be in compliance with or not inconsistent with our Code of Ethics and Code of Business Conduct and in the best interests of our shareholders.
The sister of Mary K. W. Jones, Senior Vice President & General Counsel, is an employee in the Company's global communications department. Mrs. Jones does not directly or indirectly supervise her sister. During fiscal 2018, the employee earned approximately $136,288 in direct cash compensation along with customary employee benefits available to salaried employees generally. The employee's compensation is consistent with that of other employees at the same grade level. Pursuant to the Related Person Transactions Approval Policy, this transaction was approved by the Corporate Governance Committee after determining that it is not inconsistent with our Code of Ethics or Code of Business Conduct.
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and related regulations require our directors, certain of our officers, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and to provide copies of those reports to Deere.
To assist with these required reports, we have established procedures whereby directors and officers provide us with the relevant information regarding their transactions in Deere shares and we prepare and file the ownership reports on their behalf. In addition, our directors and officers have provided written statements regarding their Deere stock ownership and reports. Based solely upon a review of these statements and reports, we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our insiders were complied with during fiscal 2018.

Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our shareholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the executives named in the Summary Compensation Table of this Proxy Statement. Deere's practice, which was approved by our shareholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting, is to conduct this non-binding vote annually.
Supporting StatementPAY FOR PERFORMANCE Deere's compensation philosophy is to pay for performance, support Deere's business strategies, and offer competitive compensation. Our compensation programs consist of complementary elements that reward achievement of both short-term and long-term objectives. The metrics used for our incentive programs are either associated with operating performance or are based on a function of Deere's stock price with linkage to revenue growth and Total Shareholder Return (TSR). See "Review of Pay for Performance Relative to Peer Group" in the CD&A, which highlights our success in connecting executive compensation with Deere's financial performance.
PROGRAM DESIGN The CD&A offers a detailed description of our compensation programs and philosophy. Our compensation approach is supported by the following principles, among others, as fully described in the CD&A:
At our 2018 Annual Meeting, we held a shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation in which shareholders approved the advisory vote on the compensation of our NEOs.
The Board believes that the executive compensation as disclosed in the CD&A, the accompanying tables, and other disclosures in this Proxy Statement is consistent with our compensation philosophy and aligns with the pay practices of our peer group.
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the compensation of the NEOs as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the CD&A, tabular disclosures, and other narrative executive compensation disclosures."
Table of Contents
Effect of Proposal The say-on-pay resolution is non-binding, but the Board values your opinion as expressed through your votes and other communications. Therefore, the Board and the Compensation Committee will carefully consider the outcome of the advisory vote and those opinions when making future compensation decisions. However, the Board believes that the Compensation Committee is in the best position to consider the extensive information and factors necessary to make independent, objective, and competitive compensation recommendations and decisions that are in the best interests of Deere and its shareholders. Therefore, the final decision regarding the compensation and benefits of our executive officers and whether and how to address shareholder concerns remains with the Board and the Compensation Committee.
In this section, we provide a detailed description of our compensation programs, including the underlying philosophy and strategy, the individual elements, the methodology and processes used by the Board and the Compensation Committee (the Committee) to make compensation decisions, and the relationship between Deere's performance and compensation delivered in fiscal 2018. The discussion in this CD&A focuses on the compensation of our CEO, CFO, and the next three most highly compensated executive officers for the fiscal 2018. These individuals, referred to as Deere's named executive officers (NEOs), were:

Executive Summary
Our business strategy emphasizes achieving superior operating and financial performance throughout the business cycle. This includes maintaining aggressive goals for operating margin and asset turns while realizing sustainable Shareholder Value Added growth through disciplined expansion. Deere's compensation program is designed to motivate NEOs to execute this strategy.
In 2018, net sales and revenues reached $37.358 billion — second-highest in company history — and net income, though hindered by tax change provisions, totaled a fifth-highest $2.368 billion. Shareholder Value Added, our measure of economic profit, jumped 45 percent. These results reflect the success of our strategy. Deere employees controlled costs and increased the productivity of our assets, while also producing award-winning advanced products and services and investing in future growth.
Since aligning the metrics of our compensation program with our strategy in 2002, Deere has shown an ability to operate profitably throughout the business cycle.
Snapshot of Compensation ElementsThe components of our 2018 compensation program are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Fixed cash component  Annual cash award for profitability and efficient operations during the fiscal year  Cash award for sustained profitable growth during a three-year period  Equity award (consisting of RSUs, PSUs, and stock options) for creating shareholder value as reflected by stock price and revenue growth  Perquisites, retirement benefits, deferred compensation benefits, additional benefits payable upon a change in control 
  Metrics(1): Operating Return on Operating Assets (OROA) (2)(3), Return On Equity (ROE)(2), and net sales and revenues in current-year performance  Metrics: Shareholder Value Added (SVA)(3) and Total Shareholder Return (TSR) modifier to the payout  Metrics: Revenue Growth  
[END TABLE]
Our incentive program reflects the long-term, cyclical nature of our industry and provides a framework for both executive and broad-based, non-executive programs to ensure that all employees pursue the same financial and operational goals. The STI provides incentives to focus on near-term results, while a two-tiered long-term incentive program — LTIC and LTI — reward growth and sustainable profitability over a longer period. LTIC differs from LTI in that it motivates behavior for long-term profitability and asset management. Given the long-term, cyclical nature of our industry, the STI and LTIC metrics create complementary incentives. In the years since the Board adopted these two incentive plans, we have demonstrated the ability to manage through various business and market conditions more profitably and to consistently generate operating cash flow, especially compared to peer group companies. The current combination of cash- and equity-based long-term compensation reflects the current peer group practice, with about 40% maintaining a similar mix.

Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation Compensation Discussion and Analysis Executive Summary
To align compensation with our business strategy of exceptional operating performance, we historically have used OROA and ROE as the metrics for our STI plan. These metrics are designed to inspire the efficient use of assets and capital. STI goals are determined each year based on where we are in the business cycle to ensure that goals are uniformly challenging in all economic conditions. In fiscal 2017, two financial metrics—net sales and revenues and net income–were added to incorporate an element of growth into the annual award. Net income was removed as an STI metric beginning in fiscal 2018 due to its overlap with the margin focus of OROA. Incorporation of net sales and revenues continues to reflect the importance of excellent near-term financial execution and growth.
To align compensation with disciplined growth, we use SVA as the metric for our LTIC plan. SVA measures our success in delivering sustained growth in economic profitability over a three-year performance period.
To align compensation with exceptional equity appreciation and to motivate and reward sustained performance, our LTI plan uses stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs), whose ultimate values are tied to Deere's stock price, and performance stock units (PSUs), which are earned (or not) based on Deere's revenue growth compared to the performance peer group consisting of a subset of the S&P Industrial Sector.
Here are some of the key drivers that affect the STI, LTIC, and LTI metrics on a short- and long-term basis.
Financial Performance and Compensation MetricsAs outlined above, the metrics Deere uses to measure success in its business strategy are the same used in our compensation programs to ensure that employees are working in aligned, high-performance teams. Further details below illustrate how the company's compensation plans and payouts are sensitive to fluctuations in business conditions. Deere's goals for OROA remain above those of its major competitors.

Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation Compensation Discussion and Analysis Executive Summary
Shareholder OutreachIn 2018, we invited our top 20 shareholders to participate in discussions regarding executive compensation and governance issues. We engaged with 15 of our top 20 shareholders, representing about 40% of our outstanding shares, to ensure changes to our program were understood and aligned to their expectations. We discussed our approach to executive compensation programs, shareholder views on the program design, and the most recent revisions to our compensation plans, as well as various environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) topics important to investors.
Our learnings included:
We regularly analyze our practices to ensure we remain a leader in executive compensation best practices and remain aware of shareholder concerns. We believe the success of our STI and LTIC programs is due to our employee's deep understanding of OROA, ROE, and SVA, which will continue to be the primary metrics for our variable pay programs. We will continue regular shareholder engagement activities to gain their perspective firsthand.

Deere is committed to a longstanding compensation philosophy that incorporates the principles of paying for performance, supporting business strategies, and paying competitively. The Committee believes this philosophy continues to drive our NEOs and salaried employees to produce sustainable, positive results for Deere and our shareholders.
Snapshot of Compensation GovernanceTo ensure that our compensation program meets Deere's business objectives without compromising our core values, we regularly compare our compensation practices and governance against market best practices. Here are some of the best practices we have implemented.

Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation Compensation Discussion and Analysis 2018 Compensation Overview
Compensation ElementsThe primary elements of our compensation program are summarized below:
As this table suggests, we compare each component of compensation to the median level for that component awarded by our peers. In addition, we strive to have each NEO's total annual cash compensation and overall compensation at target compare favorably to the median levels for comparable executives. For example, in fiscal 2018, our CEO's base salary and target STI were 29% of his overall compensation, compared to an average of 28% for CEOs in our peer group.
Table of Contents
2018 Target Direct Compensation MixPay for performance is an essential element of our compensation philosophy. We believe compensation should motivate our executives to substantially contribute — both individually and collaboratively — to Deere's long-term, sustainable growth. To that end, our performance-based compensation program consists of three components (STI, LTIC, and LTI), all driven by metrics that align with Deere's business strategy and reflect the cyclical nature of the industries in which Deere operates.
To enhance the connection between pay and performance, as our NEOs assume greater responsibility, we award a larger portion of their total compensation in the form of "at risk" incentive awards and a larger portion of their incentive awards in the form of equity. This practice is apparent in the following charts, which illustrate the allocation of all fiscal 2018 Direct Compensation components at target for our CEO and for our other NEOs as a group.
* "at risk" implies awards that are subject to performance conditions and stock price performance
Table of Contents
As shown in the Target Compensation Mix charts under 2018 Compensation Overview, the majority of direct compensation for the CEO and NEOs is based on "at-risk," variable pay. Our performance-based compensation programs fall into two categories: short-term incentives based on annual metrics and long-term incentives based on a three-year performance period. Long-term performance based incentives are awarded in the form of cash and equity (RSUs, PSUs, and stock options). The following information describes each direct compensation element, including the applicable performance metrics.
Base SalaryIn determining salary levels for each of our NEOs, the Committee considers factors such as the financial and operational performance, leadership, development of people, time in position, internal equity, and potential. The Committee also considers each NEO's current salary as compared to the salary range and median salary practices of our peer group.
Short-Term Incentive (STI)PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR STIThe Committee believes that operating margins, efficient deployment of Deere's assets (both fixed and working capital), and growth are key drivers in creating long-term shareholder value. For this reason, the Committee has designed the STI program to motivate Deere's executives and most other salaried employees to focus on reducing costs and optimizing asset and capital efficiency no matter where we are in the business cycle each fiscal year. By consistently managing OROA results through all points in the business cycle, Deere has been able to pay out more than half of cash flow from our operations to investors through dividends and net share repurchases since 2004.
In fiscal 2018, we used three distinct metrics to motivate employees, reflecting key differences between our manufacturing and financing businesses while also keeping a balanced focus on growth. For the two businesses that make up our Equipment Operations segment — Agriculture & Turf Operations and Construction & Forestry Operations — the metric is OROA. For our Financial Services segment, the metric is ROE. To measure successful short-term financial execution, the metric is net sales and revenues. As described below, the performance results for these metrics are combined to determine STI awards.
For fiscal 2018, the various business results were weighted to calculate STI as follows:
The emphasis on the OROA performance of the Equipment Operations and its constituent divisions in calculating STI reflects the critical position these operations have as drivers of Deere's business: Equipment Operations' net sales accounted for 89%
Table of Contents of Deere's net sales and revenues in fiscal 2018. The 50% weighting for the combined Equipment Operations reflects the importance of employees' aligning with the overall business strategies and not optimizing within a business segment.
We explain the metrics and the reasons behind them in this section. You can see how OROA and ROE were calculated for fiscal 2018 in Appendix B, "Deere & Company Reconciliation of Variable Compensation Measures to Non-GAAP Measures."
OROA Deere is primarily a manufacturing company with high investment in fixed assets, such as buildings and machinery, and significant expenses with longer term payoffs, such as research and development. Over the past few decades, Deere's Equipment Operations businesses have weathered many business downturns. Among other things, this segment is affected by economic factors such as prices for commodities (such as corn and other crops) and the health of the housing and infrastructure sectors because we make the equipment that farmers and contractors rely on. When commodity prices are low or the housing and infrastructure sectors are weak, our customers delay equipment purchases and upgrades.
In 2004, Deere adopted a strategy designed to enable management to respond quickly and purposefully to changing business conditions to drive sustained operational results across volatile business cycles. A focus on OROA performance was and continues to be a key component of this strategy. The Committee believes OROA effectively measures the efficient use of the Equipment Operations' assets and the ability to manage operating margins under varying business conditions and is an appropriate metric for STI awards. Using OROA as an STI performance metric aligns employee decisions with our strategic approach to sound investment of capital and asset utilization. Because business conditions can quickly change, the Committee sets a range of OROA goals for a range of potential conditions rather than for a static forecast. This allows us to be agile and encourages us to prepare in advance for a variety of business conditions.
Foundational to understanding how we determine the OROA goals for a given fiscal year is the concept of mid-cycle sales. We calculate mid-cycle sales annually by gathering historical information on the size of the industry (for example, the total number of tractors sold in the U.S. market) and Deere's market share for every product line (in this example, the number of tractors sold by Deere). This information helps us understand the cyclical nature, from peak to trough, of our business. Mid-cycle sales are determined for each product line, which could be in varying business cycles within the same performance period. This allows us to set meaningful operating performance goals at the product line level while maintaining a unified incentive program for the salaried employee population. For most of our Agriculture & Turf products, a typical business cycle is around seven years. For the Construction & Forestry products, the cycle tends to be a bit shorter. As shown in the graph below, we use that historical information to determine mid-cycle sales — essentially our best estimate of what "normal" looks like.
WHAT IS MID-CYCLE?
Generally speaking, at the peak of a typical business cycle, actual sales constitute 120% of mid-cycle sales; at the trough, actual sales constitute 80% of mid-cycle sales. OROA goals vary each year to reflect where we are on this spectrum. We have relied on the process of analyzing mid-cycle sales for decades to make decisions related to measuring the achievement of long-term business strategies, allocating manufacturing capacity and workforce, and determining standard costs.
Table of Contents
Mid-cycle goals. The Committee first established OROA goals for STI purposes by comparing Deere's OROA performance to that of the companies in our peer group. The median OROA for the peer group is in the range of 10%-15%. Accordingly, Deere's original target OROA at mid-cycle (the "normal" part of a business cycle) was set at 12%. That goal provided a reasonable approximation of Deere's cost of capital and aligned with our compensation strategy of awarding median pay for median performance. The Committee then set OROA goals for threshold and maximum STI payouts at mid-cycle to approximate 25th and 75th percentile performance, respectively, relative to the peer group. The Committee has reviewed and approved the goals each year, but because peer group OROA performance has essentially remained consistent, the OROA goals at mid-cycle also remained unchanged until recently, as discussed below. The OROA goals are the same for Equipment Operations, Agriculture & Turf Operations, and Construction & Forestry Operations.
Goals for peak and trough conditions. To maintain the rigor of the program, the Committee cannot just set goals for mid-cycle, or "normal" conditions. If OROA goals were consistent regardless of where we are in a business cycle, our employees would be unduly rewarded when the economy is strong and penalized for poor general economic conditions that have a negative effect on our sales. Therefore, the Committee fixes threshold, target, and maximum OROA goals that are more ambitious at the peak of a business cycle, when it is easier to cover fixed costs and achieve a high asset turnover (and thus a better OROA), and less ambitious at the trough. This model encourages us to quickly make necessary structural changes, such as those related to cost reduction, capacity, and assets (especially inventory) as business conditions change during the year.
As shown in the following graph, the goals for a given year are determined based on where we are in the business cycle.
Table of Contents
Recent changes in the OROA goals. In the years since we adopted OROA as an enterprise-wide performance metric, Deere has significantly restructured its Equipment Operations to enable more rapid responses to changing business conditions. The products we sell are subject to cycles. To put these cycles in perspective, the table below shows our OROA and net sales over the past 20 years. Note that since the adoption of OROA as an enterprise-wide metric in 2004, our OROA performance has exceeded the peer group even when we experienced volatile business conditions (as reflected by net sales):
Deere's sustained success in delivering OROA performance under varying business conditions had resulted in continued maximum or near-maximum STI payouts in recent fiscal years. To continue to improve operational performance and seize the benefits of Deere's structural transformation, the Committee raised OROA goals for STI purposes to align more appropriately to the current business strategy. In making this decision, the Committee determined that Deere should be measured relative to its own capabilities and aspirations in addition to its performance relative to the peer group. As the following charts show, the executive OROA goals implemented in fiscal 2018 are significantly more rigorous at mid-cycle and peak than they have been historically. Going forward, the compensation goals will be reviewed annually and may be adjusted to reflect changes in the business, up or down, to continue to align with the enterprise strategy.
The following graph shows the significant changes to the OROA goals from fiscal year 2017 to 2018.
Table of Contents
As shown in the table below, OROA goals have become more aggressive since 2015.
ROE ROE is the STI performance metric for Financial Services. The Financial Services business is a key differentiator for how Deere delivers value to our dealers and customers, so we think it is important to consider Financial Services' performance as part of STI. The Committee believes ROE effectively measures the efficient use of the segment's equity, and ROE is commonly used in the financial services industry for that purpose. We have two distinct business models within Financial Services and we use different ROE goals for each.
Historically, approximately 65% of Financial Services' business is subsidized. Under the "subsidized business" model, the Equipment Operations provide subsidies to Financial Services to reduce the interest rates that our customers and dealers would otherwise pay on financial products. These subsidies were created to facilitate sales by the Equipment Operations, not to maximize Financial Services' profitability. For this reason, the ROE goal for the subsidized business — 10% — is the same regardless of the business cycle and is based on the implied after-tax cost of equity for Financial Services. Analysis shows that our threshold ROE goal of 10% represents upper-quartile performance compared to other financial institutions.
The remaining Financial Services offerings are referred to as the "non-subsidized business." The objective of the non-subsidized business is to efficiently utilize equity to earn a profitable return. Consequently, this business has more traditional (and progressively more challenging) goals for threshold, target, and maximum ROE. The Committee establishes goal levels by benchmarking against ROEs attained by similar financial services businesses with similar debt-to-equity ratios and by evaluating cost-of-equity financial models. The threshold goal equals the implied after-tax cost of equity for Financial Services; the target and maximum ROE goals are set at progressively higher levels to encourage management and employees to efficiently utilize equity relative to industry norms and market conditions while facilitating sales by the Equipment Operations. The ROE goals of 13% at target and 16% at maximum represent an even greater level of stretch, raising the difficulty of attaining target payouts. We regularly review the ROE of other financial institutions to ensure the appropriate level of stretch.
ROE goals are weighted based on the actual mix of subsidized versus non-subsidized business in a fiscal year. The Committee approved the following ROE goals at the beginning of fiscal 2018:
NET SALES AND REVENUES In 2017, two additional financial metrics — net sales and revenues and net income — were added to incorporate a growth factor into the incentive calculation. Between OROA and net sales and revenues, there was significant overlap with the net income measure. To simplify the calculation, the net income metric was removed starting with fiscal 2018. This simplified the mix, but still retains a balanced focus between margin and disciplined growth. STI weighting includes two-thirds OROA and one-third net sales and revenues.
Table of Contents
The Committee set target goals for net sales and revenues at the beginning of fiscal 2018 based on input from management regarding our expected performance for the upcoming year. The goal for a target payout matches the number established in our annual operating budget forecast — what we call the Original Budget. Net sales and revenues that falls more than 15% below target will result in no payout on that metric. Conversely, net sales and revenues that exceeds target by at least 15% will result in a maximum (200%) payout on that metric.
APPROVAL OF STI AWARD RATES At the beginning of the fiscal year, after review and consideration of Deere's peer group data for target cash bonuses, the Committee approves target STI rates as a percentage of each NEO's base salary. The target STI rates for fiscal 2018 were as follows:
Regardless of the award amount reached by applying these payout rates, no individual award under the STI plan may exceed $5 million or 200% of target.
FISCAL 2018 PERFORMANCE RESULTS FOR STI
The chart below shows OROA results for the Agriculture & Turf Operations, the Construction & Forestry Operations, and Equipment Operations as a whole, based on actual sales volumes:
Table of Contents
Those results, together with ROE for Financial Services, are weighted to determine STI, as follows:
The amount of the STI award paid to an NEO is calculated as follows:
STI AWARD CALCULATIONS
[BEGIN TABLE]
Base salary for the fiscal year ✕   Target STI rate ✕   Actual performance as a percentage of target =   STI award amount 
Base salary for the fiscal year ✕   Target STI rate ✕   Actual performance as a percentage of target =   STI award amount 
[END TABLE]
Actual STI awards paid to NEOs are shown in the table to the right and detailed in the Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table under footnote (4).
The STI goals and the results for fiscal 2018 previously described are used to determine the STI awards paid to executive-level employees (representing approximately 120 top-level employees). For fiscal 2018, STI awards paid to the NEOs consisted of approximately 1% of the total amount of STI awards paid to all eligible employees.
Long-Term Incentive Cash (LTIC) LTIC, formerly known as Mid-Term Incentive (MTI), is a long-term cash award based on Deere's performance against ambitious goals for Shareholder Value Added (SVA) over a three-year performance period. The plan name was changed, effective with the performance cycle beginning with fiscal 2018, to more clearly define all variable pay plans that span multiple years as long-term incentives.
SHAREHOLDER VALUE ADDED PERFORMANCE METRIC The LTIC plan is designed to motivate executives and other salaried employees to consistently create lasting value. To that end, since the LTIC plan was first implemented, the performance metric has been Deere's SVA, which essentially measures operating profit in excess of our cost of capital.
Table of Contents
SVA was selected as the LTIC performance metric because the Committee believes Deere should:
We believe Deere can realize sustainable improvement in SVA through a combination of revenue growth and high returns on invested capital. SVA incorporates both of these concepts and therefore serves as a barometer of long-term value.
SVA is measured on an enterprise-wide level. As a result, the LTIC plan encourages teamwork across all of our business units. In fiscal years 1994 through 2003 (the 10 years before we implemented the LTIC plan), accumulated SVA was negative $1.4 billion. In the 10 most recent fiscal years, accumulated SVA rose to $17 billion. This demonstrates that management has become adept at investing for the future while still delivering consistent shareholder returns.
We demonstrate how SVA is calculated in Appendix B, "Deere & Company Reconciliation of Variable Compensation Measures to Non-GAAP Measures."
MODIFICATION OF AWARDS BASED ON RELATIVE TSR In an effort to further align executive compensation with shareholder interests, the Committee added a relative TSR modifier to potential LTIC payouts for our NEOs and certain other executive officers. Starting with the performance period that began in fiscal 2015, we compare Deere's TSR to TSR for the S&P Industrial Sector during the same time frame. The Committee chose the S&P Industrial Sector as a benchmark because it is an independently selected comparator group that includes a majority of our peer group companies. This index is also used to measure relative performance for PSUs under our long-term incentive plan. If Deere's TSR is at or below the 25th percentile of the index, the final LTIC payout for our senior executives will be reduced by 25%. If Deere's TSR is between the 25th and 50th percentiles, the final LTIC payout for our senior executives will be reduced by up to 25%, as shown in the following charts. The TSR modifier ensures that senior executives will not get the full LTIC award unless Deere's TSR is at least at the median of the index. In the initial modifier, there was no upside potential for outperforming the 50th percentile.
Beginning with the performance period starting with fiscal 2018, the TSR modifier was amended to include an upside opportunity when performance is between the 50th and 75th percentile and also to create a steeper reduction when TSR performance is below the 50th percentile. The performance peer group for TSR purposes was amended to a subset of the S&P 500 Industrial Sector. This smaller group of around 40 peer companies is more closely aligned by industry or related to agricultural and construction business cycles. The same smaller peer group is used as the comparator group for PSU metrics. The charts below show how the different modifiers operate at different TSR rankings. In the original modifier, the reduction amount is subtracted from the SVA performance payout factor; the new modifier will apply a multiplicative percentage to the payout factor.
TSR MODIFIER FOR LTIC PAYMENTS
Table of Contents
THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIODS The Committee approved three-year performance periods for LTIC awards to emphasize the importance of consistent, sustained operating performance. We believe employees are motivated to achieve consistently strong SVA results because, as we illustrate under "Historical Accumulated SVA, LTIC Goals, and LTIC Payouts," each year affects award calculations in three separate rolling performance periods. Whether positive or negative, SVA results for each year become part of the LTIC award calculation for that year and the next two years. Consequently, negative SVA in one year can offset positive SVA in another. A single year of strong performance will not result in a high LTIC payout if it follows one or two years of weak performance. Conversely, LTIC payouts will not necessarily be low after a year of weak performance if results in the two preceding years were strong.
SETTING SVA GOALS Each year, two principles guide the Committee in setting the accumulated maximum SVA goal for the next three-year performance period. First, the goal for a maximum payout reflects return on invested capital performance in the top 25% relative to our peer group. Second, the goal for a maximum payout is calculated based on estimated enterprise SVA at mid-cycle sales levels (previously described under "Performance Metrics for STI") for the first year of the performance period. We cannot confidently forecast SVA for the second and third years of the performance period. Instead, we assume a compounded 7% annual growth rate (a number that corresponds to Deere's historical sales growth rate) for each of the remaining two years to arrive at a cumulative three-year SVA goal. Once set, the goal is a fixed amount for the performance period.
As mentioned above, the maximum SVA goal represents top-quartile invested capital performance, which is an aggressive stretch under "normal" business conditions. Accordingly, the target SVA goal is set at half of that amount. The threshold accumulated SVA goal was raised to $5 million starting with the performance period that ended with fiscal 2015. The threshold goal was increased to avoid nominal payouts to eligible participants.
The following table details the threshold, target, and maximum accumulated SVA goals for each performance period that includes fiscal 2018. The SVA goals grew significantly more challenging for the performance periods ending in 2015 through 2017: sales volumes for agricultural equipment increased, which led to a substantial increase in mid-cycle sales and increased expectations for SVA. As the recent business downturn became part of the business cycle, mid-cycle volumes decreased, resulting in slightly lower mid-cycle SVA for the performance periods ending in 2018 through 2020. Although the SVA goals have decreased, the same level of goal rigor exists due to the downturn in business conditions. The SVA goals have increased at a compounded annual rate of 9% since the LTIC plan was introduced in 2004.
APPROVAL OF LTIC AWARD RATES At the beginning of each performance period, after considering data for our peer group, the Committee approves target LTIC award rates as a percentage of the median salary for each NEO's salary grade. For the performance period that begins in 2018, the target rates were increased to align closer to peers and market changes. The following table shows the target payout rates, as a percent of the median salary for the NEOs, approved by the Committee for the performance period ended in 2018 and the rate changes that apply to the performance period beginning in fiscal 2018.
Table of Contents
Regardless of the amount calculated for each award using these payout rates, no employee can receive an award under the LTIC plan that exceeds $6 million or 200% of target.
FISCAL 2018 PERFORMANCE RESULTS FOR LTIC The following table shows Deere's accumulated SVA, calculated as described in Appendix B, for the three-year performance period ended in 2018, which resulted in a payout of 83%.

CALCULATION OF LTIC AWARDS
The amount of the LTIC award paid to a NEO is calculated as follows:
Actual LTIC awards paid to the NEOs are shown in the table to the right and detailed in the Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table under footnote (4).
The results for the performance period ended in 2018 are also used to determine the LTIC awards for other eligible employees worldwide. LTIC awards paid to the NEOs for fiscal 2018 consisted of approximately 4.4% of the total amount of LTIC awards paid to all eligible employees.
Long-Term Incentive (LTI) The LTI is designed to reward the NEOs for creating sustained shareholder value, to encourage ownership of Deere stock, to foster teamwork, and to retain and motivate high-caliber executives while aligning their interests with those of our shareholders. LTI awards consist of three components: performance stock units (PSUs), restricted stock units (RSUs), and market-priced stock options all awarded annually under the John Deere Omnibus Equity and Incentive Plan (Omnibus Plan). The Omnibus Plan is periodically approved by our shareholders and was last approved at the Annual Meeting in February 2015.
FISCAL 2018 LTI AWARD OVERVIEW FOR NEOS
 *Based on Deere's compounded annual growth rate
Table of Contents
Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation Compensation Discussion and Analysis Direct Compensation Elements
APPROVAL OF LTI AWARD VALUES The Committee established LTI grants for the NEOs based on the following criteria: level of responsibility, individual performance, current market practice, peer group data, and the number of shares available under the Omnibus Plan. Awards granted in previous years are not a factor in determining the current year's LTI award, nor is potential accumulated wealth.
At the first Committee meeting of each fiscal year, after consideration of peer group data on median values for long-term incentives, the Committee approves a dollar value for a base-level LTI award and the mix of awards to be delivered. The grant price is the closing price of Deere common stock on the NYSE on the grant date. The grant price is used to determine the number of PSUs, RSUs, and stock options to be awarded.
As has been the practice for several years, the Committee can increase (up to 20%) or decrease (down to $0) an individual NEO's base-level award to distinguish that executive's performance, deliver a particular LTI value, or reflect other adjustments as the Committee deems appropriate. For fiscal 2018, the Committee approved adjustments to base-level award values ranging up to 20% to recognize the accomplishments of the individual NEOs. LTI awards were approved for the NEOs as follows:
*The amounts shown include PSUs valued at the grant price on the date of grant. These amounts differ from the value of equity awards shown in the Fiscal Year 2018 Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards table because those tables reflect the probable outcome of the performance metrics for PSUs.
See the Fiscal 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table and footnotes for more information on LTI awards delivered, as well as the terms of the awards.
For fiscal 2018, the number of RSUs and PSUs granted to the NEOs represented 9% and 52%, respectively, of the total RSUs and PSUs granted to all eligible salaried employees; stock options granted to the NEOs represented 30% of the total stock options granted to eligible salaried employees.
CONVERSION OF PSUs TO DEERE STOCK For PSUs granted in fiscal 2018 (December 2017), the actual number of shares to be issued upon conversion will be based solely on Deere's revenue growth for the three-year performance period ending in 2020. Relative TSR as a standalone measure will no longer apply to equity awards, but will continue to be used as a modifier of the LTIC award only. Deere's performance for PSU purposes will be measured relative to a subset of the companies in the S&P Industrial Sector as of the end of the performance period. The new performance peer group represents a more closely aligned industry comparison to our company.
For the PSU performance periods ending in 2018 and 2019, the actual number of shares to be issued will still be based equally on Deere's revenue growth and TSR performance ranking, as compared to companies in the S&P Industrial Sector.
PERFORMANCE TARGETS (PERFORMANCE PERIOD ENDING IN 2020)
Table of Contents
Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation Compensation Discussion and Analysis Direct Compensation Elements
The number of PSUs that vest and convert to shares can range from 0% to 200% of the number of PSUs awarded, depending on Deere's relative performance during the performance period, as illustrated in the following table:
These performance targets reflect the Committee's belief that median levels of relative performance should lead to median levels of compensation.
PAYOUT CAP ON PSUs In response to shareholder concerns, for PSUs that vest at the end of fiscal 2019, the payout for the PSU portion will be capped at target if Deere's TSR is negative, regardless of how Deere compares to its peers. PSUs that vest after 2019 will no longer be measured on TSR and therefore the cap on this metric is eliminated. Relative TSR will remain a metric for the modifier on the LTIC payout.
PERFORMANCE PERIOD 2016-2018 PSUs The performance period for PSUs granted in fiscal 2016 ended on October 31, 2018. The final number of shares earned was based on Deere's revenue growth and TSR relative to the S&P Industrial Sector over the three-year performance period. The Committee made its final payout determination in December 2018 following a review of the relative performances of Deere and the S&P Industrial Sector. Deere's revenue growth and TSR were comparable to the 80th and 85th percentiles, respectively. This resulted in an overall payout of 200% of target. This compared to an overall payout of PSUs relative to target for each of the five prior three-year performance periods ending in fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2017 of 100%, 48.5%, 0%, 33.5% and 100%, respectively.
LTI REPORTED VERSUS REALIZABLE VALUE
The values for Stock and Option Awards included on the Summary Compensation Table are presented in accordance with SEC requirements. Although this allows for comparison across companies, the Committee feels the prescribed calculation does not fully represent the Committee's annual decision and does not support a valid CEO pay-for-performance assessment. To calculate the realizable value, the stock units from the LTI awards granted in 2016, 2017, and 2018 are valued using the fiscal year end stock price. The value of PSUs also takes into consideration the current year payout and the current performance for the performance cycles in-process (2017-2019 and 2018-2020). The value of options is calculated using the Black-Scholes value as of fiscal year end. The following chart compares the LTI values reported on the Summary Compensation Table to Mr. Allen's realizable LTI value for each of the grants in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The three-year TSR as of October 31, 2018, is 22.9%.

REPORTED VS. REALIZABLE LTI VALUE
Summary of Direct Compensation The Committee believes each pay element included in Direct Compensation is consistent with our compensation philosophy. The Committee reviews Direct Compensation for the NEOs in the aggregate (excluding the CEO) as well as for each NEO individually and compares this compensation to the market position data of our peer group. This market position data takes into account the level of responsibility (including the level of sales volume) for each NEO's respective operations.
A key element of these individual performance evaluations is a careful analysis of each NEO's collaboration and contribution to the success of a high-performing team. Thus, while the market data for each position is a factor in reviewing Direct Compensation, the Committee also considers individual fulfillment of duties, teamwork, development, time in position, experience, and internal equity among NEOs other than the CEO. The Committee recognizes individual performance through adjustments to base salary and LTI.
Direct Compensation for the CEO is higher than for the other NEOs due to the CEO's breadth of executive and operating responsibilities for the entire global enterprise. The Committee does not target CEO compensation as a certain multiple of the compensation of the other NEOs. The relationship between the CEO's compensation and that of the other NEOs is influenced by our organizational structure, which does not currently include a chief operating officer. The ratio of Mr. Allen's Direct Compensation to that of the other NEOs is generally comparable to that found among the companies in our peer group.
Other Compensation Matters RULES RELATED TO STOCK OWNERSHIP, HOLDING REQUIREMENTS, AND ANTI-HEDGING AND ANTI-PLEDGING POLICIES NEOs are required to hold a certain amount of Deere stock. The CEO is expected to hold stock equivalent to 6 times base salary and the other NEOs are expected to hold stock equivalent to 3.5 times base salary. These ownership levels must be achieved within five years of the date the NEO is first appointed as CEO or as an executive officer. NEOs who have not achieved the requisite ownership level may not transfer any of the stock they acquire through our equity incentive plan. Only vested RSUs and any common stock held personally by an NEO are included in determining whether the applicable ownership requirement has been met. Once an NEO achieves the appropriate ownership level, the number of shares held at that time becomes that individual's fixed stock ownership requirement for three years, even if base salary increases or Deere's stock price decreases.
Our Insider Trading Policy precludes all directors and employees, including our NEOs, and their related persons from engaging in short sales of Deere's stock or trading in instruments designed to hedge against or offset price declines by any Deere securities. Our Insider Trading Policy also prohibits our directors and officers from holding Deere stock in margin accounts or pledging Deere stock as collateral for loans or other obligations.

LIMITATIONS ON DEDUCTIBILITY OF COMPENSATION Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform") that was signed into law December 22, 2017, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limited to $1 million the U.S. federal income tax deductibility of compensation paid in one year to a company's CEO or any of its three next-highest-paid executive officers (other than its Chief Financial Officer). Performance-based compensation was not subject to this limit on deductibility so long as such compensation met certain requirements, including shareholder approval of material terms. The Committee strived to provide the NEOs with incentive compensation programs that preserved the tax deductibility of compensation paid by Deere, to the extent reasonably practicable and consistent with Deere's other compensation objectives.
The Tax Reform includes a major overhaul of Section 162(m), which takes effect for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Amongst other provisions, it retained the $1 million deduction limit, but repealed the performance-based compensation exemption. The Tax Reform also expanded the definition of "covered employees" to include the Chief Financial Officer and any executive who is subject to the limitation in tax years beginning after 2016. As a result, beginning with Deere's fiscal 2019, compensation paid to our named executive officers in excess of $1 million will not be deductible for tax purposes unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain binding written performance-based compensation arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. No assurance can be given that any future compensation will qualify for the transition relief. While the Committee will continue to consider the tax deductibility of compensation as one of many factors, the Committee believes shareholder interests are best served by not restricting the Committee's discretion and flexibility in structuring compensation programs to attract, retain, and motivate key executives, even though such programs may result in non-deductible compensation expense.
RECOUPMENT OF PREVIOUSLY PAID INCENTIVE COMPENSATION Deere's Executive Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy authorizes the Committee to determine whether to require recoupment of cash and equity incentive compensation paid to or deferred by certain executives under certain conditions. Under the policy, the Committee may require recoupment if the Committee determines an executive received incentive compensation that was artificially inflated because the executive engaged in misconduct that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
— contributed to the need for a restatement of all or a portion of Deere's financial statements filed with the SEC or 
— contributed to an incorrect calculation of operating metrics that are used to determine incentive plan payouts 
[END TABLE]
The Committee is closely monitoring the proposed rules and rule amendments issued by the SEC to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to recoupment of incentive-based compensation and will amend the Recoupment Policy if necessary when the final rules are adopted.
Perquisites We offer our NEOs various perquisites that the Committee believes are reasonable in order to remain competitive. These perquisites, which are described in footnote (6) to the Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table, constitute a small percentage of the NEOs' total compensation. The Committee conducts an annual review of the perquisites offered to the NEOs. In addition to the items listed in footnote (6), NEOs, as well as other selected employees, are provided indoor parking at no incremental cost to Deere.
The Board requires the CEO to use company-owned aircraft for all business and personal travel because the ability to travel safely and efficiently provides substantial benefits that justify the cost. The geographic location of Deere's headquarters in the Midwest, more than 150 miles from a major metropolitan airport, makes personal and business travel challenging. Moreover, traveling by company aircraft allows the CEO to conduct business confidentially while in transit. Personal use of company aircraft by other NEOs is minimal and must be approved by the CEO. The Committee has limited the CEO's annual personal usage of company aircraft to approximately 100 hours.

Retirement Benefits All NEOs are covered by the same defined benefit pension plans, which include the same plan terms that apply to most qualifying U.S. salaried employees. We also maintain two additional defined benefit pension plans in which NEOs may participate: the Senior Supplementary Pension Benefit Plan (the "Senior Supplementary Plan") and the John Deere Supplemental Pension Benefit Plan (the "Deere Supplemental Plan").
The tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans have compensation limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Senior Supplementary Plan provides participants with the same benefit they would have received without those limits. This avoids the relative disadvantage that participants would experience compared to other qualified plan participants. The Deere Supplemental Plan is designed to reward career service at Deere above a specified grade level by utilizing a formula that takes into account only years of service above that grade level. We believe the defined benefit plans serve as important retention tools, provide a level of competitive income upon retirement, and reward long-term employment and service as an officer of Deere. In addition, the fact that the Senior Supplementary and Deere Supplemental Plans are unfunded (with benefit payments under these plans being made out of the general assets of Deere) and therefore at-risk (if Deere were to seek bankruptcy protection), creates a strong incentive for the NEOs to minimize risks that could jeopardize Deere's long-term financial health. For additional information, see the Fiscal 2018 Pension Benefits Table, along with the accompanying narrative and footnotes.
We also maintain a tax-qualified defined contribution plan, the John Deere Savings and Investment Plan (SIP), which is available to most of our U.S. employees, including the NEOs. We make matching contributions to participating SIP accounts on up to six percent of an employee's pay. The actual amount of the company match varies based on two factors: the STI results for the most recently completed fiscal year (see the "Fiscal 2018 Performance Results for STI" section) and the pension option in which the employee participates (see the narrative preceding the Fiscal 2018 Pension Benefits Table). The following table illustrates Deere's match for calendar 2018, which is reported for our NEOs under the "All Other Compensation" column of the Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table:
Deferred Compensation Benefits We also maintain certain deferred compensation plans that provide the NEOs with longer-term savings opportunities on a tax-efficient basis. Similar deferred compensation benefits are commonly offered by companies with which we compete for talent.
As of November 1, 2015, for the Defined Contribution Restoration Plan and as of November 1, 2016, for the Deferred Plan, the investment options now parallel the investment options offered under our 401(k) plan, with certain limited exceptions. Funds deferred prior to these effective dates may remain invested under the previous options, although participants also may move these funds into the new options. Additionally, participants may change investment options at any time. These changes effectively ensure that participants cannot earn above-market interest on new deferrals.
See the "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" section for additional details.

Potential Payments upon Change in Control Deere's Change in Control Severance Program (the "CIC Program") covers certain executives, including each of the NEOs, and is intended to facilitate continuity of management in the event of a change in control. The Committee believes the CIC Program:
For more information, see "Fiscal 2018 Potential Payments upon Change in Control" and the corresponding table.
Other Potential Post-Employment Payments Deere's various plans and policies provide payments to NEOs upon certain types of employment terminations that are not related to a change in control. These events and amounts are explained in the section under Executive Compensation Tables entitled "Fiscal 2018 Potential Payments upon Termination of Employment Other than Following a Change in Control."
Independent Review and Approval of Executive Compensation The Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving goals and objectives related to incentive compensation for the majority of salaried employees. In particular, the Committee evaluates the NEOs' performance in relation to established goals and ultimately approves compensation for the NEOs (except for the CEO). All substantive responsibilities related to the determination of compensation of the NEOs are undertaken exclusively by the members of the Committee, all of whom are independent under current NYSE listing standards.
The Committee periodically reviews the components of our compensation program to ensure the program is aligned with our business strategy, Deere's performance, and the interests of our employees and shareholders. In addition, the Committee regularly reviews market practices for all significant elements of executive compensation and approves necessary adjustments to ensure Deere's compensation remains competitive.
Generally, at the Board meeting in August, the full Board (in executive session without the CEO present) evaluates the CEO's performance. The Committee considers the results of that evaluation when providing recommendations to the independent members of the Board for the CEO's compensation, which they then approve. The CEO does not play a role in and is not present during discussions regarding his own compensation.
The CEO plays a significant role in setting the compensation for the other NEOs. At the Committee meeting in December, the CEO evaluates each NEO's individual performance and recommends changes to the NEOs' base salaries and LTI awards. (The CEO is not involved in setting the STI and LTIC awards because they are calculated using predetermined factors.) The Committee has the discretion to accept, reject, or modify the CEO's recommendations. No other executive officers play a substantive role in setting an NEO's compensation.

The Role of the Compensation Consultant The Committee has retained Pearl Meyer, LLC (Pearl Meyer) as its compensation consultant. Pearl Meyer reviews our executive compensation program design and assesses our compensation approach relative to our performance and the market. The Committee has sole responsibility for setting and modifying the fees paid to Pearl Meyer, determining the nature and scope of its services, and evaluating its performance and can terminate Pearl Meyer's engagement or hire another compensation consultant at any time.
Pearl Meyer periodically meets independently with the Chair of the Committee and regularly participates in executive sessions with the Committee (without any executives or other Deere personnel present) to review compensation data and discuss compensation matters. While the Committee values this expert advice, ultimately the Committee's decisions reflect many factors and considerations. Management works with Pearl Meyer at the Committee's direction to develop materials and analysis, such as competitive market assessments and summaries of current legal and regulatory developments, which are essential to the Committee's compensation determinations.
During fiscal 2018, Pearl Meyer performed the following specific services:
Pearl Meyer does not provide other significant services to Deere and has no other direct or indirect business relationships with Deere or any of its affiliates. Taking these and other factors into account, the Committee has determined that the work performed by Pearl Meyer does not raise any conflicts of interest. Additionally, based on its analysis of the factors identified in the Committee's charter as being relevant to compensation consultant independence, the Committee has concluded that Pearl Meyer is independent of Deere's management.

Market Analysis PEER GROUP The companies in the peer group for our fiscal 2018 market analysis process, listed in the chart below, are similar to Deere in terms of sales volume, products, services, market capitalization, and global presence.
Compensation paid by our peer group is representative of the compensation we believe is required to attract, retain, and motivate executive talent. The Committee, in consultation with Pearl Meyer, periodically reviews the peer group to confirm that it remains an appropriate point of reference for NEO compensation.
REVIEW OF PAY FOR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO PEER GROUP To ensure that total compensation for our NEOs aligns with the market, we compared our compensation and performance against the companies in our peer group. As part of this comparison, we evaluate our peers' mix of cash versus equity and short-term versus long-term components.
In addition, we reviewed the relationship between total realizable compensation and our performance for the three fiscal years ended with fiscal year 2017 — the most recent fiscal year-end for which we can obtain corresponding compensation information for our peer companies. This review helps the Committee understand whether total compensation delivered to our NEOs aligns with our performance relative to our peer group. For purposes of this review, we use TSR to measure performance.
The analysis, as shown in the following graphs, reveals that realizable pay for Deere's CEO and other NEOs was reasonably aligned with Deere's relative TSR over the relevant time period. Based on these results and the results of similar past comparisons of pay and performance alignment, we believe our pay programs ensure that compensation for our executives is aligned with performance and market norms.

(4)    Non-equity incentive plan compensation includes cash awards under the STI and LTIC plans. Cash awards earned under the STI and LTIC plans for the performance period ended in fiscal 2018 were paid to the NEOs on December 14, 2018, unless deferred under the Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan. Deferred STI and LTIC amounts are included in the first column of the Fiscal 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table.

 (b) Represents above-market earnings on compensation that is deferred by the NEOs under our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. Above-market earnings represent the difference  between the interest rate used to calculate earnings under the applicable plan and 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. See the Fiscal 2018  Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table for additional information.   Over the past two years, modifications have been made for the investment options available under the Nonemployee Director Deferred Compensation Plan and the Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plan for employees to ensure that participants cannot earn above-market returns on new deferrals.

(3)  Represents the number of RSUs and PSUs that vested during fiscal 2018. RSUs include shares granted in 2015 as well as accelerated vesting shares to satisfy tax withholding requirements. The three-year performance period for PSUs granted in fiscal 2015, ended on October 31, 2017, and vested on December 10, 2017. The final number of shares earned was based on Deere's revenue growth and TSR relative to the S&P Industrial Sector over the performance period. The final payout determination, made by the Committee in December 2017, reflects revenue growth and TSR comparable to the 9th and 77th percentiles, respectively, of the S&P Industrial Sector. Accordingly, the resulting payout of PSUs was equal to 100% of the target award.

Pension BenefitsThe NEOs are eligible to participate in pension plans that provide benefits based on years of service and pay. Pension benefits are provided under a qualified defined benefit pension plan called the John Deere Pension Plan for Salaried Employees (the "Salaried Plan") and two nonqualified pension plans called the Senior Supplementary Pension Benefit Plan (the "Senior Supplementary Plan") and the John Deere Supplemental Pension Benefit Plan (the "Deere Supplemental Plan").
In 1996, we introduced a new pension option under the Salaried Plan known as the "Contemporary Option." At that time, participants could elect to remain in the existing Salaried Plan option, known as the "Traditional Option," or convert to the new Contemporary Option. New employees hired between January 1, 1997, and October 31, 2014, automatically participated in the Contemporary Option. For new employees hired on or after November 1, 2014, pension benefits under the Salaried Plan are calculated based on a cash balance methodology instead of the Traditional or Contemporary Option formula. None of the current NEOs participates in the Traditional or cash balance plan.
SALARIED PLANThe Salaried Plan is a qualified plan subject to certain IRS limitations on benefits and is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Deere makes contributions to and benefits are paid from a tax-exempt pension trust. Pension benefits provided by the Salaried Plan under the Contemporary Option are summarized on the following page.
Table of Contents
Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation Executive Compensation Tables
Under the Contemporary Option, "Career Average Pay" is used in computing retirement benefits. Career Average Pay is calculated using salary plus STI (up to IRS limits). For participants hired before January 1, 1997, the transition to Career Average Pay includes salary and STI awards from 1992 until retirement. Deere makes additional contributions to the 401(k) retirement savings accounts of salaried employees participating in this option.
The formula for calculating benefits under the Contemporary Option is:
Early retirement eligibility under the Contemporary Option is the earlier of:
Pension payments are reduced by 4% for each year the employee is under the unreduced benefits age upon retirement. Messrs. Field and Gilles are the only NEOs currently eligible to retire early with reduced benefits under the Contemporary Option.
Eligibility to retire with unreduced benefits under the Contemporary Option occurs at age 67 for all participating employees who were hired on or after January 1, 1997. For participants hired before this date, the eligibility age to retire with unreduced benefits is based on years of service as of January 1, 1997, and ranges from ages 60 to 67. Mr. Allen is the only NEO currently eligible to retire with unreduced benefits under the Contemporary Option.
SENIOR SUPPLEMENTARY PLANThe Senior Supplementary Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified excess defined benefit plan that provides additional pension benefits in an amount comparable to those the participant would have received under the Salaried Plan in the absence of IRS limitations. Benefit payments for the Senior Supplementary Plan are made from the assets of Deere and are at-risk in the event Deere seeks bankruptcy protection.
The Senior Supplementary Plan uses the same formula as the Salaried Plan to calculate the benefit payable, except that eligible earnings include only amounts above qualified plan IRS limits.
DEERE SUPPLEMENTAL PLANThe Deere Supplemental Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified supplemental retirement plan for certain employees, including all the NEOs. Benefit payments for the Deere Supplemental Plan are made from the assets of Deere and are at-risk in the event Deere seeks bankruptcy protection. The Deere Supplemental Plan was closed to new participants effective November 1, 2014, although benefits will continue to accrue for employees who were already participating in the plan as of that date.
The formula for calculating benefits is:
Table of Contents
FISCAL 2018 PENSION BENEFITS TABLE
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1) Benefits are provided under the Salaried Plan, the Senior Supplementary Plan, and the Deere Supplemental Plan. A portion of Mr. Gilles' benefits will be provided by certain German pension plans in which he participated during his period of employment at Deere's European Office in Germany. Any benefits received from these German plans will offset benefits that otherwise would have been provided under the Salaried Plan. Mr. Gilles' total pension benefits are calculated for all purposes as if he had been a participant in the U.S. pension plans his entire career. 
 (2) The assumed retirement age is the earliest age at which the NEO could retire without any benefit reduction due to age, or, if earlier, normal retirement age. 
 (3) Years and months of service credit under each plan as of October 31, 2018. The years of credited service are equal to years of eligible service with Deere for the Salaried and Senior Supplementary Plan. Service credit under the Deere Supplemental Plan has been based on service at grade 13 or above since January 1, 1997. 
 (4) The actuarial present value of the accumulated benefit is shown as of October 31, 2018, and is provided as a straight-life annuity for the qualified pension plan and a lump sum for nonqualified pension plan benefits. Pension benefits are not reduced for any social security benefits or other offset amounts an NEO may receive. A portion of the benefit for Mr. Gilles will be provided under certain German pension plans as described in footnote (1) above.   The actuarial present value is calculated by estimating expected future payments starting at an assumed retirement age, weighting the estimated payments by the estimated probability of surviving to each post-retirement age, and discounting the weighted payments at an assumed discount rate to reflect the time value of money. The actuarial present value represents an estimate of the amount that, if invested today at the discount rate, would be sufficient on an average basis to provide estimated future payments based on the current accumulated benefit. Actual benefit present values will vary from these estimates depending on many factors, including actual retirement age. 
[END TABLE]
The following assumptions were used to calculate the present value of the accumulated benefit:

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation The Fiscal 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table below shows information about four programs:
DEFERRED PLAN Under the Deferred Plan, through fiscal 2008, NEOs could defer any of their base salary, STI, and LTIC in 5% increments up to 95%. For deferrals elected after 2008, up to 70% of base salary can be deferred while STI and LTIC awards can be deferred up to 95%. On the first day of each calendar quarter, the balance in each account under the Deferred Plan is credited with interest. For deferrals made through calendar 2009, interest is credited at the prime rate (as determined by the Federal Reserve Statistical Release for the prior month) plus 2% as of the last day of the preceding quarter. For deferrals made after December 31, 2009, the deferred amounts earn interest based on the Moody's "A" rated Corporate Bond Rate.
During fiscal 2018, amounts deferred under the Deferred Plan were credited with interest at the following rates:
NEOs must elect to defer salary before the beginning of the calendar year in which deferral occurs. An election to defer STI must be made before the beginning of the fiscal year upon which the award is based. An election to defer LTIC must be made before the close of the fiscal year preceding the calendar year of payment. Participants may elect to receive the deferred funds in a lump sum or in equal annual installments, but distribution must be completed within 10 years following retirement. All deferral elections and associated distribution schedules are irrevocable. This plan is unfunded and participant accounts are at-risk in the event Deere seeks bankruptcy protection.
As of January 1, 2016, the earnings rate described above is no longer available for new deferrals under the Deferred Plan. Instead, the investment options under the Deferred Plan now parallel the investment options offered under our 401(k) plan (with certain limited exceptions). Funds deferred prior to January 1, 2016, may remain invested under the previous options, although participants also may move these funds into the new options. Minimal above-market amounts may be reported in future years for prior years' deferrals. Additionally, as of November 1, 2016, participants may change investment options at any time. These changes effectively ensure that Deferred Plan participants cannot earn above-market interest on new deferrals.
GERMAN DEFERRAL PLAN Mr. Gilles participated in the German Deferral Plan during his period of employment at Deere's European Office in Germany. The German Deferral Plan was available to all salaried employees in Germany and permitted participants to defer up to 100% of their base salary, STI, and/or LTIC. Interest on deferrals is determined on the basis of "transforming factors" specified in the plan documentation. All distributions are paid in a lump sum in the January following the year in which the participant retires or, if the participant retires prior to age 65, no later than January following the year the participant turns 65.
Table of Contents
DCRP The DCRP is designed to allow executives participating in our Contemporary Option to defer employee contributions and receive employer matching contributions on up to 6% of eligible earnings that are otherwise limited by tax regulations. For DCRP purposes, eligible earnings include base salary, STI, and commission compensation. (None of the NEOs receives commission compensation.) The DCRP deferral percentage selected by the employee by October 31 each year is used during the following calendar year to calculate the DCRP employee contribution. This plan is unfunded and participant accounts are at-risk in the event Deere seeks bankruptcy protection.
Until November 1, 2015, two investment options were available under the DCRP: the prime rate (as determined by the Federal Reserve Statistical Release for the prior month) plus 2% or a rate of return based on the S&P 500 Index for the prior month. Participants could choose either investment option for any portion of their accounts and could change investment options between the first and 10th day of any month. During fiscal 2018, the annualized rates of return under the two options were as follows:
As of November 1, 2015, the investment options described above are no longer available for new deferrals under the DCRP. Instead, the investment options under the DCRP now parallel the investment options offered under our 401(k) plan, with certain limited exceptions. Funds deferred prior to November 1, 2015, may remain invested under the previous options, although participants may move these funds into the new options. Minimal above-market amounts may be reported in future years for prior years' deferrals. Additionally, as of November 1, 2015, participants may change investment options at any time. These changes effectively ensure that DCRP participants cannot earn above-market interest on new deferrals.
Distribution options under the DCRP consist of a lump-sum distribution one year following the date of separation, or, in the case of retirement, five annual installments beginning one year following the retirement date.
Table of Contents
DEFERRED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS There are two scenarios under which deferred RSUs can appear in the Fiscal 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table. First, certain RSUs are required to be held for a defined period of time after they vest. The following tranches of RSUs have vested but remain subject to restriction:
For RSUs granted starting in December 2003, NEOs may elect deferral of settlement for a minimum of five years. If a deferral election is made, the RSUs will be settled in shares of Deere common stock five or more years after the originally scheduled conversion date.
Deferred RSUs will not be settled in Deere common stock until either the period elected or the restriction period expires.
FISCAL 2018 NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION TABLE
Table of Contents
Fiscal 2018 Potential Payments upon Change in Control The Change in Control (CIC) Program includes a "double trigger" approach, under which participants will receive severance benefits only if both a change in control and qualifying termination occur. A "qualifying termination" is either:
The CIC Program defines the following as "change in control" events:
Benefits provided under the CIC program and other benefit plans are described in the footnotes to the following table. Although not reflected in the table, the CIC Program provides that Deere will pay the executive's reasonable legal fees and expenses if the executive must enforce the program terms. Under the CIC Program, the executive agrees: (a) not to disclose or use for his or her own purposes confidential and proprietary Deere information and (b) for a period of two years following termination of employment, not to induce Deere employees to leave Deere or to interfere with Deere's business.
In addition, the Omnibus Plan, the LTIC plan, and the Deferred Plan each contain change in control provisions that may trigger payments. Under the Omnibus Plan, unless the Board or the Committee determines otherwise, and regardless of whether the employee is terminated, all then-outstanding equity awards that were granted before February 24, 2010, would vest and restriction periods would end upon a change in control. All outstanding RSUs would be cashed out as of the date of the change in control and the executive would have the right to exercise all outstanding options. Unvested PSUs are cashed out at a target award level and the change of control price described in the Omnibus Plan. Such potential payments are disclosed in the following table adjacent to "Change in Control only." For awards made under the Omnibus Plan on and after February 24, 2010, the foregoing provisions will apply only if there is both a change in control and a qualifying termination. The LTIC plan provides for payment upon a change in control based on actual performance results to date for all performance periods then in progress. Under the Deferred Plan, in the event of certain changes in control, the Committee may elect to terminate the plan within 12 months and distribute all account balances or the Committee may decide to keep the Deferred Plan in effect and modify it to reflect the impact of the change in control.
The following table includes estimated potential payments that would have been due to each NEO if a change in control event had occurred and, if applicable, the NEO experienced a qualifying termination as of the end of fiscal 2018. Although the calculations are intended to provide reasonable estimates of the potential payments, they are based on numerous assumptions, as described in the footnotes, and may not represent the actual amount each NEO would receive if a change in control occurred. The payments listed represent the incremental amounts due to NEOs beyond what the NEOs would have received without the change in control. Not included in this table are the following payments to which the NEOs are already entitled and which are reported elsewhere in this Proxy Statement:
Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  Vesting of RSUs and PSUs does not accelerate unless there is both a change in control and a qualifying termination. In such cases, the vesting and restriction requirements no longer apply. Unvested RSUs will be cashed out and unvested PSUs will be cashed out at a target award level. 
[END TABLE]

FISCAL 2018 POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OTHER THAN FOLLOWING A CHANGE IN CONTROL The following table summarizes the estimated payments to be made to the NEOs under our plans or established practices in the event of termination of employment due to death, disability, retirement, termination without cause, termination for cause, or voluntary separation. Although the calculations are intended to provide reasonable estimates of the potential payments, they are based on numerous assumptions, as described in the footnotes, and may not represent the actual amounts the NEOs would receive.
The amounts shown assume the termination event occurred at the end of fiscal 2018 and the NEO was actively employed until that time.
Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
  In the event of termination with or without cause or voluntary separation, any vested RSUs will be cashed out. All unvested PSUs and RSUs will be forfeited. The amounts shown in the table correspond to vested RSUs, including RSUs that vest as a result of the termination of employment. 
   The value of PSUs for each outstanding tranche represents actual achievement relative to the S&P Industrial Sector or subset thereof assuming in the case of PSUs granted in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 truncated performance measurement periods. The performance period for PSUs granted in fiscal year 2016 ended on October 31, 2018. The final number of shares earned, if any, will be based upon performance as determined by revenue growth and TSR relative to the S&P Industrial Sector or subset thereof at the end of the applicable performance period. See footnotes (4) and (6) to the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal 2018 Year-End table for performance information relating to each outstanding tranche of PSUs. 
 (6)   In all cases, balances held in the U.S. nonqualified deferred compensation plans and the German Deferral Plan are payable to the employee. These amounts are reported in the Fiscal 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table under Deferred Plan, German Deferral Plan, and DCRP. Under the German Deferral Plan, the amount payable in the event of death differs from the amount payable under the other scenarios based on the application of the "transforming factors" specified in the plan documentation. The deferred RSUs reported in the Fiscal 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table appear in the Stock Awards column. 
(7)  The present value of the accumulated pension benefit was calculated using the following assumptions:  
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
Our Company strives to establish fair and competitive employee compensation programs in each local market within our global operations to effectively attract, retain, and motivate our talented workforce. Presented below is the ratio of annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee (excluding our CEO). The ratio shown below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Our median employee was identified using the Company's global full-time, part-time, temporary, and seasonal employees employed as of September 1, 2018. As of that date, we had 73,361 employees globally, with 29,152 employees located in the U.S. and 44,209 located outside the U.S. As permitted under the "5% de minimis exemption" of the pay ratio disclosure rule, we excluded all employees in the following 28 countries, which totaled 1,263, or 2%, of our total employee population.
After excluding the above employees, 29,152 employees in the U.S. and 42,946 employees located outside the U.S. were considered for identifying the median employee. To identify the median employee, we used annualized base pay as of September 1, 2018, as our consistently applied compensation measure. For salaried employees, this included annualized base salary. For hourly employees, this included annual hourly wages excluding overtime, bonuses, or other earnings. Base pay was annualized for permanent employees not employed a full year in 2018. Base pay paid in foreign currencies was converted to U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect on October 26, 2018, which is considered the October spot rate.
Using this methodology, we identified our median employee to be a full-time, hourly employee located in the U.S. The annual total compensation was calculated in accordance with the SEC rules applicable to the Summary Compensation Table. The annual total compensation of our median employee was $76,083. Mr. Allen's annual total compensation as presented in the Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table was $18,525,667. Calculated in this manner, the ratio of the CEO's total compensation to our median employee's total compensation for fiscal 2018 was about 243 to 1.

The Audit Review Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, oversight, compensation, and retention of the independent registered public accounting firm that audits Deere's financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Review Committee has approved the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019. Deloitte & Touche and its predecessors have acted as our independent registered public accounting firm since 1910. Benefits of a long-term engagement by an auditor include audit quality, enabled by understanding and expertise of the company's global business and accounting practices, and audit efficiency and effectiveness, related to familiarity with the company and the avoidance of time and expense related to new auditor onboarding. The Audit Review Committee believes that the continued retention of Deloitte & Touche to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm for Deere is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. The Audit Review Committee and the Board are requesting that shareholders ratify this appointment as a means of soliciting shareholders' opinions and as a matter of good corporate practice. The current Deloitte & Touche lead auditor for Deere, Doug Alkema, was appointed in 2016.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the meeting is required to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP. If the shareholders do not ratify the selection, the Audit Review Committee will consider any information submitted by the shareholders in connection with the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next fiscal year. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Review Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Review Committee believes such a change would be in the best interests of Deere and its shareholders.
We expect a representative of Deloitte & Touche LLP to attend the Annual Meeting. This representative will have an opportunity to make a statement and to respond to appropriate questions.
Table of Contents
Pre-approval of Services by the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Audit Review Committee has adopted a policy for pre-approval of audit and permitted non-audit services provided by Deere's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Review Committee will consider annually and, if appropriate, approve the provision of audit services by its independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Review Committee will consider and, if appropriate, pre-approve the provision of defined audit and non-audit services. The Audit Review Committee also will consider on a case-by-case basis and, if appropriate, approve specific services that are not otherwise pre-approved.
Any proposed engagement that has not been pre-approved may be presented to the Audit Review Committee for consideration at its next regular meeting or, if earlier consideration is required, to the Audit Review Committee or one or more committee members. The member or members who have delegated authority to approve services between regular meetings will report any specific approvals to the Audit Review Committee at its next regular meeting. The Audit Review Committee regularly reviews summary reports detailing all services being provided to Deere by its independent registered public accounting firm.
Fees Paid to the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The following table summarizes the aggregate fees billed for professional services by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Limited, and their respective affiliates for the fiscal years 2018 and 2017:

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS: The Audit Review Committee consists of the following members of the Board of Directors: Alan C. Heuberger, Dipak C. Jain, Michael O. Johanns, Gregory R. Page, Sherry M. Smith (Chair), and Sheila G. Talton. Each of the members is independent as defined under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The Audit Review Committee is responsible for assisting the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities pertaining to the accounting, auditing, and financial reporting processes of Deere. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining Deere's internal control over financial reporting and for preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Audit Review Committee is responsible for oversight of certain risks to the company. The Audit Review Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, oversight, compensation, and retention of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm for Deere. Deloitte & Touche LLP is responsible for performing an independent audit of Deere's annual consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting and expressing opinions on (i) the conformity of Deere's financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and (ii) Deere's internal control over financial reporting.
All members of the Audit Review Committee are financially literate under the applicable NYSE rules, and three members of the Audit Review Committee — Mr. Heuberger, Mr. Page, and Ms. Smith — are "audit committee financial experts" within the meaning of that term as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Audit Review Committee has a written charter describing its responsibilities that has been approved by the Board of Directors and is available on Deere's website at www.deere.com/corpgov. Members of the Audit Review Committee rely on the information provided and the representations made to them by management, which has primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining appropriate internal control over financial reporting and for Deere's financial statements and reports, and by the independent registered public accounting firm, which is responsible for performing an audit in accordance with Standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and expressing opinions on (i) the conformity of Deere's financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and (ii) Deere's internal control over financial reporting.
In this context, we have reviewed and discussed with management Deere's audited financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2018. We have discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP the matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees. We have discussed the scope of and plans for the annual audit with Deloitte & Touche LLP. We have received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte & Touche LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Review Committee concerning independence and have discussed with them their independence. We have concluded that Deloitte & Touche LLP's provision of audit and non-audit services to Deere is compatible with their independence.
On at least a quarterly basis, the Audit Review Committee meets in executive session with Deere management and the Deere internal audit staff, as well as separately with Deloitte & Touche LLP.
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above and exercising our business judgment, we recommend to the Board of Directors that the financial statements referred to above be included in Deere's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2018, for filing with the SEC. We have selected Deloitte & Touche LLP as Deere's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019 and have approved submitting the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm for ratification by the shareholders.

We expect the following proposal to be presented by shareholders at the Annual Meeting, although if the proposal is not properly presented by or on behalf of the proponent, it will not be voted on. Following SEC rules, other than minor formatting changes, we are reprinting the proposal and supporting statement as it was submitted to us and we take no responsibility for its content. Upon request to our Corporate Secretary at the address listed under the "2020 Shareholder Proposals and Nominations" section below, we will provide the names, addresses, and shareholdings of the sponsors and any cosponsors of this proposal.
Shareholder Proposal — Right to Act by Written Consent A shareholder has submitted the following proposal:
"Proposal 4 - Shareholder Right to Act by Written Consent
Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any appropriate topic for written consent.
This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 major companies in a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. This proposal topic might have received a still higher vote than 67% at Allstate and Sprint if small shareholders had the same access to independent corporate governance data as large shareholders.
Taking action by written consent in place of a special meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle and avoid the cost of a special meeting.
This proposal is more important for Deere shareholders in order to make up for the severe limitations on our right to call a special shareholder meeting. Many companies have a 10% stock ownership threshold to call a special meeting. However our 25% stock ownership threshold is made worse because all shares that have not been owned for one continuous year are excluded from participating in our elevated 25% ownership threshold. At a given time half of Deere stock could be held for less than one-year.
Plus when adding in the detailed procedures for shareholders to call for a special meeting it could be necessary to contact 70% or 80% of all shares outstanding during a short widow of time to call for a special shareholder meeting.
Table of Contents
Shareholders can act by written consent to elect a new director. This may be of greater importance since the Board needs to prepare for the director refreshment of the key roles that Vance Coffman, age 74, has: Lead Director, Chairman of the Executive Pay Committee, member of the Executive Committee and member of the Corporate Governance Committee. Plus Mr. Coffman has no other significant directorships that could currently serve as valuable experience to be applied to Deere.
The intention of this proposal is that shareholders will not need to make use of it because its mere existence will be an incentive factor that will help ensue that Deere is well supervised by the Board of Directors and management.
Please vote yes: Shareholder Right to Act by Written Consent - Proposal 4"
Deere's Response — Statement of Opposition to Shareholder Proposal
The Board has given careful consideration to this proposal and has concluded for the reasons described below that the adoption of this resolution is unnecessary and is not in the best interests of Deere and its shareholders.
The Board has demonstrated consistently its commitment to sound principles of corporate governance, working to ensure that its practices provide Deere shareholders with a meaningful voice and the ability to communicate with directors and promote the consideration of shareholder views. As such, the proposal is unnecessary in light of Deere's existing corporate governance practices. The following are a few examples of corporate governance best practices that the Company has adopted to foster shareholder participation:
[BEGIN TABLE]
—  The right for shareholders holding 25% or more of our common stock to call special meetings; 
—  The right for shareholders to nominate directors and have such nominees included in the proxy statement—commonly referred to as "proxy access"; 
—  The opportunity to elect all directors annually using a majority voting standard in uncontested elections; 
—  The ability to recommend director candidates to the Corporate Governance Committee, which considers those recommendations in the same manner as recommendations received from other sources (as discussed previously under "How We Identify and Evaluate Director Nominees"); 
—  All of our directors (other than our CEO) are independent; 
—  The right of shareholders to submit proposals for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement for consideration at an annual meeting, subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC; 
—  The opportunity to communicate directly with members of the Board, the Chairman, any Board committee, or the independent Presiding Director (described previously under "Communication with the Board"); 
—  The ability of shareholders to have their opinions heard at shareholder outreach discussions (described previously under "Shareholder Outreach"); 
—  The opportunity to vote annually in the "say-on-pay" vote to express their views on executive compensation; and 
—  No supermajority voting provisions in company by-laws. 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
In addition, in the Board's view, the transparency and fairness of the annual or special meeting process support all shareholders' interests in several ways that the written consent process does not. Deere's current practices are designed to ensure that prior notice and an opportunity to be heard precede shareholder votes. By doing so, all shareholders have a meaningful and structured opportunity to consider proposed actions and express their views by voting. In contrast, the written consent proposal would enable a limited group of shareholders to act in favor of their own proposed actions at any time and as frequently as they choose, without a meeting and without ever providing advance notice to other Deere shareholders. Actions taken by written consent could deprive many shareholders of the critical opportunities to receive notice, assess, discuss, deliberate, and vote on the merits of proposed actions.
Permitting shareholder action by written consent also could lead to substantial confusion to shareholders and disruption to the company. Under the proposal, multiple groups of shareholders would be able to solicit written consents at any time on a range of issues, some of which may be duplicative or conflicting. This disordered state of corporate affairs would impose significant administrative and financial burdens on the company, while providing little or no corresponding benefit to shareholders.
Given the Board's continued commitment to strong corporate governance, Deere's record of performance as supported by its governance structure, and our existing special meeting and proxy access rights, which are consistent with current best practices, the Board believes that adoption of this shareholder proposal is not necessary or in the long-term interests of Deere's shareholders.

Additional Information
Why am I receiving this Proxy Statement? You are receiving this Proxy Statement because you owned shares of Deere common stock at the close of business on December 31, 2018, which entitles you to vote, either in person at the Annual Meeting or by proxy. This Proxy Statement describes the matters on which you are asked to vote so you can make an informed decision.
This Proxy Statement, together with our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2018, a proxy card, and a voter instruction card, will be mailed or can be accessed online on or about January 11, 2019. We refer to these documents collectively as Deere's Proxy Solicitation Materials.
What is "Notice and Access" and why did Deere elect to use it? We make the Proxy Solicitation Materials available to shareholders electronically under the Notice and Access regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Specifically, most of our shareholders receive a Notice of Electronic Availability ("Notice") instead of a full set of Proxy Solicitation Materials in the mail. The Notice explains how to access and review the Proxy Solicitation Materials and how to vote online. We believe this method of delivery expedites distribution of Proxy Solicitation Materials and also allows us to conserve natural resources and reduce the costs of printing and distributing these materials.
If you received a Notice but would prefer to receive printed copies of the Proxy Solicitation Materials in the mail, please follow the instructions in the Notice for requesting such materials.
How do I vote? You can vote either in person at the Annual Meeting or by proxy without attending the meeting. To ensure a quorum, we urge you to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend. If you attend the meeting and vote in person, that vote will override your proxy vote.
To vote your shares, follow the instructions in the Notice, voter instruction form, or proxy card. Telephone and internet voting are available to all registered and most beneficial shareholders.
Shareholders voting by proxy may use one of the following three options:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 You can vote your shares online at www.proxyvote.com. You will need the 16-digit control number on the Notice of Internet Availability or proxy card.     You can vote by mail by marking, dating, and signing your proxy card or voting instruction form and returning it in the postage-paid envelope.     In the U.S. or Canada, you can vote your shares by calling 1-800-690-6903.   
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in "street name" by a bank, broker, or other holder of record, the information sent by your holder of record will explain the voting options available to you. If your shares are held in "street name" and you wish to vote them in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from your holder of record to do so.
The telephone and internet voting facilities for shareholders will close at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 26, 2019.
Table of Contents
If you hold shares through one of our employee savings plans, your vote must be received by the plan administrator by February 22, 2019, or your plan shares will not be voted.
Can I change my proxy vote? Yes. At any time before your shares are voted by proxy at the meeting, you may change your vote by: 
If you hold your shares in "street name," please refer to the information sent by your bank, broker, or other holder of record for information about revoking or changing your proxy.
How many votes do I have? You will have one vote for each share of Deere common stock that you owned at the close of business on December 31, 2018.
How many shares are entitled to vote? There were 319,880,644 shares of Deere common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018, and entitled to vote at the meeting.
How many votes must be present to hold the meeting? Under our by-laws, a majority of the votes that can be cast must be present in person or by proxy to constitute a quorum for the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and shares represented by "broker non-votes" (explained on the following page) will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum.
How many votes are needed for the proposals to pass? In an uncontested election, nominees for director who receive a majority of "for" votes cast (meaning the number of shares voted "for" a nominee exceeds the number of shares voted "against" that nominee) will be elected. If an incumbent director nominee does not receive a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election, our bylaws require the director to promptly tender a written resignation to the Board. After receiving a recommendation from the Corporate Governance Committee, the Board will determine whether to accept or reject the resignation and will publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days of the date the election results are certified.
If the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (i.e., a contested election), the nominees who receive the most votes will be elected as directors.
Each of the other proposals will pass if the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy is cast in favor of the proposal.
What if I abstain from voting or vote "abstain"? If you abstain from voting or vote "abstain" your shares will:

What if I don't return my proxy card and don't attend the Annual Meeting? If your shares are registered in your own name with our transfer agent and you do not vote, your shares will not be voted at all.
If you hold your shares in "street name" and you do not give your bank, broker, or other holder of record specific voting instructions, your record holder may vote your shares on the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm, but may not vote your shares on any other matter that comes before the Annual Meeting. If you do not provide voting instructions on these other matters, the votes will be considered "broker non-votes." Broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum, but will not affect the outcome of any proposal.
What happens if a nominee for director declines or is unable to accept election? If you vote by proxy and unforeseen circumstances make it necessary for the Board to substitute another person for a nominee, the designated proxy will vote your shares for that other person.
Is my vote confidential? Yes. The tabulator, the proxy solicitation agent, and the inspectors of voting must comply with confidentiality guidelines that prohibit disclosure of votes to Deere. The tabulator of the votes and at least one of the inspectors of voting will be independent of Deere and our officers and directors. The only time your voting records will be disclosed is (i) as required by law, (ii) to the inspectors of voting, or (iii) if the election is contested.
If you write comments on the proxy card you return to Deere, those comments will be reviewed, but your vote will remain confidential.
Attendance at the Annual Meeting If you plan to attend the meeting, you must be a holder of Deere shares as of December 31, 2018. To expedite your admission process, we encourage you to register for admission before 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday, February 26, 2019. You may register for admission for yourself and one guest by:

Will I receive a copy of Deere's Annual Report? We have either mailed the Annual Report to you with this Proxy Statement or sent you a Notice with the web address for accessing the Annual Report online.
How can I receive a copy of Deere's 10-K? There are three ways to obtain, free of charge, a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2018:
What is "householding"? If two or more shareholders reside at the same address and appear to be members of the same family, we will send single copies of either the Proxy Solicitation Materials or the Notice, as applicable, to that address unless one of the shareholders notifies us that he or she wishes to receive individual copies. This procedure reduces printing and distribution costs related to the Annual Meeting. We do not rely on householding when we mail dividend checks.
If Proxy Solicitation Materials were delivered to an address that you share with another shareholder and you prefer to receive separate copies, please contact our Shareholder Relations Department at One John Deere Place, Moline, Illinois 61265-8098 or by phone at (309) 765-4491.

For the Board of Directors,
Todd E. Davies Corporate Secretary Moline, Illinois January 11, Director Independence Categorical Standards of Deere & Company Corporate Governance PoliciesNYSE STANDARDS OF INDEPENDENCE A director may not be considered independent if the director does not meet the criteria for independence established by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and applicable law. A director is considered independent under the NYSE criteria if the Board finds that the director has no material relationship with the company. Under the NYSE rules, a director will not be considered independent if within the past three years:
In addition, in determining the independence of any director who will serve on the Compensation Committee, the Board must consider all factors specifically relevant to determining whether the director has a relationship to Deere that is material to that director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a Compensation Committee member, including but not limited to:
Table of Contents
CATEGORICAL STANDARDS OF INDEPENDENCE The Board has established the following additional categorical standards of independence to assist it in making independence determinations:
Business Relationships. Any payments by Deere to a business employing or 10% or more owned by a director or an immediate family member of a director for goods or services or other contractual arrangements must be made in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated persons. The following relationships are not considered material relationships that would impair a director's independence:
Relationships with Not-for-Profit Entities. A director's independence will not be considered impaired solely for the reason that the director or an immediate family member is an officer, director, or trustee of a foundation, university, or other not-for-profit organization that receives from Deere or its foundation during any of the prior three fiscal years contributions in an amount not exceeding the greater of $1 million or 2% of the not-for-profit organization's aggregate annual charitable receipts during the entity's fiscal year. (Any automatic matching of employee charitable contributions by Deere or its foundation is not included in Deere's contributions for this purpose.) All contributions by Deere in excess of $100,000 to not-for-profit entities with which the director is affiliated shall be reported to the Corporate Governance Committee and may be considered in making independence determinations.
For purposes of these standards, "Deere" shall mean Deere & Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, and "immediate family member" shall have the meaning set forth in the NYSE independence rules, as may be amended from time to time.

Deere & Company Reconciliation of Variable Compensation Measures to Non-GAAP Measures SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE: As described in the CD&A under Short-Term Incentive (STI), Operating Return on Operating Assets (OROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) are the metrics used to measure performance for the STI program. The OROA and ROE calculations for fiscal 2018 are summarized as follows. The Equipment Operations OROA calculation excludes the assets from our captive financial services. ROE is based solely on the Financial Services segment.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1) On December 1, 2017, the Company acquired the stock and certain assets of substantially all the operations of Wirtgen Group Holding GmbH (Wirtgen), the leading manufacturer worldwide of road construction equipment. Wirtgen is included in the construction and forestry segment. Wirtgen is excluded from the metrics above to allow time for assimilation. 
 (2) When the goodwill from an acquisition exceeds $50 million, goodwill is excluded for two years to allow time for integration of the new business. Goodwill for STI purposes for fiscal 2018 was reduced by $209.6 million to reflect the partial year impact of acquisitions made over the past two years. Average Identifiable Assets with Inventories at LIFO were $13,566 million, $10,219 million, and $3,347 million for Equipment Operations, Agriculture & Turf Operations and Construction & Forestry Operations—excluding Wirtgen, respectively. OROA with Inventories at LIFO and goodwill as reported were 26.3%, 27.6%, and 22.5% for Equipment Operations, Agriculture & Turf, and Construction & Forestry—excluding Wirtgen, respectively. 
 (3) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted new tax legislation (tax reform). The primary provisions of the tax reform affecting the Company in fiscal 2018 were a reduction to the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and a transition from a worldwide corporate tax system to a territorial tax system. As the Financial Services segment SVA is based on net income and average equity, the 2018 amounts have been adjusted to remove the effects of the discrete income tax benefit and the lower corporate tax rate provided in the tax reform for conformance with the plan design at the beginning of fiscal 2018.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE CASH: As described in the CD&A under Long-Term Incentive Cash (LTIC), Shareholder Value Added (SVA) is the metric used to measure performance for the LTIC program. The computation of SVA is summarized as follows for the performance period ended with fiscal 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1) On December 1, 2017, the Company acquired the stock and certain assets of substantially all the operations of Wirtgen Group Holding GmbH (Wirtgen), the leading manufacturer worldwide of road construction equipment. Wirtgen is included in the construction and forestry segment. Wirtgen is excluded from the metrics above to allow time for assimilation. 
 (2) When the goodwill from an acquisition exceeds $50 million, goodwill is excluded for two years to allow time for integration of the new business. Goodwill for LTIC purposes for the fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016 was reduced by $209.6 million, $101.2 million, and $46.2 million, respectively, to reflect the impact of acquisitions. 
 (3) For purposes of determining SVA, the equipment segments are assessed a pretax cost of assets, which on an annual basis is generally 12% of the segment's average identifiable operating assets during the applicable period with inventory at standard cost (believed to more closely approximate the current cost of inventory and the company's investment in the asset). 
 (4) On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the new tax legislation (tax reform). The primary provisions of the tax reform expected to impact the Company in fiscal 2018 are a reduction to the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and a transition from a worldwide corporate tax system to a territorial tax system. As the Financial Services segment SVA is based on net income and average equity, the 2018 amounts have been adjusted to remove the effects of the discrete income tax benefit and the lower corporate tax rate provided in the tax reform for conformance with the plan design at the beginning of fiscal 2018. 
 (5) For SVA, Financial Services is assessed an annual pretax cost of average equity of approximately 15%. 
 (6) In the first quarter of 2018, the company adopted Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post-retirement Benefit Cost. While the accounting standard was adopted on a retrospective basis, the SVA for 2016 and 2017 utilized for LTIC was not restated.
