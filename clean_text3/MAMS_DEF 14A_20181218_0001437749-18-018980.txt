PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
In this Proxy Statement, MAM Software Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is referred to as "MAM", the "Company", "we", "us" and "our".
Information Concerning the Proxy Materials and the Annual Meeting 
Proxies in the form enclosed with this Proxy Statement are being solicited by our Board of Directors (the "Board") for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held at 9:30 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on December 18, 2018, at the offices of Robinson Brog Leinwand Greene Genovese & Gluck P.C., 875 Third Avenue, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10022, and at any adjournment thereof. Your vote is very important. For this reason, our Board is requesting that you permit your shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"), to be represented at the Annual Meeting by the proxies named on the enclosed proxy card. This Proxy Statement contains important information for you to consider when deciding how to vote on the matters brought before the Annual Meeting. Please read it carefully.
Voting materials, which include this Proxy Statement, the enclosed proxy card, and the enclosed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, which contains financial statements and other information of interest to stockholders, will be first mailed to stockholders on or about November 9, 2018.
Only stockholders of record of our Common Stock as of the close of business on October 26, 2018 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. As of October 26, 2018, 12,579,614 shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding. Stockholders are entitled to one vote per share of Common Stock held by them. Stockholders may vote in person or by proxy; however, granting a proxy does not in any way affect a stockholder's right to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. Any stockholder giving a proxy has the right to revoke that proxy by (i) filing a later-dated proxy or a written notice of revocation with us at our principal offices at any time before the original proxy is exercised or (ii) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.
Michael Jamieson and Frederick Wasserman are named as attorneys-in-fact in the proxy. Mr. Jamieson is our Chief Executive Officer and is also a member of our Board. Mr. Wasserman is the Chairman of our Board. Mr. Jamieson or Mr. Wasserman will vote all shares represented by properly executed proxies returned in time to be counted at the Annual Meeting, as described below under "Voting Procedures and Vote Required." Any stockholder granting a proxy has the right to withhold authority to vote for any or all of the nominees to the Board. Where a vote has been specified in the proxy with respect to the matters identified in the Notice of the Annual Meeting, including the election of directors, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted in accordance with those voting specifications. If no voting instructions are indicated, your shares will be voted as recommended by our Board on all matters, and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote before the Annual Meeting.
The stockholders will consider and vote upon (i) a proposal to elect five (5) members of our Board, each to serve until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal; and (ii) a proposal to ratify the Board's selection of KMJ Corbin & Company LLP ("KMJ Corbin") as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. Stockholders also will consider and act upon such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting.
Voting Procedures and Vote Required 
Mr. Jamieson and/or Mr. Wasserman will vote all shares represented by properly executed proxies returned in time to be counted at the Annual Meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is necessary to establish a quorum for the transaction of business. Shares represented by proxies pursuant to which votes have been withheld for any or all of the nominees for directors, or which contain one or more abstentions, as well as "broker non-vote" shares (described below) are counted as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the Annual Meeting. None of the matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting will entitle any stockholder to dissenters' rights.
All properly executed proxies delivered pursuant to this solicitation and not revoked will be voted at the Annual Meeting as specified in such proxies. As noted above, proxies will be voted as recommended by our Board on all matters and will be voted in the discretion of the proxy holder on any other matters that properly come before the Annual Meeting, if no voting instructions are indicated.
Vote Required for Election of Directors (Proposal No. 1). Our certificate of incorporation, as amended ("Certificate of Incorporation"), does not authorize cumulative voting. Delaware law and our bylaws ("Bylaws") provide that directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. This means that the five (5) nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes at the Annual Meeting will be elected as directors. Only shares that are voted in favor of a particular nominee will be counted toward that nominee's achievement of a plurality. Shares present at the Annual Meeting that are not voted for a particular nominee or shares present by proxy where the stockholder properly withheld authority to vote for such nominee will not be counted toward that nominee's achievement of a plurality.
Vote Required for Ratification of Auditors (Proposal No. 2). Delaware law and our Bylaws provide that, on all matters (other than the election of directors and except to the extent otherwise required by our Certificate of Incorporation or applicable Delaware law), the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present, in person or by proxy, and voting on the matter, will be required for approval. Accordingly, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, and voting on the matter, will be required to ratify the Board's selection of KMJ Corbin as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
If you hold shares beneficially in street name and do not provide your broker with voting instructions, your shares may constitute "broker non-votes". Generally, broker non-votes occur on a matter when a broker is not permitted to vote on that matter without instructions from the beneficial owner and instructions are not given. Brokers that have not received voting instructions from their clients cannot vote on their clients' behalf on "non-routine" proposals. Broker non-votes are not counted in tabulating the voting result for any particular proposal and shares that constitute broker non-votes are not considered entitled to vote. The vote on Proposal No. 1 is considered "non-routine" and the vote on Proposal No. 2 is considered "routine".
Abstentions are counted as "shares present" at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum and with respect to any matters being voted upon at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors, but with respect to any other proposal an abstention will operate to prevent the approval of such proposal to the same extent as a vote against such proposal.
Votes at the Annual Meeting will be tabulated by one or more inspectors of election appointed by the Chief Executive Officer.
Delivery of Documents to Security Holders Sharing an Address
We will send only one set of Annual Meeting materials and other corporate mailings to stockholders who share a single address unless we received contrary instructions from any stockholder at that address. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs. However, the Company will deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of the Annual Meeting materials to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the Annual Meeting materials was delivered. You may make such a written or oral request by sending a written notification stating (i) your name, (ii) your shared address and (iii) the address to which the Company should direct the additional copy of the Annual Meeting materials, to the Company at MAM Software Group, Inc., c/o David Danovitch, 875 3rd Avenue, 9th Floor, New York, New York 10022.
If multiple stockholders sharing an address have received one copy of the Annual Meeting materials or any other corporate mailing and would prefer the Company to mail each stockholder a separate copy of future mailings, you may send notification to or call the Company's principal executive offices. Additionally, if current stockholders with a shared address received multiple copies of the Annual Meeting materials or other corporate mailings and would prefer the Company to mail one copy of future mailings to stockholders at the shared address, notification of such request may also be made by mail or telephone to the Company's principal executive offices.

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
(Proposal No. 1)
The following individuals have been nominated as members of our Board, each to serve until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, until their successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal. Pursuant to Delaware law and our Bylaws, directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. This means that the five (5) nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes at the Annual Meeting will be elected as directors. Only shares that are voted in favor of a particular nominee will be counted toward that nominee's achievement of a plurality. Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named or for persons other than the named nominees.
Following is information about each nominee, including biographical data for at least the last five (5) years. Should one or more of these nominees become unavailable to accept nomination or election as a director, the individuals named as proxies on the enclosed proxy card will vote the shares that they represent for the election of such other persons as the Board may recommend, unless the Board reduces the number of directors. We have no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected as a director.

Required Vote 
Our Certificate of Incorporation does not authorize cumulative voting. Delaware law and our Bylaws provide that directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. This means that the five (5) nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes at the Annual Meeting will be elected as directors. Only shares that are voted in favor of a particular nominee will be counted toward that nominee's achievement of a plurality. Shares present at the Annual Meeting that are not voted for a particular nominee or shares present by proxy where the stockholder properly withheld authority to vote for such nominee will not be counted toward that nominee's achievement of a plurality. 
At the Annual Meeting, a vote will be taken on a proposal to approve the election of five (5) director nominees. 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR 
THE ELECTION OF THE FIVE (5) DIRECTOR NOMINEES. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board of Directors 
The Board oversees our business affairs and monitors the performance of our management. In accordance with our corporate governance principles, the Board does not involve itself in day-to-day operations. The directors keep themselves informed through discussions with the Chief Executive Officer, other key executives and by reading the reports and other materials sent to them and by participating in Board and committee meetings. Our directors hold office until the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal, or if for some other reason they are unable to serve in the capacity of director.
Director Independence 
Our determination of independence of directors is made using the definition of "independent director" contained in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Marketplace Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") because we are listed on NASDAQ. We have determined that Peter H. Kamin, W. Austin Lewis IV, Frederick G. Wasserman and Dwight B. Mamanteo are "independent" within the meaning of such rules.
Board Meetings and Attendance 
During fiscal year 2018, the Board held four (4) physical and telephonic meetings. No incumbent director attended, either in person or via telephone, fewer than 75% of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board and committees, if any, on which each director served.  The Board also approved certain actions by unanimous written consent.
Annual Meeting Attendance 
All of the Company's five (5) then-sitting directors attended our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was held in New York, New York, on December 19, 2017.
Stockholder Communications with the Board 
We have not implemented a formal policy or procedure by which our stockholders can communicate directly with our Board. Nevertheless, every effort has been made to ensure that the views of stockholders are heard by the Board or individual directors, as applicable, and that appropriate responses are provided to stockholders in a timely manner. We believe that we are responsive to stockholder communications, and therefore have not considered it necessary to adopt a formal process for stockholder communications with our Board. During the upcoming year, our Board will continue to monitor whether it would be appropriate to adopt such a process.
Board Committees
Our Board has three (3) standing committees of the Board: a Compensation Committee; an Audit Committee; and a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The members of these committees are:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee of the Board assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing, and reporting practices of the Company and such other duties as directed by the Board. The Audit Committee's purpose is to oversee the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company, the audit of the Company's financial statements, the qualification of the public accounting firm engaged as the Company's independent auditor to prepare or issue an audit report on the financial statements of the Company, and the performance of the Company's internal and independent auditors. The Audit Committee's role includes a particular focus on the qualitative aspects of financial reporting to stockholders, the Company's processes to manage business and financial risk, and compliance with significant applicable legal, ethical, and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent auditor. 
During fiscal year 2018, the Audit Committee held four (4) physical and telephonic meetings.
The Audit Committee's charter is attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement.
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee's role is to discharge the Board's responsibilities relating to compensation of the Company's executives, to produce an annual report on executive compensation for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement, and to oversee and advise the Board on the adoption of policies that govern the Company's compensation programs, including stock and benefit plans.
During fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee held two (2) physical or telephonic meetings.
The Compensation Committee's charter is attached as Appendix B to this Proxy Statement.
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's role is to appoint nominees for election to the Board, to identify and recommend candidates to fill vacancies occurring between Annual Stockholder Meetings, to review, evaluate and recommend changes to the Company's corporate governance policies, and to review the Company's policies and programs that relate to matters of corporate responsibility, including public issues of significance to the Company and its stockholders.
During fiscal year 2018, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee held two (2) physical or telephonic meetings.
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's charter is attached as Appendix C to this Proxy Statement.
Nominating Procedures and Criteria
Director Qualifications. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee believes that persons nominated to the Board should have personal integrity and high ethical character. Candidates should not have any interests that would materially impair his or her ability to exercise independent judgment or otherwise discharge the fiduciary duties owed by a director to the Company and its stockholders. Candidates must be able to represent fairly and equally all stockholders of the Company without favoring any particular stockholder group or other constituency of the Company and must be prepared to devote adequate time to the Board and its committees.
Identifying Director Candidates. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee utilizes a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees to serve as directors. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has a policy of re-nominating incumbent directors who continue to satisfy the committee's criteria for membership and whom the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee believes continue to make important contributions to the Board and who consent to continue their service on the Board.
In filling vacancies of the Board, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will solicit recommendations for nominees from the persons the committee believes are likely to be familiar with (i) the needs of the Company and (ii) qualified candidates. These persons may include members of the Board and management of the Company. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may also engage a professional search firm to assist in identifying qualified candidates.
In evaluating potential nominees, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will oversee the collection of information concerning the background and qualifications of the candidate and determine whether the candidate satisfies the minimum qualifications required by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee for election as director and whether the candidate possesses any of the specific skills or qualities that must be possessed by one or more members of the Board pursuant to the Board's policies.
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee does not have a written policy with respect to Board diversity; however, the committee's goal is to assemble a Board that brings to the Company a diversity of knowledge, skills and expertise derived from high quality business and professional experience. We believe a Board with these attributes leads to improved Company performance by encouraging new ideas and perspectives and expanding the knowledge base available to management.
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may interview any proposed candidate and may solicit the views about the candidate's qualifications and suitability from the Company's Chief Executive Officer and other senior members of management.
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will make its selections based on all the available information and relevant considerations. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's selection will be based on who, in the view of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, will be best suited for membership on the Board. In making its selection, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will evaluate candidates proposed by stockholders under criteria similar to other candidates, except that the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may consider, as one of the factors in its evaluation, the size and duration of the interest of the recommending stockholder in the stock of the Company.
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may also consider the extent to which the recommending stockholder intends to continue to hold its interest in the Company, including whether the recommending stockholder intends to continue holding its interest at least through the time of the meeting at which the candidate is to be elected.
Stockholder Nominees. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider director nominee recommendations by stockholders, provided the names of such nominees, accompanied by relevant biographical information, are properly submitted in writing to the Company in accordance with the manner described for stockholder proposals under the heading "Future Stockholder Proposals." The acceptance of a recommendation from a stockholder does not imply that the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will recommend to the Board the nomination of the candidate recommended by the stockholder.
Family Relationships 
There are no familial relationships among any of our officers and directors.
Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 
Except as described below, to the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or executive officers has, during the past ten (10) years: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or business association of which he was a general partner or executive officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two (2) years prior to that time;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment, banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or his association with persons engaged in any such activity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
In addition, the Company is not engaged in, nor is it aware of any pending or threatened, litigation in which any of its directors, executive officers, affiliates or owners of more than 5% of the Common Stock, or any associate of any such directors, executive officers, affiliates or owners of more than 5% of the Common Stock, is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company.
Leadership Structure of the Board 
The Board does not currently have a policy on whether the same person should serve as both the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board or, if the roles are separate, whether the Chairman of the Board should be selected from the non-employee directors or should be an employee. The Board believes that it should have the flexibility to make these determinations at any given point in time in the way that it believes best to provide appropriate leadership for the Company at that time. Our current Chairman of the Board, Frederick G. Wasserman, is not an officer. Mr. Wasserman has served as a member of our Board since 2007.
Risk Oversight 
The Board oversees risk management directly and through its committees associated with their respective subject matter areas. Generally, the Board oversees risks that may affect the business of the Company as a whole, including operational matters. The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of the Company's accounting and financial reporting processes and also discusses with management the Company's financial statements, internal controls and other accounting and related matters. The Compensation Committee oversees certain risks related to compensation programs and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee oversees certain corporate governance risks. As part of their roles in overseeing risk management, these committees periodically report to the Board regarding briefings provided by management and advisors as well as the committees' own analysis and conclusions regarding certain risks faced by the Company. Management is responsible for implementing the risk management strategy and developing policies, controls, processes and procedures to identify and manage risks. 
Code of Ethics
MAM is committed to maintaining the highest standard of business conduct and corporate governance, which we believe is essential to running our business efficiently, serving our stockholders well and maintaining MAM's integrity in the marketplace. MAM maintains a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers (including MAM's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) and employees, known as our Code of Ethics of Business Conduct.

Severance Benefits 
As described above, each of the employment agreements with our officers contains a severance benefit for that officer if he or she is terminated other than for cause or the officer leaves the Company after a change in control, provided they leave for "good reason."

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Other than compensation arrangements described herein, during the past two (2) fiscal years, there have been no transactions, whether directly or indirectly, between our Company and any of our officers, directors, beneficial owners of more than 5% of our outstanding Common Stock or their family members that exceeded the lesser of $120,000 or 1% of the average of the Company's total assets at year-end. 
Our Audit Committee considers and approves or disapproves any related party transaction as required by NASDAQ regulations and Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act. Related party transactions reviewed by the Audit Committee do not include matters related to compensation of employees of the Company. The Audit Committee only approves those related party transactions that are on terms comparable to, or more beneficial to us than, those that could be obtained in arm's length dealings with an unrelated third party. Only members of the Audit Committee who are disinterested in the related party transaction in question may participate in the determination of whether such transaction may proceed.
COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 16(a) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT
Under the securities laws of the United States, our directors, executive officers, and any persons holding 10% or more of our Common Stock must report on their ownership of the Common Stock and any changes in that ownership to the SEC. Specific due dates for these reports have been established. Based solely on our review of the copies of such reports received by us, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Form 5 was required for such persons, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, we believe that all reports required to be filed by such persons pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, were filed on a timely basis, with the exception of our officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners listed in the table below:

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The following Report of the Audit Committee (the "Audit Report") does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other Company filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent the Company specifically incorporates this Audit Report by reference therein.
Role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee's primary responsibilities fall into three broad categories:
First, the Audit Committee is charged with monitoring the preparation of quarterly and annual financial reports by the Company's management, including discussions with management and the Company's outside auditors about draft annual financial statements and key accounting and reporting matters.
Second, the Audit Committee is responsible for matters concerning the relationship between the Company and its outside auditors, including recommending their appointment or removal; reviewing the scope of their audit services and related fees, as well as any other services being provided to the Company; and determining whether the outside auditors are independent (based in part on the annual letter provided to the Company pursuant to Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1).
Third, the Audit Committee reviews financial reporting, policies, procedures, and internal controls of the Company.
The Audit Committee has implemented procedures to ensure that during the course of each fiscal year it devotes the attention that it deems necessary or appropriate to each of the matters assigned to it under the Audit Committee's charter. In overseeing the preparation of the Company's financial statements, the Audit Committee met with management and the Company's outside auditors, including meetings with the Company's outside auditors without management present, to review and discuss all financial statements prior to their issuance and to discuss significant accounting issues. Management advised the Audit Committee that all financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the Audit Committee discussed the statements with both management and the outside auditors. The Audit Committee's review included discussion with the outside auditors of matters required to be discussed pursuant to Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (Communication with Audit Committees).
With respect to the Company's outside auditors, the Audit Committee, among other things, discussed with KMJ Corbin matters relating to its independence, including the disclosures made to the Audit Committee as required by the Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence Discussions with Audit Committees).
Recommendations of the Audit Committee. In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Board approve the inclusion of the Company's audited financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, for filing with the SEC.
This Audit Report has been furnished by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditors
The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent auditors prior to the engagement of the independent auditors with respect to such services.

The Chairman of the Audit Committee must report all such pre-approvals to the entire Audit Committee at the next Audit Committee meeting.
Required Vote
Delaware law and our Bylaws provide that, on all matters (other than the election of directors and except to the extent otherwise required by our Certificate of Incorporation or applicable Delaware law), the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present, in person or by proxy, and voting on the matter, will be required for approval. Accordingly, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, and voting on the matter, will be required to ratify the Board's selection of KMJ Corbin as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
At the Annual Meeting, a vote will be taken on a proposal to ratify the selection of KMJ Corbin as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
The Board has not yet determined the date on which the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held. Stockholders may submit proposals on matters appropriate for stockholder action at annual meetings in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC.  Any proposal which an eligible stockholder desires to have included in our proxy statement and presented at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be included in our proxy statement and related proxy card if it is received by us a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy materials and if it complies with SEC rules regarding inclusion of proposals in proxy statements. In order to avoid controversy as to the date on which we receive a proposal, it is suggested that any stockholder who wishes to submit a proposal submit such proposal by certified mail, return receipt requested.
Other deadlines apply to the submission of stockholder proposals for the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders that are not required to be included in our proxy statement under SEC rules. With respect to these stockholder proposals for the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders, a stockholder's notice must be received by us a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy materials. The form of proxy distributed by the Board for such meeting will confer discretionary authority to vote on any such proposal not received by such date. If any such proposal is received by such date, the proxy statement for the meeting will provide advice on the nature of the matter and how we intend to exercise our discretion to vote on each such matter if it is presented at that meeting.
EXPENSES AND SOLICITATION
We will bear the costs of printing and mailing proxies. In addition to soliciting stockholders by mail or through our regular employees, we may request banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to solicit their customers who have shares of our Common Stock registered in the name of a nominee and, if so, will reimburse such banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket costs. Solicitation by our officers and employees may also be made of some stockholders following the original solicitation.
OTHER BUSINESS
The Board knows of no other items that are likely to be brought before the Annual Meeting except those that are set forth in the foregoing Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the persons designated on the enclosed proxy will vote in accordance with their judgment on such matters.

AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER
Role
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing, and reporting practices of the Company, and such other duties as directed by the Board. The Committee's purpose is to oversee the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company, the audits of the Company's financial statements, the qualifications of the public accounting firm engaged as the Company's independent auditor to prepare or issue an audit report on the financial statements of the Company, and the performance of the Company's internal and independent auditors. The Committee's role includes a particular focus on the qualitative aspects of financial reporting to stockholders, the Company's processes to manage business and financial risk, and compliance with significant applicable legal, ethical, and regulatory requirements. The Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent auditor.
Membership
The membership of the Committee shall consist of at least three directors, all of whom shall meet the independence requirements established by the Board and applicable laws, regulations and listing requirements provided, that to the extent that the Board so determines and applicable laws, regulations and listing requirements permit (as, for instance, with regard to companies which are "Small Business Issuers" within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") , the membership of the Committee may consist of at least two directors or, if the membership of the Committee consists of at least three directors, one need not meet the aforesaid independence requirements. Each member shall in the judgment of the Board have the ability to read and understand fundamental financial statements. At least one member of the Committee shall in the judgment of the Board be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC (the "SEC Rules"), and at least one member (who may also serve as the audit committee financial expert) shall in the judgment of the Board meet the applicable financial sophistication standard as defined by the requirements of the market or exchange on which the Company's securities may from time to time be listed or qualified for trading. The Board appoints the members of the Committee and the chairperson. The Board may remove any member from the Committee at any time with or without cause.
Operations
The Committee shall meet at least four times a year. Additional meetings may occur as the Committee or its chair deems advisable. The Committee will cause to be kept adequate minutes of all its proceedings, and will report on its actions and activities at the next quarterly meeting of the Board. Committee members will be furnished with copies of the minutes of each meeting and any action taken by unanimous consent. The Committee is governed by the same rules regarding meetings (including meetings by conference telephone or similar communications equipment), action without meetings, notice, waiver of notice, and quorum and voting requirements as are applicable to the Board. The Committee is authorized and empowered to adopt its own rules of procedure not inconsistent with (a) any provision of this Charter, (b) any provision of the Bylaws of the Company, or (c) the laws of the state of Delaware.
Communications
The independent auditor reports directly to the Committee. The Committee is expected to maintain free and open communication with the independent auditor, the internal auditors, and management. This communication will include periodic private executive sessions with each of these parties.
Education
The Company is responsible for providing new members with appropriate orientation briefings and educational opportunities, and the full Committee with educational resources related to accounting principles and procedures, current accounting topics pertinent to the Company and other material as may be requested by the Committee. The Company will assist the Committee in maintaining appropriate financial literacy.
Authority
The Committee will have the resources and authority necessary to discharge its duties and responsibilities. The Committee has sole authority to retain and terminate outside financial experts or similar consultants, as it deems appropriate, including sole authority to approve the firms' fees and other retention terms. The Committee will be provided with appropriate funding by the Company, as the Committee determines, for the payment of compensation to the Company's independent auditor and other advisors as it deems appropriate, and ordinary administrative expenses of the Committee that are necessary or appropriate in carrying out its duties. In discharging its oversight role, the Committee is empowered to investigate any matter brought to its attention. Any communications between the Committee and legal counsel in the course of obtaining legal advice will be considered privileged communications of the Company, and the Committee will take all necessary steps to preserve the privileged nature of those communications. The Committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees and may delegate authority to one or more designated members of the Committee.
Responsibilities
The Committee's specific responsibilities in carrying out its oversight role are delineated in the Audit Committee Responsibilities Calendar. The Responsibilities Calendar will be updated annually to reflect changes in regulatory requirements, authoritative guidance, and evolving oversight practices. As the compendium of Committee responsibilities, the most recently updated Responsibilities Calendar will be considered to be an addendum to this Charter.
The Committee relies on the expertise and knowledge of management, the internal auditors and the independent auditor in carrying out its oversight responsibilities. Management of the Company is responsible for determining the Company's financial statements are complete, accurate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The independent auditor is responsible for auditing the Company's financial statements. It is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct audits, to determine that the financial statements are complete and accurate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, to conduct investigations, or to assure compliance with laws and regulations or the Company's standards of business conduct, codes of ethics, internal policies, procedures and controls.
