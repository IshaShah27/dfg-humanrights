PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS  TO BE HELD ON JANUARY 15, 2019
This proxy statement is furnished to holders of common stock of ContraVir Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Delaware corporation ("we," "us," "our," "ContraVir" or the "Company"), in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our board of directors (our "Board") for use at our 2018 annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held on January 15, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., local time, at the Company's offices, located at 399 Thornall Street, First Floor, Edison, New Jersey 08837.  This proxy statement is being distributed or made available, as the case may be, to stockholders on or about November 28, 2018.
You are invited to attend the Annual Meeting to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement. However, you do not need to attend the meeting to vote your shares. Instead, you may simply complete, sign and return the enclosed proxy card if you received paper copies of the proxy materials, or follow the instructions below to submit your proxy over the Internet.
Our Board is asking you to vote your shares by completing, signing and returning the accompanying proxy card. If you attend the Annual Meeting in person, you may vote at the Annual Meeting even if you have previously returned a proxy card. Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a proxy issued in your name from that record holder as described in more detail below.
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE ANNUAL STOCKHOLDERS MEETING TO BE HELD ON JANUARY 15, 2019: This proxy statement, the accompanying proxy card or voting instruction card and our transition report on Form 10-K are also available at www.pstvote.com/contravir2019.
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING
What is a proxy?
A proxy is the legal designation of another person to vote the stock you own. That other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document is also called a proxy or a proxy card. By completing, signing and returning the accompanying proxy card, you are designating Robert Foster and John Cavan, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, as your proxies for the Annual Meeting and you are authorizing Messrs. Foster and Cavan to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting as you have instructed them on the proxy card. This way, your shares will be voted whether or not you attend the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote in one of the ways described below so that your vote will be counted even if you are unable or decide not to attend the Annual Meeting. Table of Contents
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement is a document that we are required by regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or "SEC," to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy card designating Messrs. Foster and Cavan as proxies to vote on your behalf.
Why did you send me this proxy statement?
We sent you this proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card because our Board is soliciting your proxy to vote at the 2018 Annual Meeting of stockholders. This proxy statement summarizes information related to your vote at the Annual Meeting. All stockholders who find it convenient to do so are cordially invited to attend the Annual Meeting in person. However, you do not need to attend the meeting to vote your shares. Instead, you may simply complete, sign and return the enclosed proxy card.
We intend to begin making this proxy statement, the attached notice of Annual Meeting and the enclosed proxy card available on or about November 28, 2018 to all stockholders of record entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Only stockholders who owned our common stock on November 28, 2018 are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. In addition, on November 28, 2018 there were 85,581 shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on any matter with the holders of common stock on an as converted basis. On the record date, there were 16,566,787 shares of our common stock outstanding (including 222,867 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock).
Why did I Receive a Full Set of Proxy Materials in the Mail instead of a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials?
We are providing paper copies of the proxy materials instead of a Notice to our beneficial owners or stockholders of record who have previously requested to receive paper copies of our proxy materials. If you are a beneficial owner or stockholder of record who received a paper copy of the proxy materials, and you would like to reduce the environmental impact and the costs incurred by us in mailing proxy materials, you may elect to receive all future proxy materials electronically via email or the Internet. You can choose to receive future proxy materials electronically by visiting http://www.pstvote.com/contravir2019. Your choice to receive proxy materials electronically will remain in effect until you instruct us otherwise by following the instructions contained in your Notice and visiting http://www.pstvote.com/contravir2019, sending an electronic mail message to info@philadelphiastocktransfer.com, or calling 1-866-223-0448.
What am I voting on?
There are two proposals scheduled for a vote:
Proposal 1: Election of six (6) Directors:
ยท Gary S. Jacob, Ph.D.
ยท Robert Foster, Ph.D.
ยท John P. Brancaccio
ยท Thomas Adams, Ph.D.
ยท Timothy Block, Ph.D.
ยท Arnold Lippa, Ph.D
Proposal 2: To approve an amendment to the Company's 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2013 Plan") to increase the reservation of common stock for issuance thereunder to 2,837,500 shares from 1,337,500 shares. Table of Contents
How many votes do I have?
Each share of our common stock (including shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of Series A Preferred Stock) that you own as of November 28, 2018 entitles you to one vote.
How do I vote by proxy?
With respect to the election of directors, you may either vote "For" all the nominees to the Board or you may "Withhold" your vote for any nominee you specify. With respect to the amendment to our 2013 Plan, you may vote "For", "Against" or "Abstain" from voting.
Stockholders of Record:  Shares Registered in Your Name
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or vote by proxy using the enclosed proxy card. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure that your vote is counted. You may still attend the meeting and vote in person even if you have already voted by proxy.  To vote in person, come to the Annual Meeting and we will give you a ballot at the Annual Meeting. To vote using the proxy card, simply complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and return it promptly in the envelope provided. If you properly complete your proxy card and send it to us in time to vote, your proxy (one of the individuals named on your proxy card) will vote your shares as you have directed.  If you sign the proxy card but do not make specific choices, your shares will be, as permitted, voted as recommended by our Board. If any other matter is presented at the Annual Meeting, your proxy (one of the individuals named on your proxy card) will vote in accordance with his or her best judgment. As of the date of this proxy statement, we knew of no matters that needed to be acted on at the meeting, other than those discussed in this proxy statement.
Beneficial Owners:  Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank
If you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank or other agent, you should have received a proxy card and voting instructions with these proxy materials from that organization rather than directly from us. Simply complete and mail the proxy card to ensure that your vote is counted.  To vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or other agent.  Follow the instructions from your broker or bank included with these proxy materials, or contact your broker or bank to request a proxy form.
May I revoke my proxy?
If you give us your proxy, you may revoke it at any time before it is exercised. You may revoke your proxy in any one of the three following ways:
ยท you may send in another signed proxy with a later date;
ยท you may notify us in writing before the Annual Meeting that you have revoked your proxy; or
ยท you may notify us in writing before the Annual Meeting and vote in person at the meeting.
Can I vote via the Internet?
If your shares are registered in the name of a bank or brokerage firm, you may be eligible to vote your shares electronically over the Internet. A large number of banks and brokerage firms offer Internet voting. If your bank or brokerage firm does not offer Internet voting information, please complete and return your proxy card in the self-addressed, postage-paid envelope provided.
What constitutes a quorum?
The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders representing a majority of our outstanding common stock (including shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock) as of November 28, 2018 or approximately 8,283,394 shares, constitutes a quorum at the meeting, permitting us to conduct our business. Table of Contents
What vote is required to approve each proposal?
Proposal 1: Election of Directors. For Proposal 1, the six nominees who receive the most "For" votes (among votes properly cast in person or by proxy) will be elected. Only votes "For" or "Withheld" will affect the outcome.
Proposal 2: Amendment to Increase Reserve under 2013 Plan.   To be approved, Proposal 2 must receive "For" votes from the holders of a majority of the Company's voting capital present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.
Voting results will be tabulated and certified by our mailing and tabulating agent, Philadelphia Stock Transfer, Inc.
What are the Board's recommendations?
The recommendations of our Board are set forth together with the description of each proposal in this proxy statement. In summary, our Board recommends a vote:
ยท "FOR" election of the directors named in this proxy statement as described in Proposal 1; and
ยท "FOR" an amendment to the Company's 2013 Plan to increase the reservation of common stock for issuance thereunder to 2,837,500 shares from 1,337,500 shares as described in Proposal 2.
How can I attend the Annual Meeting?
You may attend the Annual Meeting if you are listed as a stockholder of record as of November 28, 2018 and bring proof of your identity. If you hold your shares in street name through a broker or other nominee, you will need to provide proof that you are the beneficial owner of the shares by bringing either a copy of a brokerage statement showing your share ownership as of November 28, 2018, or a legal proxy if you wish to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting. In addition to the items mentioned above, you should bring proof of your identity.
How can I vote my shares in person at the Annual Meeting?
Shares held directly in your name as the stockholder of record may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting. If you choose to do so, please bring proof of your identity to the Annual Meeting. Shares held in street name beneficially owned may be voted by you if you receive and present at the Annual Meeting a proxy from your broker or nominee, together with proof of your identity. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote in one of the ways described below so that your vote will be counted if you are unable or decide not to attend the Annual Meeting. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you change your proxy instructions as described above.
How can I vote my shares without attending the Annual Meeting?
Whether you hold shares directly as the stockholder of record or beneficially in street name, you may direct your vote without attending the Annual Meeting. You may vote by granting a proxy or, for shares held in street name, by submitting voting instructions to your broker or nominee. In most instances, you will be able to do this over the Internet or by mail. Please refer to the summary instructions below, and if you request printed proxy materials, the instructions included on your proxy card or, for shares held in street name, the voting instruction card provided by your broker or nominee.
ยท By InternetโIf you have Internet access, you may submit your proxy from any location in the world by following the Internet voting instructions on the proxy card or voting instruction card sent to you.
ยท By MailโYou may do this by marking, dating and signing your proxy card or, for shares held in street name, the voting instruction card provided to you by your broker or nominee, and mailing it in the enclosed, self-addressed, postage prepaid envelope. No postage is required if mailed in the United States Table of Contents
What is a broker non-vote?
A broker non-vote occurs if you hold shares in "street name" and do not provide voting instructions to your broker on a proposal and your broker does not have the discretionary authority to vote on such proposal. Matters subject to stockholder vote are classified as "routine" or "non-routine." In the case of non-routine matters, brokers may not vote shares held in "street name" for which they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner ("Broker Non-Votes"), whereas they may vote those shares in their discretion in the case of any routine matter. Broker Non-Votes will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the stockholder meetings, but will not be counted for purposes of determining the numbers of votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote with respect to a particular proposal. A broker is entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial holder on routine matters, without instructions from the beneficial holder of those shares. On the other hand, absent instructions from the beneficial holders of such shares, a broker will not be entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial holder on certain non-routine items, such as Proposal 1 (election of directors) and Proposal 2 (increase in reservation of common stock under 2013 Plan).  It is therefore important that you provide instructions to your broker if your shares are held by a broker so that your vote may be recorded. Votes cast by proxy or in person at the stockholder meetings will be tabulated by the inspectors of election appointed for the stockholder meetings, who also will determine whether a quorum is present.
What is the effect of abstentions and broker non-votes?
Shares of common stock held by persons attending the Annual Meeting but not voting, and shares represented by proxies that reflect abstentions as to a particular proposal, will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.  Abstentions are treated as shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, so abstaining has the same effect as a negative vote for purposes of determining whether our stockholders have approved each of the proposals.
Shares represented by proxies that reflect a "Broker Non-Vote" will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.  A "Broker Non-Vote" occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner has not received instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have discretionary authority to vote the shares for certain non-routine matters.  Because the election of directors is determined by a plurality of votes cast by a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, abstentions will not be counted in determining the outcome of such proposal.
What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?
If you receive more than one set of proxy materials, your shares may be registered in more than one name or in different accounts.  Please complete, sign and return each proxy card to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
I share the same address with another stockholder of the Company. Why has our household only received one set of proxy materials?
The SEC's rules permit us to deliver a single set of proxy materials to one address shared by two or more of our stockholders. This practice, known as "householding," is intended to reduce our printing and postage costs. We have delivered only one set of proxy materials to stockholders who hold their shares through a bank, broker or other holder of record and share a single address, unless we received contrary instructions from any stockholder at that address. However, any such street name holder residing at the same address who wishes to receive a separate copy of the proxy materials may make such a request by contacting the bank, broker or other holder of record.
Who is paying the costs of soliciting these proxies?
We will pay for the entire cost of soliciting proxies.  In addition to these mailed proxy materials, our directors and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by telephone or by other means of communication.  Directors and employees will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies but may be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation.  We will also reimburse brokerage firms, banks and Table of Contents other agents for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners.
How can I find out the results of the voting at the Annual Meeting?
Preliminary voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting.  Final voting results will be published in our current report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting.  If final voting results are not available to us in time to file a Form 8-K within four business days after the meeting, we intend to file a Form 8-K to publish preliminary results and, within four business days after the final results are known to us, file an additional Form 8-K to publish the final results.
When are Stockholder Proposals Due for the 2018 Annual Meeting?
Any appropriate proposal submitted by a stockholder and intended to be presented at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders must be submitted in writing to the Company's Secretary at 399 Thornall Street, First Floor, Edison, NJ 08873, and received no later than the close of business on the 10th day following the date on which such notice of the date of the 2019 annual meeting was mailed or the public disclosure of the date of the 2019 annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. A stockholder proposal will need to comply with the SEC regulations under Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), regarding the inclusion of stockholder proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials. Although the Board will consider stockholder proposals, we reserve the right to omit from our proxy statement, or to vote against, stockholder proposals that we are not required to include under the Exchange Act, including Rule 14a-8.
Pursuant to Rule 14a-4 under the Exchange Act, we intend to retain discretionary authority to vote proxies with respect to stockholder proposals for which the proponent does not seek inclusion of the proposed matter in our proxy statement for the 2019 annual meeting, except in circumstances where (i) we receive notice of the proposed matter a reasonable time before we send our proxy materials to our stockholders for the 2019 annual meeting, and (ii) the proponent complies with the other requirements set forth in Rule 14a-4.
PROPOSAL 1:
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Company's By-laws currently specify that the number of directors shall consist of one or more members, the exact number of which shall initially be fixed from time to time by the Board. The Company's Board currently consists of six persons, all of whom have been nominated by ContraVir to stand for re-election. Each director is elected or nominated to the Board until the following annual meeting of stockholders and until his successor has been elected and qualified or until the director's earlier resignation or removal.
The Board based on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has nominated Gary S. Jacob, Robert Foster, John P. Brancaccio, Thomas Adams, Timothy Block and Arnold Lippa for election as directors of ContraVir. All of the nominees are existing directors of ContraVir and each of the nominees has consented to being named as a nominee for director of ContraVir and has agreed to serve if elected.
Set forth below are the nominees to be elected to serve until the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders or until their respective successors have been duly elected and qualified.
To be elected as a director, each nominee must receive a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of our voting capital.
Should any nominee become unable or unwilling to accept election, the proxy holders may vote the proxies for the election, in his or her stead, of any other person our Board may nominate or designate. In the event that additional persons are nominated for election as directors, the proxy holders intend to vote all proxies received by them in such a manner as will ensure the election of the nominees listed below, and, in such event, the specific nominees to be voted for will be determined by the proxy holders.

Dr. Lippa's experience as a biotechnology company executive and a financier qualifies him to be a director of our Company.

Board Leadership Structure and Board's Role in Risk Oversight
We have a separate Chairman of the Board, Dr. Jacob, and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Foster. We believe that having an independent director serve as our Chairman allows our CEO to focus on our business, while allowing the Chairman to fulfill his fundamental Board leadership role, which includes providing advice to and independent oversight of our Board. As Chairman, Dr. Jacob serves as the primary liaison between the CEO and the independent directors and provides strategic input and counseling to the CEO. With input from other members of the Board, Table of Contents committee chairs and management, he presides over meetings of the Board. Dr. Jacob has developed an extensive knowledge of our company, its challenges and opportunities and has a productive working relationship with our senior management team.
The Board, as a unified body and through committee participation, organizes the execution of its monitoring and oversight roles and does not expect its Chairman to organize those functions. The Board has three standing committees โ Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance/Nominating. The membership of each of the Board committees is comprised of independent directors, with each of the committees having a separate chairman, each of whom is an independent director. Our non-management members of the board of directors meet in executive session at each Board meeting.
Risk is inherent with every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks the company faces, while the Board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, the Board has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed.
The Board recognizes that different leadership models may, depending upon individual circumstances, work for other companies and may be appropriate for us under different circumstances. The Board believes that we will be greatly benefited from having a single person setting the tone and direction for our company and having primary responsibility for managing its operations, while allowing the Board to carry out its oversight responsibilities with the full involvement of each independent director. Our CEO communicates frequently with members of the Board to discuss strategy and challenges facing the company. Senior management usually attends our regular quarterly Board meetings and is available to address any questions or concerns raised by the Board on risk management-related and any other matters. Each quarter, the Board receives presentations from senior management on matters involving our areas of operations.

PROPOSAL 2:
APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S 2013 PLAN TO INCREASE THE RESERVATION OF COMMON STOCK FOR ISSUANCE THEREUNDER TO 2,837,500 SHARES FROM 1,337,500 SHARES
Our Board adopted the 2013 Plan in June 2013. The Board initially authorized the issuance of up to 187,500 shares of common stock under the 2013 Plan. On December 2, 2014, our stockholders approved an increase in the authorized number of shares under the 2013 Plan to 812,500 shares, on December 14, 2016, our stockholders approved an increase in the authorized number of shares under the 2013 Plan to 962,500 shares and on  February 21, 2018, our stockholders approved an increase in the authorized number of shares under the 2013 Plan to 1,337,500 shares.
We are seeking stockholder approval in order to amend the 2013 Plan to increase the total number of shares of our common stock available for issuance thereunder to 2,837,500 shares.
Reasons for the Proposed Amendment
As described above, we are seeking stockholder approval of the amendment to increase the number of shares issuable pursuant to the 2013 Plan to 2,837,500 shares from 1,337,500 shares. As of November 28, 2018 there were 595,422 shares remaining available for issuance under the 2013 Plan. In determining the amount of the increase contemplated by the proposed amendment to the 2013 Plan, the Board has taken into consideration the fact that, as of November 28, 2018, there were approximately 16,343,920 shares of our common stock outstanding. If this amendment to the 2013 Plan is approved, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2013 Plan would increase by 1,500,000 shares to 2,837,500 shares. The requested increase represents approximately 9.2% of the outstanding shares of common stock and the total number of shares available for issuance under the 2013 Plan would represent approximately 12.8% of our common stock as calculated.
For the transition period ended December 31, 2017, the average burn rate at which shares of our common stock were granted under the 2013 Plan as a percentage of average basic shares outstanding in that period was approximately 5.1%.
Total potential dilution (as a percentage of shares of our common stock outstanding) associated with the 1,500,000 additional shares of our common stock to be authorized under the 2013 Plan plus the 742,078 shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2013 Plan (as of November 28, 2018) is 13.7%.
The historical burn rate and the potential dilution described above may not be indicative of what the actual amounts are in the future. The 2013 Plan does not contemplate the amount or timing of specific equity awards. The potential dilution is a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements are not facts. Actual results may differ materially because of factors such as those identified in reports we have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The purpose of this increase is to continue to be able to attract, retain and motivate executive officers and other employees and certain consultants. Upon stockholder approval, additional shares of common stock will be reserved for issuance under the 2013 Plan, which will enable us to continue to grant equity awards to our officers, employees and consultants at levels determined by the Board to be necessary to attract, retain and motivate the individuals who will be critical to our success in achieving its business objectives and thereby creating greater value for all our stockholders. We have no current plans to make awards under the 2013 Plan.
Furthermore, we believe that equity compensation aligns the interests of our management and other employees with the interests of our other stockholders. Equity awards are a key component of our incentive compensation program. We believe that option grants have been critical in attracting and retaining talented employees and officers, aligning their interests with those of stockholders, and focusing key employees on our long-term growth. We anticipate that option grants and other forms of equity awards such as restricted stock awards may become an increasing component in similarly motivating our consultants. Table of Contents
Approval of the amendment to the 2013 Plan will permit the Company to continue to use stock-based compensation to align stockholder and employee interests and to motivate employees and others providing services to us or any of our subsidiaries.
The terms of the 2013 Plan are summarized below and the full text of 2013 Plan is set forth as Exhibit 10.1 to our Registration Statement on Form S-8 filed with the SEC on May 4, 2015.  The full text of the proposed amendment to the 2013 Plan is set forth as Appendix A to this proxy statement. It is intended that the 2013 Plan qualify as an incentive stock option plan meeting the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
Summary of the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan
Employees, officers and directors of, and consultants and advisors to us, and any subsidiary, are eligible to receive awards under the 2013 Plan at the discretion of the Board or its designated committee. The Board, or a committee designated by the Board (for the purposes of this Proposal 2, "Board" shall also refer to such a committee, if any), has authority to, among other things:
ยท Determine the persons to whom, and the time or times at which, options shall be granted and the number of shares of common stock to be subject to each option;
ยท Designate options as incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options;
ยท Determine the fair market value of shares of stock or other property;
ยท Determine the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to each option (which need not be identical) and any shares acquired upon the exercise thereof, including, without limitation, (i) the exercise price of the option, (ii) the method of payment for shares purchased upon the exercise of the option; (iii) the method for satisfaction of any tax withholding obligation arising in connection with the option or such shares, including by the withholding or delivery of shares of stock, (iv) the timing, terms and conditions of the exercisability of the option or the vesting of any shares acquired upon the exercise thereof, including the grants of options on an immediately exercisable basis subject to repurchase restrictions in favor of us, (v) the time of the expiration of the option, (vi) the effect of the optionee's termination of service with us on any of the foregoing, and (vii) all other terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to the option or such shares not inconsistent with the terms of the 2013 Plan;
ยท Approve one or more forms of Option AgreementโIncentive Stock Option and Option AgreementโNonstatutory Stock Option;
ยท Amend, modify, extend, cancel, renew, reprice or otherwise adjust the exercise price of, or grant a new option in substitution for, any option or to waive any restrictions or conditions applicable to any option or any shares acquired upon the exercise thereof;
ยท Accelerate, continue, extend or defer the exercisability of any option or the vesting of any shares acquired upon the exercise thereof, including with respect to the period following an optionee's termination of service with us;
ยท Prescribe, amend or rescind rules, guidelines and policies relating to the 2013 Plan, or to adopt supplements to, or alternative versions of, the 2013 Plan, including, without limitation, as the Board deems necessary or desirable to comply with the laws of, or to accommodate the tax policy or custom of, foreign jurisdictions whose citizens may be granted options; and
ยท Correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the 2013 Plan or any option agreement and to make all other determinations and take such other actions with respect to the 2013 Plan or any option as the Board may deem advisable to the extent consistent with the 2013 Plan and applicable law. Table of Contents
Our employees and directors, and consultants, and any parent corporation, or subsidiary are eligible to receive nonstatutory stock options and other stock-based awards under the 2013 Plan. Only our employees, and any parent corporation or subsidiary, are eligible to receive incentive stock options under the 2013 Plan.
Incentive stock options may not be priced at less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant (110% of fair market value in the case of individuals holding 10% or more of our common stock). Except as otherwise determined by the Board, in the case of nonstatutory options, the exercise price may not be less than 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant in accordance with applicable law. The fair market value of our common stock on November 28, 2018, was $7,039,326, based on the closing sale price of our common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Capital Market on that date. The 2013 Plan provides that stock options and similar awards may be issued with exercise periods of up to 10 years (except that no Incentive Stock Option granted to 10% owners of the our common stock shall be exercisable after the expiration of five years after the effective date of grant of such option).
Payment of the exercise price of options under the 2013 Plan may be made in the form of: (1) cash, check or cash equivalent; (2) by tender to us, or attestation to ownership, of shares of common stock owned by the optionee having a fair market value not less than the exercise price; (3) such other consideration as may be approved by the Board to the extent applicable by law; (4) or any combination thereof, as determined by the Board.
In the event of termination of employment or consulting relationship for any reason other than disability or death, the award recipient may exercise his or her vested options within 90 days of the date of such termination. In the event of termination as a result of disability, the award recipient may exercise his or her vested options within one year following the date of such termination but in any event no later than the date of expiration of the option's term. In the event of death, the award recipient's estate may exercise his or her vested options within one year following the date of death. Upon the occurrence of a "Change in Control" (as defined in the 2013 Plan), the Board may, at its sole discretion, accelerate the vesting and exercisability of outstanding options.
The Board has discretion to grant other stock-based awards; provided, however, that no such awards may be made unless the terms of the 2013 Plan and the awards are in compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
Transfers of awards may not be made other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. During the lifetime of a participant, an award may be exercised only by the participant to whom the award is granted.
Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following is a summary of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences generally applicable to awards under the 2013 Plan. This summary does not purport to consider all of the possible U.S. federal tax consequences of the awards and is not intended to reflect the particular tax position of any award recipient. This summary is based upon the U.S. federal tax laws and regulations now in effect and as currently interpreted and does not take into account possible changes in such tax laws or such interpretations, any of which may be applied retroactively. Award recipients are strongly advised to consult their own tax advisors for additional information.
Grant of an Option    The grant of an option is not expected to result in any taxable income for the recipient as of the date of the grant, except that in the event non-statutory options are granted with an exercise price lower than the then-current fair market value of the common stock, the difference between the exercise price and the then-current fair market value may be treated as deferred compensation income recognized as of the date the non-statutory options are granted.
Exercise of Incentive Stock Option    The holder of an incentive stock option generally will have no taxable income upon exercising the option (except that a tax liability may arise pursuant to the alternative minimum tax), and the Company will not be entitled to a tax deduction.
Exercise of Nonqualified Stock Option    Generally, subject to Code Section 409A, upon exercising a nonqualified stock option, the award recipient must recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares of v acquired on the date of exercise over the exercise price. The income will be treated as Table of Contents compensation income subject to payroll and withholding tax obligations. The Company would be entitled to a compensation deduction in the amount of income recognized by the award recipient.
Disposition of Shares Acquired Through an Option    The tax consequence to a holder of an option upon a disposition of shares acquired through the exercise of an option will depend on how long the shares have been held and upon whether such shares were acquired by exercising an incentive stock option or by exercising a nonqualified stock option.
Generally, the disposition of shares which were acquired by exercise of an incentive stock option will be taxable as long-term capital gain or loss if the award recipient disposes of the shares more than two years after the option was granted and at least one year after exercising the option. If the award recipient fails to satisfy the holding period requirements for treatment as an incentive stock option, a disposition will result in any gain being treated as compensation income subject to ordinary tax rates. If the award recipient is still an employee of the Company at the time of the disposition, the amount of gain treated as compensation will also be subject to payroll and withholding taxes.
If an award recipient disposes of shares acquired through the exercise of a nonqualified option, any gain or loss will be treated as a capital gain or loss. To the extent such shares have been held for at least one year after exercise of the nonqualified option, the gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss.
Generally, there will be no tax consequence to us in connection with the disposition of shares acquired under an option, except that we may be entitled to a tax deduction in the case of the disposition of shares acquired under an incentive stock option before the applicable incentive stock option holding periods set forth in the Code have been satisfied.
The grant by the Board of other stock-based awards may have varying tax consequences to award recipients. Grants made pursuant to the 2013 Plan may be subject to Code Section 409A and plan administration may have to conform to Code Section 409A. Failure to comply with Code Section 409A, if applicable, will result in acceleration of income and imposition of penalties and interest to award recipients.
Application of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934    Special rules may apply in the case of individuals subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In particular, unless a special election is made pursuant to the Code, shares received pursuant to the exercise of a stock option may be treated as restricted as to transferability and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture for a period of up to six months after the date of exercise. Accordingly, the amount of any ordinary income recognized, and the amount of our tax deduction, are determined as of the end of such period.
Delivery of Shares to Satisfy Tax Obligation    Under the 2013 Plan, participants may deliver shares of common stock (either shares received upon the receipt or exercise of the award or shares previously owned by the holder of the option) to us to satisfy federal and state tax obligations unless the Board provides to the contrary in the award agreement.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of voting capital present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required to amend our 2013 Plan. Abstentions will be counted toward the tabulation of votes cast on this proposal and will have the same effect as negative votes. Broker Non-Votes will have no effect on this proposal as brokers or other nominees are not entitled to vote on such proposal in the absence of voting instructions from the beneficial owner.
Board Recommendation
OUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE TO AMEND THE 2013 PLAN TO INCREASE THE RESERVATION OF COMMON STOCK FOR ISSUANCE THEREUNDER TO 2,837,500 SHARES FROM 1,337,500 SHARES. Table of Contents
