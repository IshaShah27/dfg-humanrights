(''Navistar, Inc.'') and Navistar Financial Corporation (''NFC'').

Business Strategy  
Our 2018 Accomplishments
We continue to show positive progress on our top priorities as we move from a turn-around phase to a growth phase.  In 2018, we ended with a significant volume increase and we were the only brand to increase Class 8 market share.
Sales: In 2018, we increased our Class 8 market share in a strong industry environment by nearly 2%, and our Core chargeout volumes ended at 73,900.  Overall Class 6-8 retail market share was higher than the prior year.  Our all-makes Fleetrite® brand experienced double-digit growth year over year for our overall Parts segment (U.S., Canada, Mexico and export).
Product Launches:  We focused on our Core markets and investing in product development to increase customer value, improve our customers' business and enhance customer experience.
Truck:  In January 2018, we announced the International® HV™ Series Mid-Range Diesel which includes a bridge formula truck for the concrete industry. In March 2018, we announced the International® MV™ Series Mid-Range Diesel model, our new medium-duty truck.
Bus:  In February 2018, we announced the newly updated IC Bus™ RE Series Type D school bus featuring remote diagnostics connectivity solutions.  In July 2018, IC Bus™ became the first school bus original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to make electronic stability control and collision mitigation standard on all IC Bus models with air brakes.
Strategic Alliance:  Our strategic alliance with TRATON Group continues to progress. Within the strategic alliance, the parties formed a joint venture to make recommendations for sourcing, evaluating and negotiating joint procurement opportunities.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The procurement joint venture has continued to give us access to global scale to achieve significant cost reductions.  To date, our procurement joint venture has delivered over 90% of the target the parent companies had set for the first 24 months.  It has identified a pipeline of additional projects to deliver the cumulative savings projected over the first five years. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The rest of the strategic alliance is on plan to deliver technology and other synergies: 
◦ Pursuing medium-duty vehicle electric powertrain. 
◦ Collaborating on fully integrated, next generation diesel big bore powertrains. 
◦ Collaborating on connected vehicle hardware and service solutions. 
[END TABLE]
Quality and Uptime:  Our focus on improving quality and uptime can best be seen in the reduction of dealer dwell time through improvements in diagnostic and repair procedures.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Warranty expense as a percentage of manufacturing revenue has decreased to 1.7%, from 2.4% in the prior year. 
• Our new product command center ("Command Center") focuses on dwell time improvement for our new products.  In 2018,  the percent of repairs completed in 24 hours for our new A26 engine improved by 10 percentage points.  
[END TABLE]
OnCommand Connection ("OCC"): OCC is our unique open architecture, all-brands remote diagnostics system focusing on improving vehicle uptime for our customers.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• OCC supports the Command Center using proactive diagnostics and predictive tools.  
• We have over 600,000 vehicles actively reporting in OCC of which over 75% report via telematics. 
• We continue to add telematics partners to our portfolio. 
• In 2018, we launched OCC Telematics which includes access to the OCC Portal as a standard feature on our RH™, LT™ and Lonestar products. 
[END TABLE]
Cost Management: Focus on lowering material costs in our procurement and engineering organizations has resulted in improved margins.

 2019 Proxy Statement 5 
[END TABLE]
Our Expectations Going Forward
Going forward, we believe we are well-positioned and have the right strategic vision in place to build upon our 2018 accomplishments. We intend to be the number one choice and the most customer focused, innovative and value driven truck and bus solution provider in the Americas. To do that, we will prioritize and focus on closing the gaps before setting the new standard.  The strategic vision includes areas of focus centered around:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Customer-Centric 
• Operational Excellence 
• Core Business 
• Business Transformation 
• Strategic Alliance with TRATON Group and 
• Cross-Functional Teamwork and a Winning Culture 
[END TABLE]
By focusing on customer and market segmentation, we believe we will be able to better align our efforts with customer-specific applications and product requirements. We plan to continue to drive improvement of key performance metrics and we are committed to enhance customer value.  We are operating with great care to execute flawless launches.  We will further investigate electrification and build our eCommerce business to support our ease of doing business initiative. Together with our strategic alliance partner, TRATON Group, we expect to have a fully integrated proprietary powertrain as early as 2020, expect to launch the next generation connectivity module allowing feature sharing, and will launch an electric medium-duty truck and electric school bus. We intend to further develop our team-based organization, enhance collaborative work environments, and utilize visual management tools. We expect our financial performance to continue to improve due to savings from expected cost reduction actions and revenue growth.
TRATON Strategic Alliance 
In February 2017, we entered into a strategic alliance with TRATON AG , formerly Volkswagen Truck & Bus  AG  ("TRATON") pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of September 5, 2016, by and among  TRATON and us ("the Stock Purchase Agreement"), a License and Supply Framework Agreement and a Procurement JV Framework Agreement.  Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, we issued and TRATON purchased 16.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $256 million at $15.76 per share (the "Share Issuance"), equal to a 19.9% stake in the Company at that time (16.8% on a fully-diluted basis as of December 17, 2018). 
Also on September 5, 2016, we entered into a Stockholder Agreement with TRATON (the "Stockholder Agreement") which governs the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to TRATON's holdings in the Company following the Share Issuance, including the right of TRATON to nominate two directors to serve on our Board.  The Board approved the Share Issuance for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") and the Company and TRATON entered into an agreement which permits TRATON  to acquire up to 20% of the Company without triggering the restrictions that would otherwise be imposed under Section 203 of the DGCL (the "Section 203 Agreement").
During 2018 we continued the implementation of  our alliance with TRATON by entering into additional commercial agreements under the License and Supply Framework Agreement,  expanding the scope of the Procurement JV Framework Agreement and entering into certain other commercial agreements.  A description of the transactions between the Company and TRATON during 2018 is set forth in the Related Party Transactions and Approval Policy portion of the Corporate Governance section of this proxy statement.  
Changes in the Composition of our Board
General (Retired) Stanley A. McChrystal did not stand for reelection at the 2018 Annual Meeting. Michael F. Sirignano resigned from the Board in April 2018 and was immediately replaced as an MHR Group (as definedbelow) nominee by Raymond T. Miller.  Matthias Gründler resigned  from the Board in May 2018 and was replaced as a TRATON nominee in August of 2018 by 
Christian Schulz. Daniel A. Ninivaggi resigned from the Board in October 2018 and was immediately replaced as an Icahn Group (as defined below) nominee by Kevin M. Sheehan. With these changes, there was a 25% refreshment in the composition of our Board during 2018. During 2017, the two initial TRATON nominees replaced retiring directors Michael N. Hammes and James H. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 Proxy Statement 6 
[END TABLE]
Keyes, Jeffrey A. Dokho replaced Dennis D. Williams as the UAW appointed member and Daniel A. Ninivaggi replaced Samuel J. Merksamer as an Icahn Group nominee  Currently, a twelfth director position remains open.  Given a 33% and 25% refreshment in Board composition during 2017 and 2018, respectively, the 
Board is assessing its current mix of skills and attributes and is uncertain when the twelfth director position will be filled.  At the appropriate time for onboarding a twelfth director, the Board will take into consideration  the need to strengthen the Board by providing a diversity of expertise, age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, and other attributes which contribute to diversity.
Continued Stockholder Representation on our Board
Pursuant to amendments to settlement agreements (the ''Settlement Agreement Amendments'') we entered into with two of our largest stockholders, Carl C. Icahn and several entities controlled by him (collectively, the ''Icahn Group'') and Mark H. Rachesky, MD and several entities controlled by him (collectively, the ''MHR Group''), we granted each of the Icahn Group and the MHR Group the right to nominate two directors to serve on our Board, effective as of March 10, 2014, the date of our 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the ''2014 Annual Meeting'').  The current Icahn Group nominees serving as members of our Board are Vincent J. Intrieri and Kevin M. Sheehan.  The current MHR Group nominees serving as members of our Board are Dr. Mark H. Rachesky and Raymond T. Miller.  Mr. Intrieri, Mr. Sheehan, Dr. Rachesky and Mr. Miller are nominated for re-election.  In addition, pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement, TRATON was granted the right to nominate two directors to serve on our Board effective as of February 28, 2017, the date of the Share Issuance. The current TRATON  nominees serving as members of our Board are Andreas H. Renschler  and Christian Schulz.  Mr. Renschler and Mr. Schulz are nominated for re-election.  As a result, three (3) of our largest stockholders have Board representation and collectively hold six (6) of the eleven (11) seats currently filled on our  twelve (12)  seat Board.
Corporate Governance
During 2018, we strove to maintain effective governance practices and policies, and to solicit and consider input from our stockholders.  Beginning with the 2014 Annual Meeting, the Board was declassified and all directors became subject to annual election to one-year terms.  In February 2017, upon the election of Troy A. Clarke, our Chief Executive Officer, as Chairman, the Board appointed General (Retired) Stanley A. McChrystal as the Independent Lead Director. Currently, Vincent J. Intrieri and Mark H. Rachesky serve as Co-Independent Lead Directors. In addition to these actions, we believe that the following items, among others, contribute to a strong governance and compensation profile:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 10 of 11 directors are independent under our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the NYSE listing standards. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have Co-Independent Lead Directors.

Stockholder Communication and Compensation Policies
The Company has a robust stockholder outreach and engagement program in place.  We engage in regular contact with our stockholders throughout the year.  Approximately 70% of our stock is held by five of our stockholders.  Three of these stockholders have representation on our Board as discussed in our Executive Summary and Proposal One - Election of Directors.  These stockholders, through their representatives on our Board, also are members of our Compensation Committee and are integrally involved in our compensation decisions and policies.  We also engage in regular dialogue with our two remaining largest stockholders without representatives on our Board.  We maintain open lines of communication with corporate governance advisory institutions and with our top 25 stockholders on an annual basis in order to solicit their feedback.  We continuously work to improve these efforts and place importance on the feedback provided to us during this process.
We continue to focus on, and are aware of, investor concerns regarding the link between pay and performance.  In 2017 we met our annual incentive metrics and accordingly, awards were paid at 119.8% of target.  For 2018, Navistar met or exceeded the 2018 annual incentive plan targets for many of the performance goals while the Company was below target on other goals, which will yield an overall payout percentage of 112.4% of target.
For a summary of our commitment to best practices in executive compensation and changes made in 2018, please see the Executive Summary section of the Compensation, Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement.
Highlights of the changes made in 2018 include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Retained an Annual Incentive ("AI") plan that leverages our scorecard approach, retained the adjusted EBITDA multiplier, the individual performance factor, and market share and cost metrics, removed the EBIT (Parts EBIT) metric, added a quality metric and replaced Free Cash Flow with Operating Cash Flow 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Key differentiators in our 2018 Long-Term Incentive ("LTI") plan include transitioning from an annual to a 3-year performance cycle and replacing the Market Share metric with Revenue Growth while retaining the current vehicles and mix of performance-based and time-based equity as well as retaining the use of adjusted EBITDA and the relative Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") multiplier

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS REGARDING ATTENDANCE AND VOTING 
[END TABLE]
Why did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials?
Pursuant to the rules of the SEC, we have elected to provide access to our proxy materials over the internet. Accordingly, we have sent you a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the ''Notice'') because the Board is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the ''Annual Meeting'').  This proxy statement includes information that we are required to provide to you under the rules of the SEC and is designed to assist you in voting your shares.  All stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or request to receive a printed set of the proxy materials.  Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the internet or to request a printed copy can be found in the Notice.
What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting?
The purpose of the Annual Meeting is to have stockholders consider and act upon the matters outlined in the notice of Annual Meeting and this proxy statement, which include (i) Proposal 1 — the election of the nominees named in this proxy statement as directors, (ii) Proposal 2 — an advisory vote on executive compensation, a so-called ''Say-on-Pay'' proposal, (iii) Proposal 3 —  the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP (''KPMG'') as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and (iv) any other matters properly brought before the Annual Meeting.  In addition, management may report on the performance of the Company and respond to appropriate questions from stockholders.
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
The Board recommends that you vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the election of each of the director nominees (Proposal 1); 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the approval of the advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal 2); 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 3). 
[END TABLE]
Who can attend the Annual Meeting?
Anyone wishing to attend the Annual Meeting must have an admission ticket issued in his or her name. Admission is limited to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stockholders of record on December 17, 2018; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An authorized proxy holder of a stockholder of record on December 17, 2018; or 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An authorized representative of a stockholder of record who has been designated to present a properly-submitted stockholder proposal. 
[END TABLE]
You must provide evidence of your ownership of shares with your ticket request. The specific requirements for obtaining an admission ticket are specified in the Admission and Ticket Request Procedure section of this proxy statement.
What is a stockholder of record?
A stockholder of record or registered stockholder is a stockholder whose ownership of our common stock (''Common Stock'') is reflected directly on the books and records of our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services (the ''Transfer Agent'').  If you hold Common Stock through a bank, broker or other nominee, you hold your shares in ''street name'' and are not a stockholder of record.  For shares held in street name, the stockholder of record of the shares is your bank, broker or other nominee.  The Company only has access to ownership records for stockholders of record.  So, if you are not a stockholder of record, for the purpose of requesting an admission ticket to attend the Annual Meeting, you must present us with additional documentation to evidence your stock ownership as of the record date, such as a copy of your brokerage account statement, a letter from your broker, bank or other nominee or a copy of your voting instruction card from your broker, bank or other nominee.
When is the record date and who is entitled to vote?
The Board has set December 17, 2018, as the record date for the Annual Meeting.  Holders of shares of Common Stock on that date are entitled to one vote per share.  As of December 17, 2018, there were approximately 98,932,337 shares of Common Stock outstanding.  If you hold shares of our Common Stock as a participant in any of the Company's 401(k) or retirement savings plans, your proxy card will represent the number of shares of Common Stock allocated to your account under the plan and will serve as a direction to the plan's trustee as to how the shares in your account are to be voted.
A list of all registered stockholders will be available for examination by stockholders during normal business 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 Proxy Statement 10 
[END TABLE]
hours at the place of the Annual Meeting at least ten (10) days prior to the Annual Meeting and will also be available for examination at the Annual Meeting.
How do I vote?
For stockholders of record:  You may vote by any of the following methods:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 in person — stockholders who obtain an admission ticket (following the specified procedures) and attend the Annual Meeting in person may cast a ballot received at the Annual Meeting. 
 by Internet — stockholders may access the internet at www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions on the proxy card or in the Notice. 
 by scanning your QR code — to vote with your mobile device. 
 by phone — stockholders may call toll-free 1-800-690-6903 and follow the instructions on the proxy card or in the Notice. 
 by mail — if you requested and received your proxy materials by mail, you may complete, sign, date and mail the enclosed proxy card. 
[END TABLE]
For holders in street name: You will receive instructions from your bank or broker that you must follow in order for your shares to be voted.
How can I change or revoke my proxy?
For stockholders of record:  You may change or revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by (i) submitting a written notice of revocation to Navistar  c/o the Corporate Secretary at 2701 Navistar Drive, Lisle, Illinois 60532, (ii) signing and returning a new proxy card with a later date, (iii) validly submitting a later-dated vote via the Internet, by scanning your QR code or by telephone on or before 11:59 pm EST on February 11, 2019 or (iv) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.  For all methods of voting, the last vote properly cast will supersede all previous votes.
For holders in street name: You may change or revoke your voting instructions by following the specific directions provided to you by your bank or broker.
Is my vote confidential?
Yes. Proxy cards, ballots and voting tabulations that identify stockholders are kept confidential.  There are exceptions for contested proxy solicitations or when necessary to meet legal requirements.  Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., the independent proxy tabulator appointed by the Company for the Annual Meeting, will count the votes and act as the inspector of elections for the Annual Meeting.
Will my shares be voted if I do not provide my proxy?
For stockholders of record:  If you are the stockholder of record and you do not vote by proxy card, by telephone or via the internet or in person at the Annual Meeting, your shares will not be voted at the Annual Meeting.
For holders in street name:  If your shares are held in street name, under certain circumstances, your shares may be voted even if you do not provide the bank or brokerage firm with voting instructions.  Under NYSE rules, your broker may vote shares held in street name on certain ''routine'' matters without your instruction. NYSE rules consider the ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 3) to be a routine matter.   As a result, your broker is permitted to vote your shares on that matter at its discretion without instruction from you.  When a proposal is not a routine matter, such as the election of directors (Proposal 1) and the Say-On-Pay proposal (Proposal 2), and you have not provided voting instructions to the bank or brokerage firm with respect to that proposal, the bank or brokerage firm cannot vote the shares on that proposal.  The missing votes for these non-routine matters are called ''broker non-votes.''
What is the quorum requirement for the Annual Meeting?
Under the Company's Third Amended and Restated By-Laws (the ''By-Laws''), holders of at least one-third of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date must be present in person or represented by proxy in order to constitute a quorum for voting at the Annual Meeting.  Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum.
What vote is necessary for action to be taken on proposals?
It will depend on each proposal.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 1 (election of directors) requires a plurality vote of the shares present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote, meaning that the director nominees with the greatest number of affirmative votes are elected to fill the available seats.  As outlined in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, any director who receives more ''withhold'' votes than ''for''  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 Proxy Statement 11 
[END TABLE]
votes in an uncontested election is required to tender his resignation to the Nominating and Governance Committee for consideration and recommendation to the Board.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 2 (Say-On-Pay proposal) represents an advisory vote and the results will not be binding on the Board or the Company.  The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter will constitute the stockholders' non-binding approval with respect to our executive compensation programs.  Our Board will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 3 (ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm) requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote. 
[END TABLE]
With respect to Proposals 2 and 3 you may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN. If you abstain from voting on any of these proposals, the abstention will have the same effect as an AGAINST vote. With respect to Proposal 1, you may vote FOR all nominees, WITHHOLD your vote as to all nominees, or FOR all nominees except those specific nominees from whom you WITHHOLD your vote.  A properly executed proxy card marked WITHHOLD with respect to the election of one or more directors will not be voted with respect to the director or directors indicated.  Proxies may not be voted for more than ten directors and stockholders may not cumulate votes in the election of directors.  If you abstain from voting on Proposal 1, the abstention will not have an effect on the outcome of the vote.  Broker non-votes will not affect the outcome on a proposal that requires a plurality vote (Proposal 1) or on a proposal that requires the approval of at least a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote (Proposals 2 and 3).
Votes submitted by mail, telephone or Internet will be voted by the individuals named on the proxy and/or voting instruction card (or the individual properly authorized) in the manner indicated.  If you do not specify how you want your shares voted, they will be voted in accordance with our Board's recommendations.  If you hold shares in more than one account, you must vote each proxy and/or voting instruction card you receive to ensure that all shares you own are voted.
What is householding?
If you and other residents at your mailing address own shares of Common Stock in street name, your broker or bank may notify you that your household will receive only one annual report and proxy statement for the Company if you hold shares through that broker or bank. In this practice known as ''householding,'' you were deemed to have consented to receiving only one annual report and proxy statement for your household. Householding benefits both you and the Company because it reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household and helps the Company to reduce expenses.  Accordingly, the Company and your broker or bank will send one copy of the Notice (or our annual report and proxy statement if you have requested a physical copy) to your address.  Each stockholder will continue to be entitled to vote a separate proxy and/or voting instruction card.  We will promptly deliver an additional copy of either document to you if you call or write us at the following address or phone number: Investor Relations, Navistar International Corporation, 2701 Navistar Drive, Lisle, Illinois 60532, (331) 332-2143.  If you and other residents at your mailing address are receiving multiple copies of the Notice (or our annual report and proxy statement), and you prefer to receive only a single copy of each, you may so request by writing to us or contacting us at the address and phone number referred to above.
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card or more than one Notice?
Whenever possible, shares of Common Stock, including shares held of record by a participant in any of the Company's 401(k) or retirement savings plans, for multiple accounts for the same registered stockholder will be combined into the same Notice or proxy card.  Shares with different, even though similar, registered stockholders cannot be combined, and as a result, the stockholder may receive more than one Notice or proxy card.  For example, shares registered in the name of John Doe will not be combined on the same proxy card as shares registered jointly in the name of John Doe and his wife.  Shares held in street name are not combined with shares registered in the name of an individual stockholder or for a participant in any of the Company's 401(k) or retirement savings plans and may result in the stockholder receiving more than one proxy and/or voting instruction card. For example, shares held in street name by a broker for John Doe will not be combined with shares registered in the name of John Doe.
If you hold shares in more than one account, you must vote each proxy and/or voting instruction card you receive to ensure that all shares you own are voted.  If you receive more than one proxy and/or voting instruction card for accounts that you believe could be combined because the stockholder is the same, contact our Transfer Agent (for shares held by registered stockholders) or your broker (for shares held in street name) to request that the accounts be combined for future mailings.

Who pays for the solicitation of proxies?
This solicitation is being made by the Company. Accordingly, the Company pays the cost of soliciting proxies.  This solicitation is being made by mail, but also may be made by telephone, e-mail or in person. We have hired Alliance Advisors, LLC (''Alliance Advisors'') to assist in the solicitation of proxies.  Alliance Advisors' fees for their assistance in the solicitation of proxies are estimated to be $15,000, plus out-of-pocket expenses.  Proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers and employees who will not receive any additional compensation for those activities.  We will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for sending proxy materials to stockholders and obtaining their votes.
When are stockholder proposals or nominations due for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders?
In order to be included in the Company's proxy materials for our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, any such stockholder proposal must be received by the Company's Corporate Secretary no later than August 21, 2019.  Any proposal may be included in next year's proxy statement only if such proposal complies with the Company's By-Laws and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, specifically Rule 14a-8.
In addition, the Company's By-Laws require that the Company be given advance written notice of nominations for election to the Board and other matters that stockholders wish to present for action at an annual meeting of stockholders (other than matters included in the Company's proxy materials in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act). For matters to be presented at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company's Corporate Secretary must receive such notice no earlier than September 15, 2019, and no later than October 15, 2019.
The notice must contain, and be accompanied by, certain information as specified in the Company's By-Laws.  The Company recommends that any stockholder wishing to nominate a director at, or bring any other item before, an annual meeting of stockholders review the Company's By-Laws, which are available on the Company's website at http://www.navistar.com/navistar/investors/corporategovernance/documents.  All stockholder proposals and director nominations must be delivered to Navistar by mail c/o the Corporate Secretary at 2701 Navistar Drive, Lisle, Illinois 60532.
Are there any matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting that are not included in the proxy?
We do not know of any matters to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting other than those discussed in this proxy statement.  If any other matter is properly presented, proxy holders will vote on the matter in their discretion.
May stockholders ask questions at the Annual Meeting?
Yes. During the Annual Meeting, stockholders may ask questions or make remarks directly related to the matters being voted on.  In order to ensure an orderly meeting, we ask that stockholders direct questions and comments to the Chairman of the meeting.  In order to provide the opportunity to every stockholder who wishes to speak, each stockholder's remarks will be limited to two minutes. Stockholders may speak a second time only after all other stockholders who wish to speak have had their turn.
How can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?
Preliminary voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting.  Final voting results will be published in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting.  If the official voting results are not available at that time, we will provide preliminary voting results in the Form 8-K and will provide the final voting results in an amendment to the Form 8-K as soon as they become available.

PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
[END TABLE]
At the Annual Meeting, ten directors will be nominated for election.  An eleventh director is appointed by the United Automobiles, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (the ''UAW'') pursuant to a 1993 settlement agreement we entered into in connection with the restructuring of our postretirement health care and life insurance benefits and is not elected by the stockholders.  Currently, a twelfth director position is vacant.  Given the substantial refreshment in Board composition during 2017 and 2018, the Board intends to conduct a search process to identify the best candidate to fill this twelfth Board seat at a future date.  All directors elected at the Annual Meeting will be elected for a one-year term.
If a nominee is unavailable for election, proxy holders will vote for another nominee proposed by the Board or, as an alternative, the Board may reduce the number of directors to be elected at the Annual Meeting.  We know of no reason why any nominee would be unable to accept nomination or election.  All nominees have consented to be named in this proxy statement and to serve if elected.  
As discussed in the Executive Summary, during 2014 and pursuant to the Settlement Agreement Amendments we entered into with two of our largest stockholders (namely, the Icahn Group and the MHR Group), we granted each                of the Icahn Group and the MHR Group the right to nominate two directors to serve on our Board effective as of March 10, 2014, the date of our 2014 Annual Meeting.  The Icahn Group's current nominees are Mr. Vincent J. Intrieri and Mr. Kevin M. Sheehan.  The MHR Group's current nominees are Dr. Mark H. Rachesky and Mr. Raymond T. Miller.  Moreover, in connection with the TRATON alliance, and pursuant to the terms of the Stockholder Agreement, two persons nominated by TRATON were initially elected to our Board effective February 28, 2017 upon consummation of the Share Issuance.  TRATON's current nominees are Mr. Andreas H. Renschler and Mr. Christian Schulz.
The following summarizes additional information about each of the nominees and the continuing director as of the date of this proxy statement, including their business experience, public company director positions held currently or at any time during the last five years, involvement in certain legal or administrative proceedings, if applicable, and the experiences, qualifications, attributes or skills that qualify our nominees and the continuing director to serve as directors of the Company.  The nominees were evaluated and recommended by the Nominating and Governance Committee in accordance with the process for nominating directors as found in the Nominating Directors section of this proxy statement.

Corporate Governance Guidelines
Our Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at http://www.navistar.com/navistar/investors/corporategovernance/documents.  
These guidelines reflect the Board's commitment to oversee the effectiveness of policy and decision-making both at the Board and management level, with a view to enhancing stockholder value.
Related Party Transactions and Approval Policy
Our Policy and Procedures with Respect to Related Person Transactions governs the review, approval and ratification of transactions involving the Company and related persons where the amount involved exceeds $120,000.  Related persons include our executive officers, directors, director nominees, 5% stockholders and immediate family members of such persons, and entities in which one of these persons has a direct or indirect material interest.  Under this policy, prior to entering into any related-person transaction, the General Counsel or Corporate Secretary of Navistar is to be notified of the facts and circumstances of the proposed transaction, including: (i) the related person's relationship to the Company and interest in the transaction; (ii) the material facts of the proposed transaction, including the proposed aggregate value of such transaction or, in the case of indebtedness, the amount of principal that would be involved; (iii) the benefits to the Company of the proposed transaction; (iv) if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services; and (v) an assessment of whether the proposed transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to an unrelated third party or to employees generally.
The General Counsel or Corporate Secretary then assesses whether the proposed transaction is a related-person transaction for purposes of the policy and SEC rules.  If the General Counsel or Corporate Secretary determines that the proposed transaction is a related-person transaction for such purposes, the proposed transaction is then submitted to the Audit Committee of the Board for its consideration.  The Audit Committee considers all of the relevant facts and circumstances available, including (if applicable) but not limited to: (i) the benefits to the Company; (ii) the impact on a director's independence, in the event a person involved with, or connected to, the proposed transaction is a director; (iii) the availability of other sources for comparable products or services; (iv) the terms of the transaction; and (v) the terms available to unrelated third parties or to employees generally.  No member of the Audit Committee shall participate in any review, consideration or approval of any related-person transaction with respect to which such member or any of his or her immediate family members is the related person.  The Audit Committee will then make a recommendation to the Board.  The Board approves only those proposed transactions that are in, or are not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, as determined by the Board in good faith.  In the event that the Company becomes aware of a related-person transaction that has not been previously approved or ratified by the Board or the Audit Committee, a similar process will be undertaken by the Board and the Audit Committee in order to determine if the existing transaction should continue or be terminated and/or if any disciplinary action is appropriate.  The General Counsel or Corporate Secretary may also develop, implement and maintain from time to time certain administrative procedures to ensure the effectiveness of this policy.
A copy of our Policy and Procedures with Respect to Related Person Transactions is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at http://www.navistar.com/navistar/investors/corporategovernance/documents.
Since the beginning of 2018, the following related-person transactions occurred:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Carl C. Icahn.  As a 16.9% stockholder of the Company as of December 17, 2018, Carl C. Icahn is a related person.  During the first eleven months of 2018, Mr. Icahn owned 100% of Federal-Mogul Corporation (''Federal-Mogul'').  Mr. Icahn sold his entire interest in Federal Mogul to a third party on or about October 1, 2018.  Navistar purchased goods and services from Federal-Mogul throughout 2018 at a cost of approximately $16,401,884.  Navistar received standard terms and conditions and received no unique payment terms or special concessions.  Because Mr. Icahn owned Federal-Mogul in 2018, Mr. Icahn has an indirect material interest in this transaction.  The Audit  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 Proxy Statement 21 
[END TABLE]
Committee and the Board considered the factors described above and in December 2018 the Board, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, ratified the ongoing transactions with Federal-Mogul on the basis that the Navistar/Icahn/Federal-Mogul relationship is in the best interests of the Company.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• TRATON , Andreas H. Renschler and Christian Schulz.  The Company and its subsidiaries have historically had a series of commercial relationships with TRATON  and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and the parties entered into additional transactions prior to and during 2018.  The total aggregate value of these transactions amounted to approximately $157,367,629 during 2018.  As of December  17, 2018, TRATON is a 16.8% stockholder of the Company and is therefore a related person.  Messrs. Renschler and Schulz, who are members of our Board, are also the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, of TRATON.  By virtue of their positions as officers of TRATON , Messrs. Renschler and Schulz are deemed to have an indirect material interest in the Company's transactions with TRATON.  The related person transactions which existed, were entered into or are currently being proposed between the Company and TRATON during 2018 and the first two months of 2019 ("the TRATON Transactions") are as follows: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. Navistar pays MAN Truck & Bus AG ("MAN"), an indirect subsidiary of TRATON, a royalty for the use of certain base technology associated with our current A26 diesel engine and our discontinued 13 liter diesel engine. The royalty payment for 2018 was €1,775,800 (US$2,108,738). 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2. MWM International Motores, S.A. ("MWM"), one of our Brazil operating subsidiaries, purchases various parts from MAN and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.  In 2018, the amount paid for such parts, including commissions, was US$406,791. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3. MWM contract manufactures the D08 engine (6.9 and 4.6 liter) for MAN Latin America Indústria e Comérci de Veículos Ltda. ("MAN Latin America"), an indirect subsidiary of TRATON, sells block cylinders and loose engines to MAN Latin America and sells various spare parts to MAN Latin America and Volkswagen AG. The revenue and deferred revenue associated with this relationship during 2018 was approximately US$146,205,319 and US$828,872, respectively. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4. Global Truck & Bus Procurement LLC (the "Procurement JV"), a joint venture entity, was formed and commenced operations in 2017.  Owned 51% by TRATON, LLC (formerly known  
[END TABLE]
as Volkswagen Truck & Bus, LLC), a subsidiary of TRATON,  and 49% by International Truck and Engine Investments Corporation ("ITEIC"), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, the purpose of the Procurement JV is to make sourcing recommendations to TRATON and Navistar.  The Procurement JV's annual operating budget is funded on a cost plus basis.  In 2018, the parties each made operating cost payments to the Procurement JV in the amount of $2,301,428. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
5. Certain of our subsidiaries have entered into agreements, or are currently proposing to enter into agreements, with certain indirect subsidiaries of TRATON with respect to supplying us with big bore diesel engines with after-treatment and transmissions; a prototype Battery Electric Vehicle system; and certain consulting and /or engineering services in connection with our development and building of a prototype electric school bus, an electric battery for medium duty trucks, and a transmission for use with A26 engines.  Payments made by us under these agreements during 2018 totaled US$5,409,769. 
[END TABLE]
Each of the TRATON Transactions was the result of arms-length negotiations with no unique concessions on pricing or other terms and conditions, and certain of the transactions are of long-term strategic importance to the Company. The Audit Committee and the Board considered these factors and in December 2018 the Board, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee and with Messrs. Renschler and Schulz not participating since they have an indirect material interest, approved and ratified the TRATON Transactions on the basis that the Navistar/TRATON relationship is in the best interests of the Company.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Walter Borst.  As an executive officer of the Company, Walter Borst is a related person.  Mr. Borst currently serves as a trustee of Kettering University.  The Company has pledged a charitable gift to Kettering University in the amount of $2,000,000 to be paid in five annual payments of $400,000. The gift will fund technology research, scholarships for STEM students, and the naming rights for Kettering University's corporate common space.  In December 2018, the Audit Committee and the Board reviewed, approved and ratified the Kettering University charitable pledge.

[END TABLE]
Director Independence Determinations
We believe that a substantial majority of the members of our Board should be independent non-employee directors. Our Board has affirmatively determined that ten of our eleven directors, namely Dr. Rachesky and Messrs. Alapont, D'Arcy, Dokho, Intrieri, Miller, Renschler, Schulz, Sheehan and Suskind, qualify as ''independent directors'' in accordance with the NYSE's independence requirements and our own internal guidelines for determining director independence.  Each of these directors has also been determined to be financially literate.  All of the members of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Finance Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee are independent and financially literate.
Both the NYSE requirements and our own guidelines include a series of objective tests for determining the independence of a director, such as that the director or his family member is not an employee of Navistar and has not engaged in various types of commercial or charitable relationships with Navistar.  A copy of our existing guidelines for determining director independence, as included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at http://www.navistar.com/navistar/investors/corporategovernance/documents.  Our Board has made a determination as to each independent director that no relationship exists which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of the director's independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities as a director.  In making these determinations, our Board reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and Navistar with regard to each director's business and personal activities as they may relate to Navistar, its management and/or its independent registered public accounting firm.  This process included a review of the continuing development of Navistar's commercial relationships with TRATON for which Messrs. Renschler and Schulz serve as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively.  More information on the TRATON relationship is set forth in the Related Party Transactions and Approval Policy portion of the Corporate Governance section of this proxy statement.
Board Leadership Structure
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines require the Board to select the Chairman of the Board and the CEO and to determine from time to time whether the positions are combined and filled by one person or separated and filled by two persons. Prior to 2013, our CEO served as Chairman and we had an Independent Lead Director.  Beginning in April 2013, with the appointment of Mr. Clarke as our CEO, our Board decided to select one of our independent directors to serve as Chairman.  Upon  that director's retirement at the 2017 Annual Meeting, the Board determined that it was an appropriate time to appoint Mr. Clarke as Chairman.  Mr. Clarke would continue to serve as the CEO as well.  Accordingly, also at the 2017 Annual 
Meeting, General Stanley McChrystal was selected as the Independent Lead Director.   However, General McChrystal elected to not stand for re-election at the  2018 Annual Meeting. The Board continued to believe that this leadership structure was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, but it did not immediately identify a successor Independent Lead Director.  After careful  consideration and discussion by and among the Nominating and Governance Committee and the full Board, on October 16, 2018, Vincent J. Intrieri and Mark H. Rachesky were selected as the Co-Independent Lead Directors.  
Risk Oversight
Our Board has overall responsibility for the oversight of risk management at our Company.  Day-to-day risk management is the responsibility of management, which has implemented an Enterprise Risk Management process to identify, assess, manage and monitor risks that our Company faces.  Enterprise Risk Management operates within our Internal Audit and Corporate Compliance department and coordinates its efforts with that department.  Our Board, either as a whole or through its committees, regularly discusses with management our major risk exposures, their potential impact on our Company, and the steps we take to monitor and control such exposures.
While our Board has general oversight responsibility for risk at our Company, the Board has delegated some of its risk oversight duties to the various Board committees.  In particular, the Audit Committee is responsible for generally 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 Proxy Statement 23 
[END TABLE]
reviewing and discussing the Company's policies and guidelines with respect to risk assessment and risk management.  It also focuses on the Company's management of financial risk exposure and oversees risks related to the Company's financial statement compliance and control environment.  The Nominating and Governance Committee oversees risks related to corporate governance, including risk related to the political environment.  The Compensation Committee assists our Board in overseeing the management of risks arising from our compensation policies and programs and programs related to assessment, selection, succession planning, training and development of executives of the Company.  Finally, the Finance Committee is responsible for overseeing policies with respect to financial risk assessment and financial risk management including, without limitation, risks relating to liquidity/access to capital and macroeconomic trends/environment risks.  Each of the Board committees periodically reviews these risks and then discusses the process and results with the full Board.
Nominating Directors
You may recommend any person as a candidate for director for election at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders by writing to our Corporate Secretary at 2701 Navistar Drive, Lisle, Illinois 60532 and complying with the procedures set forth in the Company's By-Laws.  Your letter must be received by Navistar's Corporate Secretary no earlier than September 15, 2019, and no later than October 15, 2019, and must include all of the information required by the Company's By-Laws including, but not limited to, the proposed nominee's biographical information and principal occupation; the number of shares of capital stock of the Company which are owned by the proposed nominee, appropriate information about the proposed nominee that would be required to be included in a proxy statement under the rules of the SEC, the number of shares held by you, information about the relationship between the proposed nominee and you, any pending or threatened litigation in which the proposed nominee is a party and a representation that you intend to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the proposed nominee.  Your letter must be accompanied by the written consent of the proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.  You may only recommend a candidate for director if you hold shares of Common Stock on the date you give the notice described above, on the record date for the annual meeting of stockholders at which you propose such nominee be elected and on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders at which you propose such nominee be elected.
The Nominating and Governance Committee identifies nominees for directors from various sources, including suggestions from Board members and management, and in the past has used third party consultants to assist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees.  The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider persons recommended by the stockholders in the same manner as a committee-recommended nominee.  The Nominating and Governance Committee has specified the following minimum qualifications that it believes must be met by a nominee for a position on the Board:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• knowledge and contacts in the Company's industry and other relevant industries; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• positive reputation in the business community; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the highest personal and professional ethics and integrity and values that are compatible with the Company's values; 
[END TABLE]

• experiences and achievements that provide the nominee with the ability to exercise good business judgment; 
• ability to make significant contributions to the Company's success; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ability to work successfully with other directors; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• willingness to devote the necessary time to the work of the Board and its committees which includes being available for the entire time of meetings; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ability to assist and evaluate the Company's management; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• involvement only in other activities or interests that do not create a conflict with his or her responsibilities to the Company and its stockholders; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• understanding of and ability to meet his or her responsibilities to the Company's stockholders, including the duty of care (making informed decisions) and the duty of loyalty (maintaining confidentiality and avoiding conflicts of interest); and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• potential to serve on the Board for at least five years. 
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Governance Committee believes that consideration should also be given to having a diversity of backgrounds, skills, and perspectives among the directors.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 Proxy Statement 24 
[END TABLE]
In addition, in selecting directors, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider the need to strengthen the Board by providing a diversity of persons in terms of their expertise, age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, and other attributes which contribute to the Board's diversity.  Our Board diversity policy is contained within our Corporate Governance Guidelines.
The satisfaction of the above criteria is implemented and assessed through ongoing consideration of directors and nominees by the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board, as well as through the Board's self-evaluation process.  Based upon these activities and its review of the current composition of the Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board believe that these criteria have been satisfied.
As outlined in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, any director who receives more ''withheld'' votes than ''for'' votes in an uncontested election is required to tender his resignation to the Nominating and Governance Committee for consideration and recommendation to the Board.  The Board will publicly disclose its decision.
Board Committees and Meetings
The Board documented its governance practices, policies and procedures in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.  These governance standards embody many of our long-standing practices, policies and procedures, which are the foundation of our commitment to best practices.  In October 2018, the Board conducted an evaluation of the committees and the Board.
The Board has four standing committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Finance Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee.  Each of the committees is governed by a written charter, copies of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at http://www.navistar.com/navistar/investors/ corporategovernance/documents.
In 2018, the full Board met 9 times.  In addition, the Board's independent directors meet regularly in executive session without management present to, among other things, evaluate the performance of the CEO and discuss corporate strategies.  The chairs of our Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance and Finance Committees of the Board each preside as the chair at meetings or executive sessions of independent directors at which the principal items to be considered are within the scope of the authority of his committee.
During 2018 each of the directors attended 75% or more of all the meetings of the Board and the committees on which he serves with the exception of Andreas H. Renschler. The average attendance of all directors at meetings of the Board and the committees on which they served in 2018 was 94%.  We encourage all Board members to attend all meetings, including the Annual Meeting.  Ten of our eleven directors who were directors at the time of our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders attended that meeting with two of the ten participating by teleconference.

DSUs PSUs and RSUs
Under our Executive Stock Ownership Program in effect for 2013 and prior years, executives were entitled to defer their cash bonus into DSUs.  If an executive officer elected to defer a cash bonus, the number of shares shown for such NEO (and for all Executive Officers included in all Directors and Executive Officers as a group) includes these DSUs.  These DSUs vested immediately.  The number of shares shown as owned for each NEO (and for all Executive Officers included in all Directors and Executive Officers as a group) also includes PSUs that were awarded pursuant to the Executive Stock Ownership Program.  PSUs vested in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date on which they were awarded.  Effective November 1, 2013, our Executive Stock Ownership Program was amended and restated to, among other things, eliminate an executive's ability to earn PSUs or defer their cash bonus into DSUs.
Under our Non-Employee Directors Deferred Fee Plan, directors may defer all or a portion of their annual retainer into DSUs.  If a director elected to defer a portion of his annual retainer into DSUs, these DSUs are shown as owned for such director (and included in all Directors and Executive Officers as a group).
Certain of our executives have been awarded share settled RSUs under the 2013 Performance Incentive Plan.  The RSUs vest in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant or cliff vest as to 100% of the shares granted on the third anniversary of the date of grant, and are converted into our Common Stock on a one to one basis at time of vesting.

PROPOSAL 2 — ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
[END TABLE]
At our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, a majority of our stockholders voted in favor of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation on an annual basis.  In light of those results, our Board determined that the Company will continue to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation on an annual basis.  The next required non-binding advisory vote regarding the frequency interval will be held at our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. 
The Company places importance on the feedback of our stockholders regarding our compensation practices.  We are focused on continuously reviewing and improving such practices in order to best align executive pay with Company performance.  At our 2017 and 2018 annual meetings of stockholders, our stockholders expressed their support of our executive compensation programs by approving our non-binding advisory vote on our executive compensation by approximately 97% and 99% of those voting, respectively.  Since that time we have continued our stockholder outreach initiatives and our continuous efforts to best align executive pay with Company performance.
As described more fully in our Compensation, Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A"), our executive compensation programs for our NEOs, as well as other executives, are designed to closely align executive rewards with the total return to stockholders and both corporate and individual performance.  As evidence of our commitment to align executive pay with Company performance: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The 2016 LTI performance targets are projected to be below target but above threshold for the performance-based portion of the award.   
[END TABLE]

• The 2017 LTI performance targets are projected to be above target for Adjusted EBITDA and at target for Market Share.

• The 2018 LTI performance targets are projected to be above target for Adjusted EBITDA and above target for Revenue Growth. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The 2018 AI awards will be paid out at 112.4% of target percentage due to our achievements. 
[END TABLE]
The Board urges our stockholders to read the CD&A, which describes in more detail the changes made to the executive compensation programs and how the executive compensation programs are designed to support our Company and our business strategies in concert with our culture, compensation philosophies and guiding principles.  We believe that the Company's executive compensation programs appropriately align pay and performance and enable the Company to attract and retain talented executives within our industry.
We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our executive compensation as described in this proxy statement, as required pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act. This proposal, commonly known as a ''say-on-pay'' proposal, gives you as a stockholder the opportunity to express your views on our 2018 executive compensation policies and procedures described in this proxy statement.
This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs as described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote ''FOR'' the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of the Company approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K in the Company's proxy statement for the Annual Meeting.
Although this is an advisory vote that will not be binding on the Compensation Committee or the Board, we will carefully review the results of the vote, as we did last year. The Compensation Committee will consider our stockholders' concerns and take into account the outcome of ''say-on-pay'' votes when designing future executive compensation programs.  The Board recommends that you indicate your support for the Company's executive compensation in 2018, as outlined in the above resolution.

Executive Summary
During 2018, we continued the implementation of our strategic alliance with TRATON AG, launching products valued by our customers, improving quality and uptime, and increasing Class 8 market share.  We continue to make strong financial progress and are optimistic about 2019.
The Company has a robust stockholder outreach and engagement program in place.  We engage in regular contact with our stockholders throughout the year.  Approximately 70% of our stock is held by five of our stockholders.  Three of these stockholders have representation on our Board as discussed in our Executive Summary and Proposal One - Election of Directors.  These stockholders, through their representatives on our Board, also are members of our Compensation Committee and are integrally involved in our compensation decisions and policies.  We also engage in regular dialogue with our two remaining largest stockholders without representatives on our Board.  We maintain open lines of communication with corporate governance advisory institutions and with our top 25 stockholders on an annual basis in order to solicit their feedback.  We continuously work to improve these efforts and place importance on the feedback provided to us during this process.
An overall objective of our executive compensation program is to maintain a linkage between pay and performance, both long-term and short-term.  Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization ("EBITDA") is a key pay component linked to pay for performance and our short and long-term incentives. In 2018 the Company saw an improvement of approximately $244M in adjusted EBITDA. Also in 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company approved 2018 long-term equity awards ("LTI") for each executive based on an assessment of such executive's performance and scope of the executive's role. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Based on 2018 results, the 2018 LTI awards based on performance measures are projected to be above target for adjusted EBITDA and above target for Revenue Growth. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Based on 2018 performance measures of our short-term annual incentive ("AI") plan, 2018 AI awards will be paid at 112.4% of target. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For 2019, AI performance goals as determined by our Compensation Committee will include Market Share, Cost, Liquidity and Uptime with both an adjusted EBITDA multiplier and an individual performance factor. 
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the Compensation Committee took the following actions with respect to the Company's executive compensation program:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maintained our clawback policy, which enables the Company to recover incentive-based compensation in the event of an accounting restatement due to material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements, as well as intentional misconduct; and

Compensation Governance Measures
[BEGIN TABLE]
What We Do What We Don't Do 
We use multiple performance measures in our short-term and long-term incentive plans. These performance measures link pay to performance and stockholder interests.   The Company maintains policies that eliminate all tax gross-ups for perquisites and other similar benefits to Section 16 Officers, and prohibit tax gross-ups for any cash or equity awards for all employees.

The Company maintains policies that eliminate all tax gross-ups for perquisites and other similar benefits to Section 16 Officers, and prohibit tax gross-ups for any cash or equity awards for all employees. 
The Compensation Committee reviews external market data when making compensation decisions. We do not reprice stock options.  
The Compensation Committee selects and engages its own independent advisor, Pay Governance LLC. We prohibit short selling, trading in derivatives or engaging in hedging transactions by executives and directors.  In addition, any pledging and margin account use must be pre-cleared through the Corporate Secretary or the General Counsel.

In addition, any pledging and margin account use must be pre-cleared through the Corporate Secretary or the General Counsel.  
We maintain a clawback policy to recoup incentive-based compensation in the event of an accounting restatement. We do not accelerate the vesting of long-term incentive awards, except in certain situations upon death. 
Change in Control severance benefits are payable only upon a Change in Control (also referred to throughout as "CIC") with termination of employment ("double trigger"). We do not grant extra pension service with the exception of CIC as outlined in our Executive Severance Agreements. 
To aid in aligning the interest of our shareholders and officers, all officers are subject to stock ownership requirements, ranging from 6x base pay for the CEO to 3x base pay for other senior executives - including a retention requirement.   
Our 2018 long-term incentive plans includes both absolute and relative performance metrics.    
[END TABLE]
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
We believe the compensation of our executives should be closely tied to the performance and growth of the Company, so that their interests are aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders.  Consistent with this philosophy, the following guiding principles provide a framework for the Company's executive compensation program:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competitive Positioning:  Total remuneration is designed to attract and retain the executive talent necessary to achieve our goals through a market competitive total remuneration package. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay-for-Performance:  A substantial portion of each named NEO's compensation is performance-based with a direct link to Company as well as individual performance. It is designed to align the interests of executives and stockholders. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ownership and Responsibility:  Compensation programs are designed to recognize individual contributions as well as link NEO and stockholder  
[END TABLE]
interests through programs that reward our NEOs, based on the financial success of the Company and increases to stockholder value.
The Company actively engages stockholders in Say-On-Pay discussions.  Three of the largest stockholders are represented on the Board as well as the Compensation Committee.  Other stockholder opinions are solicited in discussions throughout the year and the Company continues to align pay with performance throughout the organization based on best practices.
Pay for Performance 
We continue to take actions that we believe will improve our efficiency and performance and continue to evaluate additional opportunities to enhance value to our customers. We had many accomplishments in 2018, including progressing our strategic alliance with TRATON, launching products valued by our customers, improving quality and uptime, and increasing Class 8 market share.  For 2018, AI awards will be paid out at 112.4% of target.

Pay Mix 
A key goal of our compensation philosophy and objectives, is the alignment of the pay mix for our CEO and top executives compared to the market. By pursuing that alignment, we can be assured that not only are the elements appropriate, but the overall package is properly designed. Although recommendations relative to each of these compensation elements are made separately, the 
Compensation Committee considers the total compensation and benefits package when making any compensation decision.
Working with an independent compensation advisor, we developed the following charts which illustrate the alignment of Navistar's executive pay and the external marketplace.

Detailed Review of Executive Compensation
Compensation Consultant
The Compensation Committee engages the services of an independent compensation consultant to assist with decisions regarding executive compensation plans and programs.  The independent compensation consultant reports solely to the Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee uses Pay Governance, LLC to render the following services:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attend committee meetings at the request of the Compensation Committee; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Advise the Compensation Committee on market trends, regulatory issues and developments and how these could impact our executive compensation programs;

The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to approve the terms of Pay Governance's engagement. 
Pay Governance did not provide any services to the Company other than executive compensation consulting services during 2018.
In compliance with SEC and NYSE requirements regarding the independence of compensation consultants, Pay Governance provided the Compensation Committee with information regarding any personal, financial, or business relationships between Pay Governance and the Company, its management, or the members of the Compensation Committee that could impair Pay Governance's independence or present a conflict of interest.  Based on its review of this information, the Compensation Committee determined that there were no relationships that impair the independence or create a material conflict of interest between Pay Governance, the Company and the partners, consultants, and employees who service the Compensation Committee on executive compensation matters and governance issues.  
Compensation Peer Group
Annually, we conduct a peer company review to determine whether our comparator companies continue to meet our criteria for inclusion. For 2018, management recommended and the Compensation Committee approved two changes to our peer group. Joy Global, Inc. was acquired by Komatsu America  and was removed from our peer group. Cooper-Standard Holdings, Inc. is similarly sized to Joy Global, Inc. and meets several of our criteria and was added to our peer group.
We continue to select companies similar in overall size to Navistar with consideration being given to companies that meet one or more of the following criteria:

External Market Compensation Review
The Compensation Committee reviews various components of our executive compensation program to ensure that (i) pay opportunities are competitive with the external market, (ii) there is an appropriate link between performance and pay, and (iii) the program supports our stated compensation philosophy.
In 2018 our Compensation Committee reviewed total compensation levels and mix relative to the above-
described peer group and broader industry surveys published by Aon Hewitt.  Survey market pay data has been size-adjusted to Navistar's revenues (corporate and unit-specific) and updated to January 1, 2019.  Please refer to Appendix A of this proxy statement for a list of survey participants in Aon Hewitt's 2017 U.S. Total Compensation Measurement (''TCM'') Executive & Senior Mgmt. Level Wise Survey.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 Proxy Statement 39 
[END TABLE]
We maintain our compensation philosophy of targeting the 50th percentile (market median) for base salary, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives, using a combination of peer group and market surveys. We consider a NEO to be within the competitive range if the NEO's total direct compensation (base salary plus target bonus plus the approved grant value of long-term incentives) is within 80 to 120 percent of the market median.  Under special circumstances, when we are recruiting for critical roles, we may target an NEO's salary to a higher level. 
Elements of Total Direct Executive Compensation
[BEGIN TABLE]
Pay Element What it Does Performance Measures 
Base Salary Provides competitive base salary, typically reviewed annually, and  balances risk-taking concerns with stockholder interests Job scope, experience, performance and market data 
Short-term Annual Incentive or AI Provides a competitive incentive opportunity and aligns individual, business unit and Company performance The goals established for 2018 include Market Share, Cost,  Liquidity and Quality as well as an adjusted EBITDA multiplier 
Long-Term Equity Incentives or LTI (including stock option grants) Aligns executive and stockholder interests by tying compensation to share price appreciation, builds long-term stockholder value, and  cultivates stock ownership The amount of the 2018 LTI awards were adjusted for each executive based upon an evaluation of both individual performance in addition to the scope of the position within the organization 
[END TABLE]
Chief Executive Officer Total Direct Compensation or "TDC"
Troy A. Clarke was named as the President and CEO in April 2013.  The Board, with the assistance of the independent compensation advisor, reviewed CEO pay levels of our peer group, as well as those of other manufacturing organizations with similar revenues. Consistent with our compensation philosophy and the market review for other company chief executive officers, the Compensation Committee targeted total compensation at the market median but believed the pay for the President and CEO should be weighted with the greatest emphasis on performance.
Mr. Clarke's compensation is specifically structured to focus on performance over the longer term and was negotiated with significant input from our stockholder-nominated directors.  
In general, our practice excludes the use of employment contracts for NEOs, except with respect to the Company's CEO. Previously, in connection with Mr. Clarke's appointment to President and CEO in April 2013, we entered into a three-year employment and services agreement with him (the "Employment Agreement") which was extended for two additional years in April 2016.  Mr. Clarke's Employment Agreement was amended in April  2018 to extend the expiration of the Agreement for one year (the "2018 Employment Agreement Amendment").   The 2018 Employment Agreement Amendment includes a "service after term" provision under which, in summary, Mr. Clarke agrees to serve as Executive Chairman of the Board  and/or as a senior advisor to Navistar for a period of not less than one year after he ceases serving as President and CEO.

CEO Performance Evaluation
Traditionally, each year in December, the Compensation Committee and the independent members of the Board evaluate the CEO's performance for the prior year.  This review is based on the CEO's achievement of goals set at the start of that prior year.  The CEO presents information on the achievement of such goals solely to the independent members of the Board, who then discuss it in executive session without the CEO present.  The independent members' evaluation of the CEO's performance then forms the basis for the decision on the CEO's short-term incentive award under our AI plan for the prior year.  The Chairman of the Compensation Committee then informs the CEO of the performance evaluation and any compensation decisions resulting from that evaluation.  In December 2018, the independent members of the Board discussed and evaluated Mr. Clarke's accomplishments as CEO. These accomplishments include:

Goal Setting For Incentive Plans
On an annual basis, the Board reviews a multi-year strategic plan developed and presented by the management team. Based on that plan, an operating plan is developed for the subsequent year and reviewed by the Board. The Compensation Committee approves the AI and LTI plan targets on the basis of the annual operating plan. The operating plan is based upon the goals of sustaining profitability and competitiveness with the market and the strategic plan incorporates long-term growth targets.
Annual Incentive or "AI"
Navistar provides its executives with an annual incentive compensation opportunity through the Annual Incentive ("AI") plan, a short-term incentive plan designed to align a significant portion of their total cash compensation with the overall financial performance of the Company. Each executive's target award is determined based on a percentage of their base pay and organization level.  For 2018, Mr. Clarke's target annual incentive opportunity is 125% of base salary. For other NEOs, target awards range from 55 to 75 percent of base salary.
2018 Annual Incentive 
The AI plan for 2018 was based on the attainment of 100% corporate goals established and approved by the Compensation Committee. The AI plan was authorized under our stockholder approved 2013 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2013 PIP"). The AI plan has threshold, target, and distinguished goal ranges for NEOs from 40% to 150%. AI payout targets for NEOs ranged from 55% to 125% of base salary. Consolidated financial results between performance levels were interpolated on a straight-line basis to determine payment amounts.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each AI financial performance metric is independent. Eligibility for payout is based on the attainment of each individual metric. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We use two design features: an adjusted EBITDA multiplier which scales the annual incentive up or down from the target level based upon actual financial performance of Navistar, and an individual performance factor.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We continue to leverage our AI scorecard using multiple performance metrics. This allows the NEOs to see how their individual achievements contribute to the overall effort and success of the Company.

Payout levels will be interpolated on a straight line basis between threshold, target, and distinguished levels.
Long-Term Incentives or "LTI"
Our objectives for including long-term incentives as part of our executive officer's total compensation package include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aligning NEO and stockholder interests by tying compensation to share price appreciation; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Building long-term stockholder value; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cultivating stock ownership.

LTI awards are governed by the 2013 PIP, which is an omnibus plan that allows for various awards such as cash, time and performance based stock options, stock appreciation rights, time and performance-based RSUs, restricted cash units ("RCUs"), PSUs, DSUs and performance shares.
The Compensation Committee approved LTI awards under the 2013 PIP for 2018 for eligible plan participants in February 2018.  LTI awards granted to NEOs in 2018 were comprised of performance-based RCUs, based on adjusted EBITDA and revenue growth goals, time-based RSUs, and time-based stock options as indicated in the following table. The value of each NEO's LTI awards was split 50% in RCUs, 30% in RSUs and 20% in stock options.

(1)  Life Insurance. We provide our executives Company-paid life insurance equal to five times base salary. The beneficiary of each individual policy is as designated by the executive.
(2)  Executive Flexible Perquisites. This provides a cash stipend to each of our NEOs, the amount of which varies by executive, based upon the executive's organization level and is set forth in the table below.  
In addition, a spouse may accompany an NEO while he or she is traveling on Company business. Although this occurs on a limited basis, the spouse's travel expense is included in taxable compensation of the NEO. 
(3)  Pension/Retirement/401(k) Plans
We began transitioning to defined contribution/401(k) plans as the primary retirement income program for all non-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 1996. These plans are as follows:
• Retirement Accumulation Plan (''RAP''). This is our tax-qualified defined contribution/401(k) plan for salaried employees. Our NEOs receive age-weighted contributions and/or matching contributions depending on their eligibility for retiree medical coverage.
• Supplemental Retirement Accumulation Plan (''SRAP''). This is our non-qualified deferred compensation plan designed primarily to restore the age-weighted contributions that participants would otherwise have received if the IRC Compensation limit had not applied to the RAP.
• Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (''SERP''). This is designed as a pension supplement to attract and retain key executives. The SERP is unfunded and is not qualified for tax purposes.
Additional information on the pension/401(k) plans are provided in the Pension Benefits, Non-Qualified Defined Contribution and Other Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation sections of this proxy statement.

[END TABLE]
(1) $16,524 was paid on behalf of Mr. Clarke for legal fees incurred during the amendment of his Employment Agreement.
(2) Mr. McMenamin's annual flexible perqisite payment is $28,000, however, he received an additional amount of $1,333.33 in May 2018.  The additional amount was a payment due to Mr. McMenamin's promotion to the next organizational level in September 2017.  
Executive Stock Ownership Program
Our stock ownership guidelines are designed to increase an executive's equity stake in Navistar and more closely align his or her financial interests with those of the Navistar's stockholders.  At year end 2018, our stock ownership guidelines applied to 35 executives, all of whom hold the title of vice president and above, including all of our NEOs. 
Our Executive Stock Ownership Program requires stock ownership guideline multiples of six times salary for the President and CEO and three times salary for other senior executives and has the following features:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A requirement that an executive retain a certain amount of shares received pursuant to  
[END TABLE]
Company executive compensation programs (75% for the CEO and 50% for other

executives) until the executive satisfies the stock ownership guideline multiples described above and;
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A one-year holding period (75% for the CEO and 50% for other executives) of shares received pursuant to Company executive compensations programs after the executive  
[END TABLE]
satisfies the stock ownership guideline multiples described above.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All NEOs were in compliance with the program ownership requirement in 2018. 
[END TABLE]
Hedging and Pledging
The Company considers it improper and inappropriate for executives to engage in short-term or speculative transactions in Company securities.  Navistar's policy on transactions in securities prohibits executives from short selling, trading in derivatives or engaging in hedging transactions.  In addition, any pledges and margin account use must be pre-cleared through the Corporate Secretary or the General Counsel.
Recoupment (Clawback) Policy
The Company maintains a clawback policy.  Under this policy, the Company may recover incentive-based compensation from an executive officer in the event of an accounting restatement due to material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements, as well as intentional misconduct.
Employment Contracts and Executive Severance Agreements
Except for our President and CEO, Troy A. Clarke, we do not have employment contracts with our executive officers. Employment with each of them is "at will."  However, like many companies, to ensure stability and continuity of management, we provide our executive officers with an Executive Severance Agreement (an "ESA"), which provides for severance benefits in the event of a specified termination event such as an involuntary termination not for cause or a termination in connection with a change in control.  Please refer to the Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control section of this proxy statement for more information. A summary of Mr. Clarke's Employment Agreement appears in the Chief Executive Officer Compensation section of this proxy statement.
Tax and Accounting Implications
Policy on Deductibility of Compensation
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") provides that a public company generally may not deduct the amount of non-performance based compensation paid to certain executive officers (generally, the officers who are "named executive officers" in the summary compensation table in the issuer's proxy statement) that exceeds $1 million in any one taxable year.  With respect to grants made prior to November 2, 2017, "qualified performance-based compensation" was not counted against the $1 million deductibility limit.  The options, granted prior to this date, with an exercise price at least equal to 100% of the fair market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant may satisfy the requirements for treatment as "qualified performance-based compensation." In addition LTI plan awards and awards under the AI plan, granted prior to November 2, 2017, that are conditioned upon achievement of certain performance goals may satisfy the requirements for treatment as "qualified performance-based compensation."  Following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, beginning with our 2019 fiscal year, the  $1 million annual deduction limitation under Section 162(m) will apply to all compensation paid to these executive officers other than performance-based compensation paid under certain grants and awards made prior to November 2, 2017.  Accordingly, the Company's ability to actually receive a corresponding deduction for the grants and awards described above may be limited by this tax law.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) The amounts reported in this column reflect the aggregate fair value of stock-based awards (other than stock options) granted in the year computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.  Generally the aggregate grant date fair value is the amount that the Company expects to expense for accounting purposes over the award's vesting schedule and does not correspond to the actual value that will be realized by the officers.  The fair values of stock-based awards are estimated using the closing price of our stock on the grant date.  Stock-based awards settle in common stock on a one-for-one basis, or the cash equivalent of the common stock.  The grant date fair values of each individual stock based award in 2018 are set forth in the 2018 Grant of Plan Based Awards table on page 52.  Additional information about these values is included in Note 17 to our audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2018.   
(2) The amounts reported in this column reflect the aggregate fair value of stock options, granted in the year computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.  These amounts reflect the Company's accounting expense and do not correspond to the actual value that will be realized by the officers.  Assumptions used in the calculation of these values are included in Note17 to our audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2018.  A description of stock options appears in the narrative text  following the 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table.  
(3) The amounts reported in this column represent the 2018 AI plan award payment based on an actual payout at 112.4% of target and performance-based RCUs earned in 2018 under the 2016 LTI.  AI awards are projected to be paid in February 2019.  The value of the 2018 AI Awards are as follows:  Mr. Clarke $1,475,250, Mr. Borst $651,078, Mr. Lisboa $614,547, Mr. McMenamin $310,224, and Mr. Kramer $272,503.  In addition, we reported the value of performance-based RCUs earned in fiscal year 2018 based on the probable outcome of such performance conditions, which was not maximum.  The  value of the performance-based RCUs for each NEO are as follows:  Mr. Clarke $875,000, Mr. Borst $367,500, Mr. Lisboa $245,000, and Mr. McMenamin $78,750.  Mr. Kramer did not receive performance-based RCUs in fiscal year 2016 due to his organizational level at that time . 
(4) These amounts represent the difference in the market interest rate under the IRC and the interest credit rate of 7.5% per annum compounded on a daily basis on the SRAP.  The 7.5% is the rate used to design the SRAP as a comparable replacement for the Managerial Retirement Objective("MRO"). The interest credit rate constitutes an ''above-market interest rate'' under the IRC. These amounts also represent the change in actuarial present value of the SERP for Messrs. Clarke, Borst, Lisboa, McMenamin and Kramer.  The change in actuarial present value of Mr. Borst's non-qualified pension from 10/31/2017 to 10/31/2018 is negative $35,327.  The increase in the SERP benefit for pay rate increase and service accrual was less than the decrease in present value due to increase in the discount rate. 
(5) "All Other Compensation" reflects the following items: flexible perquisite cash allowances; Company-paid life and accidental death and disability ("AD&D") insurance premiums; Company contributions to the RAP and the SRAP; taxable spouse travel and non-cash recognition awards; and legal fees for Mr. Clarke.

(2) Stock Options.  The amounts shown represent the number of stock options awarded to the NEO's in the fiscal year under our 2013 PIP, as described more fully under the Long-Term Incentives section of this proxy statement.  The stock options generally vest over a three-year period with 1/3rd  of the award vesting on each of the first three anniversaries of the date on which they are awarded, so that in three years the stock options are 100% vested, subject to service conditions being met.  The stock options expire ten years after the date of grant. 
(3) The amounts shown do not reflect realized compensation by the NEOs. The amounts shown represent the value of the stock settled RSUs and stock options granted to the NEOs based on the grant date fair value of the awards as determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.   
(4) Performance RCUs - EBITDA and Performance RCUs - Revenue Growth.  The amounts shown represent the threshold, target and maximum number of performance RCUs that we awarded in the fiscal year to the NEOs under our 2013 PIP, as described more fully under the Long Term Incentive section of this proxy statement.  The extent to which our NEOs will receive any amounts under the EBITDA performance award is based on the 3 year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA target percentage achieved for 2018, 2019 and 2020, with a relative 3 year TSR modifier.  The extent to which our NEOs will receive any amounts under the Revenue Growth performance award is based on the individual Revenue Growth rates for fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020, and a Cumulative Revenue Growth rate, based on the percentage increase in fiscal year 2020 Revenue vs. fiscal year 2017 Revenue with a 3-year relative TSR modifier.  The RCUs represent a cash plan with each RCU representing $1.  These amounts may not be paid to or realized by the NEOs.  The RCUs generally cliff vest as to 100% of the units awarded on the 3 year anniversary of the date the award was granted, subject to the service conditions and performance conditions being met.   
(5) The amounts set forth in this row represent the estimated cash payments to be awarded to our NEO's under the Company's 2018 AI Plan.  The actual cash payments will be based on achievement at 112.4% of target.  For additional information regarding the 2018 cash AI awards, see the Annual Incentives section of this proxy statement. Under the AI plan, the performance metric threshold is 40% of target, target is 100% and for purposes of this table maximum equals distinguished which is 150% of target.     In addition, there is an EBITDA multiplier under the AI plan which is 25% for under threshold, 40% at threshold, 100% at target and 125% at distinguished.

Also unless otherwise noted, form of payment, discount rate (4.48%) and mortality (115% of RP2014 White Collar headcount-weighted table projected using Scale MP2018 with generational projection, modified to converge to 75% of long-term improvement rates by 2034) is based on assumptions from the guidance on accounting for pensions. Additionally, SERP benefits have only been offset by benefits under 
Navistar sponsored retirement programs. At actual retirement, these benefits will also be offset by benefits accumulated under programs for employment prior to Navistar. The present value of Mr. Borst's accumulated benefit as of 10/31/2018 is less than the present value of his accumulated benefit as of 10/31/2017.  The increase in the SERP benefit for pay rate increase and service accrual was less than the decrease in present value due to increase in the discount rate.

 2019 Proxy Statement 56 
[END TABLE]
Historically, we have provided our employees with retirement income programs.  Over the years, the programs have changed for various reasons.  Effective January 1, 1996, we began transitioning from defined benefit retirement income programs to defined contribution retirement income programs as the primary vehicle to deliver those benefits.  Effective January 1, 2014, we accelerated the transition by freezing the U.S. defined benefit retirement income programs.  All U.S. employees  now participate in our defined contribution retirement income programs.
The following briefly describes the various programs.
Navistar, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan or ''SERP''.   The SERP is designed as a pension supplement to attract and retain executive officers.  Executive officers are eligible to participate in the SERP upon attainment of age 55 or upon their date of hire if later.
The SERP is unfunded and is not qualified for tax purposes.  An eligible executive's benefit under the SERP is equal to a percentage of his or her final average compensation. A pro-rated portion of AI plan payments is included in the definition of eligible compensation and the amount included is also subject to a cap determined as a percentage of the executive officer's annualized base salary.  The pro-rated portion and the cap depend on the executive officer's organizational level in the Company.  
The following table summarizes the determination of the total percentage of final average compensation, which is the sum of the accrual rates described below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Up to  Age 55 On or After  Age 55 
Each Year of Age 1/2% 1% 
Each Year of Service 1/2% 1% 
[END TABLE]
The resulting benefit is offset by no more than 50% of the executive's Social Security benefit, and any defined benefit pension plan (qualified or non-qualified) of the Company or any prior employer.  The benefit is also offset by the actuarial equivalent of any of our defined contribution pension plans (qualified or non-qualified) or that of any prior employer that is funded by the employer's contributions and is an integral part of the employer's retirement program.  Normal retirement age is 65. An executive may retire early with reduced benefits after having worked 5 years and is at least age 55.
All of the NEOs are eligible to participate in the SERP. 
Other Retirement Income Programs.   We sponsor the Navistar, Inc. Salaried Employees Pension Plan or "SEPP" and the Navistar, Inc. Hourly Employees Pension Plan or "HEPP" which are tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor the Navistar, Inc. Managerial Retirement Objection Plan or "MRO" which is an unfunded non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. None of the NEO's participate in the SEPP, HEPP, or MRO. 
We also sponsor the Navistar, Inc. 401(k) Plan for Represented Employees or ''REP'' and the Navistar, Inc. 
Retirement Accumulation Plan or ''RAP''.  Represented employees are allowed to defer a portion of their compensation to the REP up to the IRC limitations.  All non-represented employees are allowed to defer a portion of their compensation to the RAP up to the IRC limitations.  Employees receive non-elective employer retirement contributions equal to a percentage of compensation up to the IRC compensation limit ranging from 2% up to 6.5% based on their age at the beginning of the calendar year.  Additionally, employees who do not participate in our retiree medical plan receive matching contributions equal to 50% of the first 6% of employee elective pre-tax deferrals.  For those executives whose employer retirement contributions would be limited by the IRC compensation limit, the SRAP (described below) provides for employer retirement contributions in excess of the IRC compensation limit.  This plan is described in more detail within the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation section of this proxy statement.
All of the NEOs receive non-elective employer retirement contributions in the RAP and also participate in the SRAP.
We do not grant extra pension service.

Curt A. Kramer 6,009 — 2,069 — 30,731 
(1) Our contributions represent any notional contribution credits to the SRAP during the year.  
(2) ''Aggregate Earnings in Last Fiscal Year'' represent the notional interest credited during the year for participants in the SRAP, if applicable, plus the change in value from the beginning of the year to the end of the year in the PSUs and/or DSUs held by each NEO. For the SRAP, ''Aggregate Earnings in Last Fiscal Year'' is the interest credited to each NEO from the beginning of the year until the end of the year at a 7.5% interest crediting rate. ''Aggregate Earnings in Last Fiscal Year'' for purposes of the PSU is the aggregate change in value of the PSUs held during the year.   
(3) The ''Aggregate Balance as of Last Fiscal Year End'' consists of the sum of each NEO's notional account balance in the SRAP at the end of the year and the value at year end of the outstanding PSUs and/or DSUs.  
[END TABLE]
We sponsor the following non-qualified deferred compensation programs:
Navistar, Inc. Supplemental Retirement Accumulation Plan or ''SRAP''.   The SRAP provides executive officers with contributions equal to the amount by which their employer retirement contributions to the RAP are limited by the IRC compensation limit.  The SRAP is unfunded and is not qualified for tax purposes.
A bookkeeping account balance is established for each participant.  The account balance is credited with notional contributions and notional interest.  The SRAP does not permit any executive to electively defer any of his or her base compensation or bonus.  However, any increase in payments under the AI plan will increase contributions to the SRAP because contributions are a function of compensation.
The interest crediting rate is 7.5% per annum compounded on a daily basis.  The interest crediting rate constitutes an ''above-market interest rate'' under the IRC.
An executive officer is eligible to participate in the SRAP if the executive officer was hired on or after January 1, 1996 or was hired prior to January 1, 1996 and subsequently ceased participation in the Navistar, Inc. Managerial Retirement Objective Plan or "MRO". 
Executive officers who were hired prior to January 1, 1996 and who subsequently ceased participation in the MRO 
received an adjustment to their notional contributions.  The adjustment is a ''Points Multiplier'' designed to provide them with value from the SRAP comparable to what they would have received had they continued to participate in the "MRO" until they reached age 62.
Effective January 1, 2014, all executive officers were eligible for the SRAP due to the freezing of the MRO.  At retirement, each participant may elect to receive the bookkeeping account balance by either or some combination of (1) a lump-sum payment or (2) annual installments over a period of 2 to 20 years.  However, if the executive officer also participated in the SERP prior to January 1, 2012, he or she must receive the SRAP account balance in the form of an annuity.  This is a requirement under IRC Section 409A.  The NEO cannot withdraw any amounts from such NEO's bookkeeping account balance until such NEO either retires or otherwise terminates employment with the Company. 
All of the NEOs participate in the SRAP.
Premium Share Units or ''PSUs''.  In general, our Executive Stock Ownership Program as in effect during 2013 required all of our executive officers to acquire, by direct purchase or through salary or annual bonus reduction, an ownership interest in Navistar by acquiring a designated amount of our Common Stock at specified 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 Proxy Statement 58 
[END TABLE]
times. Participants were required to hold such stock for the entire period in which they are employed by the Company. PSUs may have been awarded under the 2013 PIP to participants who completed their ownership requirement on an accelerated basis. PSUs vest in equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date on which they are awarded. Each vested PSU will be settled by delivery of one share of Common Stock.  Such settlement will occur within 10 days after a participant's termination of employment or at such later date as required by IRC Section Rule 409A.  All of the NEOs participate in the Executive Stock Ownership Program and were eligible to acquire PSUs.  The Executive Stock Ownership Program was amended effective November 1, 2013 to eliminate an executive's ability to earn PSUs.
Deferred Share Units or ''DSUs''.  Under our Executive Stock Ownership Program in effect for 2013 and prior years, executives were able to defer their cash bonus into DSUs.  DSUs are credited into the participants' account at the then- current market price.  The DSUs are generally distributed to the participant in the form of our Common Stock at the date specified by the participant at the time of his or her election to defer.  During the deferral period, the participant had no right to vote the Common Stock, no right to receive any dividend declared on the Common Stock and no other rights as a stockholder.  If an executive officer elected to defer a cash bonus, the number of shares shown for such NEO includes these DSUs.  These DSUs vest immediately.  The number of shares shown as owned for each NEO (and all Executive Officers as a group) also includes PSUs that were awarded pursuant to the Executive Stock Ownership Program.  Our Executive Stock Ownership Program eliminated an executive's ability to defer their cash bonus into DSUs.  Likewise, under our Non-Employee Directors Deferred Fee Plan, directors may defer all or a portion of their annual retainer into DSUs. If a director elected to defer a portion of his annual retainer and/or meeting fees into DSUs, these DSUs are shown as owned.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control
The amount of compensation payable to each of the NEOs upon voluntary termination, termination with or without cause, involuntary termination in the event of a Change in Control, or termination as a result of death, disability or retirement are shown in the Estimated Cash Payments Upon Termination table of this proxy statement.  Unless otherwise indicated, the amounts shown assume that such termination was effective October 31, 2018, are based on the terms of the applicable plans and agreements that were in effect on October 31, 2018, assume that the executive officer has satisfied all relevant prerequisites for eligibility for such payments and benefits and are estimates of the amounts which would be paid out to the executive officer following his or her termination. The actual amounts of payments and benefits can only be determined at the time the relevant termination event occurs.
To assure stability and continuity of management, we entered into Executive Severance Agreements ("ESAs") with each of our executive officers with the exception of our CEO who has an Employment Agreement.
Executive Severance Agreements or ''ESAs''
All of our NEOs, with the exception of Mr. Clarke who is covered by an employment agreement, are covered under an "ESA". The following summarizes certain of the material provisions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The expiration date of the agreement period post-Change in Control will be the date that occurs eighteen (18) months after the date of the CIC;

• A CIC will not occur if certain ''Excluded Persons'' (including Mark H. Rachesky, Icahn Enterprises and employee or retirement benefit plans or trusts sponsored or established by the Company) become the ''Beneficial Owner'' of securities representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then-outstanding securities;

[BEGIN TABLE]
• The level of ownership of securities required to trigger a CIC is 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then-outstanding securities;

[BEGIN TABLE]
• A diminution of authority sufficient to trigger a termination for ''Good Reason'' occurs if the executive officer experiences a decrease in his or her organizational level, a reduction in base salary by ten percent (10%) or more, or a change to his or her reporting structure that requires the executive to report to a supervisor whose organizational level is below the executive's current organizational level; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The executive officer's obligations (i) not to disclose confidential, secret, proprietary or privileged information pertaining to the business of the Company, (ii) to refrain from making any defamatory, disparaging, slanderous, libelous or derogatory statements about the Company and (iii) to cooperate and provide assistance to the Company in connection with litigation or any other matters, continue at all times during the agreement period of the ESA and at all times following the executive officer's termination of employment for any reason;

Summary of the Circumstances, Rights and Obligations Attendant to Each Type of Termination Under the ESA  
All executive officers are ''at-will'' employees of the Company, except for the Company's CEO who has an Employment Agreement.  The ''at-will'' relationship between the executive officer and the Company means that either party may terminate the employment relationship at any time, and for any reason.  Depending on the circumstances of the executive's termination from the Company, the executive may be eligible for certain separation payments and benefits as summarized below. Under the 2013 PIP, individual equity award agreements, and the ESA:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Voluntary Termination by Executive and Involuntary (Termination for ''Cause'') by us:  We are not obligated to provide the executive with any additional or special compensation or benefits upon a voluntary termination by the executive or termination for ''Cause'' by us.  All compensation, bonuses, benefits, and perquisites cease upon a voluntary termination by the executive or termination for ''Cause'' by us. In general, in the event of either such termination, an executive officer would: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Be paid the value of unused and accrued vacation; 
• Not be eligible for an AI payment if the termination occurred prior to year-end or if the termination occurred after year end and prior to the payment date; 
• Be able to exercise vested stock options for three months or twelve months depending on the date of grant, following a voluntary termination; 
• Forfeit any unvested time and performance-based stock options; 
• Forfeit any unvested restricted stock and time and performance-based RSUs; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Forfeit any unvested cash-settled performance shares; and 
• Forfeit any unvested RCUs.  
[END TABLE]
As defined in the ESA, ''Cause'' generally means the reason for the executive's involuntary termination of employment was (i) willful misconduct involving an offense of a serious nature that is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise, (ii) conviction of, or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony as defined by the laws of the United States of America or by the laws of the State or other jurisdiction in which the executive is so convicted or pleads guilty or nolo contendere, or (iii) continued failure to substantially perform required duties for the Company (other than a failure due to physical or mental disability).
The executive officer would not receive any cash severance in the event of either a voluntary termination of employment without "Good Reason" (as defined below) or involuntary termination for ''Cause'' by us.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Retirement and Early Retirement:  If an executive officer terminates employment due to retirement, then the officer would generally be eligible to receive: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The value of unused and accrued vacation; 
• Monthly income from any defined benefit pension plans, both tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified, that the executive participated in solely to the extent provided under the terms of such plans; 
• Lump sum distributions from any defined contribution plans, both tax-qualified and non-tax-qualified, that the executive participated in solely to the extent provided under the terms of such plans; and 
• A pro-rata portion of cash-settled PSUs and RCUs. 
[END TABLE]
Retirement and early retirement are defined in the respective plans in which the executive officer participates. In addition, if an executive meets the ''qualified retirement'' definition under our 2004 Performance Incentive Plan, as amended ("2004 PIP") 2013 PIP or Award Agreement (as applicable) and holds outstanding stock options, he or she may exercise those stock options to the extent that those stock options are exercisable or become exercisable in accordance with their terms, at any time during the term of the option grant. If he or she holds restricted stock or RSUs, they will continue to vest according to the terms of the restricted stock grant. If he or she holds PSUs, vesting accelerates and the shares will be issued after retirement.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Termination Without ''Cause'' by us or "Good Reason" Termination by Executive:   If the employment of an executive officer is terminated either due to either an involuntary termination by us without ''Cause'' or by the executive for ''Good Reason'' (as defined below), in each case either before the date of a  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 Proxy Statement 60 
[END TABLE]
Change in Control (as defined in the ESA) or more than 18 months after the date of the most recent Change in Control, then the executive would generally be eligible to receive the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An amount equal to one-hundred to two-hundred percent (100% to 200%) of the total of (i) the executive's annual base salary in effect at the time of termination and (ii) the executive's AI plan award at target level (the ''Severance Pay''); 
• Continued health insurance for the 24-month period following termination; provided that for the first 12 month period, the executive shall pay for such coverage at no greater after tax costs to the executive than the after-tax cost to the executive officer immediately prior to the date of termination and for the remaining 12-month period, the executive officer shall pay for such coverage on a monthly cost of coverage basis; 
• Pro-rata annual incentive for the number of months of fiscal year eligible participation which is based upon actual results and will only be paid if and at the same time that the Company pays AI plan awards to active employees; 
• Continued life insurance coverage for the18-month period following termination; 
• Outplacement services; 
• Retention of any flexible perquisite allowance actually paid to the executive officer on or before the time of termination; 
• A lump sum cash payment equal to the value of unused and accrued vacation; 
• Such pension and post-retirement health and life insurance benefits due to the executive officer upon his or her termination pursuant to and in accordance with the respective Company-sponsored benefit plans, programs, or policies under which they are accrued and/or provided (including grow-in rights as provided under the terms of the applicable plan, program or policy); 
• The right to exercise vested stock options for three months or twelve months, depending upon date of grant; and 
• Forfeit any unvested cash-settled PSUs, any unvested RCUs, any unvested time and performance based stock options and any unvested restricted stock, time and performance based RSUs or PSUs. 
[END TABLE]
As defined in the ESA, ''Good Reason'' means the occurrence of any of the following events or conditions: (i) we reduce the executive officer's base salary by ten percent (10%) or more (either upon one reduction or in a series of reductions over a period of time); provided, that such reduction neither comprises a part of a general reduction for the executive officer's then-current peers as a group (determined as of the date immediately before the date on which the executive officer becomes subject to such material reduction) nor results from a deferral of the executive officer's base salary, (ii) a change to the executive's reporting structure that requires the executive to report to a supervisor whose organizational level is below the executive's current organizational level, or (iii) a demotion in position (including a decrease in organization level) resulting in the material diminution of the executive officer's authority (including, but not limited to, the budget over which the executive officer retains authority), duties, or responsibilities within the Company except, in case of each of (i) or (ii), in connection with the involuntary termination of the executive officer's employment for Cause.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Termination Related to a Change in Control:  If the employment of an executive officer is involuntarily terminated for any reason other than for "Cause" or if a "Constructive Termination" (as defined below) occurs within 18 months after a Change in Control, then the executive would generally be eligible to receive the following: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An amount equal to (i) a pro rata portion of the executive officer's AI plan award at target level (the ''CIC Prorated Bonus''), which payment shall be in lieu of any payment to which the executive officer may otherwise have been entitled to receive under a Change in Control-sponsored incentive or bonus plan, plus (ii) a multiplier ranging from 150% to 300% of the sum of the executive officer's annual base salary in effect at the time of termination and the executive officer's AI award at target level (the ''CIC Severance Pay'').  The CIC Severance Pay and the CIC Prorated Bonus shall be paid in a lump sum on the payment date; 
• Continued health insurance for the 24-month period following termination; provided that for the first 12 month period, the executive officer shall pay for such coverage at no greater after tax costs to the executive officer than the after tax cost to the executive officer immediately prior to the date of termination and for the remaining 12-month period, the executive officer shall pay for such coverage on a monthly cost of coverage basis; 
• Continued life insurance coverage for the 18-month period following termination; 
• Outplacement services; 
• Tax counseling and tax preparation services; 
• Retention of any flexible perquisite allowance actually paid to the executive officer on or before the time of termination; 
• A lump sum cash payment equal to the value of unused vacation; 
• Acceleration of the exercisability of options that would otherwise have vested over a period of three years from the date of the Change in Control had the executive officer continued employment for that period; 
• Acceleration of the vesting of cash-settled PSUs and RCUs at the target performance level;  
• Acceleration of vesting o the SRAP balance; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2019 Proxy Statement 61 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A lump sum cash payment equal to the difference in (i) the actuarial present value of the executive officer's non-tax-qualified pension benefits assuming the executive officer was 18 months older and had 18 more months of service, over (ii) the actuarial present value of the executive officer's non-tax-qualified pension benefits at the date of termination.  
[END TABLE]
As defined in the ESA, ''Constructive Termination'' means the occurrence of any of the following events or conditions: 
(i) a material diminution in the executive officer's authority (including, but not limited to, the budget over which the executive retains authority), duties or responsibilities, (ii) the executive officer's base salary or total incentive compensation opportunity is reduced by ten percent (10%) or more, (iii) a material breach of the executive officer's ESA, and (iv) the executive officer is required to be based anywhere more than 45 miles from the location of either the executive's office (if other than the Company's headquarters) or Company's headquartered offices. 
The table below states the multiplier of the sum of annual base salary plus AI plan award at target level used in each NEO's severance formula under a termination without Cause by us or by the NEO for Good Reason as of October 31, 2018.

(1) Mr. Clarke does not have an ESA. Per his Employment Agreement, in the event his employment with the Company is terminated (i) by the Company without Cause, or (ii) by executive due to Constructive Termination, as defined in his Employment Agreement, then in addition to accrued obligations, he is eligible for the sum of 200% of his base salary plus target annual incentive. 
[END TABLE]
Disability and Death:  If an executive officer is disabled and is prevented from working for pay or profit in any job or occupation, he or she may be eligible for our ''Non-Represented Employee Disability Benefit Program'' which provides for short-term and long-term disability (''LTD'') benefits.  Our executive officers are not covered under a separate program. While covered under LTD, an executive officer is eligible for 60 percent of his or her base salary reduced (or offset) by other sources of income, such as social security disability.  In the event of a total and permanent disability as defined by this program, an executive officer may exercise outstanding stock options any time within three years after such termination.  In the event an executive officer has restricted stock, or RSUs, the restricted stock or RSUs will continue to vest according to the terms of the grant. In the event an executive officerhas PSUs, vesting accelerates and the shares are issued immediately.  In addition, while classified as disabled, the executive officer continues to accrue benefits under the defined benefit plans.
In the event of an executive officer's death, a beneficiary of the executive officer may exercise an outstanding stock option at any time within a period of two years after death. Restricted stock, RSUs or PSUs will vest as of the date of death and all restrictions lapse and the restricted stock, 
RSUs or PSUs will be immediately transferable to the executive officer's beneficiary or estate.  The executive officer's beneficiary will also be eligible for a pro-rata payment under the AI plan based upon the number of months the executive officer was an active employee during the year.  The executive officer's beneficiary will also receive surviving spouse benefits under the defined benefit and defined contribution plans solely to the extent provided in those plans.

(1) The amount includes the value of un-vested  in-the-money stock options.  The per share value for options is equal to the difference between the option exercise price and the closing price as of the last day of the fiscal year (October 31, 2018), which was $33.49 per share. Please refer to the Outstanding Equity Awards Table of this proxy statement for more information on this subject as the amounts in this column represent awards that have already been granted to the NEOs in previous years.  The value in the table actually realized by the terminated executive could be higher or lower than what is set forth in the table due to the price at the time the terminated executive exercises the option, if the terminated executive does, in fact timely exercise. 
(2) The value of outstanding restricted stock, RSUs or PSUs is based on the October 31, 2018 closing price of $33.49 per share. Please refer to the Outstanding Equity Awards Table of this proxy statement for more information on this subject as the amounts in this column represent awards that have already been granted to the NEOs in previous years. Amounts indicated for voluntary and involuntary for Cause termination represent deferred shares that have already been earned. 
(3) This amount includes the value of all un-vested cash-settled performance RCUs based on current forecasting models with respect to the attainment of the applicable performance goal.  The value to be received is contingent on actual performance achieved.  
(4) Benefits include 12 months continued health care coverage with an option to purchase an additional 12 months at the cost of coverage rate. Benefits also include 18 months of continued life insurance coverage for all NEOs (per their ESAs) terminated without Cause, with Good Reason or following a Change in Control. 
(5) This amount represents our cost for NEO outplacement counseling and services. 
(6) In the event Mr. Clarke's employment and service with the Company terminate for any reason, including due to his death or disability, Mr. Clarke will be entitled to unpaid and accrued payments and benefits. 
[END TABLE]
If Mr. Clarke's employment and service with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause or by Mr. Clarke due to a Constructive Termination, as defined in his Employment Agreement, then in addition to his accrued obligations and the accelerated vesting of his options, subject to Mr. Clarke's execution of a release (without revocation), Mr. Clarke will be entitled to the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. A lump sum severance payment equal to 200% of the sum of his base salary and AI target; 
2. Twelve months continued health care coverage with an option to purchase an additional 12 months at the cost of coverage rate; 
3. 24 months continued life insurance coverage; 
4. Outplacement services; 
5. Retention of any remaining flexible perquisite allowance already paid;

If Mr. Clarke's employment and service with the Company is terminated by the Company without Cause or by Mr. Clarke due to a Constructive Termination, in either case, during the 24 months after the date of the then-most recent "Change in Control" as defined in his Employment Agreement, Mr. Clarke will be entitled to the same benefits referenced above in items 1-7 except with respect to item 7 above, instead of the pro-rata portion of the AI award it will be the pro-rata portion of the target AI award.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(7) This amount is 60% of annualized base salary as of October 31, 2018 and is not offset by other sources of income, such as Social Security. It represents the amount that would be paid annually over the term of the disability.  In addition, the NEOs would be eligible for a SRAP benefit. 
(8) Our NEOs participate in our defined contribution plans and a deferred benefit plan that provides a surviving spouse benefit.  
(9) This calculation, as described in the ESA, is 150 to 200 percent of the sum of the NEO's annual base salary plus AI target. 
(10) The Change in Control calculation, as defined in the ESA, is 300% of the sum of the executive's annual base salary plus AI target plus pro-rata AI. 
(11) Included in the Payment Under Non-Qualified Plan figure above for Change in Control is the lump sum cash payment equal to the difference in (i) the actuarial present value of the NEOs non-tax qualified pension benefits assuming the executive was 18 months older and had 18 months more of service, over (ii) the actuarial present value of the NEOs' non-tax qualified pension benefits at the date of termination. The lump sum cash payments  for Mr. McMenamin is $367,136 and Mr. Kramer is $2,744.  The lump sum cash payments for Messrs. Borst and Lisboa are $0 because the vesting of the SRAP under a CIC, which offsets the non-tax qualified pension benefits, offsets the effect of the additional 18 months of age and service.   The lump sum cash payment for Mr. Clarke is $0 as Mr. Clarke's Employment Agreement does not have a provision for this lump sum cash payment.  Also included in the Payment Under Non-Qualified Plan figure above for Change in Control, is the value of the SRAP account which immediately vests upon a CIC.  For Messrs. Borst and Kramer, the SRAP would be paid as a lump sum and the figure reported is the SRAP account balance which is $284,104 for Mr. Borst and $30,731 for Mr. Kramer.  For Messrs. Clarke, Lisboa and McMenamin, the SRAP would be paid as an annuity and the figure reported is the actuarial present value of the SRAP annuity which is $460,764 for Mr. Clarke, $178,628 for Mr. Lisboa, and $115,099 for Mr. McMenamin.  The monthly annuities are in the form of 55% Joint & Survivor and a payable for the lifetime of the partcipant to the participant and 55% of the monthly benefit is paid to the spouse following the death of the participant.  The monthly benefit amounts are $2,368.80 for Mr. Clarke, $897.32 for Mr. Lisboa and $512.81 for Mr. McMenamin.  
[END TABLE]
(12) Mr. McMenamin is retirement eligible under the SRAP plan and therefore is eligible for his SRAP benefit in all termination circumstances.
CEO PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the ratio of the annual total compensation of our median employee to the annual total compensation of our CEO, Mr. Clarke in 2018.
The 2018 annual total compensation of our CEO was $6,923,149. The 2018 annual total compensation of the median employee (excluding our CEO) was $35,951.  The resulting ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee is 193:1.This ratio is calculated in a manner consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules (the "SEC Rules"), based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described below. 
As permitted by SEC Rules, to identify our median employee, we selected August 31, 2018, which is within the last three months of our 2018 fiscal year, as the date upon which we would identify the median employee. As of that date, the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries employed 13,535 employees in 12 countries.  As it represents the principal form of compensation provided to our employees, we selected the year-to-date earnings information which would be recorded in Box 1 of IRS Form W-2 for employees located in the U.S. and the year-to-date earnings information calculated in a substantially similar and consistently applied compensation measure manner 
("CACM") for employees located in Brazil and Mexico. Using this methodology, we determined that the "median employee" had anomalous compensation characteristics.  Therefore, we selected the employee closest to the "median employee" with substantially similar compensation calculated using the CACM and with lower compensation.
The SEC Rules include an exemption which allows companies to exclude non-U.S. employees from the median employee calculation if the non-U.S. employees in a specific country comprise five percent (5%) or less of the company's total number of employees. We applied this de minimus exemption in determining the median employee which resulted in the exclusion of 311 employees located in Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, Dubai, Germany, India, South Africa, and the United Kingdom.  
The SEC Rules for identifying the "median employee" and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the ratios reported by other companies may not be comparable to the ratio set forth above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

Compensation Risk 
The Company performed, and the Compensation Committee reviewed, a risk assessment to determine whether our compensation policies, practices, plans and programs were ''reasonably likely to have a materially adverse effect'' on the Company.  Approximately thirty compensation-related topics were reviewed during  2018, including but not limited to, programs governed by the 2013 PIP.  A matrix was created for management's use that summarized the program reviewed, as well as associated mitigating factors.  Management discussed the analysis internally and with our compensation consultant, and discussed final results with the Compensation Committee. The Company and the Compensation Committee believe that the following are factors that mitigate the likelihood of excessive risk taking.

Director Fees and Equity Compensation for 2018 
In recent years, our non-employee director pay has been low in comparison to our peer group of companies.  In 2018, during our annual review of director compensation, our analysis of competitive survey data, peer group proxy information, and general industry practices confirmed that our non-employee director total direct compensation was still below median, with our total cash compensation and our total equity compensation being slightly below median.  We also noted that our committee chair retainers and fees were slightly below median.  Based on these findings, on June 12, 2018, the Board approved several changes to non-employee director compensation.   
The following table describes components of non-employee director compensation in effect during fiscal and calendar 2018 and the new compensation program that will become effective January 1, 2019 (unless otherwise noted):

(1) Amounts in this column reflect fees earned by our non-employee directors in 2018.  Effective February 13, 2018, Mr. McChrystal retired from the Board; Mr. Sirignano resigned from the Board effective April 17, 2018; Mr. Gründler resigned from the Board effective May 15, 2018; and effective October 10, 2018, Mr. Ninivaggi resigned from the Board. Mr. Miller was appointed to the Board effective April 17, 2018; Mr. Schulz was appointed to the Board effective August 14, 2018; and Mr. Sheehan was appointed to the Board effective October 10, 2018.  The fees for each of these directors that either retired, resigned or were appointed during 2018 were pro-rated for the time they served on the Board during 2018. 
(2) Under our Non-Employee Directors Deferred Fee Plan (the ''Deferred Fee Plan''), our directors who are not employees receive an annual retainer, payable quarterly, at their election, either in shares of our Common Stock or in cash. A director may elect to defer any portion of such compensation until a later date in DSUs or in cash. Each such election is made prior to December 31st for the next succeeding calendar year or within 30 days of first joining the Board. Vincent J. Intrieri, Stanley A. McChrystal, Raymond T. Miller, Daniel A. Ninivaggi, Dr. Mark H. Rachesky, Michael F. Sirignano, and Dennis A. Suskind elected to defer the receipt of some or all of their compensation received for their retainer fees in 2018.  Mr. Intrieri deferred receipt of 100% of his retainer fees from November 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, and 100% of the 2018 first calendar year quarter retainer fee normally paid in restricted stock and received a total of 1,055.130 DSUs in 2018.  General McChrystal deferred receipt of 100% of his quarterly retainer fees in DSUs and received 1,140.916 DSUs in 2018.  Mr. Miller deferred receipt of 100% of his quarterly retainer fees in DSUs and received 1,386.423 DSUs through September 30, 2018.  Mr . Ninivaggi deferred receipt of 50% of the cash portion of his retainer evenly between DSUs and deferred cash from November 2017 through December 2017, during calendar year 2018 he deferred 50% of his first quarter annual retainer fee normally paid in restricted stock in DSUs, and he deferred 80% of the cash portion of his retainer evenly between DSUs and deferred cash and received 1,123.081 DSUs through September 30, 2018, and $34,291 in deferred cash.  Dr. Rachesky deferred receipt of 100% of his quarterly retainer fees, except the portion payable in restricted stock, in calendar year 2018 and received 2,384.959 DSUs through September 30, 2018. Mr. Sirignano deferred receipt of 100% of his quarterly retainer fees in calendar year 2018 and received 1,581.010 DSUs.  Mr. Suskind deferred receipt of 100% of his quarterly retainer fees, except the portion payable in restricted stock, in calendar year 2018 and received 1,918.373 DSUs through September 30, 2018. The amount of DSUs for Mr. Intrieri, General McChrystal, Mr. Miller, Mr. Ninivaggi, Dr. Rachesky, Mr. Sirignano, and Mr. Suskind has been credited as stock units in an account under each of their names at the then current market price of our Common Stock. Mr. Ninivaggi's deferred cash has been credited in an account in his name and will earn interest quarterly at the then prime rate.  The units issued to Mr. Intrieri during 2018 will be converted into Common Stock and issued within 60 days after his separation from service on the Board.  The DSUs issued to Mr. McChrystal and Mr. Sirignano during 2018 were converted into Common Stock and issued within 60 days after their  departure from the Board.  The DSUs and deferred cash issued to Mr. Ninivaggi during 2018 will be issued in two annual installments commencing within 60 days of his departure from the Board.  The units issued to Mr. Miller, Dr. Rachesky, and Mr. Suskind during 2018 will be converted into Common Stock and issued within 60 days after January 1, 2019.  
(3) Effective April 1, 2018, each non-employee director received 571 shares of restricted stock in lieu of $20,000 of their first quarter retainer, except for Mr. Intrieri, General McChrystal, Mr. Ninivaggi, and Mr. Sirignano who each elected to defer receipt of their shares in DSUs, as described in footnote 2 above. The grant date fair value of the restricted stock and DSUs was determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Mr. Dokho does not personally receive compensation for his service on the Board, as noted under footnotes 5 and 8 below, and Mr. Miller, Mr. Schulz and Mr. Sheehan were not members of the Board when the first quarter retainers were paid.  For additional information regarding assumptions underlying valuation of equity awards see the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2018.

Share Ownership Requirements for Non-Employee Directors
To encourage directors to own our shares, $20,000 of each director's annual retainer ($25,000 beginning January 1, 2019) is paid in the form of restricted stock each year.  The stock is priced as of the date the first quarterly disbursement of the annual retainer is due.  The restricted stock portion of the annual retainer is provided pursuant to the 2013 PIP.  For additional information regarding the 
2013 PIP, see Note 17, Stock-based compensation plans, to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2018.  Directors are expected to own shares equivalent to three times their annual cash retainer within five years of being designated as a Board member.
Deferred Fee Plan For Non-Employee Directors
Under our Non-Employee Directors Deferred Fee Plan, directors may defer fees otherwise payable in the form of cash or restricted stock.  The amount otherwise payable in cash may be deferred in cash or in DSUs.  Any amount deferred in cash is generally paid to the director, with interest at the prime rate, at the date specified by the director at the time of his election to defer.  The amount otherwise payable in restricted stock may be deferred in 
DSUs. Any amount deferred in DSUs is credited into the director's account at the then current market price.  Such units are generally distributed to the director in the form of our Common Stock at the date specified by the director at the time of his election to defer.  Elections to defer are made in the calendar year prior to the year in which the fees are earned.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
Andreas H. Renschler, a member of the Compensation Committee of the Board, has an indirect material interest in related person transactions between the Company and TRATON because he is the Chief Executive Officer of TRATON.

(1) This table does not include information regarding our 401(k) plans. Our 401(k) plans consist of the following: Navistar, Inc. 401(k) Plan for Represented Employees and Navistar, Inc. Retirement Accumulation Plan. As of October 31, 2018, there were 1,127,648 shares of Common Stock held in these plans. 
(2) This number includes stock options, DSUs and PSUs (as described in the Executive Stock Ownership Program discussed below) granted under our 2004 PIP; and stock options, performance stock options, RSUs, DSUs, and PSUs granted under our 2013 PIP. Stock options awarded to employees for the purchase of Common Stock from the 2004 PIP and the 2013 PIP were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant, generally have a 10-year contractual life, except for options granted under the 2004 PIP after December 15, 2009 and options granted under the 2013 PIP between February 19, 2013 and December 12, 2017, which have a contractual life of 7-years, and generally become exercisable as to one-third of the shares on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, so that in three years the shares are 100% vested. Performance stock options granted under the 2013 PIP generally do not become exercisable until after the three year anniversary of the date of grant and only if performance conditions are met. The terms of awards of RSUs granted under the 2013 PIP were established by the Board or a committee thereof at the time of issuance. The 2004 PIP expired on February 18, 2013, and as such no further awards may be granted under the 2004 PIP. As of October 31, 2018, 263,859 stock option awards, 1,338 DSUs, and 14,143 PSUs remain outstanding for shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 2004 PIP, and 2,054,393 stock options, including performance stock options, 501,771 RSUs, 14,247 DSUs and 12,478 PSUs remain outstanding for shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 2013 PIP. For more information on the 2013 PIP see footnote 5 below.  
(3) RSUs, DSUs, and PSUs settled in shares do not have an exercise price and are settled only for shares of our Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. These awards have been disregarded for purposes of computing the weighted-average exercise price. For more information on DSUs and PSUs see the discussion in footnote 6 below entitled ''The Ownership Program.'' There were no options or warrants outstanding under the unapproved plans as of October 31, 2018.  
(4) Our 2004 PIP was approved by the Board and the Compensation and Governance Committee on October 21, 2003, and, subsequently by our stockholders on February 17, 2004. Our 2004 PIP was amended on December 14, 2004, which amendment was approved by stockholders on March 23, 2005. The plan was subsequently amended on December 13, 2005, April 16, 2007, June 18, 2007, May 27, 2008, December 16, 2008, January 9, 2009, December 15, 2009, and April 19, 2010. The 2004 PIP replaced, on a prospective basis, our 1994 PIP, the 1998 Supplemental Stock Plan, both of which expired on December 16, 2003, and our 1998 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan (collectively, the ''Prior Plans''). A total of 3,250,000 shares of Common Stock were reserved for awards under the 2004 PIP. On February 16, 2010, our stockholders approved an amendment to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the 2004 PIP from 3,250,000 to 5,750,000. Shares subject to awards under the 2004 PIP, or the Prior Plans after February 17, 2004 and before February 19, 2013, that were canceled, expired, forfeited, settled in cash, tendered to satisfy the purchase price of an award, withheld to satisfy tax obligations or otherwise terminated without a delivery of shares to the participant again became available for awards.  
(5) The 2013 PIP was approved by the Board and the Compensation Committee on December 11, 2012 and by our stockholders on February 19, 2013.  Our 2013 PIP was amended on February 11, 2015.  The 2013 PIP replaced on a prospective basis the 2004 PIP and the Prior Plans, and awards may no longer be granted under the 2004 PIP or the Prior Plans. A total of 3,665,500 shares of Common Stock were reserved for awards under the 2013 PIP. Shares subject to awards under the 2013 PIP, the 2004 PIP or the Prior Plans after February 19, 2013, that are canceled, expired, forfeited, settled in cash, tendered to satisfy the purchase price of an award, withheld to satisfy tax obligations or otherwise terminated without a delivery of shares to the participant again become available for awards. This number represents the remaining number of unused shares from the year ended October 31, 2018, which are available for issuance. 
(6) The following plans were not approved by our stockholders: The Executive Stock Ownership Program (the ''Ownership Program''), and The  Non-Employee Directors Deferred Fee Plan (the ''Deferred Fee Plan''), except that any DSUs awarded out of the Deferred Fee Plan on or after September 30, 2013, are now issued out of the 2013 PIP. Below is a brief description of the material features of each plan, but in each case the information is qualified in its entirety by the text of such plans.

The Ownership Program.  On June 16, 1997, the Board approved the terms of the Ownership Program, and on April 17, 2001, October 15, 2002, August 30, 2004, December 16, 2008 and January 9, 2009, the Board approved certain amendments thereto. In general, the Ownership Program requires all of our officers and senior managers to acquire, by direct purchase or through salary or annual bonus reduction, an ownership interest in Navistar by acquiring a designated amount of our Common Stock at specified timelines. Participants are required to hold such stock for the entire period in which they are employed by the Company. Participants may defer their cash bonus or defer salary into DSUs. These DSUs vest immediately. There were 2,365 DSUs deferred under the Ownership Program (albeit 1,338 DSUs were granted under the 2004 PIP and 1,027 DSUs were granted under the 2013 PIP) and outstanding as of October 31, 2018. PSUs may also be awarded to participants who complete their ownership requirement on an accelerated basis. PSUs vest as to one-third of the shares on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, so that in three years the shares are 100% vested. There were 29,712 PSUs earned under the Ownership Program (albeit 3,091 PSUs were granted under the Ownership Program, 14,143 PSUs were granted under the 2004 PIP and 12,478 PSUs were granted under the 2013 PIP) and outstanding as of October 31, 2018. Each vested DSU and PSU will be settled by delivery of one share of Common Stock. Such settlement will occur within 10 days after a participant's termination of employment. DSUs and PSUs are no longer granted under the Ownership Program or the 2004 PIP, but instead are granted under the 2013 PIP. Effective November 1, 2013, the Ownership Program was amended and restated to, among other things, eliminate an executive's ability to earn PSUs or defer their cash bonus into DSUs.
The Deferred Fee Plan.  Under the Deferred Fee Plan, directors may elect to receive all or a portion of their annual retainer fees (in excess of their mandatory restricted stock grant (as discussed above)) and meeting fees in cash or restricted stock, or they may defer payment of those fees in cash (with interest) or in DSUs. Deferrals in the deferred stock account are valued as if each deferral was vested in Common Stock as of the deferral date. As of October 31, 2018, there were 19,491 outstanding DSUs under the Deferred Fee Plan (including 13,220 DSUs awarded under the 2013 PIP). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(7) Includes 3,091 PSUs granted under the Ownership Program and 6,271 deferred stock units granted under the Deferred Fee Plan; all of which were outstanding as of October 31, 2018.

PROPOSAL 3 — RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
[END TABLE]
The Board is asking our stockholders to ratify the Audit Committee's appointment of KPMG as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2019.  KPMG has been the Company's auditors since 2006.  For additional information regarding the Company's relationship with KPMG, please refer to the Audit Committee Report and the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fee Information contained below. 
If the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 is not ratified by our stockholders, the adverse vote will be considered a direction to the Audit Committee to consider other auditors for next year.  However, because of the difficulty in making any substitution of auditors after the beginning of the current year, the appointment for 2019 will stand, unless the Audit Committee finds other good reason for making a change. 
Representatives of KPMG will be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so.  The representatives will also be available to respond to questions at the Annual Meeting. 
YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE ''FOR'' PROPOSAL 3.
[BEGIN TABLE]
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
[END TABLE]
Management of the Company has the primary responsibility for the integrity of the accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices of the Company, including the system of internal controls.  KPMG, our independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and issuing reports thereon.  The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor these processes.  In this regard, the Audit Committee meets periodically with management, the internal auditors and our independent registered public accounting firm.  The Audit Committee has the authority to conduct or authorize investigations into any matters within the scope of its responsibilities and the authority to retain such outside counsel, experts and other advisors as it determines appropriate to assist it in conducting any such investigations.  The Audit Committee is responsible for selecting and, if appropriate, replacing our independent registered public accounting firm.
The Audit Committee discussed with KPMG the overall scope and execution of the independent audit and reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management.  Discussions about the Company's audited financial statements included KPMG's judgments about the quality and acceptability of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. 
The Audit Committee also discussed with KPMG other matters required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standards. KPMG provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the letter required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and the Audit Committee discussed the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm with management and KPMG.  The Audit Committee concluded that KPMG's independence had not been impaired.
Based on the above-mentioned review and discussions with management and KPMG, and subject to the limitations on the roles and responsibilities of the Audit Committee referred to above and in the Audit Committee's written charter, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.  In addition, the Audit Committee engaged KPMG to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FEE INFORMATION 
[END TABLE]
The following table presents aggregate fees billed or expected to be billed by KPMG, our independent registered public accounting firm, for audit services and fees for professional services incurred for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, on our behalf: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2018(1)   2017(1)   
Audit fees   $10.3     $10.4   
Audit-related fees 0.1 0.4

All other fees —   —   
Total fees   $10.5     $10.9   
[END TABLE]
(1) In millions.
A description of the types of services provided in each category is as follows:
Audit Fees — These are fees for professional services for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements, limited review of our quarterly consolidated financial statements, and services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings.  This includes fees for the audit of NFC. 
Audit-Related Fees — These are fees for the assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements, including procedures related to our and NFC's financing transactions. 
Tax Fees — These are fees for professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning.
All Other Fees — These are fees for permissible services provided by KPMG that do not meet the above categories.  For 2017 and 2018, the Company did not incur any other fees. 
The Audit Committee pre-approved all audit and non-audit services provided to us in accordance with the Audit Committee's pre-approval policy.  In accordance with the Audit Committee's pre-approval policy, the Audit 
Committee annually considers for pre-approval all proposed audit and non-audit services which are known early in the year to be performed in the coming year by our independent registered public accounting firm and the estimated fees for such services.  Additional fees related to certain audit-related or non-audit services proposed to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm may be pre-approved by management, so long as the fees for such additional services individually or in the aggregate do not exceed $400,000 in any 12-month period, and are reported to the Audit Committee at the next regularly scheduled committee meeting.  Other proposed audit-related or non-audit services (not within the scope of the approved engagement) may be considered and, if appropriate, pre-approved by the chair of the Audit Committee if the related additional fees are estimated to be less than $250,000; otherwise, the Audit Committee must pre-approve all additional audit-related and non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm.  In making its decision to utilize our independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee considers whether the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining that firm's independence and to that end receives certain representations from the firm regarding their independence and permissibility under applicable laws and regulations related to non-audit services provided by the firm to us.

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and persons who own beneficially more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of holdings and transfers of Company stock with the SEC and to provide copies of those reports to Navistar. Based solely on our review of copies of those reports received by us or written representations that all such reports were timely filed, we believe that our directors, executive officers and greater than ten percent beneficial stockholders made all required filings on a timely basis.
