DIGIMARC CORPORATION 
PROXY STATEMENT FOR 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 
General Information 
The Board of Directors of Digimarc Corporation, an Oregon corporation ("Digimarc," "we" or "our"), is soliciting proxies to be used at the annual meeting of shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held on April 30, 2019, at 11:00 a.m., local time, at our headquarters, located at 9405 S.W. Gemini Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97008, and any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting. Notice of, and electronic access to, this proxy statement, the form of proxy and our 2018 annual report to shareholders are first being provided to shareholders on or about March 21, 2019. The shares represented by the proxies received, properly marked, dated, executed and not revoked will be voted at the Annual Meeting by the proxy holders designated on the proxy. 
The Board has fixed the close of business on March 1, 2019 as the record date (the "Record Date") for determining the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. As of the close of business on the Record Date, 12,134,857 shares of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share, were outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Each outstanding share of common stock on the Record Date is entitled to one vote on all matters. There must be a quorum for the Annual Meeting to be held. The required quorum for the Annual Meeting is a majority of the shares outstanding, present either in person or by proxy. Our Inspector of Elections will tabulate votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting. 
Internet Availability of Proxy Materials 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we are providing access to our proxy materials over the Internet. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to our shareholders of record and beneficial owners. All shareholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or request to receive a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice. In addition, shareholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. Choosing to receive your future proxy materials by email will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by email, you will receive an email next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you terminate it. 
Our proxy materials include this proxy statement and our annual report to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018, which includes our Form 10-K and audited financial statements. If you requested a printed version of our proxy materials, these materials also include the proxy card for the Annual Meeting. 
How to Vote 
Shares held directly in your name as the shareholder of record may be voted in person at the annual meeting. If you choose to do so, please bring your proxy card or proof of identification. Even if you plan to attend the annual meeting, we recommend that you vote your shares in advance as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the annual meeting. 
Shares held in street name may be voted in person by you only if you obtain a signed proxy from the record holder giving you the right to vote the shares.  If you hold shares directly as the shareholder of record, you may vote your shares by following the instructions set forth on the proxy card. If you hold shares beneficially in street name, you may vote your shares by following the instructions set forth in the notice provided by your broker, bank, trust, or other holder of record. In most cases, you may be permitted to submit your voting instructions by mail, by telephone, or via the Internet by following the instructions in the proxy card. You may access your proxy materials and proxy card online by accessing the www.proxyvote.com website and entering your 12-digit control number found on the notice that you received. The voting procedures are designed to comply with Oregon law, to authenticate the shareholder's identity and to allow shareholders to vote their shares and confirm that their voting instructions have been properly recorded. 
Revocability of Proxy 
You may change your proxy instructions at any time prior to the vote at the annual meeting. You may accomplish this by entering a new vote by Internet, by telephone, by delivering a written notice of revocation to the corporate secretary of Digimarc, by submitting a new proxy card or new voting instruction card bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy instructions) or by attending the annual meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the annual meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically so request. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker or other nominee authorizing you to vote your shares at the annual meeting. 
Any written notice revoking a proxy should be sent to Digimarc Corporation, Attention: Robert P. Chamness, Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, 9405 SW Gemini Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97008, or hand delivered to the Secretary at or before the vote at the annual meeting. 
Solicitation 
Digimarc will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. Besides this solicitation by mail, our directors, officers and other employees may solicit proxies. These persons will not receive any additional compensation for assisting in the solicitation. We will also request brokerage firms, nominees, custodians and fiduciaries to forward proxy materials to the beneficial owners. We will reimburse these persons and our transfer agent for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in forwarding these materials. 
Vote Required: Treatment of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 
Abstentions are shares that abstain from voting on a particular matter. Broker non-votes occur when shares are held in "street name" by brokers or nominees who indicate on their proxies that they did not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and do not have discretionary authority to vote those shares on a particular matter. Abstentions and broker non-votes count as being present for purposes of determining whether a quorum of shares is present at a meeting but are not counted for purposes of determining the number of votes cast for or against a proposal.  The following chart describes the proposals to be considered at the meeting, the vote required to elect directors and to adopt each other proposal, and the manner in which votes will be counted: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal    Voting Options    Vote Required to Adopt the Proposal    Effect of Abstentions    Effect of  Broker Non-Votes 
 Ratification of selection of KPMG LLP   For, against, or abstain.   The votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the votes cast opposing the proposal.   Not counted as votes cast and therefore no effect.   Brokers have discretion to vote.

Principal Executive Offices of Digimarc 
Our principal executive offices are located at 9405 S.W. Gemini Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97008.  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
(Proposal No. 1) 
Our bylaws authorize the number of directors to be set by resolution of the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has fixed the number of directors at six. Six directors are to be elected by the holders of common stock at the Annual Meeting. These directors will each serve a one-year term that will expire at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, or until a successor has been elected and qualified. The proxy holders named in the accompanying proxy or their substitutes will vote the proxy at the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting for the election of the six nominees as directors unless the shareholder of record instructs that their authority to vote is withheld. Shares held through a broker or other nominee who is a New York Stock Exchange member organization will only be voted in favor of the director nominees if the shareholder provides specific voting instructions to the broker or other nominee to vote the shares in favor of that proposal. 
Following is information about our Board of Directors' nominees for election as a director as of March 1, 2019. Each person listed below was nominated by the Company. There are no arrangements or understandings between any director and any other person pursuant to which the director is or was to be selected as a director, or pursuant to which the director receives compensation or any other payments from any third party for service as a director. There is no family relationship between any director and any executive officer of Digimarc.

Vote Required 
If a quorum is present, the six candidates receiving the highest number of affirmative votes present or represented and voting on this proposal at the Annual Meeting will be elected to the Board of Directors.

ACCOUNTING FIRM 
(Proposal No. 2) 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed KPMG LLP as Digimarc's independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting for the year ending December 31, 2019. Although ratification by shareholders is not required by law, the Board of Directors has determined that it is desirable to request ratification of this appointment by the shareholders. Notwithstanding its appointment, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may appoint a new independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee believes that such a change would be in the best interests of Digimarc and its shareholders. 
If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment. A representative of KPMG LLP is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders and to make a statement if he or she desires to do so.

Pre-Approval Policy. The Audit Committee pre-approves the Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm.

Under the policy, the term of any pre-approval is generally twelve months from the date of pre-approval. Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and the specific services included within the pre-approvals are established annually by the Audit Committee and are reviewed as the Audit Committee deems appropriate. Any   proposed services exceeding these levels, amounts, or type of services require specific pre-approval. No services were provided by the independent auditors under the categories of "Audit-Related Fees," "Tax Fees" or "All Other Fees" in 2017 or 2018. 
Vote Required 
If a quorum is present, the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm will be ratified if the votes cast in favor of this proposal exceed the votes cast opposing this proposal. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.  ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
(Proposal No. 3) 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") enables Digimarc shareholders to vote to approve, on an advisory or non-binding basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. This advisory vote on executive compensation is referred to as a "say-on-pay vote." We will offer Digimarc shareholders a say-on-pay vote every year until the next required advisory vote on the frequency of the shareholder votes on executive compensation. 
We encourage shareholders to read the "Executive Compensation" sections of this proxy statement for a more detailed discussion of our compensation programs and policies, the compensation and governance related action taken in 2018 and the compensation awarded to our named executive officers. Mr. Davis is in the second year of his three-year employment agreement, and all changes in his compensation were made according to that agreement. All other officers are compensated in a manner consistent with the processes and philosophy set forth below. 
Digimarc's goal for its executive compensation program is to attract, retain, motivate and appropriately reward the Company's executive officers, as well as to align the interests of the Company's executive officers with those of Digimarc shareholders. Digimarc seeks to accomplish this goal in a way that rewards performance and is aligned with its shareholders' long-term interests. It has chosen to utilize time-based restricted stock that vests over a three- or four-year period, which provides an increasing return to executives to the extent that the market price of our common stock appreciates, thereby creating an incentive to increase shareholder value over a longer term. Digimarc believes that its executive compensation program, which emphasizes long-term equity awards, satisfies this goal and is strongly aligned with the long-term interests of its shareholders. 
At our 2018 annual meeting, our "say on pay" advisory proposal was not approved, with 42% of the votes cast by our shareholders voting in favor of the proposal. In response to this vote, the Compensation Committee has begun a review of all aspects of the compensation program. With respect to Mr. Davis, his employment agreement expires in 2020 and no changes are anticipated prior to expiration. As for the other executive and non-executive officers, for 2019, the Compensation Committee generally froze salary and stock at 2018 levels, except for one officer who assumed materially broader responsibilities as part of a management reorganization and minor changes to the incentive compensation plans of individuals in the sales organization. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee adopted an incentive compensation recovery policy, described below, relative to financial restatements and inappropriate behavior. 
In determining whether to approve this proposal, we believe that shareholders should consider the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independent Compensation Committee. Executive compensation is reviewed and established by a Compensation Committee of the Board consisting  solely of independent directors. The Compensation Committee meets in executive session, without executive officers present, in determining annual named executive officer compensation. The Compensation Committee receives data, analysis and input from  an independent compensation consultant that does not perform any additional services for Digimarc's management.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• New Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy. In February 2019, our Board of Directors adopted revised Corporate Governance Guidelines that  provide that the Company, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee after it has considered the costs and benefits of doing so and to the extent permitted by applicable law, will seek to recover incentive compensation awarded or paid to an  officer or employee for a fiscal period if the result of the performance measure upon which the award was based or paid is subsequently restated or otherwise adjusted in a manner that would reduce the size of the award or payment. In addition, if an  officer or employee of the Company engaged in intentional misconduct that contributed to the award or payment to such officer or employee of a greater amount of incentive compensation than would have been paid or awarded in the absence of the  misconduct, the Company may take other remedial and recovery action, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2018 Compensation. In 2018, except for payments made pursuant to sales incentive plans, no cash incentive bonus was offered or paid. Further,  equity awards granted in 2018 were consistent with prior years, except for the CEO option grant made pursuant to his employment agreement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-Term Incentive Equity Awards. The restricted stock granted in 2018 will provide an increasing return to executives to the extent that the  market price of our common stock appreciates, thereby creating an incentive to increase shareholder value over a longer term.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Perquisites. Our general policy is not to provide perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers, other than those  benefits provided for all other employees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Ownership Guidelines. Our executive officers are subject to the stock ownership guidelines described in our Report of the Governance and  Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors under "Stock Ownership Guidelines." Under our policy, Executive Officers are expected to have a stock ownership interest as a means of insuring that there is an alignment of interest with the  shareholders. The Company believes that it is appropriate for the Executive Officers to hold stock in the Company sufficient to meet that objective, but not at a level that might discourage a qualified officer from serving. Our Executive Officers  currently hold between 36,000 shares and 531,800 shares, which includes vested and outstanding stock options. The value of stock held by each executive officer materially exceeds one-year's salary and  benefits of the respective officers.  
[END TABLE]
Digimarc believes the compensation program for the named executive officers is instrumental in helping Digimarc achieve its strategic objectives and long-term financial performance. The price of our common stock has increased significantly since we became an independent publicly traded company in October 2008. 
Advisory Vote 
Digimarc requests shareholder approval of the compensation of its named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to the SEC's compensation disclosure rules (which disclosure includes the compensation tables and the narrative disclosures that accompany the compensation tables). 
Although this vote is advisory and non-binding on the Compensation Committee, the Board or the Company, the Board and the Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering Digimarc's executive compensation program, value the opinions expressed by shareholders in their vote on this proposal and will continue to consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation policies and decisions for named executive officers. 
Vote Required 
If a quorum is present, the compensation of Digimarc's named executive officers will be approved on a non-binding basis if the votes cast in favor of this proposal exceed the votes cast opposing this proposal. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the approval, on a non-binding basis, of the compensation of Digimarc's named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.  REPORT OF THE GOVERNANCE AND NOMINATING COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
The Governance and Nominating Committee reports as follows: 
Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors met five times in 2018. Each director elected at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders attended 100% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board of Directors and of any committee on which he served in 2018. We encourage but do not require director attendance at our annual meeting of shareholders. Because we have experienced low turnout from our non-employee shareholders at our annual meeting of shareholders over the past five years, none of the directors attended Digimarc's annual meeting of shareholders held on April 30, 2018. 
Board Leadership and Structure 
Bruce Davis, our Chief Executive Officer, also serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors. James Richardson, an independent director, has served as Lead Director of the Board of Directors since he was appointed to this position in July 2008. At the present time, the Board believes that Digimarc and its shareholders are best served by having the Chief Executive Officer also serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors. We have determined that this structure is appropriate in light of the relatively small size of our Company and corresponding size of our Board of Directors, the complexity of our business, and the skills and experiences of our Chief Executive Officer in the industry in which we operate. At the same time, the Board of Directors has been, and continues to be, a strong proponent of Board independence. As a result, Digimarc's corporate governance structures and practices include several additional independent oversight mechanisms. Currently, all of our directors other than the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, including each member of the Board's Audit, Compensation, and Governance and Nominating Committees, are independent directors under the Nasdaq listing rules. 
The Board believes that Digimarc's corporate governance principles and policies ensure that strong and independent directors will continue to effectively oversee Digimarc's management and key issues related to long-range business plans, long-range strategic matters and risks, and integrity. The independent directors meet regularly in executive session chaired by the Lead Director without the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or other management present. In addition to presiding over these executive sessions, the Lead Director serves as the principal liaison between the independent directors and management and consults with the Chairman of the Board of Directors regarding information to be sent to the Board of Directors, meeting agendas and meeting schedules. Furthermore, each director is encouraged to suggest items for the Board agenda, and to raise at any Board meeting subjects that are not on the agenda for that meeting. We believe that the independent Lead Director's significant, clearly delineated duties and responsibilities are highly effective in providing oversight of management and direct accountability to shareholders. Finally, our corporate governance principles provide that the Board and all Board committees, including those whose members are exclusively independent directors, may seek financial, legal or other expert advice from a source independent of management, with funding provided by Digimarc. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Digimarc's management is responsible for identifying, assessing and managing the material risks facing Digimarc. The Board of Directors has historically performed an important role in the review and oversight of risks, and generally oversees Digimarc's risk management practices and processes, with a strong emphasis on financial and entity level controls. The Board has delegated primary oversight of the management of (i) financial and accounting risks to the Audit Committee, (ii) compensation risk to the Compensation Committee and (iii) governance and compliance risk related to personnel, ethics, related-party transactions, conflicts of interests,   litigation and other entity level risks to the Governance and Nominating committee. Each of these committees reviews these specific risk areas on a quarterly basis and routinely reports to the Board regarding the committee's oversight duties and findings. 
To permit the Board and its committees to perform their respective risk oversight roles, individual members of management who supervise Digimarc's risk management report directly to the Board or the relevant committee of the Board responsible for overseeing the management of specific risks, as applicable. The Board and each of its committees have the ability to engage outside legal and professional advisors to assist the Board or the committee in its oversight responsibilities. For this purpose, management has a high degree of access and communication with independent directors. In addition, the Board of Directors oversees and participates annually in a process of risk assessment that is designed to identify the most salient enterprise risks facing Digimarc's business and to evaluate how the Company's corporate strategies align with those risks. 
Each year Digimarc's executive management team prepares for the Board an initial review of the various types of risks that can affect the operations and financial performance of the Company. The management team identifies and categorizes the key strategic, financial, operational and legal and compliance risks facing the Company and then ranks these risks as to the level of risk posed, based upon management's assessment of the risk relative to Digimarc's business, personnel, internal processes, policies and controls, and the operating environment of the Company. Taking into consideration Digimarc's risk controls and mitigation plans, the Board reviews management's presentation to identify and assess the degree and likelihood of each risk. Having a Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, a Lead Director, and directors who are both knowledgeable about and sensitive to the market and industry risks facing our business ensures that risk is reviewed from multiple alternative vantage points. 
Finally, the Board oversees organizational structure, policies and procedures at Digimarc, such as the code of business conduct and other internal policies and guidelines designed to support Digimarc's corporate governance guidelines and to comply with the laws, rules and regulations that apply to Digimarc's business operations. For example, employees may anonymously report suspected violations of any applicable law by any employee or agent, questionable accounting or auditing matters, or other ethical or legal matters pursuant to these established policies and procedures. 
Board Committees 
The Board of Directors had three standing committees for 2018: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Governance and Nominating Committee. The members of these committees for 2018 are set forth in the following table: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Non-Employee Directors    Audit    Governance & Nominating    Compensation 
 Gary DeStefano        Member    Chair 
 Richard L. King        Chair    Member 
 James T. Richardson    Member         
 Andrew J. Walter    Member        Member 
 Bernard Whitney    Chair    Member     
[END TABLE]
In February 2019, the Board of Directors established a Market Development Committee to bring to bear the market development expertise of the subject matter experts on the Board of Directors. The Board appointed Gary DeStefano, Richard L. King and Andrew J. Walter to the Committee and designated Mr. Walter as the Chair. 
Audit Committee 
We have a standing Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting in 2018 of Messrs. Whitney (chairman), Richardson and Walter, that is responsible for overseeing the quality and integrity of our accounting,   auditing, and financial reporting practices, the audits of our financial statements, internal control over financial reporting, and other duties assigned by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee's role includes a particular focus on the qualitative aspects of financial reporting to shareholders, our processes to manage business and financial risk, and compliance with significant applicable legal, ethical and regulatory requirements. 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged to issue an audit report on our financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting or to perform other audit, review or attestation services for us. The Audit Committee is responsible for resolving any disagreements between management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding financial reporting. The Audit Committee also serves as our Qualified Legal Compliance Committee. 
The Audit Committee met four times during 2018. The Board of Directors has adopted a charter for the Audit Committee, a copy of which is posted on our website, www.digimarc.com, on the Company, Company Overview, Corporate Governance page. 
The Board of Directors has determined that each of the three members of the Audit Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• meets the requirements for "independence" set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rules 5605(a)(2) and 5605(c)(2) and applicable SEC rules; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• has the requisite financial sophistication called for by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2).  
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors also has reviewed and designated each of Messrs. Whitney and Richardson as an "audit committee financial expert" in compliance with Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. 
Compensation Committee 
We have a standing Compensation Committee, consisting in 2018 of Messrs. DeStefano (chairman), King and Walter, that has the authority and responsibility to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• review, establish and approve, on an annual basis, the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers of the Company;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• administer our annual and long-term compensation plans;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• review and make recommendations to the Board of Directors with respect to director compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approve our overall compensation strategy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• review and discuss with management annual compensation matters, if applicable, and recommend to the Board inclusion of a discussion and analysis of  compensation in the annual report on Form 10-K and the proxy statement, if applicable;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• create and approve a Compensation Committee Report, if applicable;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• review and approve compensation agreements and arrangements between us and our executive officers; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• perform other duties and functions assigned by the Board of Directors from time to time that are consistent with the Compensation Committee's  charter, our bylaws and governing law.  
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors has determined that all members of the Compensation Committee are "independent" as that term is defined in Nasdaq Listing Rules 5605(a)(2) and 5605(d)(2) and "outside" directors in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). 
The Compensation Committee's role includes a particular focus on the compensation of our executive officers and non-employee directors and the administration of our equity incentive plans and significant employee benefit programs.  The Compensation Committee met five times in 2018. The Compensation Committee has a written charter, a copy of which is available on our website, www.digimarc.com, on the Company, Company Overview, Corporate Governance page. 
The Compensation Committee may, under its charter, delegate any of its responsibilities to subcommittees of the Committee as necessary and appropriate. The Committee has delegated authority to Messrs. Davis and Chamness, acting jointly, so long as each is an executive officer of Digimarc, to grant options (but not restricted stock) to existing and new employees and consultants of Digimarc pursuant to a predetermined annual grant budget, limitations on the number of shares reserved for issuance that can be issued in any one year, and additional guidance or limitations established by the Compensation Committee. No such options were awarded in 2018. 
The Compensation Committee, together with our Chief Executive Officer, reviews assessments of executive compensation practices at least annually against comparative data and our compensation philosophy. Our Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee with the intent of keeping our executive officer compensation practices aligned with our compensation philosophy. The Compensation Committee must approve any recommended changes before they can be made. 
The Compensation Committee has the authority to retain and terminate any compensation and benefits consultant and the authority to approve the related fees and other retention terms of the consultant. The Compensation Committee has retained Radford (an AON Hewitt Company), a nationally recognized independent consulting firm, to provide an independent review of our compensation programs for executive officers and directors, assist in the preparation of a list of peer companies, examine our pay practices relative to the market and assist in the design of compensation programs. Radford provides compensation information to management on market compensation classifications and trends from time to time, but does not have a material additional relationship outside of the services that it provides to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has determined that Radford's work has not raised any conflict of interest. 
Governance and Nominating Committee 
We have a standing Governance and Nominating Committee, consisting in 2018 of Messrs. King (chairman), DeStefano and Whitney. The Governance and Nominating Committee met four times in 2018. The Board of Directors has delegated to the Governance and Nominating Committee the responsibility for overseeing the quality and integrity of our corporate governance practices and for optimizing the composition and competence of the Board of Directors and its committees by searching for and recommending individuals for election to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Governance and Nominating Committee, a copy of which is posted on our website at www.digimarc.com on the Company, Company Overview, Corporate Governance page. 
The Board of Directors has determined that all members of the Governance and Nominating Committee are "independent" as that term is defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2). 
The Governance and Nominating Committee's responsibilities include the review, monitoring, and general oversight of our policies and procedures involving corporate governance and compliance with significant legal, ethical, and regulatory requirements. This oversight responsibility includes monitoring compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Governance and Nominating Committee also oversees the structure and evaluation of the Board of Directors and its committees, and the development, monitoring, and enforcement of the corporate governance principles applicable to us. 
The Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for recruiting individuals to become members of the Board of Directors and evaluating their qualifications under the guidelines described under "Director Nomination Policy" below. The Board of Directors may from time to time assign to the Governance and Nominating Committee additional duties and functions consistent with its charter, our Bylaws and governing law.  Director Nomination Policy. The Governance and Nominating Committee has a formal written policy addressing the nominating process. A copy of the policy is available on our website at www.digimarc.com, attached as an exhibit to the Governance and Nominating Committee charter located on the Company, Company Overview, Corporate Governance page of the site. Pursuant to its written policy addressing the nominating process, the Governance and Nominating Committee welcomes and encourages recommendations of director candidates from our shareholders, and will consider any director candidates recommended by our shareholders, provided that the information regarding director candidates who are recommended is submitted to the Governance and Nominating Committee in compliance with the terms of its policy. Director candidate recommendations from shareholders must be provided in writing, include prescribed information, and be sent to Digimarc's Secretary at the address of our principal executive offices. In evaluating a potential candidate's qualifications for nomination to the Board, the Governance and Nominating Committee will consider the potential candidate's experience, areas of expertise, and other factors relative to the overall composition of the Board of Directors. The Governance and Nominating Committee will also review from time to time the skills and characteristics necessary and appropriate for directors in the context of the current composition of the Board of Directors. Directors are expected to devote sufficient time to carry out their duties and responsibilities effectively, ensure that other existing and planned future commitments do not materially interfere with his or her service as a director, and attend at least 75% of all Board of Directors and applicable committee meetings. 
The Governance and Nominating Committee's process for identifying and evaluating nominees for director, including nominees recommended by shareholders, involves an internal assessment of the qualifications and performance of incumbent members of the Board of Directors, compiling names of potentially eligible candidates, vetting those candidates against the factors described above, conducting background and reference checks, conducting interviews with candidates, meeting to consider and approve final candidates and, as appropriate, preparing and presenting to the Board of Directors an analysis with regard to a candidate. The Governance and Nominating Committee will identify director nominees who have the highest personal and professional integrity, have demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment, and, together with other director nominees and members, will effectively serve the shareholders' long-term interests and contribute to our overall corporate goals. In connection with the selection of nominees for director, consideration will be given to the Board's overall balance of diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences; however, the Board has not adopted a formal diversity policy beyond the universal corporate policy that decisions involving people are made on the basis of job requirements, independent of an individual's race, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, age, religion, military or veteran status, physical or mental disability, and/or any other status protected by law, and that there is no tolerance for discrimination of any sort on any protected basis. While small public companies historically have a more difficult time achieving Board diversity, during our last search for director candidates, we specifically sought out candidates that could enhance the diversity of our Board of Directors, with a focus on gender diversity. There are no differences in the manner in which the Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates nominees for director based on whether the nominee is recommended by a shareholder or by the Governance and Nominating Committee. The committee may, from time to time, pay professional search firms to assist in the identification and evaluation of potential nominees. 
Market Development Committee 
In February 2019, the Board of Directors established a Market Development Committee to bring to bear the market development expertise of the subject matter experts on the Board of Directors. The Board appointed Gary DeStefano, Richard L. King and Andrew J. Walter to the Committee and designated Mr. Walter as the Chair. The Board of Directors intends to adopt a written charter for the Market Development Committee that will be posted on our website at www.digimarc.com on the Company Overview, Corporate Governance page.  Shareholder Communications with the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors encourages communication from shareholders. All communications must be in written form, addressed to the Board of Directors or to one or more individual members of the Board of Directors, and sent care of the Secretary of Digimarc at the address of our principal executive offices or via fax to (503) 469-4771. The Secretary of Digimarc will promptly provide all communications to the applicable member(s) of the Board of Directors or the entire Board of Directors, as specified by the shareholder. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
In July 2008, the Board of Directors adopted stock ownership guidelines for members of the Board of Directors and our executive officers. Under the amended director ownership guidelines, effective April 1, 2015, the non-employee members of the Board shall acquire and maintain at least the number of shares necessary to achieve a multiple of three times the annual cash retainer. 
Director Resignation Upon Change of Employment 
The Board of Directors also has adopted a policy that requires any director who experiences a substantial change in principal employment responsibility to tender his or her resignation from the Board, unless the change was anticipated by the Governance and Nominating Committee at the time of the director's nomination or election to the Board. Upon receipt of a resignation offered under these circumstances, the Governance and Nominating Committee will review the director's change in employment responsibilities to evaluate whether the director's continued service is appropriate. 
Other Corporate Governance Matters 
In furtherance of our commitment to upholding the highest legal and ethical conduct in fulfilling our responsibilities, the Board of Directors adopted and published corporate governance guidelines and three codes of ethics and business conduct, two of which apply to our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, our Controller and other finance personnel. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines can be found on the Company, Company Overview, Corporate Governance page of our website at www.digimarc.com. These Corporate Governance Guidelines provide a framework for the Board of Directors to assist in the governance and oversight of the affairs of Digimarc. Our Code of Business Conduct can be found on the Company, Company Overview, Corporate Governance page of our website at www.digimarc.com. The Code of Business Conduct applies to every officer, director and employee of Digimarc and its subsidiaries, and their immediate family members, and sets forth internal policies and guidelines designed to support and encourage ethical conduct and compliance with the laws, rules and regulations that govern our business operations. Our Code of Ethics for Financial Personnel can be found on the Company, Company Overview, Corporate Governance page of our website at www.digimarc.com. This Code of Ethics applies to the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of Digimarc and its subsidiaries and every officer, director or employee of Digimarc who performs or influences financial transactions and reporting on behalf of Digimarc, and their immediate family members. In addition to the codes described above, we have adopted Standards of Professional Conduct for Legal Personnel that are available on the Company, Company Overview, Corporate Governance page of our website at www.digimarc.com.

(1)  Nonemployee directors of the Company receive a $50,000 annual retainer. The Lead Director and the Chair of each committee receive an  additional annual retainer as set forth below. All retainers are paid quarterly in arrears.  
(2)  On April 30, 2018, each non-employee, continuing director (a group consisting of Messrs. King,  Richardson, Whitney, DeStefano and Walter) was granted 3,475 shares of restricted stock. The amounts disclosed above represent the grant date fair value for the restricted stock granted to the indicated  non-employee director in 2018, computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718 "Compensation—Stock  Compensation". A summary of the assumptions we apply in calculating these amounts is set forth in the Notes to Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the total number of outstanding stock options held by each non-employee director was as follows: Mr. King, 0; Mr. Richardson, 15,000;  Mr. Whitney, 10,000; Mr. DeStefano, 0; and Mr. Walter, 0. As of December 31, 2018, the total number of unvested restricted shares held by each non-employee director was as follows:  Mr. King, 3,475; Mr. Richardson, 3,475; Mr. Whitney, 3,475; Mr. DeStefano, 5,408; and Mr. Walter, 5,408.  
[END TABLE]
All directors are also reimbursed for reasonable and necessary travel, communications, and other out-of-pocket business expenses incurred in connection with their attendance at meetings, while on corporate business or for continuing education related to their board service. 
Cash Compensation. The Board has approved cash compensation for each non-employee director of $50,000 per annum. In addition, the Board has approved an additional annual retainer in the amount of $20,000 for the Lead Director and an additional annual retainer of $15,000 for the Chair of the Audit Committee, $10,000 for the Chair of the Compensation Committee and the Market Development Committee, and $5,000 for the Chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee. These cash retainers included compensation for all committee, chairperson and other roles undertaken by the respective director, and for attendance at all committee and Board of Directors meetings. 
Equity Compensation. Under the Equity Compensation Program for Non-Employee Directors under the Digimarc Corporation 2018 Incentive Plan, when a non-employee director is first elected or appointed to our Board of Directors, the director is automatically granted shares of restricted common stock having an aggregate value of approximately $200,000. These shares vest over the three-year period commencing on the date of grant, with 1/3 of the shares vesting on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. On the date of each   annual meeting of shareholders, each non-employee director automatically receives an annual grant of restricted stock having an aggregate value of approximately $100,000, unless the Compensation Committee exercises its power to make an alternative grant. The stock restrictions lapse on the anniversary of the grant date, so the stock is freely tradable one year after the grant date. 
Following is a summary of the cash and equity compensation program for our non-employee directors, presented in a tabular format:

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Results of Shareholder Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation 
At our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, we requested our shareholders to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation paid to our executive officers as disclosed in the proxy statement for our 2018 annual meeting. At our 2018 annual meeting, our "say on pay" advisory proposal was not approved, with 42% of the votes cast by our shareholders voting in favor of the proposal. With respect to Mr. Davis, his employment agreement expires in 2020 and no changes are anticipated prior to expiration. As for the other executive and non-executive officers, for 2019, the Compensation Committee generally froze salary and stock at 2018 levels, except for one officer who assumed materially broader responsibilities as part of a management reorganization and minor changes to the incentive compensation plans of individuals in the sales organization. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee adopted an incentive compensation recovery policy relative to financial restatements and inappropriate behavior.

2018 POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
Davis Employment Agreement. We entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Davis in September 2017 for a term from September 1, 2017 through August 31, 2020, as described under "Narrative to Summary Compensation Table—Employment Agreement with Mr. Davis." The employment agreement provides that if Digimarc terminates Mr. Davis's employment without cause (as defined below), or if Mr. Davis terminates his employment for good reason (as defined below), in either case other than following a change of control (as defined in the employment agreement), Mr. Davis's stock options and restricted stock that would have vested if Mr. Davis's employment had continued for an additional twenty-four (24) months will immediately and fully vest, and Digimarc will be obligated to continue to pay Mr. Davis the benefits described below for two years from the date of termination. "Cause" is defined as "(i) any act of personal dishonesty by Mr. Davis in connection with his responsibilities as an officer or employee of Digimarc, (ii) Mr. Davis's conviction of a felony, (iii) any act by Mr. Davis which constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct, (iv) any material violation by Mr. Davis of his employment duties provided that if such violation is curable, it has not been cured within (30) days after delivery to Mr. Davis of a written demand for cure, or (v) any act that would constitute a material violation of Digimarc's code of conduct or code of ethics or a material violation of any restrictive covenants contained in the employment agreement or any other agreement between Digimarc and Mr. Davis or any Digimarc plan or program." "Good Reason" includes any of the following changes, if done without Mr. Davis's prior written consent: "(i) a material reduction in Mr. Davis's authority, duties or responsibilities; (ii) a material reduction in Mr. Davis's salary other than as specifically set forth in the employment agreement or (iii) relocation of Mr. Davis's geographic work location to a location that is more than 50 miles from Mr. Davis's geographic work location on the date of the employment agreement, except for required travel in furtherance of Digimarc's business to the extent consistent with Mr. Davis's duties." For a period of two years following the date of termination, Mr. Davis would continue to receive base compensation of $740,000 or the level in effect on the date of termination. This amount would be paid according to our standard payroll schedules from the date of termination, as if Mr. Davis had not been terminated. For a period of two years following the date of termination, we would also provide, for Mr. Davis and his dependents, continued health, disability and other fringe benefits similar to those generally provided to other executives of Digimarc. 
The employment agreement further provides that in the event that Digimarc terminates Mr. Davis's employment without cause or Mr. Davis terminates his employment for good reason, in either case within eighteen (18) months following a change of control (as defined in the employment agreement), Mr. Davis's stock options and restricted stock will immediately and fully vest. For a period of two years following the date of termination, Mr. Davis would continue to receive base salary at the level in effect on the date of termination. This amount would be paid according to our standard payroll schedules from the date of termination, as if Mr. Davis had not been terminated. For a period of two years following the date of termination, we would also provide, for Mr. Davis and his dependents, continued health, disability and other fringe benefits similar to those generally provided to other executives of Digimarc. 
The employment agreement provides that in the event that Mr. Davis's employment terminates due to death or permanent disability, Mr. Davis's stock options and restricted stock that would have vested if Mr. Davis's employment had continued for an additional twenty-four (24) months will immediately and fully vest and become exercisable. 
In consideration for the provisions in the employment agreement providing for the post-termination payments described above, Mr. Davis has agreed to specified non-competition and non-solicitation obligations in our favor. Mr. Davis's non-competition and non-solicitation obligations last for the duration of his employment by Digimarc, and for a post-termination period equal to the longer of one year, or the period during which Mr. Davis is receiving severance payments under the employment agreement after his employment by Digimarc terminates. The employment agreement does not provide for the waiver of a breach of such obligations.  Change of Control Retention Agreements. Effective January 1, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved a form of Change of Control Retention Agreement to be entered into by and between Digimarc and certain executive officers or key employees of the Company, including Ms. Arana and Mr. Beck. The Change of Control Retention Agreement is effective until December 31, 2021 and provides for certain severance benefits in the event of termination of the executive without cause by Digimarc, or termination by the executive for good reason, within 12 months following a change of control of Digimarc during the term of the Change of Control Retention Agreement. "Cause" is defined as willful misconduct that is significantly injurious to us; fraud, dishonesty, embezzlement, misrepresentation or theft of Digimarc property; conviction of (or plea of no contest to) a felony or crime involving moral turpitude; breach of any agreement with Digimarc; unauthorized disclosure of Digimarc's proprietary or confidential information or breach of any confidentiality/invention/proprietary information agreement(s) with Digimarc; violation of our Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct or any other employment rule, code or policy; continued failure or refusal to follow our lawful instructions after five days has passed following delivery of a written notice identifying the failure or refusal; a court order or a consent decree barring the executive from serving as an officer or director of a public company; or continued failure to meet and sustain an acceptable level of performance of the executive's duties and obligations to Digimarc for thirty days following notice of failure to perform. 
Termination by the Executive for "Good reason" is defined as a substantial reduction in duties or responsibilities (with certain exceptions); a material reduction in base salary, benefits or total cash compensation, other than as part of an overall reduction for all employees at the same level; a mandatory transfer to another geographic location more than 35 miles from the prior location of employment, other than normal business travel obligations; the failure of a successor to Digimarc to assume the obligations under the agreement; or Digimarc's failure to comply with its obligations under the agreement. 
The severance benefits payable upon such a termination include 12 months' salary, stock acceleration and up to 18 months premiums necessary to continue the executive's health insurance coverage under our health insurance plan. 
In consideration for the post-termination payments described above, Ms. Arana and Mr. Beck must execute and not revoke a settlement agreement and general release related to his/her employment and termination. 
Stock Options and Restricted Stock under the 2018 Incentive Plan. The 2018 Incentive Plan provides that, unless the Compensation Committee otherwise determines in the grant document, an employment agreement or other agreement between the plan participant and us, all outstanding awards that are not performance shares or performance units will fully vest and become exercisable immediately prior to a change in control (as defined in the 2018 Incentive Plan). In the event of a change in control which constitutes a company transaction (as defined in the 2018 Incentive Plan) all outstanding awards will become fully and immediately exercisable if and to the extent that the awards are not assumed or replaced by the successor company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation Committee has discretionary authority to determine the terms and conditions of any award granted under the 2018 Incentive Plan. In the event a named executive officer's employment terminates as a result of his/her retirement, death or disability, the executive's vested options will generally remain exercisable until the earlier of the one year anniversary of his/her termination and the original option expiration date. 
The following table summarizes potential payments upon termination of employment or a change in control to each of the named executive officers employed on the last day of our most recently completed fiscal year. The amounts set forth in the table are based on the assumption that the triggering event occurred on the last business day of our last completed fiscal year and that our stock price was the closing market price per share on that date. In the case of stock options, the value of the acceleration was determined based on the difference between (i) the exercise price of the shares for which vesting was accelerated and (ii) $14.50, the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market on December 31, 2018, the last business day of 2018.

RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
Policies and Procedures for Approving Transactions with Related Persons 
Our Governance and Nominating Committee, in executing the responsibilities delegated to it, reviews, considers and approves, rejects or ratifies all related person transactions between Digimarc and our officers, directors, principal shareholders and affiliates. The Governance and Nominating Committee consists of independent, non-employee directors. The Governance and Nominating Committee has determined that, as a general rule, transactions between Digimarc and its officers, directors, principal shareholders and affiliates should be on terms no less favorable to us than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties. Digimarc maintains written policies governing these transactions. Our Audit Committee also routinely reviews any transactions with related persons. We employ Ryan James, the stepson of our Lead Director, as an associate counsel. In 2018, Mr. James received a base salary of $115,000 and was eligible to receive bonus, equity and employment benefits available to similarly situated employees, which, together with base salary, exceeded $120,000. The employment relationship with Mr. James is periodically reviewed by the Governance and Nominating Committee.  OTHER MATTERS 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our common stock to file initial reports of ownership and changes in their beneficial ownership of our common stock and other equity securities with the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market. Based solely on a review of reports that we received and on written representations from reporting persons regarding compliance, we believe that all Section 16(a) transactions were reported on a timely basis in 2018. 
Shareholder Proposals 
Requirements for Shareholder Proposals to be Brought Before an Annual Meeting. Pursuant to our Bylaws, for a shareholder nomination of persons for election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of other business to be considered by shareholders to be considered properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must have given timely notice of the proposal to the Secretary of Digimarc. To be timely for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a shareholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by our Secretary at our principal executive offices no earlier than December 31, 2019 and no later than January 30, 2020. 
Requirements for Shareholder Proposals to be Considered for Inclusion in our Proxy Materials. Shareholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and intended to be presented at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must be received by us not later than December 31, 2019 in order to be considered for inclusion in our proxy materials for that meeting. 
Discretionary Authority. The proxies to be solicited by us through our Board of Directors for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will confer discretionary authority on the proxy holders to vote on any shareholder proposal presented at the annual meeting if we fail to receive notice of the shareholder's proposal for the meeting by January 30, 2020. 
Single and Multiple Mailings
