NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
To Be Held on April 15, 2019 
February 28, 2019 
To the Stockholders of Global Net Lease, Inc.: 
I am pleased to invite our stockholders to the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders ("Annual Meeting") of Global Net Lease, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"). The Annual Meeting will be held on April 15, 2019 at The Core Club, located at 66 E. 55th Street, New York, NY 10022, commencing at 1:00 p.m. (local time). At the Annual Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon (1) the election of two members of the Board of Directors to serve until the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2022 Annual Meeting") and until their successors are duly elected and qualify, (2) the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, and (3) the transaction of such other matters as may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any postponement or adjournment thereof. Our Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on February 27, 2019 as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Record holders of shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
For further information regarding the matters to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting, I urge you to carefully read the accompanying proxy statement. The Company makes proxy materials available to our stockholders on the Internet. The Company is relying on Securities and Exchange Commission rules that allow us to furnish proxy materials to you via the Internet. Unless you have already requested to receive a printed set of proxy materials, you will receive a Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. This Notice contains instructions on how to access proxy materials and authorize a proxy to vote your shares via the Internet or, if you prefer, to request a printed set of proxy materials at no additional cost to you. 
You can access proxy materials at www.proxyvote.com/GNL. You also may authorize your proxy via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on that website. In order to authorize your proxy via the Internet or by telephone, you must have the stockholder identification number that appears on the materials sent to you. If you attend the Annual Meeting, you may vote in person if you wish, even if you previously have submitted your proxy. Your attendance alone, without voting, will not be sufficient to revoke a previously authorized proxy. 
You are cordially invited to attend the Annual Meeting. Regardless of whether you own a few or many shares and whether you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person or not, it is important that your shares be voted on matters that come before the Annual Meeting. Your vote is important. 
By Order of the Board of Directors, 
/s/ Christopher J. Masterson

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MEETING AND VOTING 
We are providing you with this Proxy Statement, which contains information about the items to be considered and voted on at the Annual Meeting. To make this information easier to understand, we have presented some of the information in a question-and-answer format. 
Q:
Why did you send me a Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials? 
​
A:
We have made this Proxy Statement, the Notice of Annual Meeting and our 2018 10-K available to you on the Internet or, upon your request, have delivered or will deliver printed versions of these proxy materials to you by mail because our Board of Directors is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. This Proxy Statement includes information that we are required to provide to you under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and is designed to assist you in voting. You can access this Proxy Statement and the other proxy materials at www.proxyvote.com/GNL. We are relying on Securities and Exchange Commission rules that allow us to furnish proxy materials to you via the Internet. You have received or will receive a Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. This Notice contains instructions on how to access proxy materials and authorize a proxy to vote your shares via the Internet or, if you prefer, to request a printed set of proxy materials at no additional cost to you. You may authorize your proxy via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on that website. 
​
Q:
Can I vote my shares by filling out and returning the Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials? 
​
A:
No. The Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials you received in the mail identifies the items to be voted on at the Annual Meeting, but you cannot vote by marking this Notice and returning it. This Notice will provide instructions on how to authorize your proxy by Internet or by telephone, by requesting and returning a paper proxy card, or by submitting a ballot in person at the meeting. 
​
Q:
What is a proxy? 
​
A:
A proxy is a person who votes the shares of stock of another person who could not attend a meeting. The term "proxy" also refers to the proxy card or other method of appointing a proxy. When you submit your proxy, you are appointing James P. Nelson and Christopher J. Masterson, each of whom are executive officers of the Company, as your proxies, and you are giving them permission to vote your shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), at the Annual Meeting. 
​
Q:
When is the Annual Meeting and where will it be held? 
​
A:
The Annual Meeting will be held on Monday, April 15, 2019, at 1:00 p.m. (local time) at The Core Club, located at 66 E. 55th Street, New York, NY 10022. 
​
Q:
What am I being asked to vote on at the Annual Meeting? 
​
A:
At the Annual Meeting, you will be asked to: 
​
 elect Lee M. Elman and P. Sue Perrotty as Class II directors to serve until our 2022 Annual Meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualify; 
​
 ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019; and 
​
 consider and act on such matters as may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any postponement or adjournment thereof. 
​
Q:
Who is entitled to vote? 
​
A:
Anyone who is a holder of record of Common Stock at the close of business on February 27, 2019 (the "record date"), or holds a valid proxy for the Annual Meeting, is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the Annual Meeting. Every stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held on the record date. 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q:
How many shares of Common Stock are outstanding? 
​
A:
As of the record date, 83,840,503 shares of our Common Stock were issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
​
Q:
What constitutes a "quorum"?
​
A:
If holders of a majority of our shares of our Common Stock outstanding on the record date are present at the Annual Meeting, either in person or by proxy, we will have a quorum present, permitting the conduct of business at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted to determine whether a quorum is present. 
​
Q:
What is a "broker non-vote"?
​
A:
A broker non-vote occurs when a broker, bank or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee is not authorized to vote or does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that matter and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. Brokers are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to the election of directors or for the approval of other matters which the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") determines to be "non-routine," without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. 
​
Q:
How does the Board of Directors recommend I vote on each proposal? 
​
A:
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the election of Lee M. Elman and P. Sue Perrotty as Class II directors and a vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of PwC. 
​
Q:
How do I vote? 
​
A:
Stockholders can vote in person at the meeting or by proxy. Stockholders have the following three options for submitting their votes by proxy: 
​
 via the Internet at www.proxyvote.com/GNL; 
​
 by telephone, for automated voting (800) 690-9603 at any time prior to 11:59 p.m. on April 14, 2019, and follow the instructions provided on the proxy card; or 
​
 if you requested a printed set of proxy materials, by mail, by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card. 
​
For those stockholders with Internet access, we encourage you to authorize a proxy to vote your shares via the Internet, since it is quick, convenient and provides a cost savings to us. When you authorize a proxy to vote your shares via the Internet or by telephone prior to the meeting date, your vote is recorded immediately and there is no risk that postal delays will cause your proxy authorization to arrive late and, therefore, not have your vote be counted. For further instructions on voting, see the Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. 
If you elect to attend the Annual Meeting, you can submit your vote in person, and any previous proxy that you authorized, whether by Internet, telephone or mail, will be superseded. If you return your signed proxy, your shares will be voted as you instruct, unless you give no instructions with respect to one or more of the proposals. In this case, unless you later instruct otherwise, your shares of Common Stock will be voted "FOR" the election of Lee M. Elman and P. Sue Perrotty as Class II directors and "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of PwC. With respect to any other proposals to be voted on, your shares of Common Stock will be voted in the discretion of Mr. Nelson and Mr. Masterson, or either of them. 
Q:
How do I vote if I hold my shares in "street name"?
​
A:
If your shares are held by your bank, broker or other nominee as your nominee (in "street name"), you should receive a proxy or voting instruction from the voting institution that holds your shares and follow the instructions included on that form regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares. If your broker holds your shares of Common Stock in street name, your broker will vote your 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
shares on "non-routine" proposals only if you provide instructions on how to vote by filling out the voter instruction form sent to you by your broker with this proxy statement. Of the proposals expected to come before the Annual Meeting, only ratification of the appointment of PwC is considered a routine matter. The proposal to elect directors is a "non-routine" matter, and, without your instruction, your broker cannot vote your shares on that proposal. 
If your shares are held in street name and you wish to attend the Annual Meeting and/or vote in person, you must bring your broker or bank voting instruction card and a proxy, executed in your favor, from the record holder of your shares. In addition, you must bring valid government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or a passport. 
Q:
What if I submit my proxy and then change my mind?
​
A:
You have the right to revoke your proxy at any time before the meeting by: 
​
 notifying Mr. Masterson, our Secretary, in writing; 
​
 attending the meeting and voting in person; 
​
 returning another proxy card dated after your first proxy card, if we receive it before the Annual Meeting date; or 
​
 authorizing a new proxy via the Internet or by telephone to vote your shares. 
​
Only the most recent proxy vote will be counted and all others will be discarded regardless of the method of voting. 
Q:
Will my vote make a difference? 
​
A:
Yes. Because we are a widely held company, YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT! Your immediate response will help avoid potential delays and may save us significant additional expenses associated with soliciting stockholder votes. 
​
Q:
What are the voting requirements to elect the Board of Director nominees? 
​
A:
There is no cumulative voting in the election of our directors. The election of each of our nominees for director requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of all of the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present, in person or by proxy. Each share may be voted for as many individuals as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted. For purposes of the election of directors, abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote, although they will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
​
Q:
What are the voting requirements to approve the proposal to ratify the appointment of PwC, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm?
​
A:
The proposal to ratify the appointment of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of all the votes cast on the proposal at a meeting at which a quorum is present. For purposes of ratification of the appointment of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote, although they will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
​
Q:
How will proxies be voted? 
​
A:
Shares of Common Stock represented by valid proxies will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the directions given. If the proxy card is signed and returned without any directions given, the shares will be voted "FOR" (1) the election of Lee M. Elman and P. Sue Perrotty as Class II 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
directors to serve until our 2022 Annual Meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualify, and (2) the ratification of the appointment of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
The Board of Directors does not intend to present, and has no information indicating that others will present, any business at the Annual Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof other than as set forth in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. However, if other matters requiring the vote of our stockholders properly come before the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy card to vote the proxies held by them in their discretion. 
Q:
How will voting on any other business be conducted? 
​
A:
Although we do not know of any business to be considered at the Annual Meeting other than the election of Lee M. Elman and P. Sue Perrotty as Class II directors and the ratification of the appointment of PwC, if any other business is properly presented at the Annual Meeting, a submitted proxy gives authority to Mr. Nelson and Mr. Masterson, and each of them, to vote on such matters in accordance with their discretion. 
​
Q:
When are the stockholder proposals for the next annual meeting of stockholders due? 
​
A:
Stockholders interested in nominating a person as a director or presenting any other business for consideration at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2020 Annual Meeting") may do so by following the procedures prescribed in our bylaws and, in the case of such other business, in Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). To be eligible for presentation to and action by the stockholders at the 2020 Annual Meeting under our current bylaws, director nominations and other stockholder proposals must be received by our secretary no earlier than October 8, 2019 and no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on November 7, 2019. Any proposal received after the applicable time in the previous sentence will be considered untimely. All proposals must contain the information specified in, and otherwise comply with, our bylaws. To be eligible for inclusion in our proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, stockholder proposals must be received by our secretary no later than November 7, 2019. Proposals should be sent via registered, certified or express mail to: Global Net Lease, Inc., 405 Park Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York, New York 10022, Attention: Christopher J. Masterson, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary. For additional information, see "Stockholder Proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting." 
​
Q:
Who pays the cost of this proxy solicitation? 
​
A:
We will pay all of the costs of soliciting these proxies. We have contracted with Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") to assist us in the distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of proxies. We expect to pay Broadridge aggregate fees of approximately $7,500 to distribute and solicit proxies plus other fees and expenses for other services related to this proxy solicitation, including the review of proxy materials; dissemination of brokers' search cards; distribution of proxy materials; operating online and telephone voting systems; and receipt of executed proxies. In compliance with the regulations of the SEC, we will also reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses to the extent they forward proxy and solicitation materials to our stockholders. Our directors and officers and employees of affiliates of our advisor, Global Net Lease Advisors, LLC (the "Advisor"), may also solicit proxies on our behalf in person, by telephone, facsimile or other means, for which they will not receive any additional compensation. 
​
Q:
Is this Proxy Statement the only way that proxies are being solicited? 
​
A:
No. In addition to mailing proxy solicitation material, our directors and officers and employees of Broadridge and affiliates of our Advisor may also solicit proxies in person, via the Internet, by telephone or by any other electronic means of communication we deem appropriate. 
​
Q:
Where can I find more information? 
​
A:
You may access, read and print copies of the proxy materials for this year's Annual Meeting, including this Proxy Statement, form of proxy card, and annual report to stockholders, at the following website: www.proxyvote.com/GNL. 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
You can request a paper or electronic copy of the proxy materials, free of charge: 
 via Internet, at www.proxyvote.com/GNL; 
​
 via telephone, at (800) 579-1639; or 
​
 via e-mail, at sendmaterial@proxyvote.com. 
​
We also file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy any reports, statements or other information we file with the SEC on the web site maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov. Our SEC filings also are available to the public at the SEC's Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549. You also may obtain copies of the documents at prescribed rates by writing to the Public Reference Section of the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information regarding the public reference facilities. 
Q:
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card? 
​
A:
Some of your shares of Common Stock may be registered differently or held in a different account. You should authorize a proxy to vote the shares in each of your accounts by mail, by telephone or via the Internet. If you mail proxy cards, please sign, date and return each proxy card to guarantee that all of your shares of Common Stock are voted. If you hold your shares in registered form and wish to combine your stockholder accounts in the future, you should call our Investor Relations department at (866) 902-0063. Combining accounts reduces excess printing and mailing costs, resulting in cost savings to us that benefit you as a stockholder. 
​
Q:
What if I receive only one set of proxy materials although there are multiple stockholders at my address? 
​
A:
The SEC has adopted a rule concerning the delivery of documents filed by us with the SEC, including proxy statements and annual reports. The rule allows us to send a single set of any annual report, proxy statement, proxy statement combined with a prospectus, notices or information statement to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if they share the same last name or we reasonably believe they are members of the same family. This procedure is referred to as "Householding." This rule benefits both you and us by reducing the volume of duplicate information received at your household and helps us reduce expenses. Each stockholder subject to Householding will continue to have a separate stockholder identification number and receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction card. 
​
We will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of our 2018 10-K, this Proxy Statement or Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy was previously delivered. If you received a single set of disclosure documents for this year, but you would prefer to receive your own copy, you may direct requests for separate copies by calling our Investor Relations department at (866) 902-0063 or by mailing a request to Global Net Lease, Inc., 405 Park Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York, New York 10022, Attention: Investor Relations. Likewise, if your household currently receives multiple copies of disclosure documents and you would like to receive one set, please contact us. 
Q:
Whom should I call with other questions? 
​
A:
If you have additional questions about this Proxy Statement or the Annual Meeting or would like additional copies of this Proxy Statement, our 2018 10-K or any documents relating to any of our future stockholder meetings, please contact: Global Net Lease, Inc., 405 Park Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York, New York, 10022, Attention: Investor Relations, Telephone: (866) 902-0063, E-mail: investorrelations@ar-global.com, website: www.globalnetlease.com.

​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
BOARD OF DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring and supervising the performance of our day-to-day operations and our Advisor. The Advisor is controlled by AR Capital Global Holdings, LLC, which is wholly owned by AR Global Investments, LLC ("AR Global"). In accordance with our charter, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors. Each director serves until the annual meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the year of his or her election and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. At the Annual Meeting, two Class II directors will be elected to serve until our 2022 Annual Meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualify. The number of directors in each class may be changed from time to time by the Board to reflect matters such as an increase or decrease in the number of directors so that each class, to the extent possible, will have the same number of directors. Our bylaws provide that the number of directors may not be less than one, which is the minimum number required by the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL"), nor more than 15. The number of directors on the Board is currently fixed at six, of which four are independent. 
Board of Directors and Executive Officers 
The table set forth below lists the names, ages and certain other information about Lee M. Elman and P. Sue Perrotty, our Class II directors with terms expiring at the Annual Meeting (who are also nominees for election as Class II directors at the Annual Meeting), for each of the continuing members of our Board and for each of our executive officers:

Leadership Structure of the Board of Directors 
Ms. Perrotty serves as non-executive chair of the Board. James L. Nelson serves as our chief executive officer and president and is also a member of the Board. As chief executive officer and president of the Company, the Advisor and the Property Manager, Mr. Nelson is responsible for our operations and business strategy. The Board believes that its leadership structure, which separates the non-executive chair and chief executive officer roles, is appropriate at this time in light of the Company's business and operating environment. This division of authority and responsibilities also allows our chief executive officer to focus his time on our daily operations. The Board of Directors may modify this structure to best address our circumstances for the benefit of its stockholders when appropriate. 
We believe that having a majority of independent, experienced directors, including having an independent director serve as our non-executive chair, provides the right leadership structure and corporate governance structure and is best for the Company at this time.

In evaluating directors to serve as members of each committee of the Board, the nominating and governance committee takes into account the applicable requirements for members of committees of boards of directors under the Exchange Act and NYSE rules, the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charter of the applicable committee and may take into account such other factors or criteria as the nominating and governance committee deems appropriate, including directors' personal and professional integrity, ethics and values; experience in corporate management, such as serving as an officer or former officer of a publicly held company, and a general understanding of marketing, finance and other elements relevant to the success of a publicly-traded company in today's business environment; experience in the Company's industry with relevant social policy concerns; academic expertise in an area of the Company's operations; practical and mature business judgment, including ability to make independent analytical inquiries; the nature of and time involved in a director's service on other boards or committees; and with respect to any person already serving as a director, the director's past attendance at meetings and participation in and contribution to the activities of the Board. The Board of Directors believes that diversity is an important attribute of the members who comprise our Board of Directors and that the members should represent an array of backgrounds and experiences. As a result of our commitment to diversity, we were recognized in 2018 as a "Winning Company" in the 2020 Women on Boards Gender Diversity Index for female representation on our Board of Directors.

COMPENSATION AND OTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS 
Compensation of Executive Officers 
Our Advisor performs our day-to-day management functions. Our current executive officers, James L. Nelson and Christopher J. Masterson, are employees of affiliates of the Advisor. Although we have one employee based in Europe, we neither compensate our executive officers, nor do we reimburse either our Advisor or our Property Manager for any compensation paid to individuals who also serve as our executive officers, or the executive officers of our Advisor, our Property Manager or any of their respective affiliates. As a result, we do not have, and our Board has not considered, a compensation policy or program for our executive officers and has not included in this Proxy Statement a "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," a report with respect to executive compensation, a non-binding stockholder advisory vote on compensation of executives, a non-binding stockholder advisory vote on the frequency of the stockholder vote on executive compensation or a ratio of the compensation of our chief executive officer to our median employee. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" for a discussion of fees and expense reimbursements payable to our Advisor and our Property Manager and their affiliates. 
Compensation of Directors 
We pay to each of our independent directors the fees described below. If a director is our employee or an employee of our Advisor or any of its affiliates, we do not pay compensation for services rendered as a director. All directors also receive reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attendance at meetings of our Board of Directors and its committees. 
We pay our independent directors a yearly retainer of   $100,000 and an additional yearly retainer of $105,000 for the non-executive chair, in each case payable 50% in cash and 50% in RSUs; $2,000 for each meeting of the Board or any committee personally attended by the directors ($2,500 for attendance by the chairperson of the audit committee at each meeting of the audit committee) and $1,500 for each meeting attended via telephone; $750 per transaction reviewed and voted upon electronically up to a maximum of  $2,250 for three or more transactions reviewed and voted upon per electronic vote. If there is a Board meeting and one or more committee meetings in one day, the director's fees may not exceed $2,500 ($3,000 for the chairperson of the audit committee if there is a meeting of such committee). 
We pay an additional total yearly retainer of  $30,000 for each member of the audit committee, the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee, in each case payable 50% in cash and 50% in RSUs. 
RSUs in respect of the portion of the annual retainer payable in RSUs are awarded in connection with each annual meeting and vest ratably over a three-year period beginning on such annual meeting date in increments of 1∕3 per annum. RSUs that were awarded as a one-time grant on June 2, 2015 in connection with the listing of shares of our Common Stock on the NYSE (the "Listing"), vest ratably over a five-year period beginning on the Listing date in increments of 1∕5 per annum. 
We also pay a fee to each independent director for each external seminar, conference, panel, forum or other industry-related event attended in person and in which the independent director actively participates, solely in his or her capacity as an independent director of the Company, in the following amounts: 
 $2,500 for each day of an external seminar, conference, panel, forum or other industry-related event that does not exceed four hours, or 
​
 $5,000 for each day of an external seminar, conference, panel, forum or other industry-related event that exceeds four hours. 
​
In either of the above cases, we will reimburse, to the extent not otherwise reimbursed, an independent director's reasonable expenses associated with attendance at such external seminar, conference, panel, forum or other industry-related event. An independent director cannot be paid or reimbursed for attendance at a single external seminar, conference, panel, forum or other industry-related event by us and another company for which he or she is a director.

Share-Based Compensation 
Stock Option Plan 
The Plan authorizes the grant of non-qualified stock options to the directors, officers, advisors, consultants and other personnel of the Company, the Advisor and the Property Manager and their affiliates, subject to the applicable limitations of the Plan. The exercise price for all stock options granted under the Plan will be equal to the closing price of a share of Common Stock on the last business day preceding the date of grant. A total of 500,000 shares have been authorized and reserved for issuance under the Plan. 
Restricted Share Plan 
Pursuant to the RSP, we may issue restricted shares and RSUs under specific award agreements to our directors, officers and employees (if we ever have employees), employees of the Advisor and its affiliates, employees of entities that provide services to us, directors of our Advisor or of entities that provide services to us, certain consultants to us and our Advisor and its affiliates or to entities that provide services to us. 
The total number of shares that may be issued under or subject to awards under the RSP is 10.0% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock on a fully diluted basis at any time. Restricted share awards entitle the recipient to receive shares of Common Stock from us under terms that provide for vesting over a specified period of time. Restricted shares may not, in general, be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions are removed and the shares have vested. Holders of restricted shares may receive cash distributions prior to the time that the restrictions on the restricted shares have lapsed. Any distributions to holders of restricted shares payable in shares of Common Stock are subject to the same restrictions as the underlying restricted shares. 
RSUs represent a contingent right to receive shares of Common Stock at a future settlement date, subject to satisfaction of applicable vesting conditions and/or other restrictions, as set forth in the RSP and an award agreement evidencing the grant of RSUs. RSUs may not, in general, be sold or otherwise  TABLE OF CONTENTS
transferred until restrictions are removed and the rights to the shares of Common Stock have vested. Holders of RSUs do not have or receive any voting rights with respect to the RSUs or any shares underlying any award of RSUs, but such holders are generally credited with dividend or other distribution equivalents which are subject to the same vesting conditions and/or other restrictions as the underlying RSUs and only paid at the time such RSUs are settled in shares of Common Stock. RSU award agreements generally provide for accelerated vesting of all unvested RSUs in connection with a termination without cause from the Board of Directors or a change of control and accelerated vesting of the portion of the unvested RSUs scheduled to vest in the year of the recipient's voluntary resignation from or failure to be re-elected to the Board of Directors.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
James L. Nelson, our chief executive officer and president, also is the chief executive officer and president of our Advisor and our Property Manager. Christopher J. Masterson, our chief financial officer, treasurer and secretary, is also the chief financial officer, treasurer and secretary of our Advisor and our Property Manager. 
AR Global indirectly owns 95% of the membership interests in the Advisor and all of the membership interests in the Property Manager. James L. Nelson, our chief executive officer and president, holds a non-controlling profit interest in the Advisor and Property Manager. Mr. Weil, one of our directors, is also the chief executive officer of AR Global and has a non-controlling interest in the parent of AR Global. 
On August 8, 2015, the Company entered into a service provider agreement with the Advisor and Moor Park Capital Partners LLP (the "Former Service Provider"), pursuant to which the Former Service Provider agreed to provide, subject to the Advisor's oversight, certain real estate related services, as well as sourcing and structuring of investment opportunities, performing due diligence, and arranging debt financing and equity investment syndicates, solely with respect to investments in Europe. On January 16, 2018, we notified the Former Service Provider that it was being terminated, and this termination became effective as of March 17, 2018. Additionally, as a result of our termination of the Former Service Provider, the property management and leasing agreement between the Property Manager and the Former Service Provider terminated by its own terms. 
Advisory Agreement 
We are externally managed by the Advisor pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement, dated June 2, 2015, among us, with the OP and the Advisor (the "Advisory Agreement''). During 2018, the Advisory Agreement was amended on August 14, 2018 (the "August Amendment") and November 6, 2018 (the "November Amendment"). These amendments only revise the provisions regarding the effective annual thresholds of Core AFFO Per Share (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) that we must satisfy for the Advisor to be paid Incentive Compensation (as defined in the Advisory Agreement). 
Under the Advisory Agreement, following the termination of the Former Service Provider, our Advisor and its affiliates continue to manage our affairs on a day to day basis (including management and leasing of our properties) and remain responsible for managing and providing other services with respect to our European investments. Our Advisor may engage one or more third parties to assist with these responsibilities, all subject to the terms of the Advisory Agreement. 
The Advisory Agreement requires us to pay a base management fee in a minimum fee amount (the "Minimum Base Management Fee") of  $18.0 million per annum, payable in cash on a pro rata monthly basis at the beginning of each month, plus a variable fee amount (the "Variable Base Management Fee" and, together with the Minimum Base Management Fee, the "Base Management Fee") equal to 1.25% of the cumulative net proceeds realized by us from the issuance of any common equity, including any common equity issued in exchange for or conversion of our preferred stock or exchangeable notes, as well as, from any other issuances of Common Stock, preferred stock (including our NYSE 7.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock), or other forms of our equity (including limited partnership units in the OP ("OP Units")). Additionally, we pay the Advisor an incentive fee ("Incentive Compensation''), payable 50% in cash and 50% in shares of Common Stock (subject to certain lock up restrictions). The Incentive Compensation is calculated on an annual basis at the end of the Company's fiscal year but is payable throughout the course of a year, in quarterly installments, subject to a final year-end adjustment. After the end of each fiscal year, the difference, if any, between the amount of the Incentive Compensation actually paid to the Advisor in the preceding year under the quarterly installments and the actual amount payable for the fiscal year will be either repaid by or paid to the Advisor, as applicable. Shares of Common Stock that were issued as a portion of any quarterly installment payment are retained and, for purposes of any repayment required to be made by the Advisor, have the value they had at the time of issuance and are adjusted in respect of any dividend or other distribution received prior to the time of repayment but not subsequent dividends or other distributions.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under the Advisory Agreement, prior to the August Amendment, the Incentive Compensation was equal to 15% of our Core AFFO (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) in excess of  $2.37 per share plus 10% of our Core AFFO in excess of   $3.08 per share. Under the Advisory Agreement, as amended by the August Amendment, the Incentive Fee Lower Hurdle (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) was decreased from $2.37 to (a) $2.15 for the 12 months ending June 30, 2019, and (b) $2.25 for the 12 months ending June 30, 2020, and the Incentive Fee Upper Hurdle (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) was decreased from $3.08 to (a) $2.79 for the 12 months ending June 30, 2019, and (b) $2.92 for the 12 months ending June 30, 2020. 
In addition, the August Amendment revised the provisions in the Advisory Agreement governing adjustments to these annual thresholds. The annual thresholds may, beginning with effect from July 1, 2020, be increased each year in the sole discretion of a majority of our independent directors (in their good faith reasonable judgment, after consultation with the Advisor), by a percentage equal to between 0% and 3% instead of 1% and 3%. In addition, in August 2023 and every five years thereafter, the Advisor will have a right to request that our independent directors reduce the then current Incentive Fee Lower Hurdle and Incentive Fee Upper Hurdle and make a determination whether any reduction in the annual thresholds is warranted. The amounts payable to the Advisor each year with respect to both the Base Management Fee, taken alone, and taken together with the Incentive Compensation are capped at certain thresholds based on the amount of the Company's assets under management by the Advisor, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. These caps were not applicable during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
We reimburse the Advisor or its affiliates for expenses of the Advisor and its affiliates incurred on our behalf, except for those expenses that are specifically the responsibility of the Advisor under the Advisory Agreement, such as fees and compensation paid to any third-party service providers engaged by the Advisor (including amounts payable to the Former Service Provider prior to its termination) and the Advisor's overhead expenses, rent and travel expenses, professional services fees incurred with respect to the Advisor for the operation of its business, insurance expenses (other than with respect to our directors and officers) and information technology expenses. We do not reimburse either our Advisor or our Property Manager for any compensation paid to individuals who also serve as our executive officers, or the executive officers of our Advisor, our Property Manager or any of their respective affiliates. In addition, these reimbursements are subject to the limitation that we will not reimburse the Advisor for any amount by which our operating expenses (including the asset management fee) at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceeds the greater of   (a) 2.0% of average invested assets and (b) 25.0% of net income. 
No later than April 30 of each year, our independent directors are required to determine, in good faith, whether the Advisor has satisfactorily achieved annual performance standards for the immediately preceding year based primarily on actions or inactions of the Advisor, and determine the annual performance standards for the next year. 
The Advisory Agreement has an initial term expiring June 1, 2035, with automatic renewals for consecutive five-year terms unless the Advisory Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms (1) with notice of an election not to renew at least 365 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term, (2) in connection with a change of control of us or the Advisor, (3) by the independent directors in connection with the or the Advisor's failure (based on a good faith determination by our independent directors) to meet annual performance standards for the year based primarily on actions or inactions of the Advisor, subject to notice and cure provisions, (4) with 60 days' notice by us with cause, subject in some circumstances to notice and cure provisions, or (5) with 60 days prior written notice by the Advisor for any material default of the Advisory Agreement by us, subject to notice and cure provisions. In the event of a termination in connection with a change of control of us or the Advisor's failure to meet annual performance standards, we would be required to pay a termination fee that could be up to 2.5 times the compensation paid to the Advisor in the previous year, plus expenses. 
The Company has also agreed under the Advisory Agreement to reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless each of the Advisor and its affiliates, and the directors, officers, employees, partners, members, stockholders, other equity holders, agents and representatives of the Advisor and its affiliates (each, a "Advisor Indemnified Party"), of and from any and all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims of any nature whatsoever (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in respect of or arising  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
from any acts or omissions of the Advisor Indemnified Party performed in good faith under the Advisory Agreement and not constituting bad faith, willful misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of duties on the part of the Advisor Indemnified Party. In addition, the Company has agreed to advance funds to an Advisor Indemnified Party for reasonable legal fees and other reasonable costs and expenses incurred as a result of any claim, suit, action or proceeding for which indemnification is being sought, subject to repayment if the Advisor Indemnified Party is later found pursuant to a final and non-appealable order or judgment to not be entitled to indemnification. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, we paid Minimum Base Management Fees equal to $18.0 million and Variable Base Management Fees equal to $4.7 million. With respect to the third quarter of 2018, the hurdles were met and the Advisor was paid $0.4 million in a quarterly installment of Incentive Compensation. Because, based on the calculation as of December 31, 2018, the hurdles had not been met and the Company recorded a reversal of  $0.4 million for Incentive Compensation previously recorded in the third quarter of 2018, and as a result, no Incentive Compensation was earned for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
In connection with any sale or similar transaction involving any investment, subject to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, we will pay the Advisor a fee in connection with net gain recognized by us in connection with the sale or transaction (the "Gain Fee") unless the proceeds of such transaction or series of transactions are reinvested in one or more investments within 180 days thereafter. The Gain Fee is equal to 15% of the amount by which the gains from the sale of investments in the applicable month exceed the losses from the sale of investments in that month unless the proceeds from such transaction or series of transactions are reinvested in one or more investments within 180 days thereafter. The Gain Fee is calculated at the end of each month and paid, to the extent due, with the next installment of the Base Management Fee. The Gain Fee is calculated by aggregating all of the gains and losses from the preceding month. There was no Gain Fee for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Multi-Year Outperformance Agreements 
We have awarded LTIP Units to the Advisor pursuant each of the 2015 OPP and the 2018 OPP, and both of these agreements were effective during the year ended December 31, 2018. Concurrent with the Listing, we entered into the 2015 OPP with the OP and the Advisor. The 2018 OPP was entered into in connection with the conclusion of the performance period under the 2015 OPP on June 2, 2018. Because no performance goals under the 2015 OPP were achieved during the performance period, no LTIP Units issued under the 2015 OPP were earned and all LTIP Units issued under the 2015 OPP were automatically forfeited without the payment of any consideration by the Company or the OP effective as of June 2, 2018. 
LTIP Units/Distributions/Redemption 
The rights of the Advisor as the holder of the LTIP Units (whether issued pursuant to the 2015 OPP or the 2018 OPP) are governed by the terms of the LTIP Units contained in the agreement of limited partnership of the OP. Until an LTIP Unit is earned in accordance with the provisions of the applicable out performance award agreement, the holder of the LTIP Unit will be entitled to distributions on the LTIP Unit equal to 10% of the distributions (other than distributions of sale proceeds) made on an OP Unit. Even if an LTIP Unit is ultimately forfeited because it is not earned, distributions paid with respect to an LTIP Unit are not be subject to forfeiture. After an LTIP Unit is earned, the holder will be entitled to a priority catch-up distribution per earned LTIP Unit equal to the accrued distributions on OP Units during the applicable performance period, less distributions already paid on the LTIP Unit during the performance period. As of the valuation date on the final day of the applicable performance period, the earned LTIP Units will become entitled to the same distributions as OP Units. At the time the Advisor's capital account with respect to an LTIP Unit is economically equivalent to the average capital account balance of an OP Unit, the LTIP Unit has been earned and it has been vested for 30 days, the Advisor, in its sole discretion, will be entitled to convert the LTIP Unit into an OP Unit in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of the OP. In accordance with, and subject to the terms of, the limited partnership agreement of the OP, OP Units may be redeemed on a one-for-one basis for, at the Company's election, shares of Common Stock or the cash equivalent thereof. 
The Company paid $0.3 million in distributions related to LTIP Units awarded under the 2015 OPP and $0.3 million in distributions related to LTIP Units awarded under the 2018 OPP during the year ended December 31, 2018.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
2018 OPP 
Based on a maximum award value of  $50.0 million and $19.57 (the "Initial Share Price"), the closing price of Common Stock on June 1, 2018, the trading day prior to the effective date of the 2018 OPP, the Advisor was issued a total of 2,554,930 LTIP Units (the "Award LTIP Units") pursuant to the 2018 OPP. The Award LTIP Units represent the maximum number of LTIP Units that could be earned by the Advisor based on the Company's total shareholder return ("TSR"), including both share price appreciation and Common Stock dividends, against the Initial Share Price over a performance period (the "Performance Period"), commencing on June 2, 2018 and ending on the earliest of  (i) June 2, 2021, (ii) the effective date of any Change of Control (as defined in the 2018 OPP) and (iii) the effective date of any termination of the Advisor's service as advisor of the Company. 
Half of the Award LTIP Units (the "Absolute TSR LTIP Units") will be eligible to be earned as of the last day of the Performance Period (the "Valuation Date") if the Company achieves an absolute TSR with respect to threshold, target and maximum performance goals for the Performance Period as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Performance Level (% of Absolute TSR LTIP Units Earned)  ​ ​  Absolute TSR   ​ ​  Number of Absolute TSR LTIP Units Earned   ​ 
Below Threshold ​ ​ ​ ​ —% ​ ​ ​  Less than 24%   ​ ​ ​ ​ — ​ ​ 
Threshold  ​ ​ ​ ​ 25% ​ ​ ​  24%   ​ ​ ​ ​ 319,366 ​ ​ 
Target  ​ ​ ​ ​ 50% ​ ​ ​  30%   ​ ​ ​ ​ 638,733 ​ ​ 
Maximum  ​ ​ ​ ​ 100% ​ ​ ​  36% or higher   ​ ​ ​ ​ 1,277,465 ​ ​ 
[END TABLE]
If the Company's absolute TSR is more than 24% but less than 30%, or more than 30% but less than 36%, the percentage of the Absolute TSR LTIP Units earned will be determined using linear interpolation as between those tiers, respectively. 
Half of the Award LTIP Units (the "Relative TSR LTIP Units") will be eligible to be earned as of the Valuation Date if the amount, expressed in terms of basis points (bps), whether positive or negative, by which the Company's absolute TSR on the Valuation Date exceeds the average TSR as of the Valuation Date of a peer group consisting of Lexington Realty Trust, W.P. Carey Inc. and (following an amendment to the 2018 OPP in February 2019 in light of the recently effective merger of Government Properties Income Trust and Select Income REIT, with Government Properties Income Trust being the surviving entity renamed Office Properties Income Trust) Office Properties Income Trust as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Performance Level (% of Relative TSR LTIP Units Earned)  ​ ​  Relative TSR Excess   ​ ​  Number of Absolute TSR LTIP Units Earned   ​ 
Below Threshold ​ ​ ​ ​ —% ​ ​ ​  Less than -600 basis points   ​ ​ ​ ​ — ​ ​ 
Threshold  ​ ​ ​ ​ 25% ​ ​ ​  -600 basis points   ​ ​ ​ ​ 319,366 ​ ​ 
Target  ​ ​ ​ ​ 50% ​ ​ ​  — basis points   ​ ​ ​ ​ 638,733 ​ ​ 
Maximum  ​ ​ ​ ​ 100% ​ ​ ​  +600 basis points   ​ ​ ​ ​ 1,277,465 ​ ​ 
[END TABLE]
If the relative TSR excess is more than -600 basis points but less than 0 basis points, or more than 0 basis points but less than +600 bps, the percentage of the Relative TSR LTIP Units earned will be determined using linear interpolation as between those tiers, respectively. 
If the Valuation Date is the effective date of a Change of Control or a termination of the Advisor for any reason (i.e., with or without cause), then calculations relating to the number of Award LTIP Units earned pursuant to the 2018 OPP will be performed based on actual performance as of  (and including) the effective date of the Change of Control or termination (as applicable) based on the performance through the last trading day prior to the effective date of the Change of Control or termination (as applicable), with the hurdles for calculating absolute TSR pro-rated to reflect that the Performance Period lasted less than three years but without pro-rating the number of Absolute TSR LTIP Units or Relative TSR LTIP Units the Advisor would be eligible to earn to reflect the shortened period.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
The award of LTIP Units under the 2018 OPP is administered by the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors, provided that any of the compensation committee's powers can be exercised instead by the board if the board so elects. Following the Valuation Date, the compensation committee is responsible for determining the number of Absolute TSR LTIP Units and Relative TSR LTIP Units earned, as calculated by an independent consultant engaged by the compensation committee and as approved by the compensation committee in its reasonable and good faith discretion. The compensation committee also must approve the transfer of any Absolute TSR LTIP Units and Relative TSR LTIP Units (or OP Units into which they may be converted in accordance with the terms of the agreement of limited partnership of the OP). 
LTIP Units earned as of the Valuation Date will also become vested as of the Valuation Date. Any LTIP Units that are not earned and vested after the Compensation Committee makes the required determination will automatically and without notice be forfeited without the payment of any consideration by the Company or the OP, effective as of the Valuation Date. 
The rights of the Advisor as the holder of the LTIP Units are governed by the terms of the LTIP Units contained in the agreement of limited partnership of the OP. The agreement of limited partnership of the OP was amended in July 2018 in connection with the execution of the 2018 OPP to reflect the issuance of LTIP Units thereunder and to make certain clarifying and ministerial revisions, but these amendments did not alter the terms of the LTIP Units established in connection with the Company's entry into the 2015 OPP in June 2015. 
During the third quarter of 2018, the OP made a distribution to the Advisor totaling approximately $0.1 million, representing the amount that would have been paid with respect to the Award LTIP Units after June 2, 2018, the effective date of the 2018 OPP but prior to July 19, 2018. 
2015 OPP 
In connection with the Listing, the Company entered into the 2015 OPP with the OP and the Advisor. Under the OPP, the Advisor was issued 3,013,933 LTIP Units in the OP with a maximum award value on the issuance date equal to 5.00% of the Company's market capitalization (the "OPP Cap"). 
Under the 2015 OPP, the Advisor was eligible to earn a number of LTIP Units with a value equal to a portion of the OPP Cap upon the first, second and third anniversaries of June 2, 2015, the date of the Listing, based on the Company's achievement of certain levels of absolute TSR and the amount by which the Company's absolute TSR exceeded the average TSR of a peer group, for the three-year performance period commencing on June 2, 2015; each 12-month period during the three years thereafter; and the initial 24-month period thereafter. 
One third of any earned LTIP Units were to vest, subject to the Advisor's continued service through each vesting date, on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of June 2, 2015. Because no performance goals under the 2015 OPP were achieved, no LTIP Units issued under the 2015 OPP were earned and all LTIP Units issued under the 2015 OPP were automatically forfeited without the payment of any consideration by the Company or the OP, effective as of June 2, 2018. 
Property Manager 
Pursuant to property management agreements with our Property Manager, the Property Manager provides property management and leasing services for properties owned by the Company, for which the Company pays fees equal to: (i) with respect to stand-alone, single-tenant net leased properties which are not part of a shopping center, 2.0% of gross revenues from the properties managed and (ii) with respect to all other types of properties, 4.0% of gross revenues from the properties managed. 
For services related to overseeing property management and leasing services provided by any person or entity that is not an affiliate of the Property Manager, the Company pays the Property Manager an oversight fee equal to 1.0% of gross revenues of the property managed. This oversight fee is no longer applicable to 12 of the Company's properties which became subject to a separate property management and leasing agreement with the Property Manager in October 2017 (the "12-Property PMLA") on otherwise identical terms to our then effective primary property and management leasing agreement (the "Primary PMLA"), which remained applicable to all other properties.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
In February 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the Primary PMLA, following which it continues to have a one-year term that is automatically extended for an unlimited number of successive one-year terms unless terminated by either party upon notice. Under the Primary PMLA prior to this amendment, either the Company or the Property Manager could terminate upon 60 days' written notice prior to end of the applicable term. Following this amendment, either the Company or the Property Manager may terminate the Primary PMLA at any time upon at least 12 months' prior written notice. The 12-Property PMLA was not similarly amended.
Solely with respect to the Company's investments in properties located in Europe, prior to the effectiveness of the termination of the Former Service Provider in March 2018, the Former Service Provider received, from the Property Manager, a portion of the fees payable to the Property Manager equal to: (i) with respect to single-tenant net leased properties which are not part of a shopping center, 1.75% of the gross revenues from such properties and (ii) with respect to all other types of properties, 3.5% of the gross revenues from such properties. The Property Manager was paid 0.25% of the gross revenues from European single-tenant net leased properties which are not part of a shopping center and 0.5% of the gross revenues from all other types of properties, reflecting a split of the oversight fee with the Former Service Provider. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, $5.0 million of property management fees and no oversight fees were incurred, and no property management fees were forgiven. 
Investment Allocation Agreement 
We are party to an investment opportunity allocation agreement with AFIN. Pursuant to the allocation agreement, each opportunity to acquire one or more domestic office or industrial properties will be presented first to us, and each opportunity to acquire one or more domestic retail or distribution properties will be presented first to AFIN, and will be presented to us only after AFIN has determined not to acquire the property. 
Indemnification Obligations 
We have entered into an indemnification agreement with each of our directors and officers, certain former directors and officers, the Advisor and certain of its affiliates, providing for indemnification and advancement of expenses to them in connection with claims or liability they may become subject to due to their service to us consistent with the provisions of our charter and Maryland law. Through the date of this Proxy Statement, we have reimbursed the Advisor for approximately $1.1 million with respect to litigation expenses incurred by the Advisor in connection with the litigation related to the termination of the Former Service Provider, and we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to similar expenses in the future.
Affiliated Transaction Best Practices Policy 
Pursuant to AR Global's affiliated transaction best practices policy, which was approved by our Board, we may not enter into any co-investments or any other business transaction with, or provide funding or make loans to, directly or indirectly, any investment program or other entity sponsored by the AR Global group of companies or otherwise controlled or sponsored, or in which ownership (other than certain minority interests) is held, directly or indirectly, by any of the individuals who share control of the AR Global group of companies, that is a non-traded REIT or private investment vehicle in which ownership interests are offered through securities broker-dealers in a public or private offering, except that we may enter into a joint investment with a Delaware statutory trust (a "DST") or a group of unaffiliated tenant in common owners ("TICs") in connection with a private retail securities offering by a DST or to TICs, provided that such investments are in the form of pari passu equity investments, are fully and promptly disclosed to our stockholders and will be fully documented among the parties with all the rights, duties and obligations assumed by the parties as are normally attendant to such an equity investment, and that we retain a controlling interest in the underlying investment, the transaction is approved by the independent directors of the Board after due and documented deliberation, including deliberation of any conflicts of interest, and such co-investment is deemed fair, both financially and otherwise. In the case of such co-investment, the Advisor will be permitted to charge fees at no more than the rate corresponding to our percentage co-investment and in line with the fees ordinarily attendant to such transaction. At any one time, our investment in such co-investments will not exceed 10% of the value of our portfolio.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Certain Conflict Resolution Procedures 
Every transaction that we enter into with our Advisor or its affiliates is subject to an inherent conflict of interest. Our Board of Directors may encounter conflicts of interest in enforcing our rights against any affiliate of our Advisor in the event of a default by or disagreement with an affiliate or in invoking powers, rights or options pursuant to any agreement between us and our Advisor or any of its affiliates. 
Our conflicts committee reviews and evaluates all transactions and conflict of interest situations involving our Advisor, AR Global, our directors, our officers and any of their respective affiliates, on the one hand, and us, on the other hand. Except with respect to the 2018 OPP and related matters, for which this function was performed by the compensation committee, the conflicts committee has determined that all our transactions with our Advisor, AR Global and their respective affiliates during the period commencing on January 1, 2018 and ending on the date of this Proxy Statement were fair to us, and in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders. All these related party transactions were approved in accordance with the applicable Company policies consistent with the charter of the conflicts committee, and there were no other related party transactions during that period. See "Board of Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance — Conflicts Committee." TABLE OF CONTENTS​

PROPOSAL NO. 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Board of Directors is currently composed of six members, of which four are independent directors. Our bylaws provide that the number of directors may not be less than one, which is the minimum number required by the MGCL, nor more than 15. In accordance with our charter, the Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors. At the Annual Meeting, two Class II directors will be elected to serve until our 2022 Annual Meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualify. Each director serves for a term of three years, until the annual meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the year of their election and until their successors are duly elected and qualify. The number of directors in each class may be changed from time to time by the Board to reflect matters such as an increase or decrease in the number of directors so that each class, to the extent possible, will have the same number of directors. 
The Board of Directors has nominated Lee M. Elman and P. Sue Perrotty as nominees for election as Class II directors at the Annual Meeting, to serve until our 2022 Annual Meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualify. Lee M. Elman and P. Sue Perrotty currently serve as Class II directors of the Company. 
The proxy holder named on the proxy card intends to vote "FOR" the election of Lee M. Elman and P. Sue Perrotty as Class II directors. The election of each of Lee M. Elman and P. Sue Perrotty requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of all the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, provided that a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect on the result of the vote, although they will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
We know of no reason why Lee M. Elman or P. Sue Perrotty will be unable to serve if elected. If, at the time of the Annual Meeting, Lee M. Elman or P. Sue Perrotty should become unable to serve, shares represented by proxies will be voted for any substitute nominee designated by the Board of Directors. No proxy will be voted "FOR" a greater number of persons than the number of nominees described in this Proxy Statement. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF LEE M. ELMAN AND P. SUE PERROTTY AS CLASS II DIRECTORS, TO SERVE, UNTIL THE COMPANY'S 2022 ANNUAL MEETING AND UNTIL THEIR SUCCESSORS ARE DULY ELECTED AND QUALIFY. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
PROPOSAL NO. 2 — RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The audit committee of the Board of Directors has selected and appointed PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019. PwC has audited our consolidated financial statements every year since the year ended December 31, 2014. PwC reports directly to our audit committee. 
Although ratification by stockholders is not required by law or by our charter or bylaws, our audit committee believes that submission of its selection to stockholders is a matter of good corporate governance. Even if the appointment is ratified, the audit committee, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if the audit committee believes that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company. If our stockholders do not ratify the appointment of PwC, the audit committee will take that fact into consideration, together with such other factors it deems relevant, in determining its next selection of an independent registered public accounting firm. 
A representative of PwC will attend the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Fees 
The aggregate fees billed (or expected to be billed) to us for professional services rendered by PwC, all of which have been approved by the audit committee, for and during the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, are as follows: 
Audit Fees 
Professional services relating to audits of our annual consolidated financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting, reviews of our quarterly SEC filings, issuance of a comfort letter and consents, income tax provision procedures, purchase price accounting procedures and review of proxy and other registration statements in connection with the merger, and other audit services related to a statutory audit requirement. Aggregate fees for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were approximately $1.6 million and $1.5 million respectively. 
Audit Related Fees 
Audit and other assurance related services relating to individual real estate properties that are required under local tax law. Aggregate fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were $84,400 and $37,000, respectively. 
Tax Fees 
There were no tax fees billed for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 
All Other Fees 
There were no other fees billed for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
In considering the nature of the services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, the audit committee determined that such services are compatible with the provision of independent audit services. The audit committee discussed these services with the independent registered public accounting firm and the Company's management to determine that they are permitted under the rules and regulations concerning auditor independence promulgated by the SEC to implement the related requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. All services rendered by PwC were pre-approved by the audit committee. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PWC AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of the Common Stock of the Company to file initial reports of ownership of such securities and reports of changes in ownership of such securities with the SEC. Such officers, directors and 10% stockholders of the Company are also required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
To our knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required during the year ended December 31, 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were timely satisfied. 
In making these statements, we have relied upon examination of the copies of Forms 3, 4, and 5, and amendments to these forms, provided to us and the written representations of our directors, executive officers, and ten percent stockholders. 
CODE OF ETHICS 
The Board of Directors adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics effective on February 17, 2016 (the "Code of Ethics"), which is applicable to the directors, officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Code of Ethics covers topics including, but not limited to, conflicts of interest, confidentiality of information, full and fair disclosure, reporting of violations and compliance with laws and regulations. 
The Code of Ethics is available on the Company's website at www.globalnetlease.com by clicking on "Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Code of Business Conduct and Ethics."

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2020 ANNUAL MEETING 
Stockholder Proposals in the Proxy Statement 
Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act addresses when a company must include a stockholder's proposal in its proxy statement and identify the proposal in its form of proxy when the Company holds an annual or special meeting of stockholders.
