DIAMOND HILL INVESTMENT GROUP, INC.
ANNUAL LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
March 14, 2019 
Dear Fellow Shareholders:
As active managers, we continue to face industry challenges including the ongoing shift toward passive investment management. Despite this trend, we believe in the critical role that active portfolio management plays in our capital markets-based economy, and we remain committed to valuing businesses and allocating capital to those that represent attractive investment opportunities. Our value proposition for clients is managing relatively concentrated, high conviction portfolios constructed independent of benchmark weights. We believe that Diamond Hill strategies will outperform their respective passive benchmarks over a full market cycle, supported by a shared commitment to our intrinsic value-based investment philosophy, long-term perspective, disciplined approach, and alignment with our clients' interests. 
Clearly, fee pressure within the active management industry is likely to persist as long as the majority of active managers continue to underperform passive alternatives. We believe clients are best served by a fee that is low enough to allow us to achieve meaningful outperformance relative to a passive alternative; yet at the same time, a fee that is high enough to allow us to build and maintain an investment team capable of achieving such results. The fee should also reflect a fair split of economics between the client and the investment manager. We periodically review our fees relative to our excess return goals, and we are committed to always maintaining proper alignment of interests with those of our clients.
Despite these challenges, we remain confident that we will add value over passive alternatives, net of fees, over long periods, and as of December 31, 2018, the since-inception net returns for most of our strategies exceeded their respective benchmark returns.
Financial Results: Shareholder Value
Diamond Hill Investment Group generated revenue of $145.6 million in 2018 compared with $145.2 million in 2017 and $81.4 million in 2013 (referencing our typical five-year time horizon). Assets under management finished the year at $19.1 billion, down 14% from 2017, reflecting the decline in U.S. equity markets in 2018 as well as net outflows from our strategies. Assets under management were up 57% from 2013. 
We generated net operating income of $71.3 million in 2018, an increase of 6% over 2017, and our operating margin rose in 2018 to 49% compared to 46% in 2017. Net operating income adjusted for gains/losses on deferred compensation plan investments was $69.1 million in 2018 compared to $69.4 million in 20171.  By far our largest expense is the compensation of our associates. Included in this line item is a significant amount of variable incentive compensation, which can fluctuate from year to year. A variety of factors influence incentive compensation including the investment results generated for our clients, individual employee contributions, and overall Company performance.
__________ 
1 Net operating income, as adjusted, is a non-GAAP performance measure. See Use of Supplemental Data as Non-GAAP Performance Measures included in Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Notably, we have increased shareholder value as measured by growth in tangible book value, dividends paid, and change in stock price. Over the past five years, Diamond Hill's tangible book value per share increased $42.09 per share and we paid $30 per share in special dividends. The dividends paid plus the increase in tangible book value per share equals $72.09 per share, which represents one measure of change in shareholder value. While tangible book value is a component of intrinsic value, the percentage of intrinsic value it represents varies considerably between companies.
This analysis is comparable to another popular measure, total shareholder return (TSR), which considers both cash returned to shareholders and change in stock price. For Diamond Hill, this equates to approximately 8.16% annualized over the past five years. A premise of our investment philosophy is that market price and intrinsic value often differ, sometimes substantially. Thus, we believe the most relevant measure of value creation, in addition to cash returned to shareholders, is the change in Diamond Hill's intrinsic value.
Capital Allocation
As active, intrinsic value investment managers, we evaluate managements' capital allocation decisions as a central part of our investment discipline in evaluating investment opportunities. We prefer to invest in companies that have proven to be good stewards of capital for shareholders, and we hold ourselves to the same standards. The Board of Directors, with input from management, carefully reviews future capital needs and the appropriate use of any excess capital on an annual basis and is focused on the optimal long-term use of capital. 
Historically, we have used excess capital to seed new strategies or invest in existing strategies to help them achieve critical mass. We have also paid special dividends to our shareholders, with 2018's $8.00 per share dividend marking the eleventh consecutive year with a special dividend. Last year, I wrote that a share repurchase program may be considered in the future, given the general increase in trading volume in our stock combined with our growing capital and liquidity position. In September 2018, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $50 million of Diamond Hill stock. As of February 28, 2019, we have repurchased approximately 84,000 shares at an aggregate price of $13.0 million. Importantly, we will only engage in share repurchases if we believe the current market price is below our estimate of the Company's intrinsic value. 
Succession Planning
Diamond Hill has continued to evolve since its founding in 2000, with our first five years squarely focused on becoming a financially viable company and the next five years focused on profitability. Once we established both viability and profitability, our focus shifted to long-term sustainability. Creating sustainability helps us to fulfill our fiduciary duty to clients while also providing a key component for continued growth. Succession planning is crucial to sustainability and one of the most important ongoing responsibilities of our management team and Board of Directors. As I wrote in my 2016 letter to shareholders, "We are always mindful that continuing to develop the next generation of leadership is a perpetual and most critical task."
Our first CEO succession was formalized when I was named President in 2014 and Chief Executive in 2016. Due to our continued growth in clients, investment strategies and associates, it has become increasingly clear to me and to the Board of Directors that the firm requires a CEO that can focus entirely on the various execution demands of our evolving organization. As many know, I have communicated over time that I believe my most important role at the firm is as a portfolio manager on our Long-Short strategy. My desire and my intention is to eventually return to this role full time. With these needs and preferences in mind, along with a continued long-term focus on managing our business, we have formed a sub-committee consisting of independent Board members and key associates to oversee CEO succession planning. We have also engaged a leading global executive search firm to assist the sub-committee in evaluating potential future CEO candidates. The sub-committee will consider both internal and external candidates and will focus on identifying an individual that is a strong cultural fit. Most importantly, this means a primary focus on candidates that share our core client-centric approach as well as our intrinsic value investment philosophy. Our primary objective is finding the right person and the right fit, and we have not placed a deadline on this process. However, we are diligently proceeding, and this step of succession planning is likely to be completed during 2019. 
Outlook
Ric Dillon will retire as Chairman of the Board at the conclusion of his current term which ends in conjunction with our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 1, 2019. I want to thank him for his leadership, first as Diamond Hill's CEO and then as Board Chairman. I am grateful for his vision and mentorship through the years. Ric gave us an outstanding legacy on which to build. Jim Laird will succeed Ric as Chairman of the Board. As many of you know, Jim was Diamond Hill's Chief Financial Officer and President of Diamond Hill Funds from 2001 to 2014 and has served as a Director since 2011. We are fortunate to have his experience and perspective. 
We remain focused on serving existing clients while developing investment strategies which may be utilized by new ones. Our fixed income efforts continue to gain traction with our newest strategies - Core Bond and Short Duration Total Return - approaching their critical three-year anniversaries this summer. We launched our first non-domestic strategy in January 2018, the Diamond Hill Global Fund, and we anticipate launching the Diamond Hill International Fund later this year. 
Although Diamond Hill continues to evolve as an organization, our core values are unchanged. We are a financially strong, well-positioned firm operating in a competitive industry, and I believe our greatest competitive advantage is our associates. Our ability to deliver excellent investment results, partner with clients that are clearly aligned with our investment philosophy and time horizon, and operate in an efficient manner is crucial to our success. The competitive nature of our industry also requires us to be flexible and adaptable. I am confident that we have an outstanding team of highly skilled individuals in place to help us plan for the future, achieve our long-term goals, and create value for all stakeholders. 
Sincerely,
Chris Bingaman

[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: If your shares are registered in more than one account, you will receive more than one proxy card. If you intend to vote by mail, please sign, date and return all proxy cards to ensure that all your shares are voted.  If you are a record holder and intend to vote by telephone or over the Internet, you must do so for each individual proxy card you receive.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Many shareholders are beneficial owners of our shares, meaning they hold their shares in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially.  
[END TABLE]
Shareholder of Record.  For shares registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered the shareholder of record and we are sending this Proxy Statement and related materials directly to you. As a shareholder of record, you have the right to vote in person at the Annual Meeting or you may grant your proxy directly to the Board's designees by completing, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card, or voting over the Internet or by phone.
Beneficial Owner.  For shares held in "street name," you are considered the beneficial owner and this Proxy Statement and related materials are being forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee, who is the shareholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares. Your broker or nominee will provide you with information on the procedures you must follow to instruct them how to vote your shares or how to revoke previously given voting instructions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my shares for me?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Your broker will vote your shares in the manner you instruct, and you should follow the voting instructions your broker has provided to you.  However, if you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, it may vote your shares in its discretion on certain "routine" matters.  The ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year is considered routine, and if you do not submit voting instructions, your broker may choose, in its discretion, to vote or not vote your shares on the ratification.  None of the other matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting are routine, and your broker may not vote your shares on those matters without your instructions. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: May I revoke my proxy or change my vote after I have mailed a proxy card or voted electronically over the Internet or by telephone?  
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Yes. You can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the Annual Meeting.  If you are the record holder of the shares, you can do this in three ways:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• send a written statement to Gary R. Young, our Secretary, stating that you would like to revoke your proxy, which must be received prior to the Annual Meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• send a newly signed and later-dated proxy card, which must be received prior to the Annual Meeting, or submit later-dated electronic voting instructions over the Internet or by telephone no later than 7:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Saving Time on April 30, 2019; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attend the Annual Meeting and either revoke your proxy in person prior to the start of voting at the Annual Meeting or vote in person at the Annual Meeting (attending the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy or a prior Internet or telephone vote).  
[END TABLE]
If you are a beneficial owner, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker or nominee.  You should review the instructions provided by your broker or nominee to determine the procedures you must follow.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Can I vote my shares in person at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: You may vote shares held of record in person at the Annual Meeting. If you choose to attend, please bring the enclosed proxy card and a form of identification.  If you are a beneficial owner and you wish to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person, you will need a signed proxy from your broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting and a form of identification.  To obtain directions to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person, please call Gary Young, Secretary, at (614) 255-3333 or visit the Company's website, https://www.diamond-hill.com/contact/. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How will my shares be voted if I submit a proxy without voting instructions?  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]

A: If you are a record holder and have more questions about how to submit your proxy, please call Gary Young, the Company's Secretary, at (614) 255-3333.  If you are a beneficial owner, you should contact your broker or other nominee to determine the procedures you must follow. 
[END TABLE]
PROCEDURAL MATTERS
Record Date 
Only our shareholders of record at the close of business on March 4, 2019, the record date, will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the record date, there were 3,506,417 of our common shares outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Annual Meeting. 
Proxy 
Your shares will be voted at the Annual Meeting as you direct on your signed proxy card or in your telephonic or Internet voting instructions.  If you submit a proxy card without voting instructions, it will be voted as recommended by the Board.  The Board's recommendations are set forth in this Proxy Statement.  The duly appointed proxy holders will vote in their discretion on any other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting. 
Voting
A shareholder may cast one vote for each outstanding share held by the shareholder on each separate matter of business properly brought before the Annual Meeting.  If you hold shares in street name, we encourage you to instruct your broker or other nominee as to how to vote your shares. 
Director elections.  Votes that shareholders cast "FOR" a director-nominee must exceed the votes that shareholders cast "AGAINST" a director-nominee for the individual to be elected.  Please also see the discussion of our "Majority Voting" provisions within Proposal 1. Table of Contents
Ratification of selection of KPMG.  The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares cast on the proposal is required to ratify the selection of KPMG as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019.
Advisory approval of named executive officer compensation.  The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares cast on the proposal is required for non-binding shareholder advisory approval of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers.
Effect of broker non-votes and abstentions.  Under the applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the rules of the exchanges and other self-regulatory organizations of which the brokers are members, brokers who hold common shares in street name for beneficial owners may sign and submit proxies and may vote our common shares on certain "routine" matters.  The ratification of KPMG is considered routine.  Under applicable stock exchange rules, brokers are not permitted to vote without instruction in the election of directors. In addition, SEC regulations prohibit brokers from voting without customer instruction on the approval of named executive officer compensation.  Proxies that are signed and submitted by brokers that have not been voted on certain matters are referred to as "broker non-votes." 
Neither broker non-votes nor abstentions will have any effect on the election of directors, the ratification of the appointment of KPMG or the advisory approval of named executive officer compensation. 
Quorum 
Business can be conducted at the Annual Meeting only if a quorum, consisting of at least the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares entitled to vote, is present, either in person or by proxy.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted toward establishing a quorum.  If a quorum is not present at the time the Annual Meeting is convened, a majority of the shares represented in person or by proxy may adjourn the Annual Meeting to a later date and time, without notice other than announcement at the Annual Meeting.  At any such adjournment of the Annual Meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the Annual Meeting as originally called. 
Solicitation; Expenses
We will pay all expenses of the Board's solicitation of the proxies for the Annual Meeting, including the cost of preparing, assembling and mailing the Notice, form of proxy and Proxy Statement, postage for return envelopes, the handling and expenses for tabulation of proxies received, and charges of brokerage houses and other institutions, nominees or fiduciaries for forwarding such documents to beneficial owners.  We will not pay any electronic access charges associated with Internet or telephonic voting incurred by a shareholder.  We may solicit proxies in person or by telephone, facsimile or e-mail.  Our officers, directors and employees may also assist with solicitation, but will receive no additional compensation for doing so. 
No person is authorized to give any information or to make any representation not contained in this Proxy Statement, and you should not rely on any such information or representation. This Proxy Statement does not constitute the solicitation of a proxy in any jurisdiction from any person to whom it is unlawful to make such proxy solicitation in such jurisdiction.

Our Corporate Governance Guidelines prohibit shares granted to our directors as compensation from being sold while the director remains on the Board, except for sales of shares in an amount necessary to pay taxes due upon vesting.  Therefore, we expect each non-employee director to hold for his or her entire term of service on the Board all of the shares granted to the director as compensation. Table of Contents
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Nominating and Governance Committee has general oversight responsibility for assessment and recruitment of new director candidates, as well as evaluation of director and board performance and oversight of our governance matters.  The Nominating and Governance Committee has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines and reviews them annually.  The most current version of the Guidelines is available on our website, ir.diamond-hill.com, under "Corporate Governance" on the right hand side of the site. 
Board Leadership and Composition
The Chairman approves Board agendas and schedules, chairs all executive sessions of the directors, acts as the liaison between the directors and management, is available to the Secretary to discuss and, as necessary, respond to shareholder communications to the Board, and calls meetings of the directors.
Mr. Laird serves as Lead Independent Director.  The responsibilities of the Lead Independent Director include all of the duties of Chairman when the Chairman is not present.  The Lead Independent Director also chairs all executive sessions of the independent directors.
Currently, six of our seven directors who have been nominated for re-election at the Annual Meeting, qualify as independent under NASDAQ standards.  Mr. Dillon who has not been nominated for re-election is not independent.  In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Compensation Committee are all comprised entirely of independent directors.  Overall, we believe that our Board structure is designed to foster critical oversight, good governance practices, and the interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
Among other things, the Corporate Governance Guidelines address term limits of each non-executive director.  Although we have a 10 year service limit for non-employee directors, the Guidelines authorize the Board to make exceptions to this limitation and permit directors to serve for an additional year.  The Corporate Governance Guidelines also permit the Chair to serve longer than 10 years if he or she has not served in that role for five consecutive years.  The Board has not made such an exception to the term limits for non-executive directors during the last five years.
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board's role in our risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports from members of senior management on areas of material risk to the Company, including client investment results, operational, financial, legal, regulatory and strategic risks. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing risks relating to our accounting matters, financial reporting and legal and regulatory compliance. To satisfy these oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee meets regularly with management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.  The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing risks relating to employment policies and our compensation and benefits programs. To satisfy these oversight responsibilities, the Compensation Committee meets regularly with management to understand the implications of compensation decisions, particularly the risks that our compensation policies pose to our finances and our relationship with employees.
Director Orientation and Continuing Education and Development 
When a new non-executive director joins the Board, the Company provides a formal orientation program to provide the new director with an understanding of our operations and financial condition. In addition, each director is expected to maintain the necessary level of expertise to perform his or her responsibilities as a director.  To assist the directors in maintaining such level of expertise, we may, from time to time, offer continuing education programs in addition to briefings during Board meetings relating to the competitive and industry environment in which the Company operates and the Company's goals and strategies.
Director Qualifications and the Nominations Process 
The Nominating and Governance Committee believes that the nominees presented in this Proxy Statement currently constitute, and would continue to constitute, a Board with an appropriate level and diversity of experience, education, skills, and independence.  The Nominating and Governance Committee routinely considers the current composition of the Board and whether changes should be made or additional directors should be added.  Table of Contents
The Nominating and Governance Committee supervises the nomination process for directors.  It considers the performance, independence, background, experience, gender and other forms of diversity, as well as other characteristics of our incumbent directors, including their willingness to serve, and any change in their employment or other circumstances in considering their nomination each year.  We do not have any formal policy regarding diversity in identifying nominees for a directorship, but rather we consider it among the various factors relevant to any particular nominee and the overall needs of the Board.  In the event that a vacancy exists or the Company decides to increase the size of the Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee will identify, interview, examine, and make recommendations to the Board regarding appropriate candidates.
The Nominating and Governance Committee identifies potential candidates principally through suggestions from our directors and senior management.  The committee may also seek candidates through informal discussions with third parties. We have not historically retained search firms to help identify director candidates and did not do so in identifying this year's nominees or our recently appointed directors.
In evaluating potential candidates, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers, among other factors, independence from management, experience, expertise, commitment, diversity, number of other public company board and related committee seats held, potential conflicts of interest, and the composition of the Board at the time of the assessment.  Additionally, all potential nominees must: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• demonstrate strong character and integrity;  
• have sufficient time to carry out their duties;  
• have experience at senior levels in areas of expertise helpful to the Company and consistent with the objective of having a diverse and well-rounded Board; and  
• have the willingness and commitment to assume the responsibilities required of a director of the Company.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, candidates expected to serve on the various Board committees must meet applicable independence and financial literacy qualifications required by NASDAQ, the SEC, and other applicable laws and regulations.  The evaluation process of potential candidates also includes personal interviews and discussions with appropriate references.  Once the Nominating and Governance Committee has selected a candidate, it recommends the candidate to the full Board for election if a vacancy occurs or is created by an increase in the size of the Board during the course of the year, or for nomination if the director is to be first elected by our shareholders.  All of our directors serve for one-year terms and must stand for reelection annually.
The Nominating and Governance Committee does not currently have any specific policies regarding the consideration of director candidates recommended by shareholders due to a historical absence of shareholder recommendations.  In the event of such a recommendation, the Nominating and Governance Committee would consider the recommendation using the process and criteria set forth above.  In the future, the Nominating and Governance Committee may in its discretion adopt policies regarding the consideration of director candidates recommended by shareholders. Shareholder recommendations for Board candidates must be directed in writing to the Company at 325 John H. McConnell Boulevard, Suite 200, Columbus, Ohio 43215, Attention: Secretary, and must include the candidate's name, home and business contact information, detailed biographical data and qualifications, information regarding any relationships between the candidate and the Company within the last three years, and evidence of the recommending person's ownership of our common shares.
Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions
The Board recognizes that related person transactions present a heightened risk of conflicts of interest.  The Company has no written policy with respect to related party transactions, because in the last 10 years we have only had one related party transaction to consider.  The Audit Committee will review any potential related person transactions as they arise and are reported to the Board or the Audit Committee, regardless of whether the transactions are reportable pursuant to Item 404.  For any related person transaction to be consummated or to continue, the Audit Committee must approve or ratify the transaction.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
The members of the Compensation Committee during 2018 were Mr. Fortener, Mr. Laird, Mr. Reeder, and Mr. Shoup.  No director who served on the Compensation Committee during 2018 currently is, or during 2018 was, an officer, employee or former officer of the Company, and none of them has or had any relationship during 2018 requiring disclosure by us under Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K.  During 2018, none of our executive officers served as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any other company that has an executive officer serving as a member of our Board or Compensation Committee.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
In our Compensation Discussion and Analysis, we:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• describe our compensation program objectives and how compensation for our named executive officers is determined; and 
• explain the tables and disclosures that follow. 
[END TABLE]
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis presents compensation information for the following individuals (each, a "named executive officer"):
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Christopher M. Bingaman, who served as our CEO and President in 2018; 
• Thomas E. Line, who served as our CFO and Treasurer in 2018; and 
• Lisa M. Wesolek, who served as our COO until April 30, 2018. 
[END TABLE]
Background
We are in the investment management industry.  Human capital is the most important resource of companies in our industry.  Attracting and retaining employees can be more difficult in our industry than in others because of how heavily our industry depends on the contributions of talented individuals.  We have been able to attract and retain high-quality employees due to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our investment-centric culture; 
• employee ownership in our business; 
• our central Ohio location; and 
• the nationally-competitive compensation and benefits we offer to our employees. 
[END TABLE]
Compensation, which is a critical element in a business dependent on talented employees, has a particularly significant impact on profitability in industries like ours that are not capital intensive.  Achieving profitability in our industry while retaining high-quality talent requires a balancing of the economics between our operating profit margin and rewarding the employees who generate our profits and produce investment results for our clients.  As of March 4, 2019, the record date for the Annual Meeting,  Table of Contents our employees and directors owned approximately 20.8% of the Company.  In contrast, many competitor firms are owned entirely by their employees and many publicly-traded asset managers are far less employee-owned. Despite our unique ownership structure given our industry, we believe that industry norms are helpful benchmarks for evaluating this balancing of economics.
At our 2018 Annual Meeting, our shareholders voted upon an advisory resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, which was approved by 98% of the votes cast on the matter.  The Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee") believes that the results of the advisory vote on executive compensation support our previous compensation practices and  the Committee's overall judgment related to our compensation practices.  The Committee considered that endorsement in establishing the compensation of our executive officers for 2018.  
Compensation Program Objectives
We seek to attract and retain people with integrity, intelligence and energy.  All of our employees are paid a competitive base salary, provided with competitive benefits and participate in an annual cash and equity incentive compensation program.  The amount of individual incentive awards is based on an assessment of individual performance, while the amount of the overall available incentive pool is based on (i) investment results in client portfolios, (ii), overall firm operating results, (iii) general market compensation data, and (iv) our profitability compared to other investment management firms.  
In addition to annual incentive compensation, upon commencing employment with the Company, all employees are generally granted equity awards as an incentive to their continued employment.  Generally, these awards cliff vest after five years of employment to promote employee retention and long-term employee ownership.  We also seek to increase employee ownership because we believe such ownership encourages employees to act and think like owners.  While compensation amounts differ depending upon position, responsibilities, performance and competitive data, we seek to reward all employees with similar compensation components based on these objectives.
Rewards Based on Performance
Our primary business objective is to meet our fiduciary duty to clients.  Specifically, our focus is on long-term, five-year investment returns, with goals defined as rolling five-year periods in which client returns are sufficiently above relevant passive benchmarks, rank in the top quartile of similar investment strategies, and exceed a sufficient absolute return for the risk associated with the asset class.  As it relates to our investment professionals, their compensation program is designed to reward performance that supports these objectives.  The compensation program varies for those employees who are not a part of our investment team, but is based on rewarding individual performance that helps us meet our fiduciary duty to clients.  We seek to fulfill our fiduciary duty to shareholders by managing the firm and its assets to increase shareholder value over time.  Over the past five years, our annualized total shareholder return was 8.2% compared to a 4.4% return for the Russell 2000 Index.
Compensation Setting Process
Role of the Compensation Committee.  The Committee has the overall responsibility for evaluating and approving the structure, operation and effectiveness of our compensation plans, policies and programs for all employees. Each member of the Committee is a "non-employee director" for purposes of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and meets NASDAQ independence requirements.  The Committee is specifically charged to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• review and approve the corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the CEO, to evaluate the CEO's performance in light of these goals and objectives, and, based on this evaluation, make recommendations to the Board for the independent directors to approve the CEO's compensation level (including any long-term incentive or other compensation under any incentive-based or equity-based compensation plan); 
• review management's recommendations and make recommendations to the Board with respect to director and other non-CEO executive officer compensation;  
• retain compensation consultants as it deems necessary to assist in its evaluation of director, CEO or other senior executive compensation programs or arrangements; 
• obtain advice and assistance as it deems necessary from internal or external legal, accounting or other advisors; 
• review management's recommendations and make recommendations to the Board with respect to incentive-based compensation and equity-based compensation plans and programs that are subject to Board approval, and that may be applicable to all or any portion of the employees of the Company and/or its subsidiaries; and 
• exercise all power and authority of the Board in the administration of equity-based incentive compensation plans. 
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
The Committee considers the sum of all pay elements when reviewing annual compensation recommendations for the named executive officers.  Although the framework for compensation decision-making is tied to the Company's overall financial performance and the creation of long-term shareholder value, the Committee retains the discretion to approve individual compensation based on other performance factors, such as demonstrated management and leadership capabilities and the achievement of certain investment results for client accounts and other strategic operating results.
Role of Management.  The Company's CEO evaluates the CFO as part of our annual review process and makes recommendations to the Committee regarding all elements of compensation paid to him.  Changes in compensation proposed by the CEO are based on the individual's performance, the compensation of individuals with comparable responsibilities in competing or similar organizations, and the profitability of the Company.  At the Committee's request, management attends Committee meetings to provide general employee compensation and other information to the Committee, including information regarding the design, implementation and administration of our compensation plans.  The Committee also meets in executive sessions without the presence of any executive officer whose compensation the Committee is scheduled to discuss.
Use of Compensation Consultants and Surveys in Determining Executive Compensation.  The Committee's charter gives it the authority to retain an independent outside executive compensation consulting firm to assist in evaluating policies and practices regarding executive compensation and provide objective advice regarding the competitive landscape.  Historically, however, the Committee has not engaged compensation consultants, and did not do so in 2017 or 2018.
Each year the Committee obtains and summarizes an asset management industry pay analysis prepared by McLagan, a compensation specialist focusing on the asset management industry.  The companies in the McLagan analysis include approximately 150 public and private asset management companies with which we compete.  This analysis provides the Committee with a general overview of compensation trends in the asset management industry.  The Committee does not define a specific peer group, but rather takes a broad view of the analysis, including the types and amounts of compensation paid generally by the companies surveyed.  The Committee does not set any compensation elements or levels based on targeting a certain percentile from the survey, but rather sets compensation that it believes to be both competitive and based on the executive's value to the Company.  The survey is just one of many factors that the Committee considers when determining executive compensation.  Management and the Committee believe this broad view of the analysis is appropriate because we compete with both public and private asset management firms regardless of their size and scope of operations.
Elements of Compensation
Base Salary.  Base salaries for our named executive officers are intended to provide a fixed level of cash compensation that is appropriate given the executive's role in the organization.  Generally, base salaries are determined by (i) scope of responsibility and complexity of position, (ii) performance history, (iii) tenure of service, (iv) internal equity within the Company's salary structure, and (v) relative salaries of persons holding similar positions at other companies within the investment management industry.  Base salaries are designed to compensate knowledge and experience.  Consistent with our desire to have the majority of total compensation paid to named executive officers at risk in the form of incentive compensation, a significant majority of total compensation of our executive officers was paid in the form of either cash bonuses and/or long-term equity grants.
Annual Cash Bonuses. The Committee awarded a discretionary cash bonus to Mr. Bingaman, to reward him for his strong performance and overall contributions to the Company in fiscal year 2018.  The Committee believes a discretionary cash bonus provided the Committee with the flexibility to consider all aspects of Mr. Bingaman's performance and contributions to the Company as CEO, President and Portfolio Manager.  In determining the amount of Mr. Bingaman's cash bonus, the Committee considered the Company's overall operating results for 2018, the investment results in client portfolios, client service, overall contributions to the investment team, and broad market compensation data.
The Committee awarded a discretionary cash bonus to Mr. Line to reward him for his strong performance and overall contributions to the Company in fiscal year 2018.   The Committee believes that a discretionary cash bonus provided the Committee with the flexibility to consider all aspects of Mr. Line's performance and contributions to the Company which, for a CFO and Treasurer, may not be as directly tied to our operating income.  In determining the amount of Mr. Line's cash bonus, the Committee considered the Company's overall operating results for 2018, contributions by Mr. Line that were not reflected in our operating results, and broad market compensation data.
2015 Restricted Stock Unit Award to Mr. Bingaman.  In October 2015, the Committee awarded 13,000 shares of performance-based restricted stock units ("PRSUs") to Mr. Bingaman pursuant to the Company's 2014 Plan covering the performance period of January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017.  The grant called for 6,500 PRSUs to vest  on each of January 1, 2017 and  Table of Contents
January 1, 2018, respectively, if the Company's annual operating profit for each calendar year period (defined as the Company's total revenue during each calendar year period excluding any investment income and gains, less the Company's total operating expenses during such period and any investment losses and all taxes) exceeded $40,000,000.  If the Company's annual operating profit during in either calendar year period was less than $40,000,000, a reduced number of PRSUs would vest on January 1st of 2017 or 2018, respectively, according to a schedule that scaled down from 6,500 PRSUs at $40,000,000 in operating profit to zero PRSUs at or below $0 in operating profit. Any PRSUs that did not vest would be forfeited.  The performance conditions for both 2016 and 2017 were met.  The first 6,500 PRSUs vested in full on January 1, 2017. The Company accelerated the vesting of the second 6,500 PRSUs from January 1, 2018 to December 26, 2017 in order to take a tax deduction for the compensation during 2017.  All vested PRSUs settled in shares of the Company's common stock on a 1-for-1 basis and are subject to restrictions on sale or transfer for five years following the vesting date.  This PRSU award comprised all of Mr. Bingaman's equity-based compensation for 2016 and 2017.
2018 Restricted Share Award to Mr. Bingaman. On February 21, 2018, the Committee awarded 12,000 restricted shares of the Company to Mr. Bingaman pursuant to the Company's 2014 Plan.  The Committee believes this award strongly aligns the long-term interests of Mr. Bingaman with those of the Company and its shareholders.  This long-term equity award is intended to represent a portion of Mr. Bingaman's total compensation for the five year period 2018 through 2022.  Subject to Mr. Bingaman's continued employment with the Company, the restricted shares will vest on January 1, 2023.  
2018 Annual Stock award to Mr. Bingaman. The Committee awarded a discretionary stock bonus of $1,000,000 to Mr. Bingaman, to reward him for his strong performance and overall contributions to the Company in fiscal year 2018.  Similar to the cash bonus awarded to Mr. Bingaman, the Committee believes a discretionary stock bonus provides the Committee with the flexibility to consider all aspects of Mr. Bingaman's performance and contributions to the Company as CEO, President and Portfolio Manager.  In determining the amount of Mr. Bingaman's stock bonus, the Committee considered the Company's overall operating results for 2018, the investment results in client portfolios, client service, overall contributions to the investment team, and broad market compensation data.  The shares awarded in this stock bonus are fully vested, but are restricted from sale until February  2024.
2014 Restricted Stock Unit Award to Mr. Line.  In connection with his initial employment with the Company, in December 2014,  the Committee awarded 15,000 restricted stock units ("RSUs") to Mr. Line pursuant to the Company's 2014 Plan as long-term incentive compensation.  This award is subject to time-based vesting with 3,000 of these RSUs vesting on each April 1st from 2015 through 2019.  The remaining 3,000 of the RSUs will vest on April 1, 2019.  Each RSU that vests is settled in the Company's common shares on a 1-for-1 basis.  Upon vesting, the resulting shares are subject to restrictions on sale or transfer for an additional five years from each respective vesting date.  The Committee believes this compensation structure strongly aligns the long-term interests of Mr. Line with those of the Company and its shareholders.  This RSU award is intended to comprise all of Mr. Line's equity-based compensation for 2014 through 2018. 
Retirement Plan Benefits.  We provide retirement benefits to our named executive officers through the 401(k) Plan.  Each named executive officer is entitled to participate in the 401(k) Plan on the same terms and conditions as all other employees.  The 401(k) Plan does not involve any guaranteed minimum or above-market returns, as plan returns depend on actual investment results.
Deferred Compensation Plans.  We have two Deferred Compensation Plans: the Diamond Hill Fixed Term Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Fixed Term Plan") and the Diamond Hill Variable Term Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Variable Term Plan") (each individually, a "Plan", and collectively the "Deferred Compensation Plans").  Each named executive officer is eligible to participate in one of the Plans, along with certain other employees of the Company.  The terms and conditions of the Plans are described in more detail under the heading "Pension Plans and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" below.  
Other Benefits and Perquisites.  We do not provide supplemental retirement plan benefits to our named executive officers.  As a general rule, we do not provide any perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers that are not offered on an equal basis to all other employees.  Our named executive officers are entitled to participate in benefit programs that entitle them to the same medical, dental, and short-term and long-term disability insurance coverage that are available to all employees.   Table of Contents
Post-Employment Payments. No named executive officer has an employment contract or severance arrangement, and we do not provide any post-employment payments to our named executive officers, other than pursuant to our 401(k) Plan and Deferred Compensation Plans. 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code
Prior to December 22, 2017, when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA") was signed into law, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallowed a tax deduction to publicly held companies for compensation paid to certain "covered employees" in excess of $1 million per covered employee in any year, except to the extent that the compensation in excess of the limit qualified as performance-based. 
Under the TCJA, the performance-based exception has been repealed and the $1 million deduction limit now applies to (1) anyone serving as the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer at any time during the taxable year, (2) the top three other highest compensated executive officers serving at the end of the taxable year, and (3) any individual who had been a covered employee for any taxable year of the Company that started after December 31, 2016.  However, the new rules do not apply to remuneration provided pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 that is not modified in any material respect after that date.  Because of ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of this transition relief, no assurance can be given that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption from Section 162(m) will avoid the deduction limit.  We believe that the amount of compensation paid to our executive officers that can be deducted will decrease compared to prior years.
The Board of Directors has not adopted a formal policy regarding tax deductibility of compensation paid to our executive officers.   While the Board and the Committee consider the potential tax deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code in establishing compensation for named executive officers, the Board and the Committee require the flexibility to consider additional factors in making compensation decisions in order to best fulfill the objectives of the Company's compensation program.  Accordingly, the Committee may authorize, compensation that might not be deductible, and may modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from Section 162(m), if it determines that such compensation decisions are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Risks Related to Compensation Policies and Practices 
As part of its oversight of our executive and non-executive compensation programs, the Committee considers how our current compensation programs, including the incentives created by compensation awards, affect the Company's risk profile.  In addition, the Committee reviews our compensation policies, and particularly the incentives that they create, to determine whether they encourage an appropriate level of risk-taking and do not present a significant risk to the Company.  The Committee also considered the following risk mitigating factors:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our current compensation programs reward portfolio managers and research analysts on trailing five-year investment performance in client accounts; 
• a significant portion of incentive compensation is in the form of long-term equity-based awards; 
• the sale restriction periods on equity-based compensation awards encourage executives and other employees to focus on the long-term performance of the Company; 
• the Committee's discretionary authority to adjust annual incentive awards; 
• the Company's internal controls over financial reporting and other financial, operational and compliance policies and practices; and 
• the consistency of base salaries with executives' responsibilities so that they are not motivated to take excessive risks to achieve a reasonable level of financial security. 
[END TABLE]
Based on this review, the Committee has concluded that our compensation policies and procedures are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  
Compensation Recoupment and Restitution Policy
Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Board has adopted a compensation recoupment and restitution policy that applies to all incentive compensation received by all employees, including our named executive officers.  Under the policy, we may recover all or a portion of incentive compensation (or pay out additional incentive compensation) related to awards made after the adoption of the policy, in three general situations: Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if, due to error or malfeasance, the previously determined incentive pool, or an individual award, is either too large (or too small), then any overpayment made to an employee may, in the sole discretion of the Committee and the Board, be returned to the Company or an additional payment may be made to an employee; 
• if an employee engages in fraud or misconduct that contributes to the need for a financial restatement, or violates any law or regulation or any policy or procedure of the Company, then we may, in the sole discretion of the Committee and the Board, recoup all or a portion of the employee's incentive compensation; and  
• if the Committee determines that the Company's previously issued financial statements are restated as a result of error, omission, fraud or non-compliance with financial reporting requirements, then we may recoup, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee and the Board, all or a portion of the employee's incentive compensation. 
[END TABLE]
The policy is intended to provide enhanced safeguards against certain types of employee misconduct and provide enhanced protection to, and alignment with, shareholders.  These provisions are in addition to any policies or recovery rights that are provided under applicable laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

The Board adopted stock ownership guidelines for our named executive officers to further align their interests with those of our shareholders.  The below table provides the target ownership level reflected in the guidelines and actual shares owned as of December 31, 2018.

Pension Plans and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation  
We do not maintain any pension plans for named executive officers or other employees.  We offer to our named executive officers and certain other employees the opportunity to participate in two Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans:  the Fixed Term Plan and the Variable Term Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plans"). 
Deferrals of Incentive Compensation.
Pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plans, participants may elect to defer up to 50% of the stock portion of their annual incentive compensation and up to 100% of the cash portion of their annual incentive compensation for a plan year (the calendar year).  Generally, the participant must submit a deferral election by December 31 of the year before the services are to be performed.  After the applicable deadline, a deferral election is irrevocable for that plan year except under circumstances set forth in the Deferred Compensation Plan.
None of the named executive officers contributed to the Deferred Compensation Plans, and none had a balance under such plans as of December 31, 2018. 
Employment Agreements and Change in Control Benefits
None of our named executive officers is party to an employment agreement with the Company, and there are no agreements with such persons providing for change in control benefits or other post-employment compensation.  Ms. Wesolek retired from the Company effective December 31, 2018. In connection with her departure she entered into an agreement that provided for certain payments, all of which have been made and are disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table and other related table in this Proxy Statement. There are no continuing obligations or payments remaining.

PROPOSAL 2 — RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements. To carry out this responsibility, the Committee engages in an evaluation of the independent auditor's qualifications, performance, and independence.  The Committee also periodically considers whether the independent registered public accounting firm should be rotated and the advisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent registered public accounting firm.
The Audit Committee has reappointed KPMG LLP ("KPMG") to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. KPMG was first appointed to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm on October 24, 2012. 
The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the continued retention of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders, and we are asking our shareholders to ratify the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019, and may or may not make any changes to such appointment.
Representatives of KPMG are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement, if they so desire, and respond to appropriate questions from shareholders.
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019. 
If Proposal 2 is not approved, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.

Preapproval by Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures which set forth the manner in which the committee will review and approve all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm (the "Services") to ensure that the provision of the Services does not impair the firm's independence.  The pre-approval policies and procedures are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee has established a pre-approval fee cap of $25,000, under which any Services in excess of the $25,000 fee cap must be submitted to the Audit Committee for review and pre-approval, and any Services less than the $25,000 fee cap must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer and then reported to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
• Pre-approval actions taken during Audit Committee meetings are recorded in the minutes of the meetings.

Audit Committee Report
During 2018, the Audit Committee was comprised of four independent directors operating under a written charter adopted by the Board, the most current version of which is available on our website, ir.diamond-hill.com, under "Corporate Governance" on the right hand side of the site.  Annually, the Audit Committee engages the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.  KPMG served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Management is responsible for preparation of the Company's financial statements and for designing and maintaining the Company's systems of internal controls and financial reporting processes.  The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and issuing reports on the Company's financial statements and the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.  The Audit Committee's responsibility is to provide independent, objective oversight of these processes. 
Pursuant to this responsibility, the Audit Committee met and held discussions with management and KPMG regarding the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  The Audit Committee reviewed the audit plan and scope with KPMG and discussed with KPMG the matters required by the PCAOB Auditing Standard 16, as amended, – Communications with the Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee also met with KPMG without management present to discuss the results of their audit work, their evaluation of the Company's system of internal controls and the quality of the Company's financial reporting. 
The Committee also discussed with KPMG its independence from management and the Company, and received its written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the audit committee concerning independence.
Management has represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.  Based on the Audit Committee's discussions with management and KPMG and its review of KPMG's report to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board has approved) that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC.

PROPOSAL 3 - ADVISORY VOTE ON THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
As described in the section entitled, "EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND COMPENSATION INFORMATION," we believe that executive compensation should be linked with the Company's performance and significantly aligned with the interests of the Company's shareholders. In addition, our executive compensation program is designed to allow us to retain, and recognize the contributions of, employees who play a significant role in our current and future success. We urge you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure for a detailed description of the fiscal year 2018 compensation of our named executive officers. 
The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the advisory vote relates to the overall compensation of our named executive officers.  This vote is advisory and therefore not binding on the Company. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and will take into account the outcome of the vote when determining future compensation for the Company's named executive officers. 
Accordingly, we ask our shareholders to vote on the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure." 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ADVISORY APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE RULES OF THE SEC.   Table of Contents
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Given the Company's relatively small size, our limited number of record shareholders, and the Board's consistent practice of being open to receiving direct communications from shareholders, the Board believes that it is not necessary to implement, and we do not have, a formal process for shareholders to send communications to the Board.  Our practice is to forward any communication addressed to the full Board to the Chairman; to a group of directors, to a member of the group; or to an individual director, to that person. 
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2020 ANNUAL MEETING
Shareholders are entitled to submit proposals on matters appropriate for shareholder action consistent with SEC rules and our Code of Regulations (the "Regulations").  Should a shareholder wish to have a proposal appear in the proxy statement for next year's annual meeting, under applicable SEC rules, the proposal must be received by the Company's Secretary on or before November 11, 2019, and must otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act.  The Company will not be required to include in its proxy statement a shareholder proposal that is received after that date or that otherwise fails to meet the requirements for shareholder proposals established by applicable SEC rules.
Our Regulations govern the submission of director nominations and other business proposals that a shareholder wishes to have considered at an annual meeting of shareholders, but which are not included in our proxy statement for that meeting. Under our Regulations, director nominations or other business proposals to be addressed at our next annual meeting may be made by a shareholder entitled to vote who has delivered a notice to the Secretary of the Company not later than the close of business on December 11, 2019 and not earlier than November 11, 2019. To be eligible for consideration at an annual meeting of shareholders, a shareholder's proposal and notice thereof must otherwise comply with the procedures and requirements of our Regulations. 
These advance notice provisions in our Regulations are in addition to, and separate from, the requirements that a shareholder must meet in order to have a proposal included in the proxy statement under the rules of the SEC. A proxy granted by a shareholder will give discretionary authority to the proxies to vote on any matters introduced pursuant to the above advance notice provisions in our Regulations, subject to applicable SEC rules. A copy of our Regulations may be obtained from the Secretary of the Company, Gary R. Young, at 325 John H. McConnell Boulevard, Suite 200, Columbus, Ohio 43215 or by phone at (614) 255-3333.
SHAREHOLDERS SHARING THE SAME ADDRESS
The SEC has implemented rules regarding the delivery of proxy materials (i.e., annual reports, proxy statements, proxy statements combined with a prospectus or any information statements provided to shareholders) to households. This method of delivery, often referred to as "householding," generally permits the Company to send a single annual report and a single proxy statement to any household at which two or more different shareholders reside if the Company believes such shareholders are members of the same family, unless the shareholder(s) have opted out of the householding process.  Each shareholder would continue to receive a separate notice of any meeting of shareholders and proxy card. The householding procedure reduces the volume of duplicate information you receive and reduces expenses. The Company has instituted householding.  If (i) you wish to receive separate annual reports or proxy statements, either this year or in the future, or (ii) members of your household receive multiple copies of the annual report and proxy statement and you wish to request householding, you may contact the Company's transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company at 17 Battery Place, New York, New York 10004,  or by phone  at (212) 509-4000, or write to Mr. Gary Young, Secretary, at 325 John H. McConnell Boulevard, Suite 200, Columbus, Ohio 43215, or by phone at (614) 255-3333.
In addition, many brokerage firms and other holders of record have instituted householding. If your family has one or more "street name" accounts under which our shares are beneficially owned, you may have received householding information from your broker, financial institution or other nominee in the past. Please contact the holder of record directly if you have questions, require additional copies of this Proxy Statement or Annual Report on Form 10-K or wish to revoke your decision to household and thereby receive multiple copies. You should also contact the holder of record if you wish to institute householding. These options are available to you at any time. Table of Contents
