BLUE BIRD CORPORATION
PROXY STATEMENT
Unless otherwise indicated, or the context otherwise requires, "Company", "Blue Bird", "we", "our" or "us" refers to Blue Bird Corporation and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Company's principal executive offices are located at 3920 Arkwright Road, Suite 200, Macon, Georgia 31210.
This proxy statement (this "Proxy Statement") is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by Blue Bird's Board of Directors (the "Board") on behalf of the Company, for use at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of the Company's common stock, $0.0001 par value (the "Common Stock") to be held on Tuesday, March 5, 2019 at the hour of 9:00 a.m. (local time), at the Macon Marriott City Center, 240 Coliseum Drive, Macon, GA 31217, and at all postponements or adjournments thereof, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying notice of the Annual Meeting (tahe "Notice of Meeting").
In accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we mailed the Notice of Meeting and this accompanying Proxy Statement on or about February 1, 2019 to our stockholders of record (the "Stockholders") as of the close of business on January 17, 2019 (the "Record Date"). We also provided access to our proxy materials over the Internet beginning on that date. If you would like to receive an additional printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in this Proxy Statement.
RECORD DATE; PROXIES; VOTING
Who Can Vote; Votes Per Share
The Board has set January 17, 2019 as the Record Date for determining voter eligibility. At the Meeting, each Stockholder of record of Common Stock at the close of business on the Record Date will be entitled to vote on all matters proposed to come before the Annual Meeting. Each such Stockholder of record will be entitled to one (1) vote per share of Common Stock on each matter submitted to a vote of the Stockholders, as long as those shares are represented at the Meeting, either in person or by proxy. As of the Record Date, there were 26,387,360 shares of Common Stock outstanding.
How to Vote; Submitting Your Proxy; Revoking Your Proxy
You may vote your shares either by voting in person at the Annual Meeting, by submitting a completed form of proxy in the manner described in this Proxy Statement, or by telephone or via the Internet. By submitting your form of proxy, you are legally authorizing another person to vote your shares. The persons specified on the enclosed form of proxy are officers of the Company.
If you plan to attend the meeting and vote in person, we will provide a ballot to you when you arrive; however, if your shares are not registered in your name but in the "street name" of a bank, broker or other holder of record (a "nominee"), then your name will not appear in Blue Bird's record of stockholders, and you are considered a "Beneficial Holder". Those shares are held in your nominee's name, on your behalf, and your nominee will be entitled to vote your shares. If you are a Beneficial Holder, please refer to the information from your bank, broker or other nominee on how to submit voting instructions, which includes the deadlines for submission of voting instructions. Beneficial Holders may vote shares held in street name at the Annual Meeting only if they obtain a signed proxy from the record holder (bank, broker or other nominee) giving the Beneficial Holder the right to vote the shares.
Your proxy is revocable. A Beneficial Holder that has given instructions to its nominee with respect to the voting of its Common Stock may instruct the nominee to thereafter revoke the relevant proxy in accordance with the instructions provided to the Beneficial Holder by its bank, broker or other nominee. A registered Stockholder that has  submitted a form of proxy may revoke the proxy: (i) by completing, signing and submitting a form of proxy bearing a later date; (ii) by notifying Mr. Paul Yousif, the Company's Secretary, by telephone at (478) 822-2801, by email at paul.yousif@blue-bird.com, or in writing to Mr. Paul Yousif, Secretary, c/o Blue Bird Corporation, 3920 Arkwright Road, Suite 200, Macon, Georgia 31210, before the Annual Meeting that you have revoked your proxy, or (iii) you may attend the Annual Meeting, revoke your proxy and vote in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not itself be deemed to revoke your proxy unless you give notice at the meeting that you intend to revoke your proxy and vote in person as described above.
Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we encourage you to vote in advance so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting. Voting your proxy by the Internet, telephone or mail will not limit your right to vote at the Annual Meeting if you later decide to attend in person, subject to compliance with the foregoing requirements.
How Your Proxy Will be Voted; Discretionary Authority of Proxies
The persons named in the accompanying form of proxy will vote the shares of Common Stock in respect of which they are appointed in accordance with the instructions of the Stockholder as indicated in the form of proxy. In the absence of such specification, such Common Stock will be voted at the Annual Meeting as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the election of each of the director nominees as directors of the Company for a term of three (3) years, and until their successors are elected and qualified. 
[END TABLE]
The persons named in the accompanying form of proxy are conferred with discretionary authority to vote the shares of Common Stock in respect of which they are appointed on any amendments to or variations of matters identified in the Notice of Meeting and Proxy Statement and on any other matters that are properly brought up at the Annual Meeting. In addition, a Stockholder will confer discretionary authority to the proxy holder in respect of one or more of the items of business identified on the proxy form if the Stockholder properly completes and delivers the proxy but leaves blank the voting selection for that item on the form. In the event that amendments or variations to matters identified in the Notice of Meeting and Proxy Statement, or other matters are properly brought up at the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons designated in the enclosed proxy card to vote in accordance with their discretion and judgment on such matter or business. At the time of printing the Proxy Statement, the members of the Board knew of no such amendments, variations or other matters.
Quorum; Votes Necessary to Approve the Proposal
Pursuant to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting is established if holders of a majority in voting power of the Company's Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, are present in person or represented by proxy. For purposes of determining a quorum in accordance with Delaware law, abstentions and broker "non-votes" present in person or by proxy are counted as represented. However, abstentions and broker "non-votes" will not be counted as votes cast and will not affect the voting results for the election of directors. A broker "non-vote" occurs when a nominee (such as a broker) holding shares for a Beneficial Holder abstains from voting on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power for that proposal and has not received instructions from the Beneficial Holder on how to vote those shares. Under current NASDAQ Global Market ("Nasdaq") rules, your broker will not have discretion to vote your uninstructed shares with respect to the election of directors.
The proposal being considered and voted on at the Annual Meeting is subject to the following standard for approval:  Proposal 1 - To elect directors, a plurality of the votes cast is required.
Electronic Availability
In compliance with the proxy rules promulgated by the SEC, our Proxy Statement and 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders are available over the Internet at https://www.cstproxy.com/blue-bird/2019, a website established specifically for access to such materials. Such materials are also available on the Company's website at www.blue-bird.com.
Cost of Solicitation of Proxies; Tabulation of Votes
The Company will bear the cost of soliciting proxies on behalf of the Company. Our directors, officers and employees may also solicit proxies in person or by telephone, electronic transmission and facsimile transmission. We will not be specially compensating our directors, officers and employees for those services, but they may be reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation. We will also reimburse brokers, fiduciaries and custodians for their costs in forwarding proxy materials to Beneficial Holders of our Common Stock.
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
The following table sets forth information known to us regarding beneficial ownership of shares of our Company's Common Stock on January 3, 2019 by:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS
Classified Board of Directors
Our board of directors is classified into three classes, each comprising as nearly as possible one-third of the directors to serve three-year terms. Messrs. Bedi, Penn and Schumacher have been elected or appointed to a class (Class I) that will serve until our 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Messrs. Galbato and Hennessy have been elected or appointed to serve in a class (Class II) that will serve until our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Messrs. Grimm, Horlock and Wentzell have been elected or appointed to serve in a class (Class III) that will serve until our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement in connection with the change in control transaction in June 2016, whereby ASP BB Holdings LLC then became our majority shareholder, Messrs. Penn and Sand were elected to the Board of Directors.  
Director Independence
Nasdaq listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent unless we are a "controlled company". An "independent director" is defined under the Nasdaq rules generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company's board of directors, would interfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
Our Board has determined that each of our directors, other than Mr. Horlock, is an "independent director" as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.
Shareholder Communications with the Board of Directors
Our corporate governance guidelines provide that our Chairman and our Chief Executive Officer are responsible for establishing effective communications with our stockholders. Our Board has implemented a process for stockholders to send communications to our Board and to specific individual directors.
Stockholders who wish to communicate directly with our board of directors, or any individual director, should direct questions in writing to our Corporate Secretary, Blue Bird Corporation, 3920 Arkwright Road, Suite 200, Macon, Georgia 31210. The mailing envelope must contain a clear notation indicating that the enclosed letter is a "Board Communication" or "Director Communication". All such letters must identify the author and clearly state whether the intended recipients are all members of the Board or just certain specified individual directors. The Corporate Secretary will make copies of all such letters and circulate them to the appropriate director or directors.
The Company's "whistleblower" policy prohibits the Company or any of its employees from retaliating or taking any adverse action against anyone for raising a concern. If a shareholder or employee nonetheless prefers to raise his or her concern in a confidential or anonymous manner, the concern may be directed to the Audit Committee Chairman at the Company's headquarters or by telephone at 1-866-766-1953.
Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight
The Board does not have a lead independent director. Kevin Penn is our Chairman of the Board and Daniel J. Hennessy is our Vice Chairman of the Board. Although we do not have a formal policy regarding the separation of the CEO and Chairman of the Board positions, at this time those positions are held by two separate individuals, Mr. Horlock and Mr. Penn.
The Board does not have a formal risk management committee, but administers this oversight function through various standing committees of the Board. The Audit Committee maintains responsibility for oversight of financial  reporting-related risks, including those related to our accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices. The Audit Committee also review reports and considers any material allegations regarding potential violations of our Company's Code of Ethics. The Compensation Committee oversees risks arising from our compensation policies and programs. This Committee also has responsibility for evaluating and approving our executive compensation and benefit plans, policies and programs. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee oversees and reviews enterprise risk management assessments.
Annual Meeting Attendance
The Board encourages all of its members to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All director nominees and all continuing directors are encouraged to be personally present or to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders by teleconference. All directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting either in person or by teleconference.
Board Meetings
The Board held nine (9) meetings during fiscal 2018. The Board has three (3) standing committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, each as further described below. Each standing committee has the right to retain its own legal and other advisors.
All directors attended 75% or more of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of the Board (held during the period for which each has been a director); and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which each served (during the periods that they served) during our fiscal year ended September 29, 2018. 
Committees of the Board of Directors
The standing committees of our Board currently consist of an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.
Audit Committee
Our Audit Committee consists of Messrs. Bedi, Grimm, Hennessy, and Schumacher, with Mr. Schumacher serving as the Chairman of the Audit Committee. We believe that each of these individuals qualifies as an independent director according to the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq with respect to audit committee membership. The Board has determined that Mr. Schumacher qualifies as our "audit committee financial expert," as such term is defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K, and that each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate.
Our Board has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, which is available on our corporate website at www.blue-bird.com. The Audit Committee reviews and assesses the adequacy of its charter annually. The Audit Committee met five (5) times in fiscal 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]

The Compensation Committee charter also provides that the Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. Before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the Compensation Committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by the SEC and Nasdaq.
In March 2015, the Compensation Committee retained Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC to provide advice to the Compensation Committee, as requested from time to time, in connection with matters pertaining to executive and director compensation.  The scope of the engagement pursuant to the engagement letter includes general guidance on executive and director compensation matters, advice on the Company's executive pay philosophy and compensation peer group, advice on the design of incentive plan and other compensation programs, the provision of comprehensive competitive market studies and market data, and updates on best practices and changes in the regulatory or corporate governance environment. The Compensation Committee had no material interactions with Meridian Compensation Partners in fiscal years 2017 or 2018.
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee
Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee consists of Messrs. Galbato, Hennessy and Penn, with Mr. Galbato serving as the Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. If elected, Ms. Shaw will also serve on the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.  We believe that each of these individuals qualifies as an independent director according to Nasdaq requirements.
Our Board has adopted a written charter for the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, which is available on our corporate website at www.blue-bird.com. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews and assesses the adequacy of its charter annually. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee met four (4) times in fiscal 2018.

Such evaluation shall be made without regard to race, religion, gender, ancestry, national origin or disability. 
Shareholder Nominations
Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider candidates for the Board recommended by stockholders. To recommend director candidates, stockholders must follow all rules of the SEC and the Company's bylaws. Below is a summary of the requirements contained in our bylaws:
Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as directors of the Company.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions
Our board of directors has adopted a written related person transaction policy that sets forth the policies and procedures for the review and approval or ratification of related person transactions. Our policy requires that a "related person" (as defined in paragraph (a) of Item 404 of Regulation S-K) must promptly disclose to our general counsel any "related person transaction" (defined as any transaction that is reportable by us under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K in which we are or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest) and all material facts with respect thereto. The general counsel will promptly communicate such information to our Audit Committee or another independent body of our Board. No related person transaction will be entered into without the approval or ratification of our Audit Committee or another independent body of our Board. It is our policy that directors interested in a related person transaction will recuse themselves from any such vote. Our policy does not specify the standards to be applied by our Audit Committee or another independent body of our Board in determining whether or not to approve or ratify a related person transaction, although such determinations will be made in accordance with Delaware law.
Related Person Transactions
There were no related person transactions in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2018.

Phil Horlock is our principal executive officer.

(1)  In fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, Messrs. Horlock, Tighe and Roberts were granted restricted stock units and option awards under the 2015 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. These awards vest in three annual tranches, if at all, over a period of three years and are contingent upon the achievement of the performance targets set annually under the Management Incentive Plan ("MIP"), which plan is described below under "MIP."  The amounts in these columns are the aggregate grant date fair values of each respective award at the highest level of performance condition attainable, computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ("ASC Topic 718").  Fiscal 2018 reflects the first and second tranches of the awards and fiscal 2017 reflects the first tranche of the awards with respect to which the performance criteria is known. Refer to Note 14, Share Based Compensation, included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on December 10, 2018 for the relevant assumptions used to determine the valuation of our equity awards.

We maintain an annual performance-based cash bonus plan which rewards our executive officers for our achievement of specific financial targets. Cash awards are made after the end of each fiscal year (after receipt of the audited financial statements) based on the achievement of MIP Adjusted EBITDA targets, Adjusted Free Cash Flow targets, or net cash or net debt improvement targets, which are set at the beginning of such fiscal year. "MIP Adjusted EBITDA" means net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to add back nonrecurring charges such as (i) significant product design changes; (ii) transaction related costs; or (iii) discrete expenses related to major cost cutting initiatives.  "Adjusted Free Cash Flow" means net cash provided in continuing operations less cash paid for fixed assets, acquired intangible assets and adjusted to add back nonrecurring charges such as (i) significant product design changes; (ii) transaction related costs; or (iii) discrete expenses related to major cost cutting initiatives. The Compensation Committee approves the financial performance targets under the MIP on an annual basis, and has sole discretion to make adjustments to the performance targets. For fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, the Compensation Committee established target bonuses for Mr. Horlock as 150% of his salary and for each of Messrs. Tighe and Roberts as 100% of his salary.  Awards under the MIP for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 performance are based 75% on Blue Bird's MIP Adjusted EBITDA and 25% on Blue Bird's Adjusted Free Cash Flow. 
The tables below reflect the scale for fiscal 2018:

After the financial results for the preceding fiscal year are available, the Compensation Committee meets in order to determine the bonuses to be granted under the MIP for the preceding fiscal year's performance. In addition to reviewing whether the established financial targets are met, the Compensation Committee has sole discretion to adjust the actual award amounts based on such other criteria as the Compensation Committee deems relevant. MIP awards based on fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 performance and reflected in the Summary Compensation Table were paid in December 2018 and 2017, upon the completion of Blue Bird's audited financial statements for the applicable year. 
Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan
In fiscal 2015, we adopted the Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"). The Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Under the Incentive Plan, the Committee may grant an aggregate of 3,700,000 shares of common stock in the form of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, incentive bonus awards, other cash-based awards and other stock-based awards. The exercise price of a share subject to a stock option may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock with respect to the grant date of such stock option. The Committee in its discretion shall determine the terms of each award, including vesting schedules, forfeiture provisions, performance metrics, and the effect of certain events, such as a change in control.
In our fiscal year 2018, we granted 2,146 RSUs to each of our board members (excluding Messrs. Penn and Sand), and 140,134 RSUs and options to purchase 276,780 shares of Common Stock to management employees.  In our fiscal year 2017, we granted 2,907 RSUs to each of our board members (excluding Messrs. Penn and Sand), and 188,935 RSUs and stock options to purchase 400,858 shares of Common Stock to management employees.  The RSUs  awarded to our board members vest twelve (12) months after the grant date.  The awards to our management employees vest, if at all, annually over a three year period based upon the achievement of the performance criteria under the MIP.
Tax-Qualified Retirement Plan 
Blue Bird has a tax-qualified retirement savings plan, the Blue Bird Employee Retirement Savings Plan (the "401(k) Plan"), under which participating employees may contribute up to the yearly statutory maximum under IRS guidelines into their 401(k) Plan accounts. In addition, under the 401(k) Plan, Blue Bird matches amounts contributed by the participant up to a certain percent of earnings, not to exceed the statutory maximum. Blue Bird currently makes matching contributions under the 401(k) Plan at a rate of 50% of the first 6% of eligible compensation contributed by participants. The 401(k) Plan also allows Blue Bird to make discretionary profit sharing contributions to the 401(k) Plan accounts for the benefit of participating employees for any calendar year in an amount determined by the Board. 
Employment Agreements and Other Arrangements with Named Executive Officers 
Phil Horlock. Prior to completion of the Business Combination transaction, Phil Horlock and School Bus Holdings, Inc. ("SBH") entered into an Employment Agreement dated as of April 1, 2011, as amended by a First Amendment to Employment Agreement dated as of June 1, 2012 (referred to collectively as "Mr. Horlock's Employment Agreement"). Following completion of the Business Combination transaction, Mr. Horlock's Employment Agreement became an obligation of the Company.
Mr. Horlock's Employment Agreement provides that he will serve as our President and Chief Executive Officer at a base salary of $500,000, subject to annual increases as determined by the Board in its discretion. Mr. Horlock's current base salary is $800,000. Mr. Horlock's Employment Agreement initially had a two year term, and is now renewable for successive one year periods unless either party has given the other 60 days' notice prior to the expiration of the current period of its intention to terminate. 
Mr. Horlock's Employment Agreement provides that he will be eligible to receive an annual cash bonus award based on Blue Bird's performance 
If Mr. Horlock's employment is terminated for cause or by Mr. Horlock for any reason, Mr. Horlock will be entitled to receive his accrued but unpaid base salary to the date of termination and any benefits to which he is entitled under existing employee benefits plans. Upon Mr. Horlock's termination of employment without cause, or upon the expiration of the then current term, in addition to the amounts described in the preceding sentence, upon the signing of a release, Mr. Horlock will be entitled to receive (i) payment for any accrued but unused vacation, (ii) an amount equal to the unpaid portion of his annual bonus relating to the previous fiscal year or the current fiscal year if his employment is terminated during the year, in which case the bonus will be pro-rated, (iii) his then salary for the earlier of 12 months or until he commences new employment, and (iv) reimbursement for COBRA coverage.
Mr. Horlock's Employment Agreement also contains confidentiality provisions, which extend indefinitely after he ceases employment, and noncompetition and nonsolicitation (of customers, suppliers and employees) provisions, which are applicable for a period of 24 months following termination of employment. 
Phil Tighe. Prior to completion of the Business Combination transaction, Phil Tighe's Offer Letter from Blue Bird Body Company served as the basis of his employment as Chief Financial Officer, which commenced on March 20, 2012. Mr. Tighe's initial base salary of $288,000 per year was increased to $300,000 per year on January 1, 2013 and is subject to annual increases. Mr. Tighe's current base salary is $475,000. The Offer Letter includes the potential for Mr. Tighe to receive an annual bonus.
Blue Bird Corporation entered into a Severance Agreement with Mr. Tighe, dated as of May 10, 2012 ("Mr. Tighe's Severance Agreement"), which provides that if Mr. Tighe's employment is terminated without cause (such a termination is referred to as a "Qualifying Termination"), he continues to comply with his confidentiality,  nonsolicitation and noncompetition obligations as set forth in Mr. Tighe's Severance Agreement, and he signs a release, he will be entitled to receive, until the earlier of 12 months after his termination date or his commencement of new employment, continued monthly salary payments. He will also be entitled to reimbursement for continuation of group health coverage under COBRA. 
In addition to the amounts described in the preceding paragraph, upon termination of his employment, Mr. Tighe will also be entitled to accrued but unpaid base salary to the termination date and any employee benefits he may be entitled to under existing employee benefit plans, the unpaid portion of any bonus relating to the calendar year prior to the calendar year of his termination of employment and, in the event of a Qualifying Termination, payment for accrued unused vacation days. Mr. Tighe's Severance Agreement also contains confidentiality, nonsolicitation and noncompetition provisions which are comparable to those described above with respect to Mr. Horlock's Employment Agreement, except that Mr. Tighe's obligations are for 12 months, rather than 24 months, following termination of employment. 
Tom Roberts. Tom Roberts' Offer Letter from the Company serves as the basis of his employment as Chief Administrative Officer, which commenced on November 2, 2015 at a base salary of $300,000 per year.  Mr. Roberts' current base salary is $375,000. The Offer Letter includes the ability of Mr. Roberts to receive an annual bonus under the MIP and participation in the Company's employee benefit plans and programs.
If Mr. Roberts' employment is terminated without cause (such a termination is referred to as a "Qualifying Termination"), he continues to comply with his confidentiality, nonsolicitation and noncompetition obligations, and he signs a release, he will be entitled to receive, for a period of 12 months after his termination date, continued monthly salary payments. He will also be entitled to reimbursement for continuation of group health coverage under COBRA. 
In addition to the amounts described in the preceding paragraph, upon termination of his employment, Mr. Roberts will also be entitled to accrued but unpaid base salary to the termination date and any employee benefits he may be entitled to under existing employee benefit plans, the unpaid portion of any bonus relating to the calendar year prior to the calendar year of his termination of employment and, in the event of a Qualifying Termination, payment for accrued unused vacation days.

Compensation Committee Report
As the Company had no obligation to produce compensation discussion and analysis disclosure covering fiscal 2018, no Compensation Committee report is required.
CERTAIN ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT MATTERS
BDO USA, LLP ("BDO") was engaged to perform the Company's annual audit for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018. Representatives of BDO will be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to respond to appropriate questions and to make a statement if such representatives so desire.
The Audit Committee of the Board has also engaged BDO as the independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year ending September 29, 2019. Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements as of and for the year ended September 29, 2018 with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed under Standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), including those matters set forth in SAS 61 (Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, AU380), as adopted by the PCAOB in Rule 3200T. In addition, the Audit Committee received from the independent registered public accounting firm the written disclosures and the letter required by the PCAOB's applicable requirements and has discussed with them their independence from the Company and its management. The Audit Committee has considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with maintaining the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. The Audit Committee has concluded that the independent registered public accounting firm is independent from the Company and its management.
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for the audit. In addition, the audit committee met with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company to discuss the processes that they have undertaken to evaluate the accuracy and fair presentation of the Company's financial statements and the effectiveness of the Company's system of disclosure controls and procedures.
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities and as part of its review of the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Audit Committee met with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss their evaluations of the Company's internal controls as well as the overall quality of its financial reporting.
The fees paid to the Company's current and prior independent registered public accounting firms, as well as the policy on pre-approval of audit and non-audit services, are set forth below.
As a result of the reviews and discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board and the Board approved the audited financial statements of the Company for inclusion in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 for filing with the SEC.
This report has been submitted by the Audit Committee comprised of:
Alan Schumacher (Chairman)
Gurminder Bedi
Douglas Grimm
Daniel Hennessy
The foregoing report shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Policy on Pre-Approval of Services Provided by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the terms of the engagement with respect to all auditing services and non-audit services to be performed for the Company by its independent registered public accounting firm are subject to the specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee (except where such services are determined to be de minimis under the Exchange Act). All audit and permitted non-audit services to be performed require pre-approval by the Audit Committee in accordance with pre-approval procedures established by the Audit Committee. The procedures require all proposed engagements for services of any kind to be directed to the Company's principal accounting officer and then submitted for approval to the Audit Committee prior to the beginning of any services.  In fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, 100% of the audit fees and tax fees billed by the independent registered public accounting firms were pre-approved by the Audit Committee or, in the interest of expediency, by the Chairman of the Audit Committee as its designee, with subsequent approval by the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is compatible with maintaining auditor independence and believes that the provision of such services is compatible.
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees
The following table shows the type of services and the aggregate fees billed for such services for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 by Blue Bird's independent registered public accounting firm, BDO.  Descriptions of the service types are provided below.

During fiscal year ended September 29, 2018, the Company believes, based solely on a review of copies of the reports furnished to the Company and written representations to it that no other reports were required, that all Section 16 filing requirements have been timely met, with the exception of Mr. Hennessy, who filed one Form 4 report reporting one (1) transaction one (1) day late.
