PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The first proposal to be voted on at the Annual Meeting is the election of members of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company. Eight current members of the Board are standing for re-election to hold office for a one-year term, or until their successors are duly elected and qualified. 
Each nominee has agreed to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected. Although Chemours knows of no reason why any of the nominees would not be able to serve, if any nominee is unavailable for election, the proxy holders may vote for another nominee proposed by the Board of Directors. In that case, your shares will be voted for that other person.
​
Director Qualification Standards
​
The Chemours Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider potential candidates suggested by Board members, as well as management, shareholders, search firms and others. 
The Board's Corporate Governance Guidelines describe qualifications for directors. Directors are selected for their integrity and character; sound, independent judgment; breadth of experience, insight and knowledge; business acumen; and significant professional accomplishment. The specific skills, experience and criteria that the Board may consider, and which may vary over time depending on current needs, include leadership; experience involving technological innovation; relevant industry experience; financial expertise; corporate governance; compensation and succession planning; familiarity with issues affecting global businesses; experience with global business operations, strategy and management; environment, health, safety and sustainability; risk management; other board experience; prior government service; and other individual qualities and attributes, including diversity in experience, gender and ethnicity, that contribute to the total mix of viewpoints and experience 
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
represented on the Board. Additionally, directors are expected to be willing and able to devote the necessary time, energy and attention to assure diligent performance of their responsibilities. 
When considering candidates for nomination, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee takes into account these factors, among other items, to assure that new directors have the highest personal and professional integrity, have demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment and will be most effective, in conjunction with other directors, in serving the long-term interests of all shareholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will not nominate for election as a director a partner, member, managing director, executive officer or principal of any entity that provides accounting, consulting, legal, investment banking or financial advisory services to Chemours. 
Once the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has identified a prospective candidate, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make an initial determination as to whether to conduct a full evaluation of the candidate. This initial determination will be based on whatever information is provided to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with the recommendation of the prospective candidate, as well as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's own knowledge of the prospective candidate. This may be supplemented by inquiries to the person making the recommendation or others. The preliminary determination will be based primarily on the likelihood that the prospective nominee can satisfy the factors described above. If the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines, in consultation with the Chairman of the Board and other Board members as appropriate, that further consideration is warranted, it may gather additional information about the prospective nominee's background and experience. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also may consider other relevant factors as it deems appropriate, including the current composition of the Board and specific needs of the Board to ensure its effectiveness. In connection with this evaluation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will determine whether to interview the prospective nominee. One or more members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and other directors, as appropriate, may interview the prospective nominee in person or by telephone. After completing its evaluation, the Committee will conclude whether to make a recommendation to the full Board for its consideration. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates for director suggested by shareholders, applying the factors for potential candidates described above and taking into account the additional information provided by the shareholder or gathered by the Committee. Shareholders wishing to suggest a candidate for director should write to the Corporate Secretary and include the detailed information required under the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws"). 
A shareholder's written notice to the Corporate Secretary described in the preceding paragraph must be delivered to The Chemours Company, 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, DE 19899, Attention: Corporate Secretary. Shareholders who wish to nominate candidates for the Board of Directors must follow the procedures described under "2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders — Procedures for Submitting Shareholder Proposals and Nominations" in this Proxy Statement.

Our 2030 Corporate Responsibility Commitment Goals TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
Corporate Governance Practices
​
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance, which is essential for sustained success and long-term shareholder value. 
In light of this goal, the Board has adopted the Corporate Governance Guidelines, which provide the framework for the Board's corporate governance. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the Corporate Governance Guidelines annually and recommends changes to the Board as appropriate. Among other things, the Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that: 
➢
Independent directors will meet regularly in executive session in conjunction with regularly scheduled Board meetings. 
​
➢
Directors have access to the Company's management and advisors, and are encouraged to visit the Company's facilities. Our Board has visited two manufacturing facilities. 
​
➢
As necessary and appropriate, the Board and its Committees may retain outside legal, financial or other advisors. 
​
➢
The Board will make an annual self-evaluation of its performance with a particular focus on overall effectiveness. 
​
➢
Directors will avoid any actual or potential conflicts with the interests of the Company, and if any actual or potential conflict develops, will report all facts to the Board so that the conflict may be resolved or the director may resign. 
​
➢
Shareholders and others interested in communicating directly with the Board, Chair or other outside director may do so by writing in care of the Corporate Secretary. The Board's independent directors have approved procedures for handling such correspondence received by the Company and addressed to the Board. 
​
The Corporate Governance Guidelines, along with the Charters of the Board Committees, the Company's Code of Conduct, Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller, and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for the Board of Directors are available on the Company's website at www.chemours.com, under the heading "Investor Relations" and then "Corporate Governance."
​
Board Leadership Structure
​
Mr. Richard H. Brown serves as the Chairman of the Board. The Company's governing documents allow the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") to be filled by the same or different individuals. This approach allows the Board flexibility to determine whether the two roles should be separated or combined based upon the Company's needs and the Board's assessment of the Company's leadership from time to time. If the Board does not have an independent chairperson, the Board will appoint a Lead Independent Director and determine the Lead Independent Director's duties and responsibilities. The Board will periodically consider the advantages of having an independent Chairman or a combined Chairman and CEO and is open to different structures as circumstances may warrant. 
At this time, the Board has determined that separating the roles of Chairman and CEO serves the best interests of Chemours and its shareholders. By having an independent Chairman, the CEO can focus primarily on the Company's business strategy and operations. The Company's CEO and senior management, working with the Board, set the strategic direction for Chemours, and the CEO provides day-to-day leadership. The independent Chairman leads the Board in the performance of its duties and serves as the principal liaison between the independent directors and the CEO.
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
Director Independence
​
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board is responsible for reviewing the qualifications and independence of members of the Board and its various Committees on a periodic basis, as well as the composition of the Board as a whole. This assessment includes members' qualifications as independent, as well as, consideration of skills and experience in relation to the needs of the Board. Director nominees are recommended to the Board by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the policies and principles in its Charter. The ultimate responsibility for selection of director nominees resides with the Board. The qualifications that the Board considers when nominating directors is discussed in more detail under "Director Nominees and Director Qualification Standards" in this Proxy Statement.
​
Independent Directors
The Board assesses the independence of directors and examines the nature and extent of any relations between the Company and directors, their families and their affiliates. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a director is "independent" if he or she satisfies the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Listing Standards on director independence and the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the 
Company (either directly, or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company). The Board has determined that, with the exception of Mr. Vergnano, the Company's CEO, each of the directors — Curtis V. Anastasio, Bradley J. Bell, Richard H. Brown, Mary B. Cranston, Curtis J. Crawford, Dawn L. Farrell and Sean D. Keohane — is independent.
​
Committee Independence Requirements
All members serving on the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee must be independent as defined by the Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
In addition, Audit Committee members must meet heightened independence criteria under NYSE Listing Standards and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") relating to audit committees. Each Compensation and Leadership Development 
Committee member must meet heightened independence criteria under NYSE Listing Standards and the rules and regulations of the SEC relating to compensation committees, be a "non-employee director" pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets the requisite independence and related requirements.
​
Oversight of Risk Management
​
The Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of risk management and its leadership structure supports its effective oversight of the Company's risk management. In fulfilling its oversight responsibility, the Board receives various management and Board Committee reports and engages in periodic discussions with the Company's officers, as it may deem appropriate. In addition, each of the Board Committees considers the risks within its areas of responsibility. For example, the Audit Committee focuses on risks inherent in the Company's accounting, financial reporting and internal controls and reviews the Company's cybersecurity and information security programs; and the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee considers the risks that may be implicated by the Company's incentive compensation program. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee's assessment of risk related to compensation practices is discussed in more detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee provides oversight regarding the Company's policies on political 
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
contributions and lobbying expenses. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is also responsible for reviewing transactions between the Company and related persons, which is discussed in more detail under "Certain Relationships and Transactions" in this Proxy Statement. 
Pursuant to its Charter, the Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in oversight of the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. In fulfilling this role, the Audit Committee reviews with the Company's General Counsel or the attorney(s) designated by the General Counsel, any legal matters that may have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. The Audit Committee also meets at least annually with the 
Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and other members of management, as the Audit Committee deems appropriate, to discuss in a general manner the policies and practices that govern the processes by which major risk exposures are identified, assessed, managed and controlled on an enterprise-wide basis. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management the Company's cybersecurity and information security programs. Additionally, on a general basis not less than annually, the Audit Committee reviews and approves the Company's decisions, if any, to enter into swaps, including security-based swaps, in reliance on the "end-user" exception from mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements.
​
Succession Planning
​
The Board plans for succession to the position of CEO. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, on behalf of the Board, oversees the succession planning process. To assist the Board, the CEO periodically provides the Board with an assessment of senior executives and their potential to succeed to the position of CEO, as well as, perspective on potential candidates from outside the Company. The Board has available, on a continuing basis, the CEO's recommendation should he or she be unexpectedly unable to serve. 
The CEO also provides the Board with an assessment of potential successors to key positions.
​
Director Education
​
New directors participate in an orientation process to become familiar with the Company and its strategic plans and businesses, significant financial matters, core values including ethics, compliance programs, corporate governance practices and other key policies and practices through a review of background materials, meetings with senior executives and visits to Company facilities. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for providing guidance on directors' continuing education, and actively monitors and encourages director education opportunities.
​
Code of Conduct
​
The Company is committed to high standards of ethical conduct and professionalism, and the Company's Code of Conduct confirms the commitment to ethical behavior in the conduct of all activities. 
In furtherance of this commitment, the Company has adopted a Code of Conduct, a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for the Board of Directors, and a Code of Ethics for the CEO, CFO and Controller. 
➢
The Code of Conduct applies to all directors, officers (including the CEO, CFO and Controller) and employees of Chemours, and it sets forth 
​
the Company's policies and expectations on a number of topics including avoiding conflicts of interest, confidentiality, insider trading, protection of Chemours and customer property, and providing a proper and professional work environment. The Code of Conduct sets forth a worldwide toll-free and Internet-based ethics hotline, which employees can use to communicate any ethics-related concerns, and the Company provides training on ethics and compliance topics for employees. 
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
➢
The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for the Board of Directors applies to all directors, and is intended to (i) foster the highest ethical standards and integrity; (ii) focus the Board and each director on areas of potential ethical risk and conflicts of interest; (iii) guide directors in recognizing and dealing with ethical issues; (iv) establish reporting mechanisms; and (v) promote a culture of honesty and accountability. 
​
➢
The Code of Ethics for the CEO, CFO and Controller applies to those three executive officers. This Code sets forth the standards of conduct that the CEO, CFO and Controller must uphold while performing his or her duties. 
​
In fiscal year 2018, there were no waivers of any provisions of   (i) the Code of Conduct; (ii) the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for the Board of Directors; or (iii) the Code of Ethics for the CEO, CFO and Controller. In the event the Company amends or waives any provision of any Code of Conduct or Code of Ethics that relates to any element of the definition of   "code of ethics" enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Company intends to disclose these actions on the Company website at www.chemours.com.

​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Overview
​
Non-employee directors receive compensation for Board service, which is designed to fairly compensate them for their Board responsibilities and align their interests with the long-term interests of shareholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which consists solely of independent directors, has the primary responsibility to review and consider any revisions to directors' compensation. 
During fiscal year 2018, non-employee directors were entitled to the following annual retainers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Fiscal Year 2018 Director Retainers  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 
[END TABLE]
(1)
Amounts payable in cash may be deferred pursuant to The Chemours Company Stock Accumulation and Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the "Directors Deferred Compensation Plan"), which is described further below. 
​
(2)
Equity awards are valued as of the grant date and rounded up to the nearest whole share. For 2018, equity awards were in the form of shares of common stock or deferred stock units (DSUs) that convert into shares of common stock when a director leaves the Board. Before DSUs are converted into shares, directors are not entitled to dividends on the DSUs, but they receive dividend equivalents (credited in the form of additional DSUs) that likewise are converted into shares (with any fractional share paid in cash) upon termination of service. 
​
The above fees assume service for a full year. Directors who serve for less than the full year are entitled to receive a pro-rated portion of the applicable payment. Each "year," for purposes of non-employee director compensation, begins on the date of the Company's annual meeting of shareholders. The Company does not pay meeting fees, but does pay for or reimburse directors for reasonable travel expenses related to attending Board, Committee, educational and Company business meetings. 
During 2018, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed, after consultation with the independent compensation consultant Willis Towers Watson, the annual amount of the non-employee director equity compensation and recommended to the Board no changes. The Board believes the compensation program is in the best interest of the Company and designed to fairly compensate directors for their Board responsibilities and align their interests with the long-term interests of shareholders. The Board has adopted share ownership guidelines applicable to non-employee director equity awards. The share ownership guidelines, contained in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, require non-employee directors to hold at least six (6) times the cash portion of their annual retainer worth of Chemours common stock, restricted stock units (RSUs) and/or DSUs while serving as a director. Non-employee directors will have five (5) years to attain this ownership threshold from the time of their election to the Board. TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Chemours Company Stock Accumulation and Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors
​
Under the Stock Accumulation and Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, a director is eligible to defer all or part of his or her Board retainer and Committee Chair fees in cash or stock units until a future year or years, payable in a lump sum or equal annual installments. Interest will accrue on deferred cash payments, and dividend equivalents will accrue on deferred stock units. This deferred compensation is an unsecured obligation of the Company.

Executive Summary 
2018 Business Highlights 
Chemours' results from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 include positive contributions from all three segments. Net sales increased to $6.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with $6.2 billion for the same period in 2017, primarily attributable to higher average selling prices for our Ti-Pure™ TiO2 pigment in the Titanium Technologies segment, increased adoption of Opteon™ refrigerants and higher average price for fluoropolymer products in the Fluoroproducts segment, and increased price across all businesses in the Chemical Solutions segment. GAAP Net Income increased to $995 million and adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") increased to $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. These increases were primarily attributable to the aforementioned increases in pricing and volume, partially offset by higher distribution and raw material costs in 2018. 
2018 highlights include: 
 Net sales of  $6.6 billion, up 7% versus 2017 
​
 GAAP Net income of  $995 million, up 33% versus 2017 
​
 Adjusted EBITDA of  $1.7 billion, up 22% versus 2017 
​
 Improved cash flow from operations of  $1.1 billion, up $500 million versus 2017 
​
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures" starting on page 56 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
2018 Executive Compensation Highlights 
Chemours' executive pay programs are highly performance-based, with payouts under both the short-term and long-term programs dependent on meeting financial and operational objectives over various performance periods. For 2018, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee approved certain changes to the programs to better incentivize executives to drive Chemours' financial performance and long-term stock performance. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Named Executive Officer ("NEO") Compensation 
 In early 2018, certain NEOs received adjustments to their base salaries and short/long-term incentive opportunities. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee believed these changes were appropriate after a careful review of 2017 performance, internal equity, job responsibilities and competitive market data. 
​
Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP") 
 The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee modified the AIP to align payouts for Business Unit Presidents to the performance of their businesses. Beginning in 2018, AIP payouts for Business Unit Presidents were based 75% on the achievement of their Business Unit's results and 25% based on the achievement of Chemours' results. Prior to 2018, AIP payouts for Business Unit Presidents were based 100% on achievement of Chemours' results. Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA remained as measures at both the Chemours and Business Unit level as the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee believes these measures reinforce the importance of earnings and cash generation to the achievement of Chemours' objectives as well as their importance to shareholders. 
​
 The Company's and individual Business Units' performances against AIP targets were mixed in 2018. The 2018 financial measures and targets under the AIP, along with results for the year, are listed below. AIP results are reflective of the changing circumstances of the business and macroeconomic challenges. As a result, AIP payouts to NEOs varied based on the performance of Chemours and the individual Business Units. Specifically, Chemours' performance fell below target but above threshold for both Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Fluoroproducts' performance exceeded targets for both Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Titanium Technologies' performance fell below threshold for both Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee believes the AIP payouts to NEOs are commensurate with Chemours and Business Unit performance results and its pay-for-performance philosophy. 
​
Chemical Solutions exceeded maximum levels of performance for both Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. As there are no NEOs in the Chemical Solutions Business Unit, the AIP results for this Business Unit are not discussed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis.
Long-Term Incentives 
 The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee approved Adjusted EPS as a replacement for Adjusted EBITDA in the Performance Share Unit ("PSU") Plan. Adjusted EBITDA was used in both short-term and long-term plans prior to 2018 to reinforce the importance of the financial measure for Chemours during the critical period after separation from DuPont. As Chemours continued to grow and 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
build momentum, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee believed that the use of a variety of measures is a better gauge of financial performance and health of the Company. Adjusted EPS is an important indicator of success in delivering long-term shareholder value through a focus on the quality of earnings. 
 For the 2018 PSU award, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee determined it was appropriate to continue the use of a 3-year performance cycle, with fixed annual goals for each year of the three-year periods and fixed cumulative/average goals for the cumulative/average results over the three-year period. Prior to 2018, each of the annual periods and the cumulative/average periods were weighted equally at 12.5%. Beginning in 2018, the weighting of the cumulative/average period increased from 12.5% to 20% for each of the financial performance measures. 
​
 The performance results for the 2016 PSU Award were 200%. The payout for this award was based on pre-established annual and three-year targets for Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-Tax Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC"). Under the 2016 PSU Award, performance results were subject to adjustment by Relative Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") over the three-year performance period for performance above the 75th percentile or below the 25th percentile. Over the three-year period ending December 31, 2018, Chemours delivered TSR of 395%, which is at the 100th percentile for the peer group described in the section titled "2016 PSU Award Results". This level of Relative TSR performance would have resulted in a 1.25 modifier being applied to the 2016 PSU Award payout, but the total payout result under the 2016 PSU Award was capped at 200%.

2018 "Say on Pay" Vote Result 
At Chemours' 2018 Annual Meeting, shareholders approved the Company's "Say-on-Pay" proposal with more than 96% of the votes cast in support of the executive compensation program. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee is committed to regularly reviewing the program in the context of Chemours' compensation philosophy and will continue to consider shareholder input in evaluating executive compensation program design and decisions. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Executive Compensation Philosophy and Pay-for-Performance 
Executive Compensation Philosophy 
The objectives of Chemours' executive compensation philosophy are rooted in: 
 Promoting a performance-based culture that strongly links executive rewards to shareholder interests and to the Company's strategic and financial goals 
​
 Providing a competitive total compensation opportunity designed to attract, retain and motivate high-performing executive talent 
​
These objectives are achieved through fixed and variable compensation elements. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee determines the appropriate balance between these elements in setting the total compensation opportunity for executives:

Pay Mix at Target 
The Committee believes that aligning executive incentive payouts with Chemours' performance outcomes is critical for shareholders. Accordingly, the targets under the annual and long-term incentive programs represent rigorous performance expectations that are aligned to short and long-term financial and strategic goals. 
To reinforce Chemours' pay-for-performance philosophy, the total compensation program for executives emphasizes at-risk incentive pay and, therefore, fluctuates with financial results and stock price. This approach aligns the pay outcomes of executives with Company performance and shareholder interests. The charts that follow illustrate the percentage of target pay at-risk for the CEO and other NEOs on average. TABLE OF CONTENTS
87% of CEO target total pay in 2018 was at risk while target total pay for our other NEOs was on average 71% at risk. 
CEO Pay for Performance 
The chart below demonstrates the relationship between Mr. Vergnano's pay and Chemours' TSR in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Target Pay ($6 million in 2016, $7.8 million in 2017 and $7.9 million in 2018) refers to the target pay program approved by the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee regarding base salary, annual incentive, and equity awards. Realizable Pay ($18.8 million in 2016, $10.6 million in 2017 and $4.0 million in 2018) is defined as actual W-2 base salary pay, actual annual incentive payment for performance in that year (paid in following year), and the value of equity awards at the end of the period. Stock options are valued based on the in-the-money value of options granted during that year (the spread between end-of-year stock price and grant price). Performance Share Units ("PSUs") are valued based on the number of PSUs awarded during that year (i.e.target # of PSUs), valued at the stock price at the end of the year. 
The value of Mr. Vergnano's equity awards varied at the end of each fiscal year based on changes in the stock price from the date of grant. This, combined with variable annual incentive payouts, contributes to different levels of Realizable Pay value. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee believes the pay outcomes for the CEO are aligned with shareholder interests over the time periods reported. TABLE OF CONTENTS

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee has engaged Willis Towers Watson as its independent compensation consultant since April 2017. Willis Towers Watson is engaged by and reports directly to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, which may replace the firm or hire additional consultants at any time. 
The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee and the other independent directors of Chemours' Board are the sole decision makers for compensation of executive officers. 
The Committee has assessed the independence of Willis Towers Watson based on NYSE Listing Standards and SEC rules and concluded that its work does not raise any conflict of interest. 
Peer Group Selection and Competitive Positioning 
In making compensation decisions, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee considers competitive market data from a compensation peer group of companies as one of several reference points. Compensation peer group data is supplemented with broader chemical industry and general industry data. The selection of the compensation peer group is composed of publicly-traded U.S. based companies with similar scale, revenue, industry, and business characteristics reflecting Chemours' current state as well as its business direction. 
For compensation decisions made in early 2018, the compensation peer group consisted of the following companies: 
The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee reviews the composition of the compensation peer group regularly to ensure that it remains suitable and appropriate. With the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee conducted a review of the peer group in July 2018 and made no changes. 
Chemours generally targets the market median for target total direct compensation and each of base salary, target total cash compensation, and target total long-term incentives for senior officers and NEOs. Ultimately, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee has the flexibility to pay above or below the market median based on a variety of factors including an executive's scope of responsibility, experience level, the critical need for retention, sustained performance over time, potential for advancement as part of key succession planning processes, and other unique factors. 
2018 Executive Compensation 
2018 CEO Compensation Highlights 
The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee considered many factors in recommending Mr. Vergnano's 2018 target total direct compensation opportunity including the following: 
 Strong Company performance in 2017, including one-year TSR of 127% 
​
 Completion of Chemours' Transformation Plan 
​
 Mr. Vergnano's individual performance 
​
 External market competitiveness
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee recommended an increase to Mr. Vergnano's base salary of 5%, increasing his base salary to $1,050,000 and target annual incentive opportunity to $1,365,000. The following changes to Mr. Vergnano's target total compensation were approved by the Board of Directors in February 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
​ ​ ​  2017   ​ ​  2018   ​ 
[END TABLE]
Mr. Vergnano's actual 2018 AIP award was $1,000,545, 73% of his target award opportunity, which is reflective of the company performance outcomes noted previously. In 2018, 60% of Mr. Vergnano's total long-term incentive opportunity was delivered in Performance Share Units ("PSUs"), with vesting and performance results based on the achievement of Adjusted Earnings Per Share and Pre-Tax ROIC financial goals, as well as Relative TSR over a three-year period. The remaining 40% of Mr. Vergnano's long-term incentive opportunity was delivered in non-qualified stock options, which vest annually in three equal installments from the date of grant. 
2018 Base Salaries of the Other NEOs 
Base salaries for the NEOs are intended to be competitive with the market in order to attract and retain the executive talent needed to successfully manage daily business operations. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee reviews base salaries for NEOs annually. NEOs' base salaries reflect the scope of responsibilities, experience, achievement of individual strategic objectives, and external market competitiveness. Base salaries represent a small portion of a NEO's overall compensation. 
In 2018, after considering external market pay data, internal equity and performance, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee approved a base salary increase for Mr. Snell of 10%, increasing his base salary to $550,000. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee maintained base salaries at the 2017 level for Messrs. Newman, Kirsch and Shelton as set forth in the following table. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 NEO   ​ ​ Base Salary ($) (as of December 31, 2017)  ​ ​ Base Salary ($) (as of December 31, 2018)  ​ 
[END TABLE]
Salary changes for NEOs are generally effective March 1 of each year. 
Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) 
Chemours' annual incentive plan is designed to reward executives for achieving and exceeding annual financial performance goals. Under the AIP, each NEO has a target annual incentive opportunity, expressed as a percentage of base salary. Incentive targets are determined based on the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee's review of peer group practices, chemical industry data from proprietary third-party surveys, and the position and scope of responsibilities of each NEO. Incentive targets are reviewed annually. NEO AIP target opportunity (as a percentage of salary) remained unchanged for 2018. The following table summarizes 2018 AIP targets. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 NEO   ​ ​ 2017 Annual Incentive Target (as% of Base Salary)  ​ ​ 2018 Annual Incentive Target (as% of Base Salary)  ​ 
[END TABLE]
 TABLE OF CONTENTS
After careful review, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee made changes to the annual incentive plan design in 2018 to better align AIP payouts for Business Unit Presidents to the results of their respective businesses. 
Incentive Formula 
Actual cash annual incentive awards for NEOs in 2018 were determined using the formulas shown below. The calculation of award payments for each NEO is determined based on Chemours' financial performance or a combination of Chemours and Business Unit performance. There is no individual performance component for NEOs. The Committee may use discretion to reduce payout. 
AIP awards for Messrs. Vergnano, Newman and Shelton are determined as follows:
AIP awards for Messrs. Kirsch and Snell are determined as follows:
Performance Measures 
For 2018, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee determined Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow remained the appropriate measures as they directly reflect the Chemours goals of promoting earnings improvement and emphasizing cash generation. 
Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow were weighted equally in determining the Corporate Performance Factor. For the Business Unit Performance Factor, Adjusted EBITDA was weighted 75% given its significance as a measure of our business unit growth and success, and Business Unit Free Cash Flow was weighted 25%. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
​ ​ ​  Measure   ​ ​  Weighting   ​ 
 Corporate Performance Factor   ​ ​  Corporate Adjusted EBITDA   ​ ​  50%   ​ 
​ ​ ​  Measure   ​ ​  Weighting   ​ 
 Business Unit Performance Factor  ​ ​  Corporate Adjusted EBITDA   ​ ​  12.50% (50% of the 25%)  ​ 
​  Business Unit Adjusted EBITDA   ​ ​ 56.25% (75% of the 75%) ​ 
[END TABLE]
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization excluding the following items: non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs (income), exchange gains (losses), restructuring, impairment and asset-related charges (benefits), gains (losses) on sale of business or assets, transaction costs, legal charges, impacts of changes to U.S. GAAP accounting or other items not considered indicative of ongoing operations during the performance period. 
Free Cash Flow is defined as Cash Flows from Operations less Capital Expenditures as disclosed on the Company's Cash Flow statement. Business Unit Free Cash Flow defined as Adjusted EBITDA plus the delta Working Capital minus CapEx. Working Capital equals Accounts Receivable plus Inventory minus Accounts Payable. Impacts of changes to U.S. GAAP accounting, or other items not considered indicative of ongoing operations during the performance period will be excluded from this calculation during the performance period. TABLE OF CONTENTS
The chart below shows the 2018 AIP performance targets, ranges and results approved by the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee. Performance targets were set in early 2018 and were consistent with the Company's budget for 2018, which incorporated considerations of potential opportunities and risks associated with external business and market conditions. Targets for each of the performance measures are set at levels considered challenging, motivational, and competitive. The performance range is determined using external guidance, historical performance and expectations as guardrails. Threshold is considered the level of performance that warrants the minimum payout level and the maximum defines what level of performance is exceptional. 
In early 2019, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee reviewed Chemours' financial performance against the AIP targets. As part of the process the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee considered whether the impact of any significant events not contemplated at the time targets were set should lead to an adjustment of any performance results. The Committee determined that it was appropriate to exclude approximately $1 million of Adjusted EBITDA and $15 million of Free Cash Flow benefits that resulted from the construction delay in the Mexico Cyanide Plant. With rounding, this had no impact on actual Adjusted EBITDA of  $1,740 million and moved actual Free Cash Flow from $642 million to $627 million. 
Based on 2018 financial results, the Chemours 2018 Corporate AIP payout was 73.3% of target, the Fluoroproducts AIP payout was 143.6%, and the Titanium Technologies payout was 18.3%.
Figures are in millions.

Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Program 
Chemours provides long-term incentive compensation to directly tie NEO interests to the interests of shareholders. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee views long-term incentives as a critical element of our executive compensation program. Long-term incentive targets are reviewed annually and determined based on the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee's review of the following: 
 NEO position, scope of responsibilities and performance 
​
 Internal pay equity considerations 
​
 Peer group practices 
​
 Current market compensation data for the chemical industry and general industry from proprietary third-party surveys 
​
In 2018, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee increased the long-term incentive target for Mr. Shelton ($750,000 to $850,000) in connection with his performance and to better align his compensation with market. No changes were recommended for Messrs. Newman, Kirsch or Snell as their long-term incentive targets were considered market competitive and aligned with position, scope of responsibilities and internal pay equity considerations. The following table summarizes 2018 LTI targets. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 NEO   ​ ​ 2017 Long Term Incentive Target  ​ ​ 2018 Long Term Incentive Target  ​ 
[END TABLE]
As in prior years, target LTI award values were delivered through a mix of PSUs and Non-Qualified Stock Options ("stock options"). LTI awards delivered in the form of PSUs and stock options focus on shareholder value creation and long-term decision-making consistent with Chemours' strategic objectives. Details of each award type are summarized below. 
Stock Options (40% of LTI Target Award) 
The use of stock options provides clear and direct alignment with shareholder interests as they have value only if the price of Chemours' stock at the time of exercise exceeds the stock price on the date of grant. As a result, stock option grants encourage executives to focus on behaviors and initiatives that support sustained long-term stock price appreciation, which benefits all shareholders. The stock options are designed to vest in equal annual installments over three years from the grant date and have a ten-year term. 
PSU Awards (60% of LTI Target Award) 
Sixty percent of an NEOs LTI award is delivered through PSUs. The PSUs are earned and vest based on the achievement of Adjusted EPS and Pre-Tax ROIC performance objectives, which are determined at the time of grant, for each of the annual periods and the three-year average/cumulative period within the performance period.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Performance goals for each of the measurement periods are considered challenging to obtain and are aligned with delivering shareholder value. In setting these objectives, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee considers how the achievement of goals may be affected by competitive and/or economic conditions over the three-year period. Results for each of the annual periods and the average/cumulative periods are measured independently. Final awards are subject to potential modification based on TSR results relative to the Chemours peer group over the cumulative three-year performance period. 
The payout range of the PSUs was 0% to 200% depending on Chemours' achievement of the performance goals. The maximum incentive under the PSU was capped at 200%, inclusive of modifier impact. 
As in prior years, the PSU portion of Chemours' LTI program consisted of overlapping cycles, with a new equity award each year. In general, each participant receives a grant at the beginning of each three-year cycle. 
Financial/Operating Measures
The use of Adjusted EPS in the long-term program is an important indicator of success in delivering long-term shareholder value. Pre-Tax ROIC remains critical to Chemours' ability to invest and manage assets that deliver the greatest return. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee believes these performance measures are appropriate to motivate executives to achieve and sustain outstanding long-term results. 
The 2018 PSU Award performance period, January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020, consists of four measurement periods for each financial objective: three annual (each weighed 10%) measurement periods and one three-year (weighted at 20%) measurement period. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Period   ​ ​  Weighting   ​ ​  Period   ​ ​  Weighting   ​ 
 Cumulative FY2018 – FY2020   ​ ​ ​ ​ 20% ​ ​ ​  Average FY2018 – FY2020   ​ ​ ​ ​ 20% ​ ​ 
[END TABLE]
Adjusted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by fully diluted shares outstanding. Shares outstanding to be determined as the diluted shares outstanding as of the beginning of the performance period, adjusted by the shares issued under compensation plans during the period. The impact of any share issuances or repurchases (size and timing) on diluted share count, other than those contemplated in the three-year business plan used for compensation plan purposes, shall be excluded from this calculation during the performance period. Adjustments will be applied for diluted share count that deviates 1% from amounts reflected in plan targets. 
Pre-Tax ROIC, consistent with external reporting, is defined as Adjusted EBIT divided by average Invested Capital. Adjusted EBIT equals Adjusted EBITDA minus depreciation and amortization. Invested Capital equals Debt plus Equity minus Cash, all based on stated balance sheet values. Any impact of changes to U.S. GAAP accounting during the performance period is excluded from this calculation. 
Chemours believes disclosing specific targets while the applicable performance period is ongoing could cause competitive harm. However, such targets will be disclosed once the applicable performance periods have ended as part of our discussion and analysis on awards earned by the NEOs. 
Relative TSR
Relative TSR is used as a modifier to promote alignment with shareholder interests. Relative TSR for the 2018 PSU Award will be measured at the end of the three-year period against the peer group discussed previously. Chemours' TSR relative to these peers will be used as a modifier to increase or reduce the number of units earned. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Relative TSR is defined as the change in the Company's stock price plus dividends paid and assumed to be reinvested on the ex-dividend date during the period, divided by beginning stock price, compared on a percentile basis to the same change with respect to the companies in a peer group. At the end of the performance period, the overall performance outcome will be modified as shown in the table below, subject to the overall cap of 200%:

[END TABLE]
(1)
The number of PSUs awarded was determined by dividing the dollar target value for each NEO by the closing price for Chemours common stock on grant date, March 1, 2018, and rounding to the nearest whole share. The closing price of Chemours common stock was $48.53. 
​
(2)
The number of stock options awarded was determined based on the Black-Scholes value using the closing price of Chemours common stock on the grant date, March 1, 2018. The exercise price of the options was equal to the closing price of Chemours common stock on the grant date. The closing price of Chemours common stock was $48.53 and the Black-Scholes value of an option was $20.55. 
​
2016 PSU Award Results (paid in 2019) 
The three-year performance period for PSUs awarded in 2016 ended on December 31, 2018. The payout for this award was based on pre-established target levels of Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-Tax ROIC over the three-year performance period, subject to a TSR modifier. The final payout determination was made in February 2019 after a review of the Chemours performance. Based on performance results throughout the period and relative TSR, the 2016 PSU Award payout was 200% of target. Chemours' Relative TSR ranking of 100th percentile for the FY2016 – FY2018 performance period would have resulted in a 1.25 increase of the award were it not for the 200% payment cap. The tables listed below detail performance against each measure:

Company Sponsored Employee Benefits 
The Company offers the NEOs health and welfare and retirement plan benefits. Additional elements specific to the executive compensation program include nonqualified retirement benefit plans, reimbursement of financial planning and income tax preparation services, and change-in-control benefits. 
The Chemours Company Retirement Savings Restoration Plan 
The Chemours Company Retirement Savings Restoration Plan ("RSRP") is a nonqualified defined contribution plan that restores benefits above the Internal Revenue Code limits for tax-qualified retirement plans to be consistent with those provided to other eligible employees at Chemours. 
The Chemours Company Management Deferred Compensation Plan 
Under The Chemours Company Management Deferred Compensation Plan ("MDCP"), a nonqualified elective deferred compensation plan, participants may defer base salary, bonus, and certain incentive plan awards until a later date. Generally, earnings on deferred amounts include returns on investments that mirror the investment alternatives available to all employees under the Company's retirement savings plan. 
Change-in-Control Severance Benefits 
To ensure that executives remain focused on Chemours' business during a period of uncertainty, Chemours maintains a change-in-control severance plan for its executives, including the NEOs. For any benefits to be earned, a change in control must occur and the executive's employment must be terminated within two years following the change in control, either by Chemours without cause or the executive for good reason (often called a "double trigger"). The plan does not provide tax gross-ups. For additional information, see "Executive Compensation — Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control." TABLE OF CONTENTS
Benefits provided under the change-in-control severance plan include: 
 A lump sum cash payment of two times (three times for the CEO) the sum of the executive's base salary and target annual incentive; 
​
 A lump sum cash payment equal to the pro-rated portion of the executive's target annual incentive for the year of termination; and 
​
 Continued health and dental benefits, financial counseling and tax preparation, and outplacement services for up to two years (three years for the CEO) following the date of termination. 
​
The change-in-control severance plan also includes 12-month (18-month for the CEO) non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, non-disparagement, and confidentiality provisions. 
Compensation and Risk
​
In 2018, Chemours management reviewed its executive and non-executive compensation programs and in concurrence with the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee's independent compensation consultant, determined that none of its compensation programs encourages or creates excessive risk-taking, and none are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
In conducting this assessment, the components and design features of executive and non-executive plans and programs were analyzed. A summary of the findings of the assessment was provided to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee. Overall, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee concluded that (1) the Company's executive compensation programs provide a mix of awards with performance criteria and design features that mitigate potential excessive risk taking and (2) non-executive employee compensation programs are appropriately balanced between fixed and variable compensation and do not encourage excessive risk taking. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee also considered its payout caps or limits, stock ownership guidelines, and clawback policy as risk mitigating features of its executive compensation program. 
Payout Limitations or Caps 
Earned awards from the annual incentive plan and the PSU awards are capped at 200% of target to protect against excessive payouts. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
To further support our goal of achieving a strong link between shareholder and executive interests, Chemours maintains stock ownership guidelines to require executive share ownership of a value equal to a specified multiple of base pay. Executives have five (5) years from the date they become subject to the guidelines to reach their respective ownership requirements. Until the ownership requirement is satisfied, 100% of the net shares realized from exercise or vesting of stock-based awards must be retained. Share ownership guidelines are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Multiple of Salary   ​ ​  2018 Target   ​ 
[END TABLE]
All applicable NEOs have satisfied or are on track to satisfy these guidelines. 
Restrictions on Certain Types of Transactions
​
The Company has a policy that prohibits executive officers and directors from engaging in the following types of transactions with respect to Chemours' stock: hedging transactions, pledging securities, short sales, derivative transactions, margin accounts, and short-term trading. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Deductibility of Performance-Based Compensation
​
In setting the NEO's 2018 compensation packages, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee considered Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which provided that compensation in excess of $1 million paid to certain executive officers, is not deductible unless certain exceptions applied. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) for awards that are not grandfathered and increased the coverage of Section 162(m) to, among other things, include Chief Financial Officers and any executive who is subject to the Section 162(m) limitation in tax years beginning after 2016. These changes will cause more NEO compensation to be non-deductible under Section 162(m) in the future, and will eliminate the Company's ability to structure performance-based awards to be exempt from Section 162(m). While the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee will continue to consider the tax deductibility of compensation, it does not believe the limitations under Section 162(m) should restrict the Committee's discretion and flexibility in structuring compensation programs to attract, retain, and motivate our executive officers. 
CEO Pay Ratio
​
As there were no significant changes to the global employee population nor significant changes to employee compensation arrangements, Chemours used the same median employee for the 2018 CEO pay ratio calculation as used in 2017. The CEO pay ratio figures below are a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules. 
When first running the CEO pay ratio calculation, Chemours determined that as of October 31, 2017, the total number of employees was 6,954. To determine median employee pay, Chemours chose base pay as the consistently applied compensation measure. Chemours then calculated an annual base pay for each employee, annualizing pay for those employees who commenced work during 2017 and any employees who were on leave for a portion of 2017. Chemours used a valid statistical sampling methodology to identify a population of employees whose base pay was within a 5% range of the median. Using this methodology, Chemours identified the median employee from that group. The total number of employees on December 31, 2018 was 7,048.
It was determined that the total compensation for the selected median employee in 2018 was $106,807. The ratio of CEO pay to the median worker pay is 76:1. This is a reduction in the CEO Pay Ratio compared to last year's ratio of 101:1. This is the result of a lower AIP payout to Mr. Vergnano and an increase in 2018 overtime pay for the median employee.

The 2016 PSU grant, with a performance period of 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2018 was considered as 'earned' on 12/31/2018. 
​
➢
Mr. Vergnano, Mr. Snell and Mr. Shelton were retirement eligible and considered fully vested on 12/31/2018. Their 2016 PSU awards are reported in the above table. 
​
➢
If the NEO was not retirement eligible the 2016 PSU award remained unvested until performance was certified on 2/15/2019. Mr. Newman and Mr. Kirsch were not retirement eligible, so their 2016 PSU awards are reported in the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End table.

Narrative Discussion of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table 
Chemours sponsors two nonqualified deferred compensation plans for the benefit of eligible employees. The Retirement Savings Restoration Plan ("RSRP") supplements our qualified defined contribution plan, the Retirement Savings Plan ("RSP"), and is designed to provide benefits in excess of IRS qualified plan limits applicable to the RSP. The Management Deferred Compensation Plan ("MDCP") is an elective deferral plan that provides eligible employees with the opportunity to defer receipt of a specified portion of their compensation, thereby postponing income taxation on amounts deferred until the time such deferrals are distributed from the MDCP. Eligible employees may elect to participate in either, neither or both nonqualified deferred compensation plans annually. The following provides an overview of the various deferral options as of December 31, 2018. 
Retirement Savings Restoration Plan 
Each year during the enrollment window, eligible employees can elect to defer 1 – 6% of compensation. The deferral elections spring into effect when the participant's year-to-date compensation exceeds the IRS annual compensation limit ($275,000 for 2018). Compensation for RSRP purposes consists of base salary and annual incentive payments. Chemours provides a Company matching contribution equal to 100% of the employee deferral amount. Certain employees previously employed by DuPont are also eligible to receive transition (benefit) contributions under the RSRP. In addition, and entirely at its discretion, Chemours may make non-elective contributions to the RSRP. 
Deferrals and contributions to the RSRP are notionally invested in the available investment alternatives which mirror those made available under the qualified RSP. The term "notional" means account balances are not actually invested in any of the deemed investment alternatives, rather, the rate of return derived from the notional investments is credited to individual account balances consistent with the participant's investment direction elections. 
When enrolling in the RSRP, participants are also requested to make distribution elections. Distributions are triggered by termination of employment, and will commence either upon separation from service or 1 – 5 years thereafter if the participant so elects. Distributions may be paid in a lump sum or substantially equal annual installments over 2 – 15 years, at the election of the participant. 
Employee and Matching contributions are always 100% vested. The transition (benefit) contribution vests upon completing two years of service with Chemours. Non-Elective Contributions are vested upon completion of three years of service. The NEOs are 100% vested in their deferrals and related investment experience.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Management Deferred Compensation Plan 
Under the terms of the MDCP, each year during the enrollment window eligible employees can elect to defer: 1 – 60% of  "base salary" and/or 1 – 60% of the annual incentives. Additionally, corporate officers may elect to defer settlement of their equity awards (i.e., RSUs and/or PSUs). 
Base salary and annual incentive award deferrals are notionally invested in the available investment alternatives. The term "notional" means account balances are not actually invested in any of the deemed investment alternatives, rather, the rate of return derived from the notional investments is credited to individual account balances consistent with the participant's investment direction elections. Equity award deferrals are notionally invested in Chemours common stock with dividend equivalents credited as additional stock units. Chemours does not match deferrals under the MDCP. 
When enrolling in the MDCP, participants are also requested to make distribution elections. Participants may elect either in-service or termination distribution elections. In-service distributions are payable as of a specified date in the form of a lump sum. Termination distributions commence either upon separation from service or 1 – 5 years thereafter if the participant so elects, and can be paid either in a lump sum or substantially equal annual installments over 2 – 15 years, at the election of the participant. 
NEOs are 100% vested in their deferrals and related investment experience.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
​
The table below summarizes the potential payouts to the NEOs upon a termination from the Company, or under specified situations in a change in control as further described below. The amounts shown in the following table are approximate and reflect certain assumptions that the Company has made in accordance with the SEC's rules. These assumptions include that the termination of employment or change in control occurred on December 31, 2018, and that the value of a share of the Company's stock on that day was $28.22, the closing price per share of the Company's common stock on December 31, 2018. The table also includes potential payments under The Chemours Company 2017 Equity and Incentive Plan (the "2017 Plan"). The treatment of benefits under each plan on termination or change in control is detailed in the footnotes to the table.

Effective January 1, 2017, Chemours revised the termination provisions associated with Stock Option, RSU and PSU awards to be more consistent with market prevalence and simplify administration. A summary of the provisions by award type follows. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Stock Options 
 Retirement eligibility results in continued vesting, and the time to exercise is three years post-employment or the original expiration date of the award, whichever occurs first. 
​
 Death or Disability termination results in immediate vesting of unvested awards and the time to exercise is limited to two years post-employment, or the original expiration date of the award whichever occurs first. 
​
 Change in Control with qualifying termination remains consistent with the description below. 
​
 Any other termination results in the forfeiture of unvested options and 90 days post-employment to exercise any options vested as of the termination date. 
​
RSUs 
 Retirement eligibility results in continued vesting of unvested awards. 
​
 Death or Disability termination results in immediate vesting of unvested awards. 
​
 Change in Control with qualifying termination remains consistent with the description below. 
​
 Any other termination results in forfeiture of unvested awards. 
​
PSUs 
 Retirement eligibility results in vesting of a pro-rated portion of the award, with performance based on actual performance over the full performance period and proration based on the number of days the NEO was employed during the performance period. 
​
 Death or Disability results in vesting of a pro-rated portion of the award, with performance based on actual performance over the full performance period and proration based on the number of days the NEO was employed during the performance period. 
​
 Change in Control with qualifying termination remains consistent with the description below. 
​
 Any other termination results in forfeiture of unvested awards. 
​
 The 2016 PSU grant, with a performance period of 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2018 was considered as 'earned' on 12/31/2018, but the PSUs remained unvested until performance was certified on 2/15/2019 if the executive was not retirement eligible on 12/31/2018. 
​
➢
Mr. Vergnano, Mr. Snell and Mr. Shelton were retirement eligible and considered fully vested on 12/31/2018. The 2016 PSU awards are not reported in the above table, rather the awards are declared under the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table. 
​
➢
Mr. Newman and Mr. Kirsch were not retirement eligible, so the 2016 PSU award was unvested on 12/31/2018. Therefore, the 2016 PSU awards are reported in the above table for termination reasons that would have resulted in payout of the unvested award on 12/31/2018. 
​
(1)
The award agreements for stock options, PSUs and RSUs contain restrictive covenants that may result in forfeiture of unvested stock options, PSUs and RSUs upon a breach of confidentiality, nonsolicitation and noncompetition obligations during employment and after termination of employment (for a period of one year for nonsolicitation and noncompetition). 
​
(2)
Amounts shown in this column indicate the NEO has achieved the requisite age and service milestones to be regarded as "retirement eligible" in accordance with award terms. To the extent that the NEO is retirement eligible, unvested stock options, RSUs, and PSUs are treated as if the NEO had retired. The amounts listed in the table for Mr. Vergnano, Mr. Snell and Mr. Shelton represent values that will continue to vest in accordance with retirement eligible provisions. Mr. Vergnano and Mr. Snell meet the retirement eligible provisions for all plans. Mr. Shelton met the retirement eligible provisions for the 2016 grants (minimum 55 years of age and 10 years of service) but did not meet the retirement eligible conditions for plans granted after January 1, 2017 (minimum 60 years of age and 10 years of service). If an NEO is not retirement eligible, upon voluntary termination or termination for cause, the various Company plans and programs provide for forfeiture of all unvested stock options, RSUs, and PSUs. The PSUs listed relate to the 2017 and 2018 PSU grants and are based on the level of performance assumed and disclosed in the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End table. 
​
(3)

Amount shown represents the in-the-money value of stock options not yet vested as of December 31, 2018 that would continue to vest in accordance with retirement eligible provisions. 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
b.

Upon Change in Control: 
​
a.
Treatment varies depending on whether the Company is the surviving entity and, if not, whether the awards are assumed by an acquiring entity. Values shown in the table above assume that the Company is not the surviving entity and the acquiring entity does not assume or otherwise provide for continuation of the awards. 
​
b.
Stock options are immediately vested and cancelled in exchange for payment in an amount equal to (i) the excess of the fair market value per share of the stock subject to the award immediately prior to the change in control over the exercise or base price per share of stock subject to the award multiplied by (ii) the number of shares granted. Amount shown represents the in-the-money value of unvested stock options as of December 31, 2018. 
​
c.
RSUs are immediately vested and all restrictions lapse. Awards cancelled in exchange for a payment equal to the fair market value per share of the stock subject to the award immediately prior to the change in control multiplied by the number of shares granted. Amount shown represents the value of all RSUs as of December 31, 2018. 
​
d.
PSUs convert, at target amount, to time-based vesting RSUs, and subsequent vesting is governed by the applicable change-in-control terms. Amount shown represents the value of all PSUs, at target value, as of December 31, 2018. 
​
In the event that the Company is the surviving entity, or the acquiring entity assumes or otherwise provides for continuation of the awards, all stock options, RSUs and PSUs remain in place or substitute awards are issued. 
Upon termination without cause or termination for good reason within two years after change in control, awards vest in full. Stock options remain exercisable for two years, or the original expiration date, whichever occurs first. 
Under the Senior Executive Severance Plan, a change in control must occur and the executive's employment must be terminated within two years following the change in control, either by the Company without cause or the executive for good reason (often called a "double trigger"). Benefits provided under the plan include: (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to two times (three times for the CEO) the sum of the executive's base salary and target annual bonus; (ii) a lump sum cash payment equal to the pro-rated portion of the executive's target annual bonus for the year of termination; and (iii) continued health and dental benefits and outplacement services for two years (three years for the CEO) following the date of termination.

Proposal 2 — Advisory Vote To Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the related rules of the SEC, the Company seeks your vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the SEC's compensation disclosure rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the compensation tables (a "say-on-pay" vote). 
As described in detail under the heading "Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis" in this Proxy Statement, the Board of Directors seeks to link a significant portion of executive officer compensation with the Company's performance. The Company's compensation programs are designed to reward the Company's executive officers for the achievement of short-term and long-term financial goals, while minimizing excessive risk taking. The Company's executive compensation program is strongly aligned with the long-term interests of shareholders. The Company urges you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement for additional details on executive compensation programs, including compensation philosophy and objectives and the compensation of named executive officers during fiscal year 2018. 
The vote on this proposal is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the vote relates to all compensation relating to the Company's named executive officers, as described in this Proxy Statement. The vote is advisory and is not binding on the Company, the Board, or the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, and will not be construed as overruling a decision by, or creating or implying any additional fiduciary duty for, the Company, the Board, or the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee. However, the Board and the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee value the opinions expressed by shareholders in their votes on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions and policies regarding the Company's executive officers. 
Accordingly, the Board of Directors and management ask shareholders to approve the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and any related material disclosed in this Proxy Statement."

Proposal 3 — Ratification Of Selection Of Independent REGISTERED Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. In Proposal 3, the Company is asking shareholders to ratify this selection. 
Although ratification is not required by the Company's Bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of PwC to the Company's shareholders for ratification. If the selection is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year, if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
Representatives of PwC are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be available to respond to appropriate questions and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so.

Audit Committee's Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
​
To assure that the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm do not impair its independence in appearance and/or fact, the Audit Committee has established the Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy of the Audit Committee (the "Policy"). The Policy outlines the scope of services that PwC may provide to the Company. The Policy sets forth guidelines and procedures the Company must follow when retaining PwC to perform audit, audit-related, tax and other services. The Policy also specifies certain non-audit services that may not be performed by PwC under any circumstances. Pursuant to the Policy, the Audit Committee has approved services to be provided by PwC and fee thresholds within each of the service categories, and services within these thresholds are deemed pre-approved. Additional services and fees exceeding those thresholds require further pre-approval. Requests for specific pre-approvals may be considered by the full Audit Committee. In addition, the Audit Committee has delegated to the Chair the authority to grant specific pre-approvals. Any such pre-approvals are reported to the full Audit Committee at its next meeting. The Policy is evaluated and updated annually by the Audit Committee. For fiscal year 2018, all services provided by PwC were approved by the Audit Committee. 
Report of the Audit Committee
​
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of the Company's previous or future filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that might incorporate this proxy statement or future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in whole or part, the following report shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any such filing. 
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board of Directors to assist the Board in the oversight of  (i) the integrity of the financial statements of the Company, (ii) the qualifications and independence of the Company's independent auditor, (iii) the performance of the Company's internal audit function and independent auditors, and (iv) the compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements. All members of the Audit Committee meet the criteria for independence applicable to audit committee members under NYSE Listing Standards and the rules and regulations of the SEC relating to audit committees. The Audit Committee Charter complies with NYSE Listing Standards.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Management is responsible for the financial reporting process, including its internal control over financial reporting, and for the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements, and expressing opinions on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and review these processes and act in an oversight capacity. The Audit Committee does not certify the financial statements or guarantee the independent registered public accounting firm's report. The Audit Committee relies, without independent verification, on the information provided to it, including representations made by management and the independent registered public accounting firm, including its audit report. 
The Audit Committee discussed with PwC, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requirements. The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from PwC required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with PwC its independence. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 with management and PwC. Based on the review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements of the Company be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

Proposal 4 — SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL
The International Brotherhood of DuPont Workers, P.O. Box 10, Waynesboro, VA 22980, the holder of 250 shares of Chemours common stock, has advised Chemours that it intends to introduce at the Annual Meeting the proposal and supporting statement quoted verbatim below. 
For the reasons set forth by the Company in the section titled Chemours' Statement in Opposition to Proposal 4, following the Proponent's proposal and supporting statement, the Company disagrees with Proponent's proposal and supporting statement. 
RESOLVED: That the stockholders of The Chemours Company, assembled in annual meeting in person and by proxy, hereby recommend the following nonbinding proposal: 
That the Board of Directors prepare a report, to be made available to shareholders four months after the 2019 Annual Meeting, that shall review the compensation packages provided to senior executives of the Company and address the following. 
1.
Comparison of compensation packages for senior executives with that provided to the lowest paid Company employees. 
​
2.
Whether there should be a ceiling on compensation provided to senior executives so as to prevent the possibility of excessive compensation. 
​
3.
Whether compensation of senior executives should be adjusted in a situation where there is a stated need for employees to be laid off from work. 
​
Stockholders' Statement 
Pay for senior executives of Chemours is determined by its Board of Directors. According to the March 2018 proxy statement, non-employee members of the Board receive annual compensation ranging from $230,000 to $340,000 for their service on the Board. 
Yet it does not appear that these members of the Board are required to attend any meetings or even participate in conference calls. Nor is it clear precisely what work, if any, is actually performed by any individual member of the Board. All that is said is that each director attended at least 75% of the Board meetings and meetings of the Committees on which they served. 
Given this extraordinarily generous compensation provided to the members of the Board, is it any surprise that these same members have approved extraordinarily generous compensation ranging from $2.1 million to $9.9 million for senior executives of Chemours? Can we just view this back and forth between the Board and senior executives as simply that of  "one hand washing the other"? 
Not surprisingly, virtually nothing is said in the proxy statement regarding how the employees of Chemours —  those who are not executives — are compensated. This failure is no surprise given that employees have been granted the most minimal of wage increases and have experienced the Company eliminating its 3% contribution to each employee's savings and investment plan. 
This proposal seeks to have the Board address these issues of compensation, issues involving not just the compensation of executives, but also how the executives are compensated in relation to how its non-executive employees are compensated. 
If you AGREE with this proposal, please mark your proxy FOR this resolution. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Chemours' Statement in Opposition to Proposal 4
The Board unanimously recommends a vote "AGAINST" the shareholder proposal. 
After careful consideration, and for the reasons set forth below, the Board believes it is not in the best interests of Chemours or its shareholders for the Board to engage in the proposal's requested review and report. 
Chemours' executive compensation philosophy supports long-term shareholder value and drives fairness and consistency across the Company. 
Our employees have a wide range of responsibilities, and we believe that all of our employees make contributions that are important to our success. We are committed to paying our employees fairly in accordance with their job responsibilities, their performance in those jobs and their ability to contribute to our overall success, taking into account competitive and market factors. 
Within this overall framework, compensation for employees at different levels within Chemours is determined based on different factors. As discussed in more detail under "Executive Compensation Philosophy and Pay-for-Performance" in this Proxy Statement, the executive compensation framework for Named Executive Officers (NEOs) is purposely different from that for other employees, as NEOs realize the greatest rewards through the achievement of corporate objectives. This approach aligns the pay outcomes of executives with company performance and shareholder interests. Exemplifying the strong link between NEO pay and company performance, for fiscal year 2018, 87% of the CEO's target compensation and 71% of the other NEOs' target compensation, on average, was variable based on the achievement of performance measures. Accordingly, the total compensation program for senior executives emphasizes at-risk incentive pay and, therefore, fluctuates with financial results and stock price, whereas other employees may experience less volatility in compensation. 
The proposal suggests that a disparity between NEO pay and the pay to other Company employees may indicate that management has undue influence on the Board. Chemours has established governance processes that are reflected in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and the various Board Committee charters, including policies and processes designed to ensure the independence of Chemours' non-employee directors. These policies and charters are available on the Chemours website at https://investors.chemours.com/corporate-governance/default.aspx. In addition, in accordance with the expectations set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, all directors attended over 75% of the Board meetings and meetings of the Committees on which they served. A description of the Board's corporate governance practices and each Committee's responsibilities may be found under "Corporate Governance" and "Board Structure and Committee Composition" in this Proxy Statement. 
Our Compensation and Leadership Development Committee has responsibility for overseeing Chemours' executive compensation programs and for approving the compensation of the NEOs, and in regards to our CEO, recommends CEO compensation to our Board for approval. Accordingly, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee is best positioned to determine what factors should be considered when making decisions on executive pay and to implement executive compensation practices that are aligned with the interests of our shareholders and our pay-for-performance philosophy. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee has developed a compensation program for NEOs that it believes best serves shareholder interests and which has received support from shareholders, as described below. 
Chemours' executive compensation program and pay-for-performance philosophy is carefully designed to attract, retain and motivate executive talent. 
Chemours competes for executive talent and must provide competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain talented employees, as well as to reward for strong business and financial results. As discussed in more detail under "Executive Compensation Philosophy and Pay-for-Performance" in this Proxy Statement, Chemours' executive compensation programs currently reward high-performing executive talent for sustained, strong business and financial results. Chemours believes that adoption of the review and report requested by the proponent does not serve to enhance a compensation decision-making process that is focused on the enhancement of long-term shareholder value, taking into account best practices, market competitiveness and the Company's strategic, operational and financial goals. Implementation of the proposal may ultimately result in loss of executive talent or significantly hinder the Company's ability to be competitive in the global market for talent.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Shareholders have demonstrated their support for Chemours' executive compensation programs. 
At the 2018 Annual Meeting, shareholders expressed strong support for the Company's executive compensation programs, with more than 96% of votes cast approving executive compensation practices and disclosure. Shareholders expressed their support following review of the information necessary to understand and assess the compensation decisions made with respect to NEOs, and the firm as a whole, including through "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" in this Proxy Statement. 
Chemours believes this Proxy Statement provides more meaningful information for shareholders about the compensation paid to our executives than the analysis and report requested by this proposal. The Proxy Statement includes a detailed discussion of our compensation objectives and methods, including the process by which compensation decisions are made in the context of the Chemours business, which is large, operationally complex and global. Additionally, in last year's Proxy Statement and in this Proxy Statement, we have provided disclosures regarding the ratio of our CEO's pay to that of our median employee in accordance with SEC rules. Given the extensive compensation-related disclosures already provided to our shareholders, the requested review and report would divert our resources and attention while providing shareholders with little or no incremental information. 
​
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "AGAINST" THIS SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL.
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Certain relationships and transactions
The Board has adopted "Policies and Procedures for Transactions with Related Persons" to assist it in reviewing, approving and ratifying related person transactions and to assist the Company in preparing the disclosures that the rules and regulations of the SEC require to be included in the Company's applicable SEC filings. Pursuant to the policies and procedures, any reported transaction between the Company and a "Related Person" that may qualify as a "Related Person Transaction" will be referred to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or any other committee comprised of independent directors designated by the Board. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (or its Chair, under some circumstances) will determine whether to approve, ratify, disapprove or reject any Related Person Transaction following consideration of all relevant factors, including, without limitation, the following: (i) the commercial reasonableness of the transaction; (ii) the materiality of the Related Person's direct or indirect interest in the transaction; (iii) whether the transaction may involve a conflict of interest, or the appearance of one; (iv) whether the transaction was in the ordinary course of business; (v) the benefits to the Company; (vi) the availability of other sources for comparable products or services; and (vii) the impact of the transaction on the Related Person's independence under the Company's Corporate Governance
Guidelines and applicable regulatory and listing standards. Related Person Transactions will be approved or ratified only if they are determined to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
If a Related Person Transaction that has not been previously approved or ratified is discovered, the Related Person Transaction will be presented to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for ratification. If the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not ratify the Related Person Transaction, then the Company will ensure all appropriate disclosures regarding the transaction are made and, if appropriate, take all reasonable actions to attempt to terminate the Company's participation in the transaction. 
It is expected that the Company and its subsidiaries may purchase products and services from and/or sell products and services to companies of which certain of the Company's directors or executive officers, or their immediate family members, are directors or employees. Chemours carries out transactions with these entities on customary terms, and, in many instances, the Company's directors and executive officers may not be aware of them. To the Company's knowledge, since the beginning of fiscal year 2018, no related person has had a material interest in any of the Company's business transactions or relationships.

general Information about the meeting
Q.
Why am I being asked to review these materials? 
​
A.
The Board is soliciting proxies for use at the Annual Meeting to be held on April 30, 2019, beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time, in the Caesar Rodney Ballroom at The Westin Hotel, located at 818 Shipyard Drive, Wilmington, DE 19801. In order to solicit your proxy, the Company must furnish you with this Notice and Proxy Statement, which contains information about the proposals to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting. As a Company shareholder, you are invited to attend the Annual Meeting and are entitled and encouraged to vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement. This Proxy Statement and the Company's Annual Report to Shareholders are first being mailed to the Company's shareholders and made available on the Internet on or about March 14, 2019. 
​
Q.
Why am I being asked to review materials online? 
​
A.
In accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, instead of mailing a printed copy of the Company's proxy materials to each shareholder, the Company is furnishing proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement and Annual Report to Shareholders, by providing access on the Internet rather than mailing printed copies of the materials. Most shareholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless they request them. Instead, a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") has been sent to most of the Company's shareholders with instructions on how to access and review the proxy materials on the Internet. The Notice also provides instructions on how you may submit your proxy on the Internet. If you would like to receive a paper or email copy of the Company's proxy materials, please follow the instructions for requesting such materials in the Notice. 
​
Q.
How does the Board recommend I vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement? 
​
A.
The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" each of the director nominees to the Board 
​
(Proposal 1), "FOR" approval of the compensation of the named executive officers (Proposal 2), "FOR" ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 3), and "AGAINST" the shareholder proposal on executive compensation (Proposal 4). 
Q.
Who may vote at the meeting? 
​
A.
Only holders of Chemours common stock at the close of business on March 5, 2019 (the "Record Date") are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Each outstanding share of common stock is entitled to one vote. On the Record Date, there were 166,282,468 shares of Chemours common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. 
​
Q.
How do I vote? 
​
A.
If your shares are registered directly in your own name with the Company's transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered a "shareholder of record" with respect to those shares, and the Notice has been sent directly to you. 
​
As a record holder, you may submit your proxy in advance of the Annual Meeting using any of the following alternatives: 
VIA INTERNET at www.AALVote.com/CC 
BY TELEPHONE by dialing: 866-804-9616
BY MAIL by completing and mailing in a paper proxy card. 
Or you may vote IN PERSON at the Annual Meeting. 
If, like most shareholders of the Company, you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you are considered a "beneficial owner" of those shares, holding the shares in "street name." If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you will receive instructions from your broker or other nominee describing how to vote your shares. To vote at the Annual Meeting, beneficial owners will need to contact the broker, trustee or nominee that holds their shares to obtain a "legal proxy" to bring to the meeting. 
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q.
What is the deadline for voting if I do not plan to attend the Annual Meeting? 
​
A.
You may submit your proxy via the Internet or by telephone until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 29, 2019, or the Company's agent must receive your paper proxy card by mail on or before April 29, 2019. 
​
If your shares are held in "street name," please refer to the voting instructions from your broker, trustee or other nominee. 
Q.
If I provide voting instructions and/or grant my proxy, who will vote my shares at the Annual Meeting and how will they vote my shares? 
​
A.
Mark E. Newman and David C. Shelton are Officers of the Company and were named by the Board as proxy holders. They will vote all proxies, or record an abstention, in accordance with the directions on the proxy. If no contrary direction is given, the shares will be voted as recommended by the Board. 
​
Q.
Who will count the votes? 
​
A.
A representative of Alliance Advisors, LLC, an independent tabulator, will count the vote and act as the inspector of election. 
​
Q.
Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy? 
​
A.
Yes. Submission of a later proxy by any means by the deadlines described herein or voting in person at the Annual Meeting will change your prior vote. Beneficial owners who wish to change their vote must follow the procedures provided by their broker, bank or other nominee. 
​
Q.
Can I revoke a proxy? 
​
A.
Yes. A shareholder of record may revoke a properly executed proxy at any time before its exercise by submitting a letter addressed to, and received by, the Corporate Secretary of the Company, by delivering later dated proxy instructions or by voting in person at the meeting. Beneficial owners who wish to revoke their proxy should contact their broker, bank or other nominee. Attendance at the meeting alone 
​
will not revoke a proxy. Without a legal proxy from the record owner, beneficial owners cannot revoke their proxies in person at the Annual Meeting because the actual registered shareholders — the broker, bank or other nominees — will not be present. Beneficial owners who wish to vote at the Annual Meeting must obtain a legal proxy from their broker, bank or other nominee. 
Q.
What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice, proxy or voting instruction card? 
​
A.
It means your shares are registered differently or are in more than one account. For all Notices you receive, please submit your proxy by Internet for each control number you have been assigned. If you received paper copies of proxy materials, please provide voting instructions for all proxy and voting instruction cards you receive. The Company encourages you to register all your accounts in the same name and address. Registered shareholders may contact the Company's transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, P.O. Box 505000, Louisville, KY 40233-5000; (866) 478-8569. Beneficial owners holding Chemours common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee should contact their broker, bank or nominee and request consolidation of their accounts. 
​
Q.
What is a quorum? Why is a quorum required? 
​
A.
Return of your proxy is important because a quorum is required for the Company shareholders to conduct business at the meeting. The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of shares having a majority of the voting power represented by all issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote on the record date will constitute a quorum, permitting the Company to conduct the business of the meeting. Proxies received but marked as abstentions, if any, will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the meeting for quorum purposes. Because this proxy includes a "routine" management proposal, shares represented by "broker non-votes" will be counted in determining whether there is a quorum present. If there is not a quorum present at the Annual Meeting, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the Annual Meeting to a later time.
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q.
How will votes be counted on shares held through brokers? 
​
A.
If you are a beneficial owner and do not provide your broker with voting instructions, your shares may constitute "broker non-votes." Generally, broker non-votes occur on a matter when a broker is not permitted to vote on that matter without instructions from the beneficial owner and instructions are not given. Brokers are not entitled to vote on the election of directors or the advisory proposal to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, unless the brokers receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner. The shares of a shareholder whose shares are not voted because of a broker non-vote on a particular matter will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting so long as the shares are represented at the meeting. In tabulating the voting result for any particular proposal, shares that constitute broker non-votes are not considered present and entitled to vote on that proposal. Thus, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any matter being voted on at the Annual Meeting, assuming that a quorum is obtained. Brokers will be permitted to vote without voting instructions on the ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, assuming that a quorum is obtained and therefore no broker non-votes are expected with respect to that proposal.
​
Q.
How many votes are needed to elect the director nominees and approve each of the proposals? 
​
A. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
​  Proposal   ​ ​  Vote Required   ​ ​  Broker Discretionary Voting Allowed?   ​ 
​  Election of Directors   ​ ​  Majority of Votes Cast   ​ ​  No   ​ 
​  Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation   ​ ​  Majority of Votes Represented and Entitled to Vote   ​ ​  No   ​

​  Shareholder Proposal   ​ ​  Majority of Votes Represented and Entitled to Vote   ​ ​  No  ​ 
[END TABLE]
For the election of directors, under the Bylaws, the number of votes cast "for" a nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" the nominee for the nominee to be elected as a director. For all other matters, except as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws or applicable law, the approval of the holders of a majority of votes represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal is required for approval of a proposal under the Bylaws. The proposals to ratify our independent accountants and approve, on an advisory basis, executive compensation, and the shareholder proposal require shareholder approval pursuant to this standard. In accordance with the voting standards set forth above, abstentions have no effect on the election of directors but have the same effect as votes "against" the other proposals. 
Q.
What happens if an incumbent director nominee does not receive a majority of the votes cast for his or her re-election at the Annual Meeting? 
​
A.
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board shall nominate for election or re-election only those candidates who agree to tender, promptly following the annual meeting at which they are elected or re-elected as a director, their irrevocable resignations contingent upon their failure to receive a majority of the votes cast for their election in an election that is not a contested election and the Board's acceptance of such resignations. In the event an incumbent director fails to receive the required vote for re-election, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the resignation of the incumbent director. The Board will act on the resignation, taking into account the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and publicly disclose its decision within ninety (90) days following certification of the election results. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in making its recommendation and the Board in making its decision may consider all facts and circumstances they consider relevant or appropriate in reaching their determinations. 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
Q.
Where can I find voting results of the Annual Meeting? 
​
A.
Chemours will announce preliminary general voting results at the meeting and publish final detailed voting results on a Current Report on Form 8-K that Chemours will file with the SEC within four business days after the meeting. 
​
Q.
Who will bear the cost for soliciting votes for the Annual Meeting? 
​
A.
Chemours will bear all expenses in conjunction with the solicitation of the enclosed proxy, including the charges of brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees or fiduciaries for forwarding documents to security owners and the fee to Innisfree M&A Incorporated ("Innisfree"), who will help the Company solicit proxies. Chemours anticipates that the fee to Innisfree will be approximately $12,500, plus expenses. In addition, proxies may be solicited by mail, email, in person, or by telephone or fax by certain of the Company's directors, officers and other employees. 
​
Q.
Who may attend the Annual Meeting? What is the process for attending the Annual Meeting? 
​
A.
If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, you must be a holder of Company shares as of the Record Date of March 5, 2019, and obtain an admission ticket in advance. Tickets will be available to registered and beneficial owners. You can request an admission ticket from Chemours Investor Relations by calling (302) 773-3291 or by e-mailing annualmeeting@chemours.com. You must bring your admission ticket to the Annual Meeting to ensure access to the meeting. 
​
Requests for admission tickets will be processed in the order in which they are received and must be requested no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on April 23, 2019. Please note that seating is limited. As a result, Chemours is not able to admit the guests of either shareholders or their legal proxy holders. Requests for tickets will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis. 
On the day of the meeting, each shareholder will be required to present: a valid picture identification such as a driver's license or passport, a copy of your brokerage statement (if you hold your shares in street name) and your admission ticket. You may be denied admission if you do not provide this information. Registration will begin at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time and the Annual Meeting will begin at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. Cameras (including cell phones with photographic capabilities), recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted at the meeting. You will be required to enter through a security check point before being granted access to the meeting. 
Q.
Can I access future annual meeting materials through the Internet rather than receiving them by mail? 
​
A.
Yes. 
​
Shareholders of record can sign up for electronic delivery at www.allianceproxy.com/chemours/​2019. If you submit your proxy through the Internet, you can also sign up for electronic delivery by following the instructions that appear after you finish voting. You will receive an e-mail next year containing links to the Company's Annual Report to Shareholders and the Proxy Statement for the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting. 
Beneficial owners may also have the opportunity to receive copies of these documents electronically. Please check the information provided in the proxy materials mailed to you by your broker or other nominee regarding the availability of this service. This procedure reduces the printing costs and fees the Company incurs in connection with the solicitation of proxies. 
Q.
What is "householding"? 
​
A.
As permitted by SEC rules, the Company has adopted a procedure called "householding," under which multiple shareholders who have the same address will receive a single Notice and, if applicable, a single set of annual report and other proxy materials, unless one or more of these shareholders notifies the Company that they wish to continue receiving individual copies. 
​
Shareholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. This procedure can result in significant savings to the Company by reducing printing and postage costs. 
If you are a registered holder and would like to participate in householding, or if you participate 
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
in householding and would like to receive a separate set of proxy materials, please contact Alliance Advisors, LLC by calling 1-877-777-2857 or by e-mailing requests@viewproxy.com. Beneficial owners should contact their broker or other nominee for information about householding. 
Q.
How can I communicate with the Company's Board? 
​
A.
Shareholders and other interested parties may send communications to the Board in care of the Corporate Secretary, The Chemours Company, 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19899. Please indicate whether your message is 
​
for the Board as a whole, a particular group or committee of directors, or an individual director. 
Q.
What if I have additional questions? 
​
A.
If you have additional questions about the Annual Meeting or any of the information presented in this Proxy Statement, you may direct your questions to Chemours Investor Relations at annualmeeting@chemours.com, or call (302) 773-3291.
