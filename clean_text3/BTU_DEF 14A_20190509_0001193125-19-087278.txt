Dear Fellow Stockholder: 
It is my pleasure to invite you to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Thursday, May 9 in St. Louis. 
We believe that 2018 marked a year of substantial achievements even in the face of notable challenges. Your company earned $645.7 million in income from continuing operations, net of income taxes, on Adjusted EBITDA1 of $1.38 billion and revenue of $5.58 billion, while generating Free Cash Flow2 of $1.36 billion. The company also completed an attractive acquisition of the Shoal Creek hard-coking coal mine in Alabama and reduced liabilities by more than $550 million. Peabody initiated a quarterly dividend and increased the per-share payout as the year progressed, even as we expanded the share buyback program and completed $1.1 billion of share repurchases over 18 months. Most recently, we have announced an approximately $200 million supplemental dividend, or $1.85 per share, recognizing our strong cash flow generating capability. 
Some headwinds persisted in 2018, including macro concerns around global GDP growth and trade wars that led to equity declines across the resource sector in general and coal specifically. These issues were exacerbated by a fire in September at the company's North Goonyella Mine, which resulted in second-half provisions and ongoing costs, and the company is now executing its plan to resume operations. For the full year, shares of BTU lost 22% from a total shareholder return perspective, whereas a representative group of U.S. coal equities declined an average of 24%. Sixteen of 23 global coal equities and master limited partnerships lost value during 2018. These challenges in 2018 detracted from BTU's total shareholder return of 40% as measured from the company's relisting in April 2017 through December 2018. 
A fundamental tenet at Peabody is that how we behave is just as important as what we accomplish. In 2018, Peabody continued to emphasize its environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices and conducted outreach with shareholders on our ESG approach. The company was recognized with a number of national and international ESG, safety, land restoration and employment practices awards. I invite you to further explore the company's ESG practices and what we colloquially call "Coal Done Right" in our Corporate and Social Responsibility Report. 
As chairman of Peabody, I believe that good governance is a journey rather than a destination. I use such times as the proxy to evaluate both how far we've come and where we are heading. Since our last annual meeting, the board has continued to provide oversight on good governance, strategy and risk management. In 2018, we have advanced a new compensation program that is consistent with best practices and aligns management with stockholders. We are also pleased to have added Andrea Bertone, former President of Duke Energy International, to our board. Ms. Bertone increases the skills, experience and diversity of a board already high in quality and international in scope. 
As we enter 2019, we do so as a company that remains committed to delivering results and generating value across an increasingly seaborne-oriented company. Our financial approach continues to be focused on generating cash, maintaining financial strength, investing wisely and returning cash to shareholders. We believe that this focus, matched by a commitment to best practices in ESG, provides the best opportunity for real value creation over time. 
Thank you for your time and ongoing support of Peabody. 
Bob Malone 
Chair of the Board

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS 
Peabody's 2018 executive compensation program was the first full-year executive pay program since the company successfully emerged from Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code ("Chapter 11") reorganization in April 2017. The program included fundamental changes that evidence our pay-for-performance approach to executive compensation. This approach aligns with the company's current business strategy and is designed to motivate and reward our leaders for long-term performance and enhanced company value. Our 2018 compensation program design and pay levels were significantly different from those of 2017. The 2017 design and pay levels were driven by programs specific to the period the company was in Chapter 11 through Emergence. In addition, in response to last year's Say-on-Pay vote, we engaged with and listened to our investors. We believe that our 2018 executive compensation program supported the company's strategic objectives and was aligned with stockholder interests and the feedback provided by our owners during that engagement process. 
The 2018 executive compensation program for our named executive officers ("Named Executive Officers" or "NEOs") is summarized in the following table:

BOARD RESPONSIVENESS TO STOCKHOLDERS – HOW WE ENGAGED IN RESPONSE TO SAY-ON-PAY VOTE 
Stockholder Outreach 
Peabody engaged in open and constructive dialogue with its stockholders throughout 2018 and into 2019. During this time, Peabody reached out to 24 institutional stockholders, representing about 87% of total shares outstanding as of March 18, 2019, to solicit feedback on the company's compensation programs and other governance matters. 
Meetings with Board Members and Senior Management 
Members of management directly engaged with 9 institutional stockholders, representing about 66% of our total shares outstanding, to articulate our compensation philosophy and solicit feedback on our compensation programs. Our Compensation Committee Chair participated in 8 of these meetings, representing 58% of our total shares outstanding. 
Matters Discussed 
In addition to Say-on-Pay matters, members of the Peabody team discussed the company's strategy and value proposition; fundamental drivers of the long-term success of the business; the company's holistic approach to ESG matters; board composition and operations; and sustainability. 
Outcomes 
After considering input from stockholders received through an extensive engagement effort, we believe that the 2018 compensation program is properly aligned with stockholder feedback and addresses the concerns raised regarding the outsized equity awards and the desire for greater linkage between pay and performance with the 2017 program. Changes to 2018 compensation relative to 2017 included aligning the STIP more closely with the achievement of strategic priorities, and both reducing the value of LTIP awards granted and making the majority of the LTIP awards performance-based rather than time-based (60% PSUs and 40% RSUs). In addition to extensive stockholder engagement, we sought the advice of the Compensation Committee's independent consultant and other external advisors. 
The Compensation Committee believes that the 2018 executive compensation program and pay levels are aligned with the views expressed by our stockholders and are consistent with our overall compensation objectives. As shown in the chart below, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table values for our CEO and the other NEOs (on average) reflect a significant reduction from 2017. 
SUMMARY OF CERTAIN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PRACTICES 
The table below highlights our current executive compensation practices, including practices we have implemented because we believe they drive performance, and the practices we have not implemented because we do not believe they would serve our stockholders' long-term interests.

PROPOSAL 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The Board has nominated Andrea E. Bertone, Nicholas J. Chirekos, Stephen E. Gorman, Glenn L. Kellow, Joe W. Laymon, Teresa S. Madden, Bob Malone, Kenneth W. Moore, Michael W. Sutherlin and Shaun A. Usmar for election as directors, each to serve for a term of one year or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. Each nominee is currently serving as a director and has consented to serve for the new term. Should any of them become unavailable for election, your proxy authorizes us to vote for such other person, if any, as the Board may recommend. 
Overview of Director Election Process 
Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Bylaws ("bylaws"), the Board shall consist of at least three members and no more than 15, and may be fixed from time to time by a resolution adopted by the Board or by the stockholders. At present, the Board has ten members. Directors need not be stockholders but are subject to certain share ownership requirements as described below.

Director Selection and Evaluation Process 
Current Board 
Our current Board consists of our President and CEO, Glenn L. Kellow, and nine independent directors: Bob Malone (Chair), Andrea E. Bertone, Nicholas J. Chirekos, Stephen E. Gorman, Joe W. Laymon, Teresa S. Madden, Kenneth W. Moore, Michael W. Sutherlin and Shaun A. Usmar. All of our current Board members other than Ms. Bertone (who was appointed to the Board on February 21, 2019) were elected to serve for a one-year term at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2018 Annual Meeting") and were initially appointed on April 3, 2017 when the company successfully emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization (the "Emergence"). 
Overview of Director Nominating Process 
The Board believes one of its primary goals is to advise management on strategy and to monitor our performance. The Board also believes the best way to accomplish this goal is by choosing directors who possess a diversity of experience, knowledge and skills that are particularly relevant and helpful to us. As such, current Board members and director nominees possess a wide array of skills and experience in the coal industry, related energy industries and other important areas, including engineering, finance and accounting, operations, environmental affairs, international affairs, governmental affairs and administration, public policy, corporate governance, board service and executive management. When evaluating potential members, the Board seeks to enlist the services of candidates who possess high ethical standards and a combination of skills and experience which the Board determines are the most appropriate to meet its objectives. The Board believes all candidates should be committed to creating value over the long term and to serving our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying, evaluating and recommending qualified candidates for election to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates submitted by stockholders in accordance with the process outlined below. 
Any stockholder wishing to submit a candidate for consideration should send the following information to the Corporate Secretary, Peabody Energy Corporation, Peabody Plaza, 701 Market Street, St. Louis, Missouri 63101: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –  Stockholder's name, number of shares owned, length of period held and proof of ownership;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –  Candidate's name, age and address;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –  A detailed resume describing, among other things, the candidate's educational background, occupation, employment  history and material outside commitments (e.g., memberships on other boards and committees, charitable foundations, etc.);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –  A supporting statement which describes the candidate's reasons for seeking election to the Board, and documents the  candidate's ability to satisfy the director qualifications criteria described above;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –  A description of any arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and the candidate; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –  A signed statement from the candidate confirming his/her willingness to serve on the Board, if elected.   
[END TABLE]
Stockholders may submit potential director candidates at any time in accordance with these procedures. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider such candidates if a vacancy arises or if the Board decides to expand its membership, and at such other times as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee deems necessary or appropriate. We recently modified our bylaws to implement "proxy access," a means for stockholders to include stockholder-nominated director candidates in our proxy materials for annual meetings of stockholders. Separate procedures apply if a stockholder wishes to nominate a director candidate at the 2020 Annual Meeting. Those procedures are described below under the heading "Process for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations." 
Under its charter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee must review with the Board, at least annually, the requisite qualifications, independence, skills and characteristics of Board candidates, members and the Board as a whole. While the selection of qualified directors is a complex and subjective process that requires consideration of many intangible factors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes candidates should generally meet the criteria listed below under the heading "Director Qualifications." The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider candidates submitted by a variety of sources, including stockholder nominees, when filling vacancies and/or expanding the Board and will evaluate each potential candidate's educational background, employment history, outside commitments and other relevant factors to determine whether he/she is potentially qualified to serve on the Board. Qualified stockholder nominees will be evaluated on the same basis as those submitted by Board members or other sources. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that its process for selecting directors will consistently produce highly qualified, independent Board members. However, the Committee may choose, from time to time, to use additional resources (including independent third-party search firms) after determining that such resources could enhance a particular director search. 
Director Qualifications 
Under its charter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews with the Board, at least annually, the requisite qualifications, independence, skills and characteristics of Board candidates, members, and the Board. While the selection of qualified directors is a complex and subjective process that requires consideration of many intangible factors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that candidates should generally meet the following criteria: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Broad experience and a successful track record at senior policymaking levels in business, government, education,  technology, accounting, law, consulting and/or administration;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The highest personal and professional ethics, integrity and values;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Commitment to representing our long-term interests and those of all our  stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An inquisitive and objective perspective, strength of character and the mature judgment essential to effective decision-making;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Expertise that is useful to us and complementary to the background and experience of other Board members; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sufficient time to devote to Board and committee activities and to enhance their knowledge of our business, operations and  industry.  
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that all of our current directors meet these criteria. In addition, as outlined below, each director brings a strong and unique background and set of skills to the Board, giving the Board competence and experience in a wide variety of areas, including mining and related industries, end-user segments (energy/steel), mergers and acquisitions ("M&A"), finance and accounting, human capital and organizational health, restructuring, global operations, health, safety and environmental affairs, international, governmental affairs and administration, public policy, corporate governance, legal and regulatory, board service and executive management. We believe the Board as a whole and each of our directors individually possess the necessary qualifications and skills to effectively advise management on strategy, monitor our performance and serve our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. 
The following table shows our directors' specific skills and knowledge that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Board relied upon when determining whether to nominate the individual for election. A particular nominee may possess other valuable skills, knowledge, or experience even though they are not indicated below. 
Diversity 
Peabody is an equal opportunity employer and, in addition, one of our core values is to offer an inclusive workplace. Our policies and practices support diversity of thought, perspective, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, culture and professional experience, among others. While the Board does not have a formal policy of considering diversity when evaluating director candidates, the Board does believe that its members should reflect diversity in professional experience, cultural experience, gender and ethnic background. These factors, together with the director qualifications criteria noted above, are considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in assessing potential new directors. 
Board Evaluations 
The Board conducts an annual self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively. Pursuant to its charter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for developing and administering an annual review process to evaluate the performance of the Board. This annual review process includes the annual solicitation of comments from all directors, after which the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reports to the Board with an assessment of the Board's performance, which is discussed by the full Board. The Board has confirmed that each committee and the Board as a whole is functioning effectively. 
Board Training and Development 
From time to time, the Board members attend ongoing training and development sessions. For instance, in 2018 our directors participated in an in-boardroom training event provided by the National Association of Corporate Directors. 
Director Involvement in Stockholder Engagement 
Peabody management and Board members engaged in open and constructive dialogue with our stockholders throughout 2018 and into 2019. The Board and the Compensation Committee value these discussions and will continue to engage with stockholders to continue to solicit feedback about our executive compensation programs and other matters. 
Feedback provided by our stockholders related to executive compensation and other governance matters was shared with the Compensation Committee and the full Board. After considering this input from stockholders, which is described in detail below under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the Board determined the already established 2018 compensation program that was designed by the Compensation Committee and in place by early 2018 was properly aligned with stockholder feedback. The Compensation Committee believes that the 2018 executive compensation program and pay levels are aligned with the views expressed by our stockholders (who generally supported the 2018 executive compensation program structure) and are consistent with our overall compensation objectives.

Director Attendance 
The Board met 13 times in fiscal year 2018. During fiscal year 2018, each incumbent director attended 75% or more of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served, and their average attendance was approximately 98%. 
In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the non-management directors meet in executive session at least quarterly. During fiscal 2018, our non-management directors met in executive session six times. Our Chair, Mr. Malone, chaired these executive sessions. 
Under Board policy, each director is expected to attend our annual meetings of stockholders in person, subject to occasional excused absences due to illness or unavoidable conflicts. All of our then-current directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting, and all of our director nominees are expected to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board oversees an enterprise-wide approach to risk management, designed to support the achievement of organizational objectives, including strategic objectives, to enhance long-term organizational performance and stockholder value. A fundamental part of risk management is not only understanding the risks we face, how those risks may evolve over time, and what steps management is taking to manage and mitigate those risks, but also understanding what level of risk tolerance is appropriate for us. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks we face, while the Board, as a whole and through its committees, is responsible for the oversight of risk management. 
In its risk oversight role, the Board has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. The Board regularly reviews information regarding marketing, operations, safety performance, trading, finance and business development as well as the risks associated with each. In addition, the Board holds strategic planning sessions with management to discuss our strategies, key challenges, and risks and opportunities. The full Board receives reports on our enterprise risk management initiatives on at least an annual basis. 
While the Board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight, Board committees also have been allocated responsibility for specific aspects of risk oversight. The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to risk management in the areas of financial reporting, internal controls, risk assessment and risk management. The Compensation Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the risks arising from our compensation policies and programs. The Health, Safety, Security and Environmental Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the risks associated with our health, safety, security and environmental objectives, policies and performance. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the risks associated with board organization, membership and structure, ethics and compliance, political contributions and lobbying expenditures, succession planning for our directors and executive officers, and corporate governance. 
Board Independence 
In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, a majority of our Board must be independent as defined by the NYSE listing standards and the Exchange Act. As required by the NYSE listing standards, the Board evaluates the independence of its members at least annually, and at other appropriate times when a change in circumstances could potentially impact the independence or effectiveness of one or more directors (such as in connection with a change in employment status or other significant status changes). This process is administered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which consists entirely of directors who are independent under applicable NYSE rules. After carefully considering all relevant relationships, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee submits its recommendations regarding independence to the full Board, which then makes a determination with respect to each director. 
On February 21, 2019, the Board determined that all the current members except for Mr. Kellow are independent. In making independence determinations, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including (1) the nature of any relationships with us, (2) the significance of the relationship to us, the other organization and the individual director, (3) whether or not the relationship is solely a business relationship in the ordinary course of our and the other organization's businesses and does not afford the director any special benefits, and (4) any commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable and familial relationships. For purposes of this determination, the Board generally deems any relationships that have expired for more than three years to be immaterial. The Board also considered the relationships described below in "Review of Related Person Transactions." The Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Health, Safety, Security and Environmental Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are each comprised of independent directors. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines permit the roles of Chair and CEO to be filled by different individuals. Effective May 1, 2017, the Board elected Mr. Malone to the role of non-executive Chair of the Board of the company after its Emergence. 
Our Board leadership structure provides for strong oversight by independent directors. The Board is currently comprised of Mr. Kellow and nine independent directors. All Board committees are chaired by and composed entirely of independent directors, except for the Executive Committee, of which Mr. Kellow is a member. 
As Chair, Mr. Malone's duties are to:

Corporate Governance 
Good corporate governance is a priority at Peabody. Our key governance practices are outlined in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, committee charters, and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. These documents can be found on our website (www.peabodyenergy.com) by clicking on "Investor Info" and then "Corporate Governance." Information on our website is not considered part of this Proxy Statement. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing the Corporate Governance Guidelines from time to time and reporting and making recommendations to the Board concerning corporate governance matters. Each year, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, with the assistance of outside experts, reviews our corporate governance practices, not only to ensure that they comply with applicable laws and NYSE listing requirements, but also to ensure that they continue to reflect what the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes are best practices and promote our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. 
Director Service on Other Public Company Boards 
As stated above, when reviewing qualifications, independence, skills and characteristics of Board candidates and nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee examines whether such candidates or nominees have any material outside commitments (e.g., memberships on other boards and committees, charitable foundations, etc.) which might adversely affect their performance as a director on the Board. Current directors are required to advise the Chair of the Board and the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee prior to accepting an invitation to serve on another public company board. 
It is the current view of the Board that no director should serve on more than four public company boards, including the Board. Except in extraordinary circumstances, and only after the Board has determined that such simultaneous service would not impair the ability of the director to serve effectively on the company's Audit Committee, no member of the company's Audit Committee shall serve simultaneously on the audit committee of more than two other public companies. For purposes of this guideline and as provided under NYSE rules, (i) service on the boards of multiple funds within a single fund complex shall be deemed as service on one public company board, and (ii) service on multiple audit committees within a single fund complex shall be deemed as service on one public company audit committee. 
Majority Voting and Mandatory Director Resignation Policy 
Our bylaws provide for majority voting in the election of directors. In the case of uncontested elections, in order to be elected, the number of shares voted in favor of a nominee must exceed 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that nominee's election at any meeting of stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. Votes cast include votes against or votes to withhold authority with respect to that nominee's election, but exclude abstentions and broker non-votes. 
If a nominee is an incumbent director and does not receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to the nominee's election, such director is expected to promptly tender his or her resignation to the Chair of the Board following certification of the stockholder vote. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will promptly consider the resignation submitted by such director and will recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation. In considering whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider all factors deemed relevant by its members. The Board will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation no later than 90 days following the date of the stockholders' meeting where the election occurred. In considering the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, the Board will consider the factors considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and such additional information and factors the Board deems to be relevant. Any director who tenders his or her resignation under our Corporate 
 Governance Guidelines will not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommendation or Board consideration regarding whether to accept the tendered resignation. 
In the case of contested elections, directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or by proxy and voting for nominees in the election of directors at any meeting of stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For these purposes, a contested election is any election of directors in which the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
We have adopted a code of ethics, the "Code of Business Conduct and Ethics" which can be found on our website (www.peabodyenergy.com) by clicking on "Investor Info" and then "Corporate Governance." The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to all our directors, officers and salaried employees. 
Succession Planning 
Pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, our CEO provides the Board with an annual report on succession planning and related development recommendations. The report includes a short-term succession plan which delineates temporary delegation of authority in the event that the CEO or any other executive officer is unable to perform his or her duties. 
Director Compensation 
The 2018 compensation of non-employee directors consisted of cash compensation (annual Board and committee retainers) and equity compensation. Each of these components is described in more detail below. Any director who was also our employee received no additional compensation for serving as a director. In setting director compensation, the Compensation Committee received input from F.W. Cook, its independent compensation consultant. In addition, our 2017 Incentive Plan places a limit of $600,000 total on cash and equity compensation that may be awarded to each non-employee director in any calendar year. 
In July 2018, F.W. Cook conducted a competitive market review of our non-employee director compensation program. For purposes of this review, data was collected from the same peer group we utilized for executive compensation decisions (as described below under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis"). Based on this review, F.W. Cook presented to the Compensation Committee an analysis of and recommendations for our director compensation program. Because the review indicated that the company's per-director compensation is comparable to the peer group median, no changes were made to the non-employee director compensation program or stock ownership requirements for 2018.  
However, the company made the following changes effective for 2019 non-employee director compensation to align with peer group practices and better align the interests of our non-employee directors with those of our stockholders: (1) provided for dividend equivalents on annual deferred stock unit grants to non-employee directors, and (2) increased the Audit Committee Chair cash retainer from $20,000 to $25,000.  
The Board consists of ten directors, including our CEO and nine independent directors. Our Board adopted the following compensation structure for our non-employee directors for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Annual Cash Retainer       $110,000   
 Annual Cash Retainer       $110,000   
 Audit Committee Chair    $  20,000 
 Compensation Committee Chair    $  15,000 
 Health, Safety, Security and Environmental Committee Chair    $  15,000 
 Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chair       $  15,000   
 Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chair       $  15,000   
[END TABLE]
The equity award for our non-employee directors was comprised of deferred stock units ("DSUs"). The number of DSUs granted to each non-employee director was determined by dividing $130,000 by the closing price per share of the company's Common Stock on the grant date (and rounding down to the nearest whole DSU). DSUs generally vest monthly over 12 months. However, the underlying shares are generally not distributed until the earlier of (1) three years after the grant date and (2) the director's separation from service, if this election is made.  
Other Elements of Board Compensation 
In addition to the compensation described above, we paid travel and accommodation expenses of our non-employee directors to attend meetings and other integral corporate functions. Non-employee directors did not receive meeting attendance fees. Non-employee directors could be accompanied by a spouse/partner when traveling on company business on our aircraft or charter aircraft. Non-employee directors also had the opportunity to participate in our charitable contribution matching gifts program at the same level and based on the same guidelines applicable to our full-time employees. 
The following table sets forth compensation for each director (other than Mr. Kellow) who served on the Board in 2018:

As of December 31, 2018, each of these non-employee directors had 8,348 stock awards  outstanding. No options were held by directors as of the end of 2018.  
(3)   All Other Compensation for Mr. Chirekos, Ms. Madden, Mr. Malone and Mr. Moore consists of charitable contributions in  accordance with our matching gifts program.  
[END TABLE]
Non-Employee Director Share Ownership Requirements 
Under our share ownership requirements for directors, each non-employee director is required to acquire and retain Common Stock having a value equal to at least five times his or her annual cash retainer within five years of board appointment. 
If at any time a non-employee director does not meet his or her ownership requirement, the director must retain (1) any Common Stock owned by the director (whether owned directly or indirectly) and (2) any net shares received as the result of the exercise, vesting or payment of any equity award until the ownership requirement is met, in each case unless otherwise approved in writing by the Compensation Committee. For this purpose, "net shares" means the shares of Common Stock that remain after shares are sold or withheld, as the case may be, to (1) pay the exercise price for a stock option award or (2) satisfy any tax obligations, including withholding taxes, arising in connection with the exercise, vesting or payment of an equity award. 
Compliance with these requirements is evaluated as of December 31 of each year. The value of an individual's share ownership as of such date is determined by multiplying the number of shares of our Common Stock or other eligible equity interests held by the individual by the closing price of our stock as of the business day immediately preceding the date of determination. Currently, each non-employee director is in compliance with these requirements and is on-track to meet the share ownership guidelines within the allowable timeframe. 
For purposes of determining stock ownership levels, only the following forms of equity interests are included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• stock owned directly (including stock or stock units held in any defined contribution plan or employee stock purchase plan  and shares of restricted stock);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• stock held by immediate family members residing in the same household or through trusts for the benefit of the person or  his or her immediate family members residing in the same household;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• unvested restricted stock or RSUs (provided that vesting is based solely on the passage of time and/or continued service  with Peabody); and  
[END TABLE]

• vested and undistributed DSUs.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Dear Fellow Stockholder: 
As members of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Peabody, we believe that most executive compensation should be contingent on performance against robust metrics that reflect the interests of our stockholders and the company's long-term business strategy. We also believe that executive compensation should be market competitive to attract and retain high-quality talent and earned compensation should be reasonable compared to actual company performance. 
At the 2018 Annual Meeting, our Say-on-Pay vote received 58% support. The Compensation Committee takes this feedback very seriously. We heard concerns about the magnitude of the 2017 compensation and a desire to see a greater linkage between pay and performance. 
Following last year's vote, the Compensation Committee made a concerted effort to increase engagement with our stockholders regarding our executive compensation program. I have personally had the opportunity to speak with stockholders holding 58% of our shares outstanding. 
After listening to input from stockholders, the Compensation Committee believes the 2018 compensation program aligns with stockholder feedback and addressed the concerns with the 2017 compensation program. The 2018 program also incorporates advice from the Compensation Committee's independent consultant and other external advisors. The following changes were incorporated into the design: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The short-term incentive program is  formula-driven based entirely on business results;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The majority of equity granted to NEOs is tied to performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation opportunities were determined by taking into consideration competitive market information; the breadth, scope,  complexity and criticality of each NEO's role; and internal equity and individual performance; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Based on a competitive market review, the CEO's target total direct compensation will not be increased in 2019.   
[END TABLE]
During September 2018, our North Goonyella Mine in Australia experienced a fire in a portion of the mine, which impacted our financial results. 
As described in more detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the following pay actions demonstrate our pay-for-performance philosophy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The CEO recommended, and both the Compensation Committee and the Special Committee approved, a reduction in the formulaic  results for the 2018 STIP payments for the executive leadership team, including the NEOs, to reflect the impact of the fire at the North Goonyella Mine; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The CEO recommended, and both the Compensation Committee and the Special Committee approved, a further discretionary  reduction for the 2018 STIP payments for the CEO and the President Australia, who have direct line operating responsibility for North Goonyella operations.  
[END TABLE]
On behalf of the Compensation Committee, I would like to thank you for your support and feedback. We are committed to the continued evaluation of our executive compensation programs to ensure they are aligned with the interests of our stockholders. Thank you for your investment in Peabody. I can assure you that the Board, this Committee and management is working hard every day to deliver on the trust you have put in us. 
Sincerely, 
Joe Laymon 
Compensation Committee Chair 
Overview 
Peabody's 2018 executive compensation program was the first full-year executive pay program since the company successfully emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization in April 2017. The program included fundamental changes that evidence our pay-for-performance approach to executive compensation. This approach aligns with the company's current business strategy and is designed to motivate and reward our leaders for long-term performance and enhanced company value. Our 2018 compensation program design and pay levels were significantly different from those of 2017. The 2017 pay levels were driven by programs specific to the period the company was in Chapter 11 through Emergence. In addition, in response to last year's Say-on-Pay vote, we engaged with and listened to our investors. We believe that our 2018 executive compensation program supported the company's strategic objectives and was aligned with stockholder interests and the feedback provided by our owners during that engagement process. Our North Goonyella Mine in Australia experienced a fire in a portion of the mine during September 2018. As a result of this event, and as described below under the subheading "Short-Term Incentive Program," discretionary downward adjustments were made to the results for the 2018 STIP payments for NEOs and other members of the executive leadership team.

Business Highlights for 2018 
Peabody concluded 2018 with strong company-wide Adjusted EBITDA margins1 of approximately 25% for the full year, successful completion of what we believe to be a highly accretive acquisition, robust cash flows and share buybacks that have now surpassed $1 billion. Against the backdrop of favorable seaborne conditions, Peabody began 2019 with a healthy balance sheet, expectations of continued strong operating cash flows and an ongoing commitment to returning cash to stockholders. In particular, 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Response to Last Year's Say-on-Pay Vote 
At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we conducted a Say-on-Pay vote in which we received approximately 58% support. We take these voting results seriously, so following last year's vote, we made a concerted effort to increase engagement with our stockholders regarding our executive compensation program. 
Peabody engaged in open and constructive dialogue with its stockholders throughout 2018 and into 2019. The Board and the Compensation Committee value these discussions and will continue to engage with stockholders to continue to receive feedback about our executive compensation programs. 
Analysis of Executive Compensation Since Emergence from Bankruptcy; Response to Stockholders 
In evaluating the company's executive compensation program for 2018 and the changes made in 2018, it is important to understand the historical context in which the program has developed. The company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 3, 2017 with a new board of directors that formed a new 
 Compensation Committee and, as it related to the CEO, the Special Committee. As part of the company's plan to emerge from bankruptcy, the company established the terms of the 2017 executive compensation program. The 2017 program was part of the company's Plan of Reorganization, which received 93% approval from the creditors, who would become the company's stockholders upon Emergence. The 2017 program reflected the priorities and aligned with the interests of the new stockholders in 2017, and included an RSU grant to all active employees. 
The Emergence awards reflected the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competitive market practices in restructuring;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Desire to retain our high-performing executive team and operations management;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Recognition of cost reduction efficiencies and value created during Chapter 11; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Intent to ensure the sustainability of results.  
[END TABLE]
The 2017 executive compensation program was largely comprised of one-time programs specific to the period the company was in Chapter 11; the program aligned with the interests of the stockholders and with the goals and interests of the company at that time. The Compensation Committee recognized that stockholder interests and the company's business plans and priorities changed from 2017 to 2018. Therefore, the 2018 executive compensation program is grounded in a pay for performance approach, aligns with current business realities and is designed to motivate and reward our leaders for long-term performance and enhanced company value. 
Feedback provided by our stockholders related to executive compensation and other governance matters was shared with the Compensation Committee and full Board. After considering this input from stockholders, we believe that the 2018 compensation program is properly aligned with stockholder feedback and addresses previously raised concerns. In addition to extensive stockholder engagement, we sought the advice of the Compensation Committee's independent consultant and other external advisors. The following table details what the Board heard throughout the course of these conversations and how the 2018 compensation program addressed each concern and reflected changes aligned with stockholder feedback and concerns: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

  What We Heard        What We  Did 
 Some stockholders expressed concern with certain aspects of our 2017 compensation program through the 2018 Say-on-Pay vote.    Peabody reached out to 24 institutional stockholders, holding about 87% of total shares outstanding as of  March 18, 2019, to solicit feedback on the company's compensation programs and related governance policies.   Of these, management met with 9 stockholders holding 66% of our total shares outstanding as of March 18, 2019, and our Compensation Committee Chair  participated in 8 of these meetings with stockholders, representing 58% of our total shares outstanding as of March 18, 2019.

 Some stockholders expressed a desire for greater linkage between pay and performance    The Compensation Committee established 2018 LTIP awards for the NEOs. The majority of the 2018 equity grants to the NEOs were performance-based.   About 59% of the  CEO's 2018 compensation opportunity was performance-based and more than half of the other NEOs' compensation opportunities, on average, was  performance-based.   Performance-based LTIP awards have a three-year performance period, which is consistent with predominant practices in U.S.  long-term incentive programs. Time-based LTIP awards have a three-year ratable vesting term.   The CEO recommended, and both the Compensation Committee and the Special  Committee approved, a discretionary reduction in the formulaic results for the 2018 STIP payments for the executive leadership team, including the NEOs. The reduction is intended to reflect the impact of the fire at the North Goonyella Mine in  Australia. Final awards for the CEO and the President Australia, who have direct line operating responsibility for North Goonyella operations, include an additional reduction.

The Compensation Committee believes that the 2018 executive compensation program and pay levels are aligned with the views expressed by our stockholders and are consistent with our overall compensation objectives. As shown in the chart below, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table values for our CEO and the other NEOs (on average) reflect a significant reduction from 2017. 
We will continue to engage with and solicit feedback on compensation and design practices from our stockholders, who (based on feedback in our outreach discussions) generally supported the 2018 executive compensation program structure. 
2018 Executive Compensation Program Structure 
Our 2018 executive compensation program reflected a combination of salary, annual cash incentives under our STIP and LTIP equity awards. 
The graphs below display the 2018 target total direct compensation mix for our CEO and our other NEOs, as well as the portion that was performance-based. As shown in the graphs below, about 59% of the CEO's target total direct compensation and, on average, about 54% of the target total direct compensation for the other NEOs was performance-based. 
Process for Determining 2018 NEO Compensation 
Our executive compensation philosophy is comprised of the following core principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay-for-performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• STIP awards should be tied to the successful achievement of pre-established  objectives that support our business strategy; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentives should provide opportunities for executives to earn equity  compensation if certain pre-established long-term objectives are successfully achieved.  
[END TABLE]
Summarized below are roles and responsibilities of the parties that participated in the development of the company's 2018 executive compensation program: 
Committees 
The Compensation Committee and, as it relates to the CEO, the independent members of the Board (the "Special Committee" and together with the Compensation Committee, the "Committees"), had responsibility for overseeing our executive compensation framework. The Committees, working with the Committees' independent compensation advisor (discussed further below), other advisors and senior management, sought to align pay with performance and create incentives that reward operational excellence, safety and financial management and that ultimately are designed to create stockholder value. 
The Committees' responsibilities included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• developing our executive compensation philosophy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approving base salaries and STIP and LTIP programs and opportunities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• assessing performance and approving earned incentives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approving LTIP grants including performance goals and award terms; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approving severance programs and executive participation.  
[END TABLE]
In making compensation decisions for 2018, the Committees took a fresh look at the total compensation opportunity for each of our NEOs and modified base salaries and determined incentive targets, taking into consideration: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the breadth, scope, complexity and criticality of each NEO's role;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• competitive market information;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• internal equity or roles of similar responsibilities, experience and organizational impact;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• current compensation levels; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• individual performance.  
[END TABLE]
The Committees did not use a predetermined formula to make overall decisions but generally considered all of the above factors. 
Management 
For 2018, in relation to compensation, the role of the CEO was to review the performance of the other NEOs and make recommendations on base salary, STIP and LTIP opportunities for the other NEOs. 
Independent Compensation Consultants 
The Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisor only after taking into consideration all factors relevant to that person's independence from management and is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation arrangements and oversight of the work of any such person. Under this authority, for 2018 the Compensation Committee engaged an independent compensation consultant, F.W. Cook, after assessing its independence. F.W. Cook does not provide any other services to us and its work in support of the Compensation Committee did not raise any conflicts of interest or independence concerns. F.W. Cook in general provided the Committees with competitive market information, assistance on evaluation of the peer group composition, input to incentive program design, and information on compensation trends. The Board conducts an annual review of the performance of F.W. Cook. 
Competitive Market Information 
Talent for senior-level management positions and key roles in the organization can be acquired across a broad spectrum of companies. As such, we utilized competitive market compensation information for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• as an input in developing base salary levels, STIP targets and LTIP award ranges;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to evaluate the form and mix of equity awarded to NEOs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to assess the competitiveness of total direct compensation opportunities for NEOs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to evaluate share utilization by reviewing overhang levels and annual run rates;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to evaluate share ownership guidelines;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to validate whether our executive compensation program was aligned with our performance; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• as an input in designing compensation plans, benefits and perquisite programs.  
[END TABLE]
This competitive market information comes from both compensation surveys and from a group of companies of similar size and/or complexity as us (the "Compensation Peer Group"), described in more detail in the section below. The survey data provided a significant sample size, included information for management positions below senior executives, and included other industries from which we might recruit for executive positions. The primary survey source was the Willis Towers Watson Executive Database. We did not select the constituent companies comprising this survey group, and the component companies' identities were not a material factor in the applicable compensation analysis. 
As stated above, while the Compensation Committee examined competitive market information from this survey and the Compensation Peer Group, competitive market information was not the sole factor in its decision-making process. 
Compensation Peer Group 
In July 2017, the Compensation Committee approved a revised Compensation Peer Group. In determining the composition of the Compensation Peer Group, our Compensation Committee considered companies that were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• direct business competitors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• labor market competitors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in a similar industry (for example, coal and consumable fuels, mining and metals, energy and other companies subject to  similar economic opportunities and challenges); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• of a similar scale (with revenue and enterprise value generally within 1/3-times to  3-times the size of our company).  
[END TABLE]
Based on review and discussions with F.W. Cook, no changes were made to the Compensation Peer Group for 2018. The Compensation Peer Group for 2018 was comprised of the following companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2018 Compensation Peer Group (18)      Alignment with Peer  Median (2) 
2018 Compensation Peer Group (18)      Alignment with Peer  Median (2) 
 AK Steel Holding Corporation   Freeport-McMoRan Inc.      
 Antero Resources Corporation   The Mosaic Company 
 Arch Coal, Inc.   Newmont Mining Corporation 
 Barrick Gold Corporation   Noble Energy, Inc. 
 Chesapeake Energy Corporation   Packaging Corporation of America 
 Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.   Southwestern Energy Company 
 CONSOL Energy Inc.(1)   SunCoke Energy, Inc. 
 CVR Energy, Inc.   Teck Resources Limited 
 Domtar Corporation   United States Steel Corporation 
[END TABLE]
(1) In November 2017, CONSOL Energy Inc. spun off "CONSOL Mining Corp," which has retained the name CONSOL Energy, Inc. (and remains in the peer group, as it produces and exports coal). 
(2) Data is reflected as of the most recently reported four quarters at January 1, 2019 from S&P's Capital IQ; includes adjustments that may differ from GAAP reporting made by Capital IQ. 
2018 NEO Compensation Determinations and Outcomes 
The following discussion provides details of our executive compensation program determinations and outcomes for each of our NEOs during 2018. 
Base Salaries 
In general, we pay base salaries to the NEOs to provide them with a level of fixed income for their service to the company. 
The Committees approved an increase to the base salary rate of each NEO effective April 1, 2018, as detailed in the following table. These changes generally represented merit increases, but also included market-based adjustments for Glenn Kellow and Amy Schwetz.

Short-Term Incentive Program 
The STIP is designed to reward company performance while encouraging management to continue to improve upon our excellent safety record. For 2018, the STIP was modified to better align with our strategic priorities as a fully independent public company and reflect input from stockholders. In particular, the Committees approved the following changes from the 2017 STIP program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• eliminated the "individual objectives" metric in order to place more emphasis on measurable company performance;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• added Free Cash Flow—STIP per Share as a metric, as we view this metric as a measure of company performance;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• replaced the Adjusted EBITDAR metric with an Adjusted EBITDA—STIP metric since we emerged from Chapter 11  reorganization in April 2017 (and Adjusted EBITDAR is generally a reorganization metric);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• modified the weightings of the STIP metrics to align with business strategy; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in conjunction with the overall review of each NEO's compensation package, increased the target opportunity as a  percentage of base salary for certain NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
The table below provides the definitions for and the purposes of the 2018 STIP performance metrics, which applied to the executive officers and certain other participants in the 2018 STIP:

Similar to many U.S.-based publicly traded companies, the 2018 STIP initially had a funding mechanism that was designed and intended to comply with the "qualified performance-based compensation" exemption requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Generally, awards structured this way were anticipated to potentially be deductible by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes. More particularly, under the 2018 STIP, awards were initially designed so that a threshold goal of $100 million of Adjusted EBITDA—STIP was required to be met for fiscal 2018 in order to fund 2018 STIP awards at maximum payout levels, and the Committees retained negative discretion to reduce final award payouts. However, due to the unavailability of the "qualified performance-based compensation" exemption under Section 162(m) of the Code following tax reform legislation adopted in late 2017 (as further described below), in January 2018 the Committees determined that 2018 STIP awards would not be "qualified performance-based awards" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code (although they are still performance-based awards for compensation purposes). Accordingly, the Committees determined that the threshold Adjusted EBITDA—STIP funding mechanism would not be applicable and determined that the performance goals described below would serve as the only performance measures for the 2018 STIP awards. In any event, the 2018 STIP awards were also designed so that no 2018 STIP award could exceed $5,000,000. 
Summarized in the table below are: the weights for each 2018 STIP performance metric; threshold, target and maximum performance expectations; actual results; and the achievement percentage for each performance metric, including the discretionary downward adjustments to the formulaic results:

In 2018, our NEOs earned STIP awards equal to 169% of target, based on our performance against Free Cash Flow-STIP per Share, Adjusted EBITDA—STIP and Safety metrics. However, following a fire at the North Goonyella Mine in Australia, the CEO recommended, and both the Compensation Committee and the Special Committee approved, a reduction in the formulaic results, decreasing STIP payments by 24%. This 24% reduction was derived as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A negative adjustment of $201 million was applied to both Adjusted EBITDA—STIP and Free Cash Flow—STIP per Share  reflecting a combination of estimated 2019 re-entry costs at North Goonyella and expected cash outlays related to equipment settlements. These adjustments applied to the executive leadership team, including  the NEOs, and to Corporate and Business Unit employees with STIP awards based on these same metrics.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The achievement of SAWOL was reduced from 138% of target to zero recognizing the relationship of the incident to our safety  and monitoring systems and standards. This impacted earned awards for the executive leadership team, including the NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
Finally, for the CEO, who has direct line operating responsibility for North Goonyella operations, the CEO recommended, and the Special Committee approved, a further discretionary reduction of 50%, resulting in a 62% reduction in the overall 2018 STIP payment for the CEO as shown in the table below:

The RTSR peer group consists of the companies set forth in the table below. The list includes the VanEck Vectors Coal exchange-traded fund (the "KOL Index"), the company's current peers that are included in the KOL Index, other U.S.-based companies in the KOL Index, Australia-based companies in the KOL Index, as well as other companies in the coal & consumables fuels industry that were excluded from the peer group used to make compensation decisions (as described below) for reasons not applicable for an RTSR performance peer group (for example, because the company used abnormal pay practices or was too small in comparison to Peabody). We used a different peer group for purposes of the RTSR modifier because compensation levels are heavily influenced by scale and certain of our more direct business competitors may be smaller in scale than us.

(1) In November 2017, CONSOL Energy Inc. divested "CONSOL Mining Corp," which has retained the name CONSOL Energy, Inc. (and remains in the peer group, as it produces and exports coal). 
The performance period applicable to the 2018 PSU awards will conclude at the end of fiscal year 2020, and the awards therefore remain outstanding as of the end of fiscal year 2018. There were no PSU awards for which the performance period concluded during 2018. 
RSUs generally represent the right to receive a defined number of shares of our Common Stock after completing a service period established at the time of grant. RSUs granted to the NEOs in 2018 generally vest ratably on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, subject to continued employment. The Compensation Committee believes RSUs are important because they link compensation to stock price performance, promote retention, and build executive ownership and alignment with stockholders. 
Executive Compensation Policies and Practices 
Benefits 
NEOs participated in 2018 in benefit plans generally available to the broader employee group. 
Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan 
All of our NEOs participate in our non-qualified defined contribution plan ("Non-Qualified Plan"). The Non-Qualified Plan is designed to allow a select group of highly compensated management employees to make contributions in excess of certain limits imposed by the Code that apply to our tax-qualified 401(k) plan. The Non-Qualified Plan is designed to restore the benefits, including matching contributions on employee contributions, not permitted due to the limits on the qualified 401(k) plan. Investment options under the Non-Qualified Plan are generally identical to those under the qualified 401(k) plan, except that collective trust options are not available. The target date trust and retirement savings trust funds available under the qualified 401(k) plan have been replaced with target date retirement funds and a money market fund. Our NEOs can each defer from 1% to 10% of his or her compensation to the Non-Qualified Plan. For every $1 deferred up to 6%, the company will contribute $1 to the Non-Qualified Plan. Effective January 1, 2019, matching contributions are 100% vested. The company has established a rabbi trust for the purpose of providing Non-Qualified Plan benefits to participants.  
Perquisites 
In 2018, we provided limited perquisites that the Committees believed were necessary to enable the NEOs to perform their responsibilities safely and efficiently. The limited perquisites utilized by our NEOs in 2018 are explained in the footnotes to the All Other Compensation table on page 49. 
In particular, during 2018, we began offering our NEOs financial counseling services. Offering such services helped ensure that our NEOs understand, appreciate and maximize our benefit programs. Not all of our NEOs utilized the financial counseling services; however, for those who did, we reported the value of the service as a perquisite in the All Other Compensation table below (these values were not "grossed up" for tax purposes).  
Share Ownership Requirements 
We have share ownership requirements for our NEOs, which are designed to align their long-term financial interests with those of our stockholders. The NEO share ownership requirements are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Role         Value of Common Stock to be  Owned   
    Role         Value of Common Stock to be  Owned   
    Role         Value of Common Stock to be  Owned   
    CEO         5 times base salary   
    CEO         5 times base salary   
    CEO         5 times base salary   
      Other NEOs         3 times  base salary 
      Other NEOs         3 times  base salary 
      Other NEOs         3 times  base salary 
[END TABLE]
If at any time a NEO does not meet his or her ownership requirement, he or she must retain 100% of net shares received as the result of the exercise, vesting or payment of any equity award until the ownership requirement is met. As of the date of this filing, all NEOs comply with these ownership requirements. 
Prohibition on Hedging or Pledging of Company Stock 
Our Insider Trading Policy prohibits our directors and all our employees, including our NEOs, from entering into hedging transactions involving our stock, and from holding our stock in a margin account as collateral for a margin loan or otherwise pledging our stock as collateral for a loan. 
Clawback Provisions 
In October 2018, our Compensation Committee approved a revised, stand-alone clawback policy designed to align with current market practice with respect to clawback policies. Under our prior clawback provisions, if we were required to prepare an accounting restatement due to fraudulent and/or intentional material misrepresentation, the Board could recoup incentive awards and equity gains on awards granted to NEOs to the extent such awards exceeded the payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results. This right to recoup expired unless such determination was made by the Board within three years following the payment of the award. 
Under the new policy, subject to certain exceptions, if the company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the U.S. federal securities laws, and the Board determines any current or former Section 16 officer of the company who received certain incentive-based compensation (including STIP awards and PSUs) has willfully committed an act of fraud, dishonesty, or intentional disregard of company policies in the performance of his or her duties as a Section 16 officer that contributed to the noncompliance that resulted in the company's obligation to prepare the accounting restatement, the Board may recover from each such culpable officer "excess incentive-based compensation." For this purpose, excess incentive-based compensation generally is the amount of incentive-based compensation received by the culpable officer in excess of the amount that otherwise would have been received had such incentive-based compensation been determined based on the accounting restatement. The clawback policy applies to incentive-based compensation for which the applicable performance period ended (or, for stock options, the grant was made) in, or in the three years prior to, the year in which the Board determines that an accounting restatement is required. 
Executive Severance Plan 
The Peabody Energy Corporation 2015 Amended and Restated Executive Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan") is intended to provide transitional assistance to certain senior executives whose employment is terminated by us for reasons other than "cause" (as defined in the Severance Plan), death or "disability" (as defined in the Severance Plan), or by the senior executive for "good reason" (as defined in the Severance Plan). For more information about the Severance Plan, see "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." 
On February 21, 2019, the Board adopted the Peabody Energy Corporation 2019 Executive Severance Plan, effective as of January 1, 2019 (the "2019 Severance Plan"). The 2019 Severance Plan revises and replaces the Severance Plan described above. The 2019 Severance Plan continues to provide for severance payments and benefits to the NEOs upon certain qualifying terminations of employment by the company without "Cause," or by the NEO for "Good Reason" (as such key terms are defined in the 2019 Severance Plan). In general, the 2019 Severance Plan amends the Severance Plan described above with respect to the NEOs by: (1) revising the severance benefits to include payment of a pro-rata, current-year annual incentive based upon actual performance for the year in which termination occurs; (2) reducing the advance written notice period for plan amendments adverse to participants from 12 months to six months; and (3) revising the definitions of "Change in Control," "Disability," "Cause" and "Confidential Information" to generally conform to or coordinate with the definitions in the Peabody Energy Corporation 2017 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Severance Plan participants received written notice of these changes in February 2019. 
Deductibility of Compensation Expenses 
Under Section 162(m) of the Code, compensation paid to certain executive officers (and, beginning in 2018, certain former executive officers) in excess of $1 million is not tax deductible. Historically, compensation that qualifies as "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code could be excluded from this $1 million limit, but this exception has now been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, unless certain transition relief for certain compensation arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017 is available. The Committees have in the past generally considered the impact of Section 162(m) of the Code when establishing incentive compensation plans. The Committees believe that the tax deduction limitation should not be permitted to compromise our ability to design and maintain executive compensation arrangements that will attract and retain the executive talent to compete successfully. Accordingly, achieving the desired flexibility in the design and delivery of compensation may result in compensation that in certain cases is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
Messrs. Gorman, Laymon, and Sutherlin served on our Compensation Committee during 2018. None of these committee members is a current or former Peabody officer or employee. In addition, none of our executive officers served during 2018 as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity which has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board or Compensation Committee. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the above section of this Proxy Statement entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" with management. Based on such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board that the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" be included in this Proxy Statement for filing with the SEC and incorporated by reference in Peabody's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
MEMBERS OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE: 
JOE W. LAYMON, CHAIR 
STEPHEN E. GORMAN 
MICHAEL W. SUTHERLIN 
RISK ASSESSMENT IN COMPENSATION PROGRAMS 
The Compensation Committee periodically reviews our compensation programs for features that might encourage inappropriate risk-taking. The programs are designed with features that mitigate risk without diminishing the incentive nature of the compensation. We believe our compensation programs encourage and reward prudent business judgment without encouraging undue risk. 
In 2018, we conducted, and the Compensation Committee reviewed, a comprehensive global risk assessment. The risk assessment included a global inventory of incentive plans and programs and considered factors such as the plan metrics, number of participants, maximum payments and risk mitigation factors. Based on the review, we believe our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company.

(1)   Amounts in the Stock Awards column reported for 2018 represent the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance  with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation ("FASB ASC Topic 718"). For PSUs, the reported value is based on the probable outcome of the applicable performance  conditions. Assuming the highest level of performance, the value of the PSU awards as of the grant date would be as follows: $6,567,854 for Mr. Kellow; $1,734,088 for Ms. Schwetz; $1,511,470 for Mr. Meintjes; $1,374,040 for Mr. Williamson; and  $1,251,634 for Ms. Dorch. For a discussion of the assumptions made in the valuation of stock awards for purposes of this table, see Note 20 to the company's consolidated financial statements as reported in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year  ended December 31, 2018.  
(2)   Amounts in this column reported for 2018 represent awards earned under the 2018 STIP based on actual performance. The  material terms of the 2018 STIP awards are described starting on page 36.  
(3)   For 2018, there was no positive change in the actuarial present value of the participating NEO's pension benefit, but  Mr. Williamson's accumulated benefit under the Peabody Investments Corp.

Our Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees, or pension plan, is a qualified "defined benefit" pension plan. The pension plan provides a monthly annuity to eligible salaried employees when they retire. An employee must have at least five years of service to be vested in his or her benefit under the pension plan. A full benefit is available to a retiree at age 62. A retiree can begin receiving a benefit as early as age 55; however, a 4% reduction factor applies for each year a retiree receives a benefit prior to age 62. 
The pension plan was phased out beginning January 1, 2001. Certain transition benefits were introduced based on the age and service of affected employees at December 31, 2000. Each of the participants in the pension plan has had his or her pension benefits frozen and those who had less than five years of service as of December 31, 2000 became fully vested in their accrued benefit. In all cases, final average earnings for retirement purposes are capped at December 31, 2000 levels. 
A participant's retirement benefit under the pension plan is equal to the sum of (1) 1.112% of the highest average monthly earnings over 60 consecutive months up to the "covered compensation limit" multiplied by the employee's years of service, not to exceed 35 years, and (2) 1.5% of the average monthly earnings over 60 consecutive months over the "covered compensation limit" multiplied by the employee's years of service, not to exceed 35 years. Under the pension plan, "earnings" include compensation earned as base salary and up to five annual incentive awards. 
Listed below is the actuarial present value of the current accumulated pension benefit under the pension plan as of December 31, 2018 for the NEOs. Due to the phase-out of the pension plan in 2001, Mr. Williamson is the only NEO who is eligible to receive a benefit under the pension plan. The estimated present value was determined assuming the NEO retired at age 62, the normal retirement age under the plan, using a discount rate of 4.35% and the RP-2014 Blue Collar Sex-Distinct Annuitant Mortality projected back to 2007 with MP-2014, and projected forward using generational Scale MP-2017. The disclosed amounts are estimates only and do not necessarily reflect the actual amounts that will be paid to a NEO. Such amounts will be known only at the time the NEO becomes eligible for payment.

(1)   Due to the phase-out of our pension plan as described above, years of credited service are less than years of actual  service. The actual years of service number for Mr. Williamson is 18.3.  
(2)   Mr. Kellow, Mr. Meintjes, Ms. Schwetz, and Ms. Dorch are not eligible to receive benefits under our pension plan because  their employment with us began after the pension plan was phased out.  
(3)   Under the terms of the phase-out, pension benefits for Mr. Williamson were frozen as of December 31, 2000, and years of  credited service, for the purposes of the pension plan, ceased to accrue.

2018 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation 
All of our NEOs participate in our Non-Qualified Plan. The Non-Qualified Plan is designed to allow a select group of highly compensated management employees to make contributions in excess of certain limits imposed by the Code that apply to our tax-qualified 401(k) plan. The Non-Qualified Plan is designed to restore the benefits, including matching contributions on employee contributions, not permitted due to the limits on the qualified 401(k) plan. Investment options under the Non-Qualified Plan are generally identical to those under the qualified 401(k) plan, except that collective trust options are not available. The target date trust and retirement savings trust funds available under the qualified 401(k) plan have been replaced with target date retirement funds and a money market fund. Our NEOs can each defer from 1% to 10% of his or her compensation to the Non-Qualified Plan. For every $1 deferred up to 6%, the company will contribute $1 to the Non-Qualified Plan. Effective January 1, 2019, matching contributions are 100% vested. The company has established a rabbi trust for the purpose of providing Non-Qualified Plan benefits to participants. 
The following table sets forth detail about activity for the NEOs in our Non-Qualified Plan:

The table set forth on the next page reflects the amount of compensation that would have been payable to the NEOs in the event of termination of employment, including certain benefits upon an involuntary termination related to a Change in Control, under the terms of the Severance Plan and equity award agreements, as applicable. Certain terms used in the chart are defined in the Severance Plan or applicable award agreement. The amounts shown assume a termination effective as of December 31, 2018. The actual amounts that would be payable can be determined only at the time of the NEO's termination. The amount of compensation payable to each NEO upon retirement is not included in the table, as none of the NEOs were eligible for retirement (age 60, with 10 years of service) as of December 31, 2018. 
Under the award agreement applicable to RSU awards (other than Emergence RSU awards), such awards generally vest in full on the grantee's death or "disability" (as defined in the award agreement). If the grantee becomes eligible for "retirement" (as defined in the award agreement) after the grant date, the award will begin to vest on a quarterly basis (rather than an annual basis), still generally subject to continued employment. 
Under the award agreements applicable to Emergence RSU awards, such awards generally vest in full on a termination of service without "cause," for "good reason," or due to death or "disability" (as each such term is defined in the award agreement). 
Under the award agreements applicable to the PSU awards, in the event of the grantee's termination of service on account of death or "disability" (as defined in the award agreement), such awards generally become earned and vest on the basis of the relative achievement of the applicable performance goals for the entire performance period. In the event of a grantee's termination of service on account of "retirement" (as defined in the award agreement), or on account of a termination without "cause" or for "good reason" (as each such term is defined in the award agreement), other than following a change in control, a pro-rata portion of the PSUs will vest, based on the number of days that the grantee provided services to the company or a subsidiary during the performance period and the relative achievement of the applicable performance goals for the entire performance period. 
Generally, in the event of a "change in control" (as defined for purposes of the awards), if outstanding equity awards are continued, assumed or replaced by the acquiring or surviving entity, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee will either (1) make such adjustment to the awards then outstanding as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate to reflect the change in control or (2) cause any such outstanding awards to be replaced and/or substituted by new rights by the acquiring or surviving entity after the change in control. If the awards are not to be assumed in the change in control, the Compensation Committee will generally cancel such awards in exchange for consideration (whether in cash or other property) based on the price paid per share as part of the change in control, and, with respect to Emergence RSU awards, the Compensation Committee may in such circumstances convert the awards into cash-settled awards based on the value of the consideration Peabody's stockholders receive in the change in control, as determined by the Compensation Committee in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. 
If a grantee's service is terminated without "cause" or for "good reason" within two years after a change in control, outstanding equity awards held by such grantee will generally vest in full. PSU awards will generally vest in such circumstances based on the relative achievement of the applicable performance goals for the full performance period.

PROPOSAL 2 – ADVISORY APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS' COMPENSATION 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") require that we permit our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the CD&A, the Summary Compensation Table and accompanying executive compensation tables, and the related narrative disclosure accompanying such information. At our 2018 Annual Meeting, our stockholders approved, on an advisory basis, that an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation should be held annually. Based on such result, our Board determined that the advisory vote on our named executive officers' compensation will be held every year until the next advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on our named executive officers' compensation. We expect the next advisory vote to approve our named executive officers' compensation will be held at the 2020 Annual Meeting. 
We believe that our compensation programs and policies reflect an overall pay-for-performance culture that is strongly aligned with the interests of our stockholders. We are committed to utilizing a mix of incentive compensation programs that will reward success in achieving the company's financial objectives and growing value for stockholders, and continuing to refine these incentives to maximize company performance. The Compensation Committee of the Board has overseen the development of a compensation program designed to achieve pay-for-performance and alignment with stockholder interests, as described more fully in the CD&A section above. The compensation program was designed in a manner that we believe is reasonable, competitive and appropriately balances the goals of attracting, motivating, rewarding and retaining our executives. 
The company and the Board continually evaluate our compensation policies and practices to ensure they are meeting our objectives and are consistent with corporate governance best practices. As part of that process, the Compensation Committee and the Board consider the results of our stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation. The Compensation Committee will continue to routinely evaluate and, as appropriate, take into account the views of our stockholders to enhance our compensation program. 
For the reasons discussed in the CD&A section above, the Board recommends that stockholders vote, on an advisory basis, in favor of the following "Say-on-Pay" resolution: 
"Resolved, that the compensation paid to the company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, narrative discussion and any related material disclosed in this Proxy Statement, is hereby approved." 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the company, the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, we value the views of our stockholders and the Compensation Committee expects to continue to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" PROPOSAL 2. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The company's management is responsible for preparing financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") and the financial reporting process, including the company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. The company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for (i) auditing the company's financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity to GAAP and (ii) auditing the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting and expressing an opinion as to its effectiveness. The Audit Committee of the Board, composed solely of independent directors, meets periodically with management, including the Vice President, Internal Audit (the employee with primary responsibility for the company's internal audit functions) and others in the company, and the company's independent registered public accounting firm to review and oversee matters relating to the company's financial statements, audit services (internal audit) activities, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting and non-audit services provided by the independent accountants. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and Ernst & Young LLP ("EY"), the company's independent registered public accounting firm, the company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee has also discussed with EY the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16 (codified as Auditing Standard No. 1301), "Communications with Audit Committees" issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). In addition, the Audit Committee received from EY the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding EY's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, discussed with EY its independence from the company and the company's management, and considered whether EY's provision of non-audit services to the company is compatible with maintaining the auditor's independence. 
The Audit Committee conducted its own self-evaluation and evaluation of the services provided by EY during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Based on its evaluation of EY, the Audit Committee reappointed EY as the company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the company's audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

AUDIT FEES

[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Audit-Related Fees: $67,507 (for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018) and $66,426 (for the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2017) for assurance-related services for internal control reviews, and other attest services not required by statute.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Tax Fees: $157,548 (for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018) and $209,929 (for the fiscal year ended December  31, 2017) for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning services.

[END TABLE]
Under the Board's established procedures, the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that the provisions of such services do not impair such firm's independence. The Audit Committee may delegate its pre-approval authority to one or more of its members, but not to management. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
Each fiscal year, the Audit Committee reviews with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the types of services that are likely to be required throughout the year. Those services are comprised of four categories, including audit services, audit-related services, tax services and all other permissible services. At that time, the Audit Committee pre-approves a list of specific services that may be provided within each of these categories, and sets fee limits for each specific service or project. Management is then authorized to engage the independent registered public accounting firm to perform the pre-approved services as needed throughout the year, subject to providing the Audit Committee with regular updates. The Audit Committee regularly reviews the amount of all billings submitted by the independent registered public accounting firm to ensure their services do not exceed pre-defined limits. The Audit Committee must review and approve in advance, on a case-by-case basis, all other projects, services and fees to be performed by or paid to the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Under our policy and/or applicable rules and regulations, our independent registered public accounting firm is prohibited from providing the following types of services to us: (1) bookkeeping or other services related to our accounting records or financial statements, (2) financial information systems design and implementation, (3) appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or contribution-in-kind reports, (4) actuarial services, (5) internal audit outsourcing services, (6) management functions, (7) human resources, (8) broker-dealer, investment advisor or investment banking services, (9) legal services, (10) expert services unrelated to audit, 
 (11) any services entailing a contingent fee or commission (not including fees awarded by a bankruptcy court) and (12) tax services to any of our officers whose role is in a financial reporting oversight capacity (regardless of whether we or the officer pays the fee for the services). 
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, all the services described under "Audit Fees," "Audit-Related Fees," "Tax Fees" and "All Other Fees" were approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the procedures described above. 
PROPOSAL 3 – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Board's Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP (EY) as the company's independent registered public accounting firm to audit the company's financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. As a matter of good corporate governance, the Audit Committee submits its selection of EY to our stockholders for ratification, and will consider the vote of our stockholders when appointing our independent registered public accounting firm in the future. A representative of EY is expected to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and will have an opportunity to make a statement, if desired. For additional information regarding the company's relationship with EY, please refer to the "Audit Committee Report" and "Audit Fees" sections above.

REVIEW OF RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
Policy for Approval of Related Person Transactions 
Under a written policy adopted by the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all transactions between the company and certain "related persons," such as our executive officers, directors and owners of more than 5% of our voting securities. In reviewing a transaction, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the relevant facts and circumstances, including the benefits to us, any impact on director independence and whether the terms are consistent with a transaction available on an arms-length basis. Only those related person transactions that are determined to be in (or not inconsistent with) our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders are permitted to be approved. No committee member may participate in any review of a transaction in which the member or any of his or her family members is the related person. A copy of the policy can be found on our website (www.peabodyenergy.com) by clicking on "Investor Info," then "Governance Documents," and then "Related Person Transactions Policy" and is available in print to any stockholder who requests it. During 2018, the following related person transactions occurred. 
2018 Share Repurchase 
On August 1, 2017, we announced that our Board had authorized a $500 million share repurchase program, which was subsequently increased to $1.5 billion. Repurchases under the share repurchase program may be made from time to time at our discretion. No expiration date has been set for the share repurchase program, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
Pursuant to the share repurchase program, on August 14, 2018, we entered into a Share Repurchase Agreement (the "Share Repurchase Agreement") by and among the company and Elliott Associates, LP, Liverpool Limited Partnership and Spraberry Investments Inc. to repurchase 7,173,601 shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $300,000,000. Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement, the purchase price per share of $41.82 represented a 1.7% discount from the closing sale price of our Common Stock on the NYSE on August 13, 2018. The repurchase transaction closed on August 21, 2018 and was approved by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
Communications with the Board 
The Board has adopted the following procedures for stockholders and other interested persons to send communications to the Board and/or individual directors (collectively, "Stockholder Communications"). 
Stockholders and other interested persons seeking to communicate with the Board and/or individual directors should submit their written communications to the Chair, Peabody Energy Corporation, Peabody Plaza, 701 Market Street, St. Louis, Missouri 63101. The Chair will forward such Stockholder Communications to each Board member (excluding routine advertisements and business solicitations, as instructed by the Board), and provide a report on the disposition of matters stated in such Stockholder Communications at the next regular meeting of the Board. If a Stockholder Communication (excluding routine advertisements and business solicitations) is addressed to a specific individual director, the Chair will forward that Stockholder Communication to the named director, and will discuss with that director whether the full Board and/or one of its committees should address the subject matter. 
If a Stockholder Communication raises concerns about management's or the company's ethical conduct, it should be sent directly to our Chief Legal Officer at Peabody Energy Corporation, Peabody Plaza, 701 Market Street, St. Louis, Missouri 63101. The Chief Legal Officer will review the Stockholder Communication and, if appropriate, forward a copy of it to the Chair of the Audit Committee and, if appropriate, the Chair of the Board, and see that the subject matter is addressed by the appropriate Board committee, management and/or the full Board. 
If a stockholder or other interested person seeks to communicate exclusively with our non-management directors, individually or as a group, such Stockholder Communication should be sent directly to the Corporate Secretary, who will forward it directly to the Chair of the Board. The Corporate Secretary will first consult with and receive the approval of the Chair of the Board before disclosing or otherwise discussing the Stockholder Communication with members of management or directors who are members of management. 
At the direction of the Board, we reserve the right to screen all materials sent to our directors for potential security risks, harassment and/or other inappropriate content. 
At our 2019 Annual Meeting, stockholders will have an opportunity to pose questions to the directors. 
Process for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations 
Stockholder Proposals Included in Our Proxy Materials 
If you wish to submit a proposal for inclusion in next year's proxy statement, we must receive the proposal on or before November 28, 2019, which is 120 calendar days prior to the anniversary of this year's mailing date. Upon timely receipt of any such proposal, we will determine whether to include such proposal in the proxy statement and proxy in accordance with applicable regulations governing the solicitation of proxies. Any proposals should be submitted, in writing, to the Corporate Secretary, Peabody Energy Corporation, Peabody Plaza, 701 Market Street, St. Louis, Missouri 63101. 
Director Nominations (including Proxy Access) and Other Matters to be Brought Before the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
Under our bylaws, the following process applies if you wish to nominate a director or bring other business before the stockholders at the 2020 Annual Meeting without having your proposal included in next year's proxy statement. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You must notify the Corporate Secretary in writing at our principal executive offices between January 9, 2020 and  February 8, 2020; however, if we advance the date of the meeting by more than 20 days or delay the date by more than 70 days, from May 9, 2020, then such notice must be received no earlier than 120 days before the date of the annual meeting and not  later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day before such date or the 10th day after public disclosure of the meeting is made; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Your notice must contain the specific information required by our bylaws regarding the proposal or nominee, including, but  not limited to, name, address, shares held, a description of the proposal or information regarding the nominee and other specified matters. Our new proxy access bylaw, discussed below, has additional requirements for nominees submitted through that  proxy access process. We modified our bylaws in 2015 to implement "proxy access," a means for stockholders to include stockholder-nominated director candidates in our proxy materials for annual  meetings of stockholders. The proxy access process under the bylaws was first available to stockholders for our 2018 Annual Meeting. These provisions permit a stockholder, or group of not more than 20 stockholders, meeting specified eligibility  requirements to include director nominees in our proxy materials for annual meetings. In order to be eligible to use the proxy access provisions, eligible stockholders, among other requirements, must have owned 3% or more of our outstanding Common  Stock continuously for at least three years. The maximum number of stockholder-nominated candidates under the proxy access provisions of our bylaws is equal to the greater of two directors or the largest whole  number that does not exceed 20% of the number of directors on our Board as of the last day on which a proxy access notice may be delivered. The submission process described above applies to nominees submitted through this proxy access process.   
[END TABLE]
You can obtain a copy of our bylaws, without charge, by writing to the Corporate Secretary at the address shown above or by accessing our website (www.peabodyenergy.com) and clicking on "Investor Info," and then "Corporate Governance." Information on our website is not considered part of this Proxy Statement. These requirements are separate from and in addition to the requirements a stockholder must meet to have a proposal included in our proxy statement. The foregoing time limits also apply in determining whether notice is timely for purposes of SEC rules relating to the exercise of discretionary voting authority. 
Householding of Proxies 
SEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for annual reports, proxy statements and notices of internet availability with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single annual report and/or proxy statement and/or notices of internet availability addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. We and some brokers household annual reports, proxy statements and notices of internet availability, delivering a single annual report, proxy statement and notice of internet availability to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. 
Once you have received notice from your broker or us that your broker or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate annual report, proxy statement and/or notice of internet availability in the future, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or notify us at the address or telephone number below if you hold registered shares. If, at any time, you and another stockholder sharing the same address wish to participate in householding and prefer to receive a single copy of our annual report, proxy statement and/or notice of internet availability, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or notify us if you hold registered shares. 
At any time, you may request a separate copy of our annual report or proxy statement by sending a written request to the Corporate Secretary at Peabody Energy Corporation, Peabody Plaza, 701 Market Street, St. Louis, Missouri 63101 or by calling (314) 342-3400. 
Additional Filings 
Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available without charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. They may be accessed at our website (www.peabodyenergy.com) by clicking on "Investor Info," and then "SEC Filings." Information on our website is not considered part of this Proxy Statement. 
In accordance with SEC rules, the information contained in the Report of the Audit Committee and the Report of the Compensation Committee shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material," or to be "filed" with the SEC or subject to the SEC's Regulation 14A, or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically request that the information be treated as soliciting material or specifically incorporate it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act. 
Costs of Solicitation 
We are paying the cost of preparing, printing and mailing these proxy materials. We have engaged Morrow Sodali to assist in distributing proxy materials, soliciting proxies and in performing other proxy solicitation services for a fee of $20,000 plus their out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may be solicited personally or by telephone by our regular employees without additional compensation as well as by employees of Morrow Sodali. We will reimburse banks, brokerage firms and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners and obtaining their voting instructions. 
OTHER BUSINESS 
The Board is not aware of any matters requiring stockholder action to be presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting other than those stated in the 2019 Notice of Annual Meeting. Should other matters be properly introduced at the 2019 Annual Meeting, those persons named in the enclosed proxy will have discretionary authority to act on such matters and will vote the proxy in accordance with their best judgment. 
We will provide to any stockholder, without charge and upon written request, a copy (without exhibits unless otherwise requested) of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the SEC. Any such request should be directed to Investor Relations, Peabody Energy Corporation, Peabody Plaza, 701 Market Street, St. Louis, Missouri 63101.

A. VERONA DORCH 
Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, Government Affairs and Corporate Secretary 
APPENDIX A: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the internet availability of proxy materials this year instead of a  full set of proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  In accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, instead of mailing a printed copy of our proxy materials to  each stockholder of record, we may furnish proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement and the Peabody Energy Corporation 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders, by providing access to them via the internet. We believe this allows us to provide our  stockholders with the information they need, while reducing delivery costs and the environmental impact of our 2019 Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Some stockholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless they request them. Instead, a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") was mailed which tells them how to access and review all the proxy materials on the internet. The Notice also provides information about how to submit a proxy on the internet or by telephone. If you received a Notice and would like to receive a paper or email copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting them in the Notice. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Why am I receiving these materials?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  We are providing these proxy materials to you on the internet or delivering printed versions of these materials to you by  mail in connection with our solicitation of proxies to be voted at our 2019 Annual Meeting, which will take place on May 9, 2019. These materials were first made available on the internet or mailed to stockholders on or about March 27, 2019. You are  invited to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting and requested to vote on the items described in this Proxy Statement.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How do I vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you are a stockholder of record as of the record date you may vote using any of the following methods:   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Via the internet, by visiting the website "www.proxyvote.com" and following the instructions for internet  voting on your Notice or proxy card/voting instruction form;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By dialing  1-800-690-6903 and following the instructions for telephone voting on your Notice or proxy card/voting instruction form;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By casting your vote in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If you vote over the internet, you may incur costs such as telephone and internet access charges for which you will be responsible. The telephone and internet voting facilities for the stockholders of record of all shares will close at 10:59 p.m. Central time on May 8, 2019. The internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders by use of a control number and to allow you to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. 
If you vote by internet or telephone, or return your signed proxy card/voting instruction form, your shares will be voted as you indicate. If you do not indicate how your shares are to be voted on a matter, your shares will be voted for all matters in accordance with the Board's voting recommendations. 
If your shares are held in a brokerage account in your broker's name (also known as "street name"), you should follow the instructions for voting provided by your broker or nominee. You may submit voting instructions by internet or telephone or, if you received your proxy materials by mail, you may complete and mail a proxy card/voting instruction form to your broker or nominee. If you provide specific voting instructions by telephone, internet or mail, your broker or nominee will vote your shares as you have directed. Ballots will be provided during the 2019 Annual Meeting to anyone who wants to vote in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting. If you hold shares in street name, you must request a confirmation of beneficial ownership from your broker or nominee to vote in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I change my vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you can change your vote or revoke your proxy before the 2019 Annual  Meeting by:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Submitting a valid, later-dated proxy card/voting instruction form;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Submitting a valid, subsequent vote by telephone or the internet at any time prior to 10:59 p.m. Central time on May 8,  2019;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Notifying our Corporate Secretary in writing that you have revoked your proxy; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Completing a written ballot at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in a brokerage account in your broker's or nominee's name, you should follow the instructions for changing or revoking your vote provided by your broker or nominee. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Is my vote confidential?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Yes. All proxies, ballots and vote tabulations that identify how individual stockholders voted will be kept confidential  and not be disclosed to our directors, officers or employees, except in limited circumstances, including:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• When disclosure is required by law;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• During any contested solicitation of proxies; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• When written comments by a stockholder appear on a proxy card/voting instruction form or other voting material.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What will happen if I do not instruct my broker how to vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If your shares are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker how to vote, one of two things can happen  depending on the type of proposal. Under NYSE rules, brokers have discretionary power to vote your shares on "routine" matters, but they do not have discretionary power to vote your shares on  "non-routine" matters. We believe the only proposal that will be considered routine under NYSE rules is Proposal 3, which means your broker may vote your shares in its discretion on that item if you  have not provided instructions. This is known as "broker discretionary voting."  
[END TABLE]
The election of directors - Proposal 1 - and Proposal 2 are considered non-routine matters. Accordingly, your broker may not vote your shares with respect to these items if you have not provided instructions. This will result in a "broker non-vote." 
We strongly encourage you to submit your proxy and exercise your right to vote as a stockholder. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How many shares must be present to hold the 2019 Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Holders of record of a majority of the shares of outstanding Common Stock as of the record date must be represented in  person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting in order to conduct business. This is called a quorum. If you vote, your shares will be part of the quorum. Abstentions, "Withheld" votes and broker  non-votes also will be counted in determining whether a quorum exists.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What vote is required to approve the proposals?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  In the election of directors (Proposal 1), the number of shares voted "For" a nominee must exceed 50% of the  number of votes cast with respect to such nominee's election for such nominee to be elected. Votes cast exclude abstentions and broker non-votes. If the number of shares voted "For" a nominee  does not exceed 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to such nominee's election, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that such nominee promptly tender his or her resignation to the Chair of the Board following certification of  the stockholder vote. The proposals to approve, on an advisory basis, our named executive officers' compensation (Proposal 2) and to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP (Proposal 3), will require approval by the holders of a  majority of the shares present in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting and entitled to vote. Abstentions will count as a vote against these proposals, and broker non-votes, if any, will have no effect  on these proposals. Votes will be tabulated by the independent inspector of election appointed for the 2019 Annual Meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and broker  non-votes.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice or proxy card or voting instruction form?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  It means your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account at the transfer agent and/or with  banks or brokers. Please vote all your shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who may attend the 2019 Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  All our stockholders as of the close of business on March 18, 2019 may attend the 2019 Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What do I need to do to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  An admission card or other proof of ownership, together with valid  government-issued photo identification such as a driver's license or passport, are required to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. The registration desk will open at 8:30 a.m. Central time on the day of the  meeting, and the meeting will begin at 9:00 a.m. Central time. Please note that seating in the meeting room is limited and stockholders may be required to view the meeting from a secondary room.  
[END TABLE]
If you own shares in street name, you will need to ask your bank or broker for an admission card in the form of a confirmation of beneficial ownership. You will need to bring a confirmation of beneficial ownership with you to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting. If you do not receive your confirmation of beneficial ownership in time, bring your most recent brokerage statement with you to the 2019 Annual Meeting. We can use that to verify your share ownership and admit you to the meeting; however, you will not be able to vote your shares at the 2019 Annual Meeting without a confirmation of beneficial ownership. 
For safety reasons, we will not allow anyone to bring large bags, briefcases, packages or other similar items into the meeting or secondary rooms, or to record or photograph the meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Where can I find the voting results of the 2019 Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  We plan to announce preliminary voting results at the 2019 Annual Meeting and to publish final results in a  Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days after the 2019 Annual Meeting.

Note:  Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA-STIP; Adjusted EBITDA-STIP, after Discretionary Adjustment; Free Cash Flow; Free Cash Flow-STIP; Free Cash Flow-STIP, after Discretionary Adjustment; Adjusted EBITDA Margin; Free Cash Flow-STIP per Share and Free Cash Flow-STIP, after Discretionary Adjustment per Share are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that non-GAAP performance measures are used by investors to measure our operating performance and lenders to measure our ability to incur and service debt. These measures are not intended to serve as alternatives to U.S. GAAP measures of performance and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies. 
(1)   Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from continuing operations before deducting net interest expense, income taxes, asset retirement obligation expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortization and reorganization items, net. Adjusted EBITDA is also adjusted for the discrete items that management excluded in analyzing each of our segment's operating performance as displayed in the reconciliation above. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management as the primary metric to measure each of our segment's operating performance. 
(2)   Item excluded from 2018 STIP performance metric, as described within the Proxy Statement under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
(3)   Adjusted EBITDA-STIP is equal to Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted for certain items excluded from the 2018 STIP performance metric. 
(4)   Discretionary adjustment made to the 2018 STIP formulaic results, as described within the Proxy Statement under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
(5)   Adjusted EBITDA-STIP, after Discretionary Adjustment is equal to Adjusted EBITDA-STIP further impacted by the discretionary adjustments to the 2018 STIP formulaic results. 
(6)   Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities and excludes cash outflows related to business combinations. Free Cash Flow is used by management as a measure of our financial performance and our ability to generate excess cash flow from our business operations. 
(7)   For purposes of 2018 – STIP, management elected to exclude from Free Cash Flow results cash flows from incremental cash collateral returned and income taxes received in excess of targeted levels, resulting in a reduction in the Free Cash Flow — STIP per Share metric results by approximately $1.16 per share. 
(8)   Free Cash Flow-STIP is equal to Free Cash Flow further adjusted for certain items excluded from the 2018 STIP performance metric. 
(9)   Free Cash Flow-STIP, after Discretionary Adjustment is equal to Free Cash Flow-STIP further impacted by the discretionary adjustments to the 2018 STIP formulaic results. 
(10)   Adjusted EBITDA Margin is equal to Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenues. 
(11)   Free Cash Flow-STIP per Share is defined as Free Cash Flow-STIP divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 
(12)   Free Cash Flow-STIP, after Discretionary Adjustment per Share is defined as Free Cash Flow-STIP, after Discretionary Adjustment divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
