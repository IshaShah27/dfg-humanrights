[END TABLE]
 2018 Executive Compensation
The Company's executive compensation programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate talented executives, to reward executives for the achievement of pre-established Company and tailored individual goals consistent with the Company's strategic plan and to link compensation to Company performance.  Executives are primarily compensated through base salary, annual cash incentive compensation and long-term equity incentive compensation.  The Company's executive compensation philosophy emphasizes performance-based incentive compensation over fixed cash compensation so that the vast majority of total direct compensation is variable and not guaranteed, as displayed below in the visual diagram of 2018 target compensation for the Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and other named executive officers or NEOs.  In addition, a significant percentage of incentive compensation is in the form of equity awards granted to reward performance.  Although these performance-based equity awards are fully earned at the time of grant, a substantial portion of the awards vests over time, furnishing additional retention benefits and achieving enhanced alignment with stockholders.  We believe this structure appropriately focuses the executive officers on the creation of long-term value and encourages prudent evaluation of risks.
Our stockholders have consistently supported our executive compensation program.  At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 93% of the votes cast were voted in favor of our resolution seeking advisory approval of our executive compensation.  Over the last five years, stockholder support for our advisory vote on executive compensation has averaged 93%, with no year below 86%.  While we have consistently had strong stockholder support for our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee does use an independent compensation consultant to review the structure of our compensation program, and to assess the effectiveness of our program in aligning executive and stockholder interests.
Pay-At-Risk: 2018 Direct Compensation Target 2018 Executive Compensation Decisions
In 2018, compensation decisions once again reflected strong alignment between pay and performance.  In determining the incentive compensation paid to active named executive officers for 2018, the Compensation Committee rigorously evaluated Company and individual performance relative to the pre-established measures and goals under the annual cash and long-term equity incentive plans.  
For 2018, annual cash incentive compensation for named executive officers was subject to each executive's individual performance, departmental performance, the overall performance of the Company and the advancement of the Company's long-term strategic initiatives.  The determination reflected the achievement of pre-established measures related to transactional, operational, financial and strategic objectives that served as the underlying assumptions in the Company's stated earnings guidance, such as growth of net operating income, or NOI, operating margin improvement, the achievement of development yields, quality external growth, targeted joint ventures and/or dispositions and rental revenue growth. 
Also for 2018, 50% of the value of long-term equity incentive awards for named executive officers was determined exclusively by achievement of absolute total stockholder return ("TSR"), three-year relative TSR, and funds from operations-modified, or FFOM, per share.  These quantitative performance metrics are not subject to Compensation Committee or Board discretion.  The other 50% was predicated on performance metrics that enable the Compensation Committee to exercise discretion in rewarding actions that preserve long-term stockholder value while discouraging excessive risk-taking.  The Compensation Committee and the independent members of the Board believe that this equal weighting, between a fixed quantitative evaluation of performance and a more qualitative evaluation, provides the appropriate incentive structure and balance to drive long-term stockholder value and discourage excessive risk-taking.  The Compensation Committee and the independent members of the Board will continue to evaluate the long-term incentive plan in the context of the overall executive compensation program, business needs and feedback from stockholders. 
In 2018, the Company accomplished significant financial objectives and milestones, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achieving record levels in total revenue and FFOM 
• Leading the sector in leasing for the 14th consecutive year with a 2018/2019 academic year same store lease-up that achieved 97% occupancy and 3.6% opening rental revenue growth 
• Producing same store NOI growth for the 14th consecutive year (every year since becoming a public company in 2004) 
• Delivering ten new owned development and presale development projects into service on-schedule, totaling $669.9 million in development cost, the largest development delivery year in the Company's history, with the six new owned development projects completed 1% under budget 
• Executed an agreement to develop a $615 million, 10,440-bed housing project for college students participating in the Disney College Program, which is currently scheduled to be delivered in multiple phases through 2023 
[END TABLE]
A reconciliation of net income to FFOM and NOI for the year ended December 31, 2018, is contained in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the earnings release furnished on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 20, 2019.
This discussion of the Company, its business and individual measures are used in assessing performance.  These measures are discussed in the limited context of the executive compensation program.  You should not interpret them as statements of the Company's expectations or as any form of guidance.  We caution you not to apply the statements or disclosures made in this Proxy Statement in any other context. 2018 Compensation Practices at a Glance
[BEGIN TABLE]
ü    DO align pay and performance by linking a substantial portion of compensation to the achievement of pre-established performance measures that drive stockholder value    û    DO NOT base incentive awards on a single performance measure, thereby discouraging unnecessary or excessive risk-taking 
ü    DO provide executive officers with the opportunity to earn market-competitive compensation through a mix of cash and equity compensation, with strong emphasis on performance-based incentive awards   û    DO NOT provide guaranteed minimum payouts or uncapped award opportunities

ü    DO enable the Board to "claw back" incentive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement due to material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements as a result of misconduct by executive officers   û    DO NOT permit executive officers or directors to engage in derivative or other hedging transactions in the Company's securities 
ü    DO prohibit new tax gross-up arrangements under anti-tax gross-up policy   û    DO NOT provide accelerated vesting upon a change of control under the 2018 Incentive Award Plan 
ü    DO maintain a Compensation Committee comprised solely of independent directors   û    DO NOT provide single-trigger change of control benefits 
ü    DO engage an independent compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee on executive compensation matters and establishing an appropriate peer group   û    DO NOT permit executive officers and directors to hold the Company's securities in margin accounts or to otherwise pledge the securities to secure loans

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What am I voting on?

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Who is entitled to vote? 
A: Stockholders as of the close of business on March 11, 2019 are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.  Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How do I vote? 
A: Sign and date each proxy card you receive and return it in the prepaid envelope.  If you do not mark any selections, the proxy holders named on your proxy card will vote your shares in favor of all of the director nominees, in favor of the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent auditors for 2019 and in favor of approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the named executive officers.  You may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before the Annual Meeting by submitting written notice to the Secretary, submitting another proxy that is properly signed and later dated or voting in person at the Annual Meeting.  In each case, the later submitted votes will be recorded and the earlier votes revoked.  If you hold your shares in street name, please follow the procedures required by your bank, broker or other nominee to revoke a proxy.  You should contact that firm directly for more information on these procedures. 
[END TABLE]
Under New York Stock Exchange rules, the proposal to ratify the appointment of independent registered public accountants is considered a "discretionary" item.  This means that brokerage firms may vote in their discretion on this matter on behalf of clients who have not furnished voting instructions at least ten days before the date of the meeting.
In their discretion, the proxy holders are authorized to vote on any other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting and at any postponement or adjournment thereof.  The Board knows of no other items of business that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting other than the proposals described in this Proxy Statement.  In addition, no stockholder proposals or nominations were received on a timely basis, so no such matters may be brought to a vote at the Annual Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Is my vote confidential? 
A: Yes.  Proxy cards, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are confidential.  Only the inspectors of election and certain employees associated with processing proxy cards and counting the vote have access to your card.  Additionally, all comments directed to management (whether written on the proxy card or elsewhere) will remain confidential, unless you ask that your name be disclosed. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Who will count the vote and how are votes counted? 
A: All votes will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the Annual Meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes and withheld votes and abstentions.  In order to be elected as a director, a nominee must receive a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting at which a quorum is present.  For election of directors, abstentions and broker non-votes will not affect the vote outcome.  In order for Ernst & Young LLP to be ratified as the Company's independent auditors for 2019 and for the advisory vote on executive compensation to be approved, the respective proposal must receive a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting at which a quorum is present.  For ratification of the independent auditors for 2019, an abstention will have the same effect as an "Against" vote and, as this is a routine matter, there will not be any broker non-votes.  For approval of the advisory vote on executive compensation, an abstention will have the same effect as an "Against" vote, but a broker non-vote will not affect the vote outcome.  "Broker non-votes" are proxies from brokers or other nominees indicating that such person has not received instructions from the beneficial owner or other person entitled to vote the shares that are the subject of the proxy on a particular matter with respect to which the broker or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What constitutes a quorum? 
A: As of the record date for the Annual Meeting, 137,213,092 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding.  A majority of the outstanding shares, present or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Who can attend the Annual Meeting? 
A: All stockholders of record as of March 11, 2019 can attend. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Who pays for this proxy solicitation? 
A: The Company will bear the entire cost of solicitation of proxies, including preparation, assembly and mailing of this Proxy Statement, the proxy card and any additional information furnished to stockholders.  Copies of solicitation materials will be furnished to banks, brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians holding shares of the Company's common stock in their names that are beneficially owned by others to forward to these beneficial owners.  Persons representing beneficial owners may be reimbursed for their costs of forwarding the solicitation material to such beneficial owners.  Original solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or personal solicitation by the Company's directors, officers or employees.  The Company will not pay any additional compensation to directors, officers or employees for such services.

PROPOSAL 1 – 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
[BEGIN TABLE]
The Board recommends you vote FOR each of the nominees listed. 
[END TABLE]
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
There are currently nine directors on the Board, William C. Bayless, Jr., William Blakeley Chandlee III, G. Steven Dawson, Cydney C. Donnell, Mary C. Egan, Edward Lowenthal, Oliver Luck, C. Patrick Oles,Jr., and John T. Rippel. Mr. Chandlee has decided to not stand for re-election to the Board of Directors at the Annual Meeting in order to focus on other opportunities.  Each of the other current directors has been nominated for re-election to the Board.   The Board is currently contemplating adding an additional director in the future.  The employment agreement with Mr. Bayless provides that he will be nominated as a director.  See "Executive Compensation – Employment Contracts" for additional information.  Directors elected at the Annual Meeting will hold office for a one-year term.
All nominees have consented to serve as directors.  The Board has no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable to act as director.  However, if a director is unable to stand for re-election, the Board may either reduce the size of the Board or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may designate a substitute.  If a substitute nominee is named, the proxies will vote for the election of the substitute.
Directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting.  Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote for each of the eight director nominees.  Cumulative voting is not permitted. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Board Composition
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks directors with established strong professional reputations and experience in areas relevant to the strategy and operations of the business.  Each of the nominees for election as a director at the Annual Meeting holds or has held senior executive positions in large, complex organizations and has experience that meets this objective, as described below.  In these positions, they have also gained experience in core management skills, such as strategic and financial planning, public company financial reporting, compliance, risk management and leadership development.  Each director also has experience serving on or advising boards of directors and board committees of other organizations and has an understanding of corporate governance practices and trends.
In addition to the above, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considered the specific experience described in the biographical details that follow in determining to nominate the individuals set forth below for election as directors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Skills and Experiences Support Our Long-Term Strategy 
Investment Expertise Real Estate Expertise 
Legal/Regulatory Strategic Planning

[END TABLE]
 The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also believes that each of the nominees has other key attributes that are important to an effective board:  integrity, candor, analytical skills, the willingness to engage management and each other in a constructive and collaborative fashion, and the ability and commitment to devote significant time and energy to serve on the Board and its committees.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee takes into account diversity considerations (as discussed below in "Board Diversity") in determining the director nominees and planning for director succession and believes that, as a group, the nominees bring a diverse range of perspectives to the Board's deliberations.  Each of the nominees, other than Mr. Bayless, is independent of the Company and its management.
As set forth below, our director nominees exhibit a balanced mix of independence, tenure, gender diversity, age, and financial expertise.

Consideration of Director Nominees
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider appropriate nominees for director whose names are submitted in writing by a holder of the Company's common stock.  Nominations must be addressed to Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, c/o American Campus Communities, Inc., 12700 Hill Country Blvd., Suite T-200, Austin, Texas 78738, indicating the nominee's qualification and other relevant biographical information and providing confirmation of the nominee's consent to serve as director.  In order to be considered for the next annual election of directors, any such written request must comply with the requirements set forth in the Company's bylaws.
The Chairman of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer or Board of Directors may call a special meeting of the stockholders.  A special meeting of stockholders will be called upon the written request of the stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting, provided that such written request complies with the requirements set forth in the Company's bylaws.
The committee considers nominees for the Board from any reasonable source, including current Board members, stockholders or other persons.  In 2018, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee retained a third party to assist in the identification process for independent directors.
Each of the current directors has been nominated for election as director at the 2019 Annual Meeting, other than Mr. Chandlee, who decided to not stand for re-election to the Board of Directors at the Annual Meeting.  
GOVERNANCE OF THE COMPANY
Board Independence and Meetings
Board Governance Documents.  The Board maintains charters for all committees.  In addition, the Board has adopted a written set of corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics.  To view the committee charters, corporate governance guidelines and code of business conduct and ethics, please visit www.AmericanCampus.com.  The Board has adopted and adheres to corporate governance practices that the Board and senior management believe promote the highest standards of integrity, are sound and represent best practices.  The Board of Directors periodically reviews these governance practices, the rules and listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and SEC regulations, as well as best practices suggested by recognized governance authorities.
Independence.  There are eight nominees for director.  The Board of Directors has determined, after considering all of the relevant facts and circumstances, that seven nominees (Messrs. Dawson, Lowenthal, Luck, Oles and Rippel, and Ms. Donnell and Ms. Egan) are independent, as "independence" is defined by the New York Stock Exchange.  This means that none of the independent directors has any direct or indirect material relationship with the Company, either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company.  As a result, the Board has a majority of independent directors on the Board as required by the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. 
Executive Sessions.  Non-employee directors have regularly scheduled executive sessions in which they meet without the presence of management or management directors.  These executive sessions typically occur before or after each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors.  Any independent director may request that an additional executive session be scheduled.  The presiding director of these executive sessions is the Independent Chairman of the Board, Mr. Lowenthal.
Board Leadership Structure; Separate Independent Chairman of the Board
Since the 2004 IPO, the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board have been separate.  Currently, Mr. Lowenthal serves as the Chairman of the Board and Mr. Bayless serves as a director and Chief Executive Officer.  The Board of Directors believes this is the most appropriate structure for us at this time because it makes the best use of Mr. Lowenthal's skills and experience gained over a distinguished career, including as a founder and President of Wellsford Real Properties, Inc.
Board's and Committees' Roles In Risk Oversight
The Board, as a whole, has responsibility for risk oversight, with reviews of certain areas being conducted by the relevant committees that report on their deliberations to the Board.  The oversight responsibility of the Board and its committees is enabled by management's reporting processes that are designed to provide visibility to the Board about the identification, assessment and management of critical risks and management's risk mitigation strategies.  These areas of focus include competitive, economic, operational (including those related to cybersecurity), financial (accounting, credit, liquidity and tax), legal, regulatory, compliance, health, safety and environment, and reputational risks.  The Board and its committees oversee risks associated with their respective principal areas of focus, as summarized in the following Board Committee table.  Each committee meets in executive session with key management personnel and representatives of outside advisors (for example, the head of Internal Audit meets in executive session with the Audit Committee).  
Corporate Responsibility
Corporate responsibility is fundamental to the Company's mission to consistently provide every resident and team member with an environment conducive to healthy living, personal growth, academic achievement and professional success. This mission drives our ESG (environmental, social and governance) vision of creating healthy, sustainable environments with a sense of community and connection by giving back, investing in our employees and driving long-term value for all stakeholders.
During 2018, the Company formed a multi-functional ESG Committee sponsored by our President and engaged a third-party ESG consultant. Working together, the committee and our consultant are conducting an initial ESG evaluation of the Company's existing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, performing an entity-level ESG analysis and benchmarking our existing practices versus those publicly disclosed from a selection of peers.  Additional information regarding the Company's ESG initiatives may be found online at www.AmericanCampus.com at About Us (although none of the information on the Company's website is incorporated into this Proxy Statement by reference).
Board Committees 
The following table identifies each committee of the Board, its key function, its primary areas of risk oversight and the number of meetings held during 2018.  A copy of the charter for each of these committees is available on the Company's website at www.AmericanCampus.com.

 Committee Charting
The following table graphically displays the current directors, the current committee members, the respective committee chair, the independent members and Audit Committee financial experts (as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K), based on their expertise in accounting and financial management. Each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance, Compensation, Audit and Risk and Strategic Planning Committees satisfies the independence requirements of applicable law and the requirements of the SEC and NYSE.
Board and Committee Evaluations
The Board recognizes that a thorough, constructive evaluation process enhances the effectiveness of the Board and contributes to the implementation of the Company's governance practice.  It is important to take stock of Board, committee, and director performance and to solicit and act upon feedback received.  As such, each director participates in the annual process outlined below. Director Qualifications; Limits on Board Service
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews with the Board on an annual basis the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members in the context of the then-current composition of the Board.  In addition to qualities of intellect, this assessment includes integrity and judgment, business experience and knowledge, reputation and character, issues of diversity (as discussed below), relevant industry and trade association knowledge and participation, accounting and financial expertise, public company experience and relevant legal and regulatory qualifications.  The committee also seeks candidates who are willing to challenge management in a productive and  constructive manner, and who possess the willingness and ability to devote the time and effort required to effectively serve on the Board.  The committee makes this determination in the context of an assessment of the perceived needs of the Board at that point in time.  The committee evaluates all nominees for director based on these criteria, including nominees that may be recommended by stockholders.
The Board recognizes that its members benefit from service on the boards of other companies.  That service is encouraged, but it is also critical that directors have the opportunity to dedicate sufficient time to their service on our  Board.  To that end, individuals who serve on more than six other public company boards will not normally be asked to join the Board unless the Board determines that such simultaneous service would not impair the ability of such individual to effectively serve on the Board.
Term Limits; Retirement Age
The Guidelines on Governance provide that, as a general matter, non-employee directors will not stand for election to a new term of service at any Annual Meeting following their 75th birthday.  However, the Board may approve exceptions to this practice when it believes it is in the Company's interest to do so.  The Board does not believe it should establish term limits for director service, instead preferring to rely upon the mandatory retirement age and the evaluation procedures described below as primary methods of ensuring that each director continues to act in a manner consistent with the best interests of the Company, stockholders and the Board.  The Board believes that term limits have the disadvantage of limiting valuable insights from directors who have been able to develop, over a period of time, a specialized understanding of student housing and, therefore, provide a beneficial contribution to the Board as a whole.
Board Diversity
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the current composition of the Board in light of the diverse communities and geographies the Company serves and the interplay of a candidate's or nominee's experience, education, skills, background, gender, race, age, ethnicity, and other qualities and attributes with those of the other Board members.  Consideration extends beyond the traditional notion of diversity to include a more broad range of experience, thought, perspectives, and competencies to enable effective board leadership.  In implementing its practice of considering diversity of thought, more emphasis may be placed on attracting or retaining director nominees with certain specific competencies or experience, such as industry, regulatory, operational, or financial expertise, depending on the circumstances and the composition of the Company's Board at the time.  Gender, age, race, and ethnic diversity also have been, and will continue to be, a priority in the director nomination process as a board comprised of directors with widely-varying backgrounds provide a more robust and complex perspective and is better able to provide oversight in driving sustainable financial performance in the current complex and rapidly-evolving business environment.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and independent members of the Board remain cognizant of the Board's characteristics, monitoring the effectiveness of the current practice and focusing on its diverse priorities as the Board evolves and new candidates or nominees are considered.  In 2018, the Board's diversity was enhanced with the appointment of Mary C. Egan, a proven leader with a wealth of strategic business consulting experience who expanded the Board's existing gender and age diversity, while providing additional diversity of thought and expertise to the Board.
Number of Directors; Director Vacancies
The bylaws provide that at any regular meeting or at any special meeting called for that purpose, a majority of the entire Board of Directors may increase or decrease the number of directors, provided that there cannot be less than three directors.  The tenure of office of a director will not be affected by any decrease in the number of directors.  The bylaws also provide that if any or all the directors cease to be directors, any vacancy, other than vacancies that result from an increase in the number of directors or from the removal of a director, may in general be filled solely by a majority of the remaining directors, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum.  Any vacancy that results from an increase in the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of the entire Board of Directors.  Any vacancy that results from the removal of a director may be filled either by a majority of the  remaining directors or the Company's stockholders.  Any director elected to fill a vacancy will hold office until the next annual election of directors and until a successor is elected and qualified.
Stockholder Approval of Amendment of the Charter and Bylaws and Transactions Outside the Ordinary Course of Business
The Company's charter, including its provisions on removal of directors, may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.  The Company's bylaws may be amended by a majority of the directors or by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
The charter provides that the Company may not merge with or into another entity, sell all or substantially all of its assets, engage in a share exchange or engage in similar transactions outside the ordinary course of the Company's business unless the transaction or transactions are approved by the affirmative vote of the majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, except if:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the merger will merge one of the Company's 90% or more owned subsidiaries into the Company without amending the charter other than in limited respects and without altering the contract rights of the stock of the subsidiary (in which case only the approval of the Board of Directors and the board of directors of the subsidiary is necessary); 
• the Company is the successor corporation in a share exchange (in which case only the approval of the Board of Directors is necessary); or 
• the Company is the survivor in the merger and the merger does not change the terms of any class or series of the Company's outstanding stock, or otherwise amend the charter, and the number of shares of stock of each class or series outstanding immediately before the merger does not increase by more than 20% of the number of shares of each such class or series of stock that was outstanding immediately prior to effectiveness of the merger (in which case only the approval of the Board of Directors is necessary). 
[END TABLE]
Guidelines on Governance and Codes of Ethics
The Board has adopted Guidelines on Governance to address significant corporate governance issues.  These guidelines provide a framework for the Company's corporate governance initiatives and cover a variety of topics, including the role of the Board, Board selection and composition, Board committees, Board operation and structure, Board orientation and evaluation, Board planning and oversight functions and stock ownership guidelines.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing and reviewing the guidelines and reporting and recommending to the Board any changes to the guidelines.
The Board of Directors has also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which is designed to help officers, managers and employees resolve ethical issues in an increasingly complex business environment.  It covers topics such as reporting unethical or illegal behavior, compliance with law, share trading, conflicts of interest, fair dealing, protection of the Company's assets, disclosure of proprietary information, internal controls, personal community activities, business records, communication with external audiences and obtaining assistance to help resolve ethical issues.  The Board also adopted a Code of Ethical Conduct for Senior Financial Officers, which is applicable to the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller and persons performing similar functions.
You may obtain a copy of the committee charters, Guidelines on Governance, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Code of Ethical Conduct for Senior Financial Officers at www.AmericanCampus.com.  
Management Succession
Pursuant to the Company's Guidelines on Governance, the Board undertakes regular and appropriate succession planning for the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers, including policies and principles for selection and performance review for the Chief Executive Officer, as well as policies regarding succession in case of emergency or the retirement of the Chief Executive Officer.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has reviewed the succession plans and reported on them to the Board.
Stockholder Outreach and Engagement 
Engagement and transparency with stockholders is helpful in gleaning useful feedback on a wide variety of topics, including governance, compensation, stockholder communication, board composition, stockholder proposals, business performance and operations. 
The Company regularly interacts and communicates with stockholders through a number of forums, including quarterly earnings presentations, SEC filings, annual meetings, investor conferences and web communications.  Management's outreach efforts during 2018 included meetings with stockholders who collectively held a majority of the outstanding common stock.  Additionally in 2018, members of senior management and the Board proactively engaged both passive and active stockholders in an ongoing annual review of the Company's corporate governance policies, board composition, executive compensation program, sustainability initiatives, long-term business strategy and other topics.
The information received in regular stockholder interaction and through the Company's proactive outreach program is shared regularly with management and the Board and is considered in the processes that set the Company's governance practices and strategic direction.  Stockholder feedback is also considered in refining and tailoring the public disclosure practices of the Company.

Stockholder Communications
Stockholders and interested parties who wish to communicate with any member of the Board of Directors may do so in writing to the following address:
Mr. Edward Lowenthal
Chairman of the Board c/o American Campus Communities, Inc.
12700 Hill Country Blvd., Suite T-200
Austin, Texas 78738
Mr. Lowenthal will review all correspondence addressed to the Board, or any individual Board member, for any inappropriate correspondence and correspondence more suitably directed to management. Mr. Lowenthal will summarize all correspondence not forwarded to the Board and make the correspondence available to the Board for its review at the Board's request.  Mr. Lowenthal will forward stockholder communications to the Board prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board following the receipt of the communication as appropriate.  
Stock Ownership Guidelines
To further support the Company's goal of achieving a strong link with stockholders, directors are strongly encouraged to purchase and hold shares of common stock with a market value equal to or greater than $350,000 within five years of their election to the Board. This was increased from $250,000 in 2017 based on a review of comparative stock ownership guidelines of the Company's peer group. Additionally, senior officers (which currently total 29 persons) are strongly encouraged to acquire and hold shares of the Company's common stock having a market value equal to or greater than the following amounts within three years of becoming a senior officer: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Chief Executive Officer   6 times annual base salary 
President or Executive Vice President   3 times annual base salary 
Senior Vice President   1 times annual base salary 
[END TABLE]
Operating partnership units, options, restricted stock awards, units subject to vesting, settlement or forfeiture, and shares held in the Company's deferred compensation plan count towards the recommended levels.  Once a director or senior officer meets the stock ownership guidelines, periodic market declines in the value of the Company's common stock will not adversely affect any previous determination by the Board that the stock ownership guidelines had been met by the director or senior officer.  In addition, senior officers must hold, and may not sell, any vested restricted stock awards until the applicable stock ownership guideline has been met.  As of the record date all directors and senior officers were in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines.
Short Selling, Hedging and Pledging Prohibitions
Directors and officers may not make "short sales" of any of the Company's equity securities.  "Short sales" are defined as sales of securities that the seller does not own at the time of the sale, or, if owned, securities that will not be delivered for a period longer than 20 days after the sale.  In addition, the Company's directors and officers may not engage in transactions in derivatives of the Company's equity securities, including hedging transactions, and may not pledge any of the Company's equity securities.
Repricing and Cash Buyouts of Underwater Options and Stock Appreciation Right Prohibitions
The 2018 Incentive Award Plan and Corporate Governance Guidelines prohibit the repricing of options to purchase the Company's common stock and stock appreciation rights.  The exercise price for options or stock appreciation rights will not be lowered even if the current market price of the Company's common stock is below the exercise price.  The 2018 Incentive Award Plan also prohibits cash buyouts of underwater options and stock appreciation rights.  To date, the Company has not issued any stock options or stock appreciation rights.
Prohibition on Classifying the Board
The Company's bylaws prohibit a future election to classify the Board pursuant to Section 3-803 of the Maryland General Corporation Law, which prohibition may not be repealed unless approved by stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of all the votes cast on the matter by stockholders entitled to vote on the matter.

[END TABLE]
On May 3, 2018, the date of the 2018 Annual Meeting, each then current member of the Board was re-elected and each non-employee director, other than the Chairman of the Board, received 2,921 restricted stock units, or RSUs, and the Chairman of the Board received 4,064 RSUs, valued at $39.37 per RSU, or a value of $115,000 and $160,000, respectively.  All 2018 grants immediately vested and were settled in shares of the Company's common stock and/or cash in lieu of the delivery of shares.  As of December 31, 2018, no RSUs were outstanding.  
Mr. Rippel and Ms. Egan received RSUs with a dollar value of $115,000 on March 8, 2018 and September 6, 2018, respectively, the dates on which they were appointed to the Board.  On the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting, each non-employee director who is re-elected to the Board of Directors, other than the Chairman of the Board, will receive RSUs with a value of $117,500, and the Chairman of the Board will receive RSUs with a value of $162,500. The increased RSU amounts received by directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting were determined by the Compensation Committee after engaging an independent compensation consultant in 2018 to evaluate the cash and equity compensation for the Company's Board of Directors as compared to peer companies.  In addition to increasing the annual RSU grants for Board members, the Compensation Committee also determined it was appropriate to increase the quarterly Board member fees to $18,750 and the quarterly Chairman of the Board fees to $29,275, as well as the quarterly fees to the chairs of the Compensation Committee to $4,687 and the quarterly fees to the chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee $3,750 to better align the Company's Board compensation levels with that of the Company's peer group.
Members of the Board of Directors are also reimbursed for travel expenses incurred in connection with the Company's business, including attendance at meetings of the Board and its committees. The table below summarizes the compensation paid to each non-employee director for 2018:

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee of American Campus Communities, Inc. has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") provides a detailed description of the executive compensation philosophy, objectives and programs, the compensation decisions made under those programs and the factors considered by the Compensation Committee.  The CD&A focuses on the compensation of the Named Executive Officers for 2018, who were:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name   Title 
William C. Bayless, Jr.   Chief Executive Officer 
James C. Hopke, Jr.   President 
William W. Talbot   Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer 
Jennifer Beese   Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer 
Daniel B. Perry   Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer 
[END TABLE]
As in previous years, Named Executive Officers for 2018 were awarded compensation based on policies that closely link compensation to performance.  These policies, in planned combination, generate rewards for achievement of high-level Company and individual performance and discourage excessive short-term risk taking.  This balance is essential to align management with the long-term interests of stockholders.
This CD&A discusses the Company, its business and individual measures used in assessing performance.  These measures are discussed in the limited context of the executive compensation program.  You should not interpret them as statements of the Company's expectations or as any form of guidance.  We caution you not to apply the statements or disclosures made in this CD&A in any other context. 
2018 Performance
The Compensation Committee views performance for compensatory purposes in two primary ways:  (1) financial and operating performance including individual goals and objectives and results against the Company's growth targets, and (2) returns to stockholders over time, both on an absolute basis and relative to other companies, including the compensation peer group (see "Compensation Consultant and Benchmarking").
The 2018 compensation decisions made by the Compensation Committee reflect strong alignment between pay and performance with respect to the pre-established measures and goals under the annual cash and long-term equity incentive plans and the performance and contributions of the Named Executive Officers to the Company's financial and operating performance during the year.  In determining the incentive compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers for 2018, the Compensation Committee rigorously evaluated Company and individual  performance relative to the pre-established measures and goals under the annual cash and long-term equity incentive plans. 
In 2018, the Company celebrated its 25th anniversary and continued its long track record of creating value for stockholders.  In doing so, we accomplished significant financial and strategic objectives and milestones, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achieved record levels in total revenue and FFOM; 
• Leading the sector in leasing for the 14th consecutive year with a 2018/2019 academic year same store lease-up that achieved 97% occupancy and 3.6% opening rental revenue growth; 
• Produced same store NOI growth for the 14th consecutive year (every year since becoming a public company in 2004); 
• Delivered ten new owned and presale development projects into service on-schedule, totaling $669.9 million in development cost, the largest development delivery year in the Company's history, with the six owned development projects completed 1% under budget; 
• Achieved 97% opening occupancy for the 10 new owned and presale development projects, resulting in full stabilization at opening; 
• Awarded ten new on-campus development projects including two American Campus Equity (ACE®) on-campus developments, seven third-party projects, and one project with a transaction structure to be determined; 
• Executed an agreement to develop a $615 million, 10,440-bed housing project for college students participating in the Disney College Program, which is currently scheduled to be delivered in multiple phases through 2023;  
• Increased the common dividend to $1.84 per share on an annualized basis, the sixth consecutive increase, representing dividend growth of over 36% since 2012. 
[END TABLE]
A reconciliation of net income to FFOM and NOI for the year ended December 31, 2018, is contained in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the earnings release furnished on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 20, 2019.
As discussed more fully below under "2018 Executive Compensation", a majority of the quantitative performance metrics for the cash incentive opportunity were met, and two of the three quantitative performance goals for the equity incentive opportunity were met.  The Company did not meet goals related to FFOM, FFOM per share and total NOI primarily due to the strategic decision to execute on dispositions not originally contemplated for the year when 2018 compensation goals were set.
Management recommended the additional dispositions to the Board based on a strategic rationale to take advantage of strong private market valuations for student housing properties and to further strengthen the Company's balance  sheet in advance of an increased value-enhancing development pipeline.  Management was aware this would negatively impact the performance results for the previously mentioned compensation metrics.  The Board took these factors into consideration and determined that this capital allocation strategy was in the best long-term interest of stockholder value.  The Compensation Committee took this strategic decision making, and the resulting negative impact to pre-set objective compensation goals, into consideration when determining the award amount granted pursuant to the subjective portion of the executive compensation program.
2018 Changes to the Executive Compensation Program
The Compensation Committee periodically engages an independent compensation consultant to advise on executive compensation trends and best practices, as well as any relevant regulatory updates that may impact our short- and long-term executive compensation programs.  The Compensation Committee uses this information to form decisions on executive compensation and to ensure that the overall program continues to provide a strong link between pay and performance.
Based on this review and in response to changing business needs, market best practices and stockholder feedback, the Committee took the actions outlined below to enhance the 2018 executive compensation program.  The Committee believes these changes create a stronger and more transparent alignment between pay and performance, and the specific rationale for such changes is more fully discussed below. Compensation Policies and Practices—Good Governance
Consistent with the Company's commitment to strong corporate governance and responsiveness to stockholders, in 2018 the Board maintained the following compensation policies and practices to drive performance and serve the stockholders' long-term interests: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
ü    DO align pay and performance by linking a substantial portion of compensation to the achievement of pre-established performance measures that drive stockholder value   û    DO NOT base incentive awards on a single performance measure, thereby discouraging unnecessary or excessive risk-taking 
ü    DO provide executive officers with the opportunity to earn market-competitive compensation through a mix of cash and equity compensation, with strong emphasis on performance-based incentive awards   û    DO NOT provide guaranteed minimum payouts or uncapped award opportunities 
ü    DO have a robust peer selection process and benchmark executive compensation to target the median of the comparative group of peer companies   û    DO NOT reprice or permit cash buyouts of underwater stock options 
ü    DO require executive officers and directors to own and retain shares of common stock that have significant value to further align interests with stockholders   û    DO NOT provide executive officers with excessive perquisites or other personal benefits 
ü    DO enhance alignment with long-term shareholder value and executive officer retention with 5-year vesting schedules for equity incentive awards earned for prior-year performance   û    DO NOT provide executive officers with pension or retirement benefits other than pursuant to a 401(k) plan and a deferred compensation plan 
ü    DO enable the Board to "claw back" incentive compensation in the event of an accounting restatement due to material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements as a result of misconduct by executive officers   û    DO NOT permit executive officers or directors to engage in derivative or other hedging transactions in the Company's securities 
ü    DO prohibit new tax gross-up arrangements under anti-tax gross-up policy   û    DO NOT provide accelerated vesting upon a change of control under the 2018 Incentive Award Plan 
ü    DO maintain a Compensation Committee comprised solely of independent directors   û    DO NOT provide single-trigger change of control benefits 
ü    DO engage an independent compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee on executive compensation matters and establishing an appropriate peer group   û    DO NOT permit executive officers and directors to hold the Company's securities in margin accounts or to otherwise pledge the securities to secure loans 
[END TABLE]
2018 Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
An advisory vote is submitted to stockholders on an annual basis to approve executive compensation. Our stockholders have consistently supported our executive compensation program.  At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 93% of the votes cast were voted in favor of our resolution seeking advisory approval of our executive compensation.  Over the last five years, stockholder support for our advisory vote on executive compensation has averaged 93%, with no year below 86%.  While we have consistently had strong stockholder support for our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee does use an independent compensation consultant to review the structure of our compensation program, and to assess the effectiveness of our program in aligning executive and stockholder interests.
The Compensation Committee has also continued to evaluate the overall executive compensation program and believes that it is well designed to achieve the objectives of attracting, retaining and motivating talented executives and rewarding superior performance in the context of the business risk environment. 
Objectives of the Compensation Program
The Company recognizes that effective compensation strategies are critical to recruiting, incenting and retaining key employees who contribute to long-term success and thereby create value for stockholders.  Accordingly, the compensation program is designed to achieve the following primary objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract, retain and motivate talented executives;   
• Reward performance that meets or exceeds pre-established Company and tailored individual goals consistent with the Company's strategic plan, while maintaining alignment with stockholders;  
• Provide balanced incentives that discourage excessive risk-taking;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Retain sufficient flexibility to permit executive officers to manage risk and adjust appropriately to meet rapidly changing market and business conditions;  
• Evaluate performance by balancing consideration of those measures management can directly influence with market forces that management cannot control (such as monetary policy and interest rate expectations), but that impact stockholder value;  
• Encourage executives to become and remain long-term stockholders of the Company; and  
• Maintain compensation and corporate governance practices that support the Company's goal to deliver sustained, superior returns to stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
Interests of the executive officers and stockholders are aligned by maintaining a performance- and achievement-oriented environment that provides executives with the opportunity to earn market-competitive levels of cash and equity compensation for strong performance measured against key financial and strategic goals that create long-term stockholder value.
Compensation Consultant and Benchmarking
Prior peer group:  In determining 2018 compensation targets for Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee considered the competitive positioning of executive compensation levels relative to compensation data for the below list of peer companies with respect to the following components of pay: base salary, cash incentive awards, and long-term equity incentive awards.  Consistent with the Company's compensation philosophy, the Compensation Committee generally targeted the median of the peer companies for each of these components and for total compensation.  The 2018 executive compensation program was designed to deliver compensation levels above or below these targets if performance exceeded or failed to achieve the goals established for the annual cash and long-term equity incentive awards.  This methodology is appropriate for the Company's operating style and reflects the need to attract and retain top executive talent.  The peer companies listed below comprise the peer group selected as part of the Company's previous compensation study performed in conjunction with an independent advisor, and was utilized when determining 2018 compensation targets:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Apartment Investment and Management Company Essex Property Trust, Inc. 
Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. Federal Realty Investment Trust 
AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. 
Camden Property Trust Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. 
Corporate Office Properties Trust UDR, Inc. 
Education Realty Trust, Inc. Weingarten Realty Investors 
Equity Residential   
[END TABLE]
New peer group:  As the Company had maintained its prior peer group for several years, the Compensation Committee determined that it was prudent to reassess the composition of the Company's peer group in 2018 to ensure the design and structure of the compensation program continues to be appropriate and consistent with market developments.  As a result, it retained FPL Associates L.P. ("FPL") as its independent consultant to advise on matters related to reassessing the Company's peer group.  At the time of the engagement, the Compensation Committee reviewed independence and determined that FPL met the independence criteria under the Compensation Committee charter and that FPL's engagement raised no conflict of interest.
It is important to note that the Company has no publicly traded direct business competitors, particularly when factoring in its specialization in student housing.  As such, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with FPL, strived to formulate a peer group that best reflects the following characteristics:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Industry and business strategy - identify companies with similar business models, philosophies, and investment criteria. 
• Ownership structure - include companies organized as publicly traded REITs. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Size - ensure companies are similar in size and scope, with the primary measure being total capitalization and leasable units under management. 
• Operational intensity - identify companies with a comparable number of leasing units administered and similar complexity of diverse business activities and geographic reach.  
• Complexity - include companies engaging in transactions of a similar complex nature to transactions undertaken by the Company, such as development activities, joint ventures, and public/private partnerships. 
• Talent - identify companies that might attempt to recruit our executives, and determine from which companies we might recruit executives if we needed to externally replace a member of our executive team with an individual possessing similar capabilities. 
• Index - consider whether a company is classified within the FTSE NAREIT Residential Index, as well as its relative weighting within the Index. 
• Other considerations - identify companies that we compete against for investors, and/or companies whom key analysts and proxy advisory firms name as our peers.  Determine which other companies cite us as a peer. 
[END TABLE]
Based on the analysis and considerations provided by FPL, the Compensation Committee has determined that the following 16 companies best represent the characteristics noted above.  In order to ensure the goals outlined above were met, the Compensation Committee evaluated both the characteristics of each individual company as well as the composition of the peer group as a whole.  Although the following REITs were among the closest in comparison to us, our specialization as the only student housing REIT and our unique operational and market cycles puts us in a unique category.  Unlike other companies, the fundamentals that drive success in our business model do not always correlate to broader macroeconomic trends.  Additionally, we manage a student housing tenant base that is not directly comparable to the peer companies; as such, our operational characteristics and dynamics are unique.  The following companies may individually demonstrate comparability in certain of the criteria noted above, but not in all.
[BEGIN TABLE]
*Apartment Investment and Management Company *Federal Realty Investment Trust 
*AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Invitation Homes Inc. 
*Camden Property Trust *Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. 
CubeSmart Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. 
Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc. Sun Communities, Inc. 
*Equity Residential  *Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. 
*Essex Property Trust, Inc. *UDR, Inc. 
Extra Space Storage, Inc. *Weingarten Realty Investors 
[END TABLE]
* Represents companies that were also included in our prior peer group.
After the peer group was finalized, the Compensation Committee then engaged FPL to provide an evaluation of the Company's overall compensation program design, taking into account the new peer group.  As part of this analysis, FPL provided market data and compensation practice information on the new peer group companies, and advised on trends and developments in executive compensation practices and philosophies generally.  This new peer group will be utilized by the Compensation Committee when setting the Named Executive Officers' target compensation mix and levels for 2019.  
Compensation Mix
The executive compensation philosophy promotes a compensation mix that emphasizes variable pay and long-term stockholder value.  An emphasis on incentive compensation creates greater alignment with the interests of stockholders, ensures that the business strategy is executed by decision-makers in a manner that focuses on the creation of long-term value rather than only short-term results, and encourages prudent evaluation of risks.  Accordingly, the compensation structure is designed such that a significant portion of Named Executive Officers' total direct compensation is in the form of equity awards granted based on past performance that vest over time.  Pay at Risk
The following diagram illustrates the total direct compensation targets of the CEO and each other active Named Executive Officer for 2018.  The charts outline the size, in percentage terms, of the targeted direct compensation elements (at the date of grant) pre-established by the Compensation Committee for performance year 2018.  CEO target compensation reflects additional weight on long-term equity incentive compensation because the Compensation Committee believes that, due to his leadership role as Chief Executive Officer, his compensation structure should reflect even greater alignment with stockholders.  The dark outer band of the charts reflects the incentive or at-risk performance-based components of compensation (e.g., 81% of the CEO's 2018 target direct compensation was at-risk performance based).
Elements and Philosophy of the Compensation Program
For 2018, the compensation provided to executive officers consisted of the same elements generally available to non-executive officers: base salary; annual cash incentive compensation; long-term equity incentive compensation; and other perquisites and benefits. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS OF PAY 
The elements of the Company's executive compensation program are presented below in summary format. 
COMPONENT FORM PURPOSE 
Base Salary Cash Provide a competitive fixed rate of pay recognizing different levels of responsibility and performance within the Company. 
Annual Incentive Performance  Cash Award  Reward executives for achieving transactional, operational, financial and strategic objectives.

Company benefits are designed to provide market competitive benefits to protect employees' and their covered dependents' health and welfare and provide retirement benefits.  
Other Benefits and Perquisites  Health, Welfare and Retirement Programs  Executives are generally eligible to participate in the same benefit programs that are offered to non-executive employees. Company benefits are designed to provide market competitive benefits to protect employees' and their covered dependents' health and welfare and provide retirement benefits.  
[END TABLE]
 Base Salary.  The base salary payable to each Named Executive Officer provides a fixed component of compensation that reflects the executive's position and responsibilities.  Base salary is generally targeted to approximate the competitive market median of the peer companies, but may deviate from this target based on an individual's sustained performance, contributions, leadership, experience, expertise and specific roles within the Company as compared to the benchmark data.  The Compensation Committee reviews base salaries annually and may make adjustments to better match competitive market levels or to recognize an executive's professional growth and development or increased responsibilities.  The Compensation Committee also considers the success of each executive officer in developing and executing on strategic plans, exercising leadership and creating stockholder value.
In determining base salaries for the Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee analyzes base salary information of the peer companies.  Although the Compensation Committee periodically considers information from REIT industry and other compensation surveys, it places primary emphasis on publicly available data from the peer companies' proxy statements and other SEC filings, which is more detailed by individual executive officer position than the data typically provided in compensation surveys.
Annual Cash Incentive Compensation.  Named Executive Officers are provided with an annual opportunity to earn cash incentive awards.  For each Named Executive Officer, annual cash incentive compensation reflects the achievement of pre-established measures related to transactional, operational, financial and strategic objectives that serve as the underlying assumptions in the Company's stated earnings guidance such as NOI and rental revenue growth, operating margin improvement, the achievement of targeted development yields, quality external growth, and targeted dispositions.  The Compensation Committee also considers each executive's individual performance, departmental performance, and the overall performance of the Company.  
Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation.  The Compensation Committee and the independent members of the Board continually evaluate the long-term incentive plan in the context of the overall executive compensation program, the Company's business needs and feedback from stockholders.  This process includes assessing the level of discretion permitted in evaluating the performance of and objectives achieved by the Named Executive Officers.  The Compensation Committee has concluded that a significant portion of each Named Executive Officer's long-term equity incentive awards will be determined based on the achievement of pre-established quantitative performance metrics that are not subject to Compensation Committee discretion.  These specific performance factors are aligned with the Company's business strategy and current market conditions and are based on objective, quantifiable measures.  Such factors include absolute and relative TSR and FFOM per share achieved.  
In addition, when assessing the weight that should be placed on discretionary and subjective measures of performance, the Compensation Committee also considers the importance of maintaining flexibility in the evaluation of long-term performance.  While measuring performance relative to objective metrics is important and is a key part of the overall long-term incentive program, the Compensation Committee philosophically believes it is important to also assess more intangible accomplishments such as leadership development and overall execution of the Company's mission and long-term strategic business plan which can include decisions that may impact the ability to meet certain objective metrics.  Examples include strategic reinvestment in technology and systems and capital allocation decisions such as opportunistic dispositions of properties that were not originally contemplated when establishing objective compensation metrics for the year.  The flexibility permitted in the subjective portion of the compensation program allows management to adjust to meet rapidly changing market and business conditions and to act in the in the best interests of stockholders to create, and preserve, long-term value for the Company's stakeholders. Additionally, the Compensation Committee believes that having rigid goals and formulaic determinations of performance for the entire long-term incentive opportunity may increase compensation risk by encouraging a narrow focus that may be inappropriate in light of these industry and strategic considerations.  
When evaluating a suitable allocation between such objective and subjective measures of performance, the Compensation Committee concluded that a 50/50 split between a formulaic objective evaluation of performance and a more qualitative subjective evaluation provides the appropriate incentive structure and balance to drive long-term stockholder value and discourage excessive risk-taking.   The Company is the only publicly traded student housing REIT, and is therefore uniquely impacted by different market cycles as compared to other REITs.  In a constantly evolving business environment, certain of the objective performance measures may not be met for a fiscal year due to strategic business decisions made in the best interest of long-term stockholder value.  Additionally, the specialized nature of student housing involves a rigorous annual lease-up process, managing customer service for a unique tenant base, continually fostering University relationships, and managing an employee base much larger than most companies of similar size due to the need for higher staffing levels (including student Community  Assistants) at our properties.  For these reasons, the Compensation Committee deems it important to retain a certain level of discretion in evaluating performance, having the flexibility to discretionarily adjust incentive awards to take into account the Company's unique and specialized dynamics. The Compensation Committee believes that this 50/50 approach is instrumental in driving consistent, superior total returns to stockholders and limiting risk in the executive compensation program.  
Unlike companies that grant equity awards on a prospective basis prior to performance, the Company's long-term equity incentive plan is retrospective in nature, such that equity awards are granted following the satisfaction of specified performance goals.  Similar to annual cash incentive awards, the grant and value of long-term equity incentive awards are approved at the beginning of each fiscal year and determined solely by performance achieved in the preceding fiscal year.  If threshold performance has not been achieved with respect to a performance goal for a particular performance period, the portion of the long-term equity incentive awards based on that performance goal is not granted for that period.  Therefore, at the time of their grant, long-term equity incentive awards have been fully earned and are not subject to additional performance-based vesting requirements.  These awards vest over a five-year period, furnishing retention benefits and creating significant long-term alignment with stockholders by incentivizing each Named Executive Officer to identify and accomplish long-term business objectives that generate value through stock price appreciation and dividend growth. 
Because of the retrospective nature of the long-term equity incentive plan and the SEC's disclosure rules, the 2019 long-term equity incentive awards granted to Named Executive Officers do not appear in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, but will be reflected in next year's Summary Compensation Table as RSAs granted in 2019.  2018 Executive Compensation
The Compensation Committee considered all of the factors established under the executive compensation program for 2018 and has discretion to consider other relevant factors, although it places the greatest emphasis on the factors noted in the "2018 Base Salary," "2018 Annual Cash Incentive Awards" and "2018 Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards" sections below.
The table below sets forth total direct compensation (base salary + annual cash incentive award + long-term equity incentive award) of each active Named Executive Officer for 2018, 2017 and 2016, consistent with the manner in which the Compensation Committee evaluates executive compensation and pay-for-performance alignment.  This table differs from compensation reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in that it reflects the value of Named Executive Officers' long-term equity incentive awards in the performance year for which they were earned, rather than the year in which they were granted (e.g., long-term equity incentive awards granted in January 2019 for 2018 performance are shown in the table below as 2018 compensation).  While compensation reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table is useful, the SEC's disclosure rules do not take into account the retrospective nature of the Company's executive compensation program and therefore create a one-year lag between the value of Named Executive Officers' long-term equity incentive awards and the performance year for which they were earned (e.g., long-term equity incentive awards granted in January 2019 for 2018 performance will not be shown in the Summary Compensation Table until the 2020 Proxy Statement as 2019 compensation).  This table supplements, and does not replace, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.

The Company's 2018 performance, as measured by the performance metrics utilized for determining the 2018 annual cash incentive awards, was as follows:

(1) As discussed  above in "2018 Performance," in evaluating FFOM achieved in 2018, the Compensation Committee noted this objective was not met due to the strategic decision to execute on dispositions not originally contemplated for the year in order to take advantage of strong private market valuations for student housing properties and to further strengthen the Company's balance sheet.

When determining the 2018 cash incentive awards, the Compensation Committee noted that a majority of the quantitative goals listed above were achieved, and in some cases exceeded.  As discussed above in "2018 Performance", the Company did not meet goals related to FFOM, total NOI, NOI growth and operating margin primarily due to the strategic decision to execute on dispositions not originally contemplated for the year in order to take advantage of strong private market valuations for student housing properties and to further strengthen the Company's balance sheet.  After taking all quantitative factors into account as well as each Named Executive Officer's individual and department accomplishments, the Compensation Committee determined that the 2018 cash incentive awards are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Award 
William C. Bayless, Jr. $ 1,100,000   
James C. Hopke, Jr. $ 550,000   
William W. Talbot $ 625,000   
Jennifer Beese $ 600,000   
Daniel B. Perry $ 550,000   
[END TABLE]
2018 Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards.  As set forth below, 50% of each Named Executive Officer's annual long-term equity incentive award for 2018 performance was based on three pre-established quantitative goals where achievement was not subject to the Compensation Committee's discretion, and the other 50% was based on the Compensation Committee's subjective consideration of performance related to pre-established management objectives as well as performance in advancing the Company's long-term strategic business plan during the year.  Awards are expressed as a fixed dollar amount at threshold, target and high levels and, to the extent performance  fell between two levels with respect to any quantitative metric, linear interpolation was applied.  If actual performance did not meet the threshold requirement, no awards were earned for the applicable metric.  If actual performance is above the maximum for a metric, the award is the maximum number for the participant's opportunity.  
Awards are granted in the form of RSAs based on the dollar value of the earned award, which is converted into the number of RSAs based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.

      100%         
(2) As discussed above in "2018 Performance," in evaluating FFOM achieved in 2018, the Compensation Committee noted this objective was not met due to the strategic decision to execute on dispositions not originally contemplated for the year in order to take advantage of strong private market valuations for student housing properties and to further strengthen the Company's balance sheet. 
(3) As discussed above in "2018 Performance," the Compensation Committee took into account the impact of the additional dispositions not originally contemplated for the year, as well as management's performance relative to other intangible accomplishments such as leadership development and overall execution of the Company's mission and long-term strategic business plan which can include decisions that may impact the ability to meet certain objective metrics. 
[END TABLE]
GOAL 1:  Absolute Total Stockholder Return
Why does this measure matter? TSR is the most direct measure of creation and preservation of stockholder value.  Result:  The Company delivered TSR of 5.6% in 2018, which was between the threshold and target ranges.
GOAL 2:  Relative Total Stockholder Return vs. RMS Index
Why does this measure matter?  By utilizing a relative measure of TSR performance over a three-year period, the impact of broader market or industry trends that do not directly reflect the Company's actual performance are mitigated.
Result:  TSR of 12.8% for the three years ended December 31, 2018 was in the 53rd percentile, which was between the target and the high end of the range.
GOAL 3: Company Financial Measures — FFOM Per Share
Why does this measure matter?  FFO is a common measure of operating performance for REITs because it excludes, among other items, the effect of gains and losses from real estate sales and real estate depreciation and amortization to allow investors, analysts and management to compare operating performance among companies and across time periods on a consistent basis.  We also believe it is meaningful to present a measure we refer to as FFOM, which reflects certain adjustments to FFO related to the economic performance of our on-campus participating properties.  When calculating FFOM, the Company also excludes losses from early extinguishment of debt incurred in connection with property dispositions, property acquisition costs, contractual executive separation and retirement charges and other non-cash items, as determined in good faith.  FFOM is presented because the Company considers it an important supplemental measure of operating performance and believes it is used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company's performance across time periods.  A reconciliation of net income to FFOM for the year ended December 31, 2018, is contained in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the earnings release furnished on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 20, 2019.
Result:  In 2018, the Company achieved FFOM of $2.31 per fully diluted share, which was below the threshold range.  As discussed above in "2018 Performance," in evaluating FFOM achieved in 2018, the Compensation Committee noted this objective was not met due to the strategic decision to execute on dispositions not originally contemplated for the year in order to take advantage of strong private market valuations for student housing properties and to further strengthen the Company's balance sheet.
SUMMARY:  Objective Criteria 
Because two out of three quantitative performance metrics (Goals 1 and 2) were met in 2018, which represented 50% of the total long-term equity incentive opportunity, the Named Executive Officers earned awards which were calculated based on the weighting of each metric.  As discussed above, when 2018 performance fell between two levels with respect to any metric, linear interpolation was applied.  
GOAL 4: Individual Performance Under Management Objectives  Established by the Compensation Committee for Named Executive Officers
Goals:  Individual objectives relate to areas of special emphasis within the executive's particular responsibilities and duties, with a particular focus on advancing the Company's long-term strategic initiatives.  Other extraordinary or unusual accomplishments or contributions, in light of the business risk environment, are also considered.  
Why does this measure matter?  A review of each Named Executive Officer's annual accomplishments, both individually and respectively in relation to Company-wide accomplishments, enables the Compensation Committee to evaluate the specific contributions of the Named Executive Officer to the Company's success and more closely link pay to performance.
Result:  Each Named Executive Officer achieved high performance with respect to the tailored individual objectives designed to advance the Company's long-term strategic initiatives, which represented 50% of the long-term equity incentive award opportunity.  The significant accomplishments considered by the Compensation Committee in determining the subjective individual performance component of the Named Executive Officers' 2018 awards are discussed below.

William C. Bayless, Jr. $ 3,230,000   
James C. Hopke, Jr. $ 1,260,000   
William W. Talbot $ 1,070,000   
Jennifer Beese $ 980,000   
Daniel B. Perry $ 980,000   
[END TABLE]
Other Benefits and Perquisites
The Company's executive compensation program focuses on the elements described above, with extremely limited provision of perquisites.  The Named Executive Officers are generally eligible to participate in the same benefit programs offered to other employees.  We believe these benefits are competitive with overall market practices.
Severance Benefits
The Named Executive Officers are entitled to receive severance benefits under existing agreements upon certain qualifying terminations of employment (subject to any required payment delay pursuant to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code).  Generally, these severance arrangements support executive retention and continuity of management and provide replacement income if an executive is terminated involuntarily other than for cause.
None of the Company's executive officers are entitled to severance benefits solely upon a change of control of the Company.  Although longstanding legacy arrangements with Messrs. Bayless and Hopke provide certain tax gross-ups with respect to payments made in connection with a change of control, consistent with the Company's commitment to strong corporate governance and responsiveness to stockholders, the Board subsequently adopted a policy prohibiting tax gross-up arrangements, which formalized the Company's existing practice of not entering into new tax gross-up arrangements with executive officers.  This policy was filed on a Current Report on Form 8-K on April 27, 2010.
Policy with Respect to the $1 Million Deduction Limit
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the deductibility on the Company's tax return of compensation over $1 million to any of the Named Executive Officers.  On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which eliminated the exception for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018 unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017.   Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the deductibility on the Company's  tax return of compensation over $1 million to any of the Named Executive Officers.  Although each of our Named Executive Officers' compensation in 2018 exceeded $1 million, the Company believes, because it qualifies as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and therefore is not subject to federal income taxes on income to the extent distributed, the payment of compensation that does not satisfy the requirements of section 162(m) will not generally affect net income.  However, to the extent compensation does not qualify for deduction under section 162(m), a larger portion of stockholder distributions may be subject to federal income taxation as dividend income rather than return of capital.  The Company does not believe section 162(m) will materially affect the taxability of stockholder distributions, although no assurance can be given in this regard due to the variety of factors that affect the tax position of each stockholder.  For these reasons, the Compensation Committee's compensation policy and practices are not directly governed by section 162(m).
Employment Agreements
The Company has entered into employment agreements with certain key employees, including all of the Named Executive Officers, when the Compensation Committee determines an employment agreement is desirable for the Company to obtain a measure of assurance as to the executive's continued employment in light of prevailing market competition for the particular position held by the executive officer, or where the Compensation Committee determines an employment agreement is necessary and appropriate to attract an executive in light of market conditions, the prior experience of the executive or practices at the Company with respect to other similarly situated employees.   These employment agreements are more fully described below under "Employment Contracts" and "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control."
Policy Regarding Clawbacks to Recoup Compensation
If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirement, then the Compensation Committee may require the Named Executive Officers to repay to the Company "Excess Compensation," which is defined as that part of the annual cash bonus and long term equity incentive compensation received by that officer during the two-year period preceding the publication of the restated financial statement that the Compensation Committee determines was in excess of the amount that such officer would have received had such compensation been calculated based on the financial results reported in the restated financial statements.
The Compensation Committee may take into account any factors it deems reasonable in determining whether to seek recoupment of previously paid Excess Compensation and how much Excess Compensation to recoup from individual officers (which need not be the same amount or proportion for every officer), including any conclusion by the Compensation Committee that an officer engaged in wrongdoing or committed grossly negligent acts or omissions.  The amount and form of the compensation to be recouped will be determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion, and recoupment of compensation paid as annual cash bonuses or long term incentives may be made, in the Compensation Committee's discretion, through cancellation of vested or unvested restricted stock awards and/or cash repayment.
Deferred Compensation Plan
Effective January 1, 2015, the Compensation Committee established a deferred compensation plan for the benefit of senior officers, directors and other key employees in which the participant may elect to defer cash compensation and/or equity awards granted under share incentive plans.  A participant has a fully vested right to his or her cash deferral amounts and the vested deferred equity awards.
Risk Considerations
In establishing and reviewing the executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee considers whether the program encourages unnecessary or excessive risk-taking and has concluded that it does not.  Executives' base salaries are fixed in amount and thus do not encourage risk-taking.  The majority of compensation provided to the executive officers is in the form of equity awards which typically vest over a period of five years and further align executives' interests with those of stockholders.  The Compensation Committee believes that by structuring the program such that a considerable amount of the wealth of executives is tied to the Company's long-term health, it avoids the type of disproportionately large short-term incentives which could encourage executives to take risks not in the Company's long-term interests.  We believe this combination of factors encourages executives and other employees to manage the Company in a prudent manner.  
Summary Compensation Table
The table below summarizes the total compensation paid or earned by each of the Named Executive Officers for the three years ended December 31, 2018.  The Company has entered into employment agreements with each of the Named Executive Officers.  Such employment agreements are described below under "Employment Contracts."

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
The following summarizes the compensation payable to each named executive officer under the applicable employment agreement in the event of a termination of such executive's employment.
Each employment agreement provides that the respective executive may terminate the agreement at any time by delivering written notice of termination to us at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such termination, in which case the executive will be entitled to payment of base salary through the effective date of termination, plus all other benefits to which the executive has a vested right at that time.  Additionally, each employment agreement provides that the executive may terminate the agreement for "good reason," which is defined in the employment agreement, in general, as any substantial change by the Company in the nature of the executive's employment without their express written consent; the requirement that the executive be based at a location at least 50 miles further than from his current principal location of employment; the Company's failure to obtain a satisfactory agreement from any successor to assume the terms of the employment agreement; and the Company's breach of any material provision of the employment agreement.
The employment agreements provide that, if the Company terminates an executive's employment without "cause" or the executive terminates employment for "good reason" (each as defined in the applicable employment agreement), the executive will be entitled to the following payments and benefits, subject to execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A cash payment equal to 299% for Mr. Bayless and 100% for Messrs. Hopke, Talbot and Perry and Ms. Beese, in each case times the sum of his or her then-current annual base salary plus the average annual cash bonus paid or payable in respect of the three years immediately prior to the year of termination; 
• A prorated cash bonus for the year in which the termination occurs equal to the greater of (i) the annual cash bonus paid or payable in respect to the year immediately prior to the year in which the termination occurs or (ii) the target cash bonus for the year in which the termination occurs; 
• Health benefits for two years following the executive's termination of employment at the same cost to the executive as in effect immediately preceding such termination, subject to reduction to the extent that the executive receives comparable benefits from a subsequent employer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All of the executive's RSAs vest; and 
• Excise tax equalization payments for Messrs. Bayless and Hopke. 
[END TABLE]
The amounts set forth in the table below represent the compensation payable to each named executive officer under the respective employment agreement in the event of a termination of such executive's employment.  The amounts shown assume such termination was effective as of December 31, 2018, and therefore include amounts earned through such time and are estimates of the amounts that would be paid to the executives upon their termination.  The actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of such executive's termination.

 Pursuant to the employment agreements with Messrs. Bayless, Hopke, Talbot and Perry and Ms. Beese, if an executive's employment is terminated without cause or the executive terminates employment for good reason, retirement, death or disability, all of the executive's RSAs will vest.  "Disability" is defined as any physical or mental disability or infirmity that prevents the performance of the executive's duties for a period of (i) six consecutive months or (ii) an aggregate of 12 months in any 24 consecutive month period.  Any question as to the existence, extent or potentiality of an executive's disability upon which the Company and the executive cannot agree will be determined by a qualified, independent physician selected by us and approved by the executive (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld), with the determination of any such physician being final and conclusive.  "Retirement" is defined as a termination of employment other than for cause, disability or death, following the date on which the sum of the following equals or exceeds 70 years: (i) the number of full years of the executive's employment and other business relationships with the Company or its predecessors and (ii) the executive's age on the date of termination; provided that (x) the executive's employment by (or other business relationships with) the Company and any of its predecessors have continued for a period of at least 120 contiguous full months at the time of termination and, on the date of termination, the executive is at least 50 years old; (y) the executive gives at least six months' prior written notice to the Company of his or her intention to retire; and (z) the noncompetition agreement remains in full force and effect and the executive enters into a general release of all claims in a form that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company.  Under this formula, Messrs. Bayless and Hopke became eligible for retirement in 2014 and 2016, respectively, and Messrs. Talbot and Perry and Ms. Beese will become eligible for retirement in 2024.
The values of the RSAs for which vesting would accelerate for such a termination as of December 31, 2018, based on a closing price of $41.39 on December 31, 2018, are as follows:  Mr. Bayless-$7,542,293, Mr. Hopke-$2,344,040, Mr. Talbot-$2,315,315, Mr. Perry-$1,644,011 and Ms. Beese-$1,578,035.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
Effective January 1, 2015, the Compensation Committee established a deferred compensation plan for the benefit of senior officers, directors and other key employees in which the participant may elect to defer cash compensation and/or vested equity awards granted under the Company's share incentive plans.  A participant has a fully vested right to his or her cash deferral amounts and the vested deferred share awards.
The following table provides certain information regarding contributions to, withdrawals from and earnings in the deferred compensation plan as of December 31, 2018:

CEO Compensation Pay Ratio
For 2018, the total compensation of the Company's CEO as reported in the Summary Compensation Table was  $4,672,998 and total compensation for the median employee was $27,080.  The resulting ratio of the CEO's pay to the pay of the median employee for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 173 to 1.  The CEO to median pay ratio is calculated in accordance with SEC requirements pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.  The Company calculated annual total compensation for the median employee using the same methodology it uses for its named executive officers as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table. The same median employee used in the calculation of the CEO to median pay ratio for 2017 was used for 2018, as there were no significant changes in the Company's employee population or compensation practices in 2018.
Please keep in mind that under the SEC's rules and guidance, there are numerous ways to determine the compensation of a company's median employee, including the employee population sampled, the elements of pay and benefits used, any assumptions made and the use of statistical sampling.  In addition, no two companies have identical employee populations or compensation programs.  As such, the Company's pay ratio may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies.  
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
The Company is not a party to any transaction with executive officers or directors that is required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.

The Audit Committee also evaluates, on an annual basis, whether it is in the best interests of shareholders to reengage Ernst & Young as the Company's independent auditors, and is involved in the selection of the engagement partner in accordance with the mandated Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") partner rotation rules.  The Audit Committee performs these oversight responsibilities in accordance with its Audit Committee Charter, which is available on the investor relations section of the Company's website at www.AmericanCampus.com.
Management has the responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal controls.  In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed with management the audited financial statements in the Company's Annual Report, and discussed with management the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.  The Audit Committee also reviewed and discussed the Company's earnings releases with management.
During 2018, the Audit Committee met with management and the Company's independent auditors and internal auditor periodically to consider the adequacy of the Company's internal controls and the objectivity of the Company's financial reporting in response to the requirements set forth in Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations.  The Audit Committee also discussed with management and the Company's independent auditors and internal auditor the process used for certifications by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that are required for certain of the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent auditors, is responsible for auditing the Company's financial statements and for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting  principles.  The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with the independent auditors their judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended, as adopted by the PCAOB in Rule 3200T.  The Audit Committee also received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence.  The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors the auditors' independence from management and us and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the auditors' independence.
The Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors the overall scope and plans for their audit.  The Audit Committee meets at least quarterly with the independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting.  The Audit Committee also meets with management and the independent auditors prior to the filing of the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC and release to the public of its quarterly and year-end financial results to, among other things, review and discuss such filings, review any related financial statements and related variances, review significant accounting policies and discuss any significant accounting treatments applied during the period.
In evaluating the appropriateness of engaging Ernst & Young as the Company's independent auditors, the Audit Committee considers a number of factors including, but not limited to:  (i) Ernst & Young's relevant technical expertise and its significant institutional knowledge of the Company's operations and industry; (ii) the quality and candor of Ernst & Young's communications with the Audit Committee and management; (iii) Ernst & Young's independence, including the consideration of any non-audit services provided by Ernst & Young and their impact on independence; (iv) the quality and efficiency of the services provided by Ernst & Young, including input from management on Ernst & Young's performance, objectivity and professional skepticism; (v) external data on audit quality and performance, including recent PCAOB reports on Ernst & Young and its peer firms; (vi) the appropriateness of Ernst & Young's fees; and (vii) Ernst & Young's tenure as independent auditors, including the benefits of a longer tenure, and the controls and processes in place that help ensure Ernst & Young's continued independence.  Ernst & Young has served as the Company's independent auditors since 2004.  Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee and the Board believe that retaining Ernst & Young to serve as independent auditors for 2019 is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board has approved) that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.
This section of the proxy statement is not deemed "filed" with the SEC and is not incorporated by reference into the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.
This Audit Committee report is given by the following members of the Audit Committee as of December 31, 2018:
G. Steven Dawson, Chairman
C. Patrick Oles, Jr.
John T. Rippel
Independent Auditor Fees
The following summarizes the approximate aggregate fees billed to American Campus Communities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 by the Company's principal accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Total Approximate Fees 
Types of Services (1)   2019   2018 
Audit Fees (2)   $ 1,575,000     $ 1,572,500   
Audit-Related Fees   —     —   
Tax Fees   —     —   
All Other Fees (3)   2,160     2,160   
   Total   $ 1,577,160     $ 1,574,660   
(1) All such services were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. 
(2) Fees for audit services billed in 2018 and 2017 included the following: (i) audit of the Company's annual financial statements; (ii) reviews of quarterly financial statements; (iii) audit of internal control over financial reporting; and (iv) services related to SEC matters, including review of registration statements filed and related issuances of comfort letters, consents and other services. 
(3) All other fees include the aggregate fees for products and services provided by Ernst & Young LLP that are not reported under "Audit Fees," "Audit-Related Fees" or "Tax Fees." 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has developed policies and procedures concerning its pre-approval of audit and non-audit services provided to us by the independent auditors.  These provide that the Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be rendered to the Company by the independent auditors. The independent auditors provide the Audit Committee with a list describing the services expected to be performed by the independent auditor.  Any request for services not contemplated by this list must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific pre-approval and the provision of such services cannot commence until such approval has been granted.  Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings.  However, the Audit Committee has authorized the committee's Chairman to approve the provision by the Company's independent auditors of up to $50,000 per occurrence of non-audit services not prohibited by law.  Each decision made by the Audit Committee Chairman will be reported to the full Audit Committee at its next meeting.
In addition, although not required by the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Audit Committee generally requests a range of fees associated with each proposed service.  The Audit Committee believes that providing a range of fees for a service incorporates appropriate oversight and control of the independent auditor relationship, while permitting us to receive immediate assistance from the independent auditor when time is of the essence.
In considering the nature of the services provided by Ernst & Young LLP, the Audit Committee determined that such services are compatible with the provision of independent audit services.  The Audit Committee discussed these services with representatives of Ernst & Young LLP and management to determine that they are permitted under the rules and regulations concerning auditor independence promulgated by the SEC to implement the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  
PROPOSAL 3 – 
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  
[BEGIN TABLE]
The Board recommends that you vote FOR approval of the advisory vote on executive compensation. 
[END TABLE]
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Dodd-Frank Act enables the Company's stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the SEC's rules. 
As described in detail under the heading "Executive Compensation – Compensation Discussion and Analysis," these executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain executives who have the motivation, experience and skills necessary to lead the Company effectively.  Under these programs, named executive officers are rewarded for the achievement of specific performance measures that are directly related to financial performance goals and creation of stockholder value.  Please read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" for additional details about the Company's executive compensation programs, including information about the 2018 compensation of the named executive officers. 
Stockholders approved the Company's executive compensation at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  The Compensation Committee continually reviews the compensation programs for the named executive officers to ensure they achieve the desired goals of aligning executive compensation structure with stockholders' interests and current market practices.  As a result of its review process, the Compensation Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provides a significant portion of each executive's compensation as variable compensation in a pay-for-performance setting through a combination of cash bonuses and equity-based grants; 
• Provides a significant portion of total compensation as non-cash compensation in the form of long-term equity-based awards to more closely align the interests of executives with those of stockholders and to maximize retention insofar as all equity-based awards are subject to time-based vesting; and 
• Uses long-term compensation, payment of annual bonuses in part in shares, clawbacks, and a variety of performance metrics to closely tie executives' wealth to the Company's long-term health. 
[END TABLE]
The Company is asking stockholders to indicate their support for named executive officer compensation as described in this proxy statement.  This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives stockholders the opportunity to express their views on named executive officers' compensation.  This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement.  Accordingly, the Board will ask stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the annual meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure."
The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board.  The Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of stockholders and to the extent there is any  significant vote against the named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, the Company will consider stockholders' concerns and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. 
The proposal will be approved if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of shares represented in person or by proxy at the meeting.  
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
Any stockholder proposal intended for inclusion in the proxy materials for the Annual Meeting to be held in 2020 must be received no later than December 31, 2019.  A stockholder may also nominate directors before the next Annual Meeting by submitting the nomination as described under "Board of Directors – Consideration of Director Nominees." No formal proposals were received during 2018 from stockholders.
2018 ANNUAL REPORT
The Company's Annual Report to Stockholders is being mailed to stockholders along with this Proxy Statement.
