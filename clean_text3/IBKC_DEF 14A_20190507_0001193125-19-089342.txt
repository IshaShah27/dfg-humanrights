Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
May 7, 2019 
This Proxy Statement is being furnished to our shareholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors for use at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 7, 2019, or at any adjournments or postponements thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). We sometimes refer to IBERIABANK Corporation in this Proxy Statement as the "Company," "IBKC," "we," "us," or "our." 
Your proxy will be voted in the manner you specify if you vote properly and timely by the Internet or telephone or if you complete and return the enclosed proxy card. You may revoke your proxy by notifying our Secretary in writing, by delivering a properly executed proxy of later date (either in writing, telephonically, or via the Internet) to the Secretary at or before the Annual Meeting, or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. 
This Proxy Statement was mailed on or about April 2, 2019, to each shareholder of record at the voting record date. 
Introduction 
This Proxy Statement provides an overview of matters that are very important to our shareholders and the continued success of our business. During 2018, the Company achieved its goals in earnings and profitability. Despite competitive headwinds and market changes, we delivered above-market loan and deposit growth with ever strengthening asset quality based on high-quality client selection. Results in 2018 were favorably impacted by U.S. tax reform changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, and the acquisitions of Sabadell United Bank, N.A. ("Sabadell United") on July 31, 2017 and Gibraltar Private Bank & Trust Company ("Gibraltar") on March 23, 2018. 
In April 2018, we established and announced our 2020 Strategic Goals, providing a framework from which to measure the Company's performance over the next several years. Improving the Company's financial results, growing earnings, and increasing efficiencies are targets that can only be achieved by focusing on the details of everyday banking decisions. By attracting and retaining high-quality clients through best in class services in an efficient operating model, we have continued to produce sustainable and profitable growth for our business and increased value for all of our stakeholders. 
In 2018, our Company continued to focus on improving efficiencies and operating leverage resulting in significantly enhanced profitability on both a GAAP and core basis. The Company earned $6.46 per share of GAAP EPS and $6.69 per share on a core basis, compared to $2.59 and $4.47 in 2017, respectively. At year-end, our total assets grew to $30.8 billion, or 10% higher than year-end 2017. At year-end 2018, we operated 191 bank branches and 329 offices in our franchise in 12 states. 
The "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement provides a summary of our results compared to peers. Highlights of our focused efforts in 2018 are summarized below: 
Shareholder Outreach 
Shareholder outreach and engagement are priorities and integral to the Company's investor relations philosophy and practice, as shareholders provide us insight on a variety of topics, including performance, operations, governance, and compensation. In 2018, the leadership team was actively engaged with shareholders through multiple conferences, non-deal roadshows, office visits, and conference calls, receiving feedback on the Company's strategic direction and financial results. In addition, in May 2018, we initiated outreach with many of 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019 Proxy Statement     1   
[END TABLE]
Introduction our largest shareholders, offering an opportunity to engage in dialogue with members of our Board of Directors on a variety of topics. As a result of this effort, we received valuable feedback regarding the Company's strategic direction, executive compensation, corporate governance, and best practices. 
Shareholder Focus 
Efficiency 
Asset Quality 
Balance Sheet Strength 
Other Notable Achievements 
Our focus on continuous improvement in financial results over the last several years is similar to our focus on corporate governance and compensation matters, as evidenced by the following actions: 
2008—Adopted over-boarding restrictions, board resignation policy, stock ownership guidelines, and director education programs; 
2009—Established Board Risk Management Committee; 
2011—Implemented annual voting on say-on-pay; 
2012—Adopted majority voting policy for uncontested elections; 
2013—Adopted compensation recovery ("claw-back") policy, committed to de-clawing blank check preferred stock, and finalized our mandatory director retirement age policy; 
2014—Restructured executive compensation programs to be more quantitative and less qualitative, introduced performance based long-term incentives, modified compensation benchmarking, publicly disclosed incentive metrics, commenced investor outreach; 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Introduction 
2016—Adopted 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, incorporating changes based on investor feedback, increased stock ownership requirements for NEOs, implemented corporate governance policy changes including raising stock ownership guidelines, prohibiting new 280G excise tax gross-ups, moving to "double-trigger" mechanisms in new change-in-control severance agreements, and restricting pledging of Company stock; and 
2018—Created Diversity and Inclusion Group. 
We believe well-designed compensation programs tie executive pay and performance through short-term and long-term incentives that are appropriately structured to manage the overall risk of the Company. Feedback from our shareholder engagement and outreach led us to make changes in our executive compensation program in 2016, including redesigning our short-term and long-term incentive programs, improving transparency associated with these programs, and providing greater weighting toward performance-based compensation. 
This year, we are asking our common shareholders to vote on four important matters: 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Codes of Ethics, Conflicts of Interest Policies, and Board Committee charters are available on the "Investor Relations" portion of the Company's website at www.iberiabank.com under "Resources" and then "Corporate Governance".

Questions and Answers 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  Who may vote?  
[END TABLE]
You may vote if you were a holder of record of IBERIABANK Corporation ("IBKC" or the "Company") common stock at the close of business on March 19, 2019, which is the record date of the Annual Meeting. Each share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote on each matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. Holders of our outstanding shares of preferred stock do not have voting rights at the Annual Meeting. 
Participants in our Retirement Savings Plan (the "Plan") will receive a Voting Authorization Form for the common stock owned through the Plan. If you hold shares as a participant in the Plan and you do not provide the Plan trustee with voting instructions on any matter (either by not returning a Voting Authorization Form or voting by phone or online, or due to incomplete voting instructions) and you do not vote in person by attending the Annual Meeting, your shares will be voted in the same proportion as the shares for which voting instructions were provided by other participants. The Voting Authorization Form will serve as voting instructions for the Plan's trustee.

∎  If I am a shareholder of record of IBKC shares, how do I cast my vote?  
[END TABLE]
If you are a holder of record of IBKC common stock, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. We will give you a ballot at the Annual Meeting. 
If you do not wish to vote in person or if you will not be attending the Annual Meeting, you may vote by proxy. If you received a printed copy of these proxy materials by mail, you may vote in one of the following three ways: 
If you vote by mail, your proxy must be received by 11:00 a.m., Central Time, on May 7, 2019, to be counted. 
You may vote on the Internet or by telephone any time prior to 1:00 a.m., Central Time, on May 7, 2019. 
We provide Internet proxy voting to allow you to vote your shares on-line, with procedures designed to ensure the authenticity and correctness of your proxy vote instructions. However, please be aware that you must bear any costs associated with your Internet access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and telephone companies.

[END TABLE]
Questions and Answers 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  If I am a beneficial owner of IBKC shares held in street name, how do I vote?  
[END TABLE]
If you are a beneficial owner of shares of IBKC common stock held in street name (i.e., your shares are held by a broker) and you received a printed copy of these proxy materials by mail, you should have received a voting instruction card with these proxy materials from the organization that is the record owner of your shares rather than from us. Beneficial owners that received a printed copy of these proxy materials by mail from the record owner may complete and mail that voting instruction card or may vote by telephone or over the Internet as instructed by that organization in the voting instruction card. Beneficial owners that received a notice by mail from the record owner should follow the instructions included in the notice to view the Proxy Statement and transmit their voting instructions. If you provide specific voting instructions, your broker or nominee will vote your shares as you direct. 
A beneficial owner planning to vote in person at the Annual Meeting must obtain a valid proxy from the record owner. To request the requisite proxy form, follow the instructions provided by your broker or contact your broker. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  May I change my vote?  
[END TABLE]
If you are a holder of record of shares of IBKC common stock, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before your shares are voted at the Annual Meeting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  How many votes do the proposals need in order to be approved?  
[END TABLE]
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast (Proposal I). Shareholders may vote "FOR" or "WITHHOLD" authority to vote for each nominee for the Board of Directors. If you withhold authority to vote with respect to any nominee, your shares will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum, but will have no effect on the election of that nominee. 
Our Board has adopted a majority voting policy which applies to an uncontested election of directors. Under this policy, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "WITHHOLD" from his or her election than votes "FOR" such election is required to promptly tender his or her resignation following certification by the Secretary of the shareholder vote. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would then consider the resignation and make a recommendation to our Board as to the action to be taken. This policy does not apply in contested elections. For more information, see "Proposal I—Election of Directors—Majority Voting for Directors; Director Resignation Policy." The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes actually cast is required for: (i) ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal II), (ii) approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the Named Executive Officers (Proposal III), and (iii) approval of the IBERIABANK Corporation 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (Proposal IV). Shareholders may vote "FOR," "AGAINST," or "ABSTAIN" on Proposal II, Proposal III, and Proposal IV. If you abstain from voting on Proposal II, III, or IV, your shares will be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum, but will not be counted as a vote cast for the proposal and will have no effect on the proposal. 
If you are the registered holder of IBKC common stock and you sign and submit your proxy card without voting instructions, your shares will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum, and will be voted "FOR" each director nominee and "FOR" each of Proposals II, III, and IV. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  Is cumulative voting permitted for the election of directors?  
[END TABLE]
No. You may not accumulate your vote for the election of directors. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  What are broker non-votes?  
[END TABLE]
A broker "non-vote" occurs when your broker submits a proxy for your shares but does not indicate a vote for a particular proposal because the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote and has not received specific instructions from you. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, if your broker holds your shares (i.e., your shares are held in "street name") and delivers this Proxy Statement to you, the broker generally has authority to vote the shares on "routine" matters. Proposal II is a matter we believe will be considered "routine"; even if the broker does not receive instructions from you, the broker is entitled to vote your shares in connection with Proposal II. The other Proposals (I, III, and IV) are matters we believe will be considered 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019 Proxy Statement     5   
[END TABLE]
Questions and Answers 
"non-routine;" the broker is not entitled to vote your shares without instructions. Shares held in street name which have been designated by brokers as not voted ("broker non-votes") will not be counted as votes cast. Broker non-votes, however, will be treated as shares present for purposes of determining a quorum. Brokers who are not members of the New York Stock Exchange may not be able to exercise discretionary authority with respect to even routine items depending on the rules of the exchange or market of which the broker is a member. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  How many outstanding shares of IBKC common stock are there?  
[END TABLE]
At the close of business on March 19, 2019, which is the record date for the Annual Meeting, there were 54,552,042 shares of IBKC common stock, par value $1.00 per share, outstanding and entitled to vote. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  What constitutes a quorum?  
[END TABLE]
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of our total voting power will constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on March 19, 2019, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  Will my vote be confidential?  
[END TABLE]
Proxy instructions, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify individual shareholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed either within the Company or to third parties, except: (1) as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements, (2) to allow for the tabulation of votes and certification of the vote, and (3) to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  How will voting be conducted on other matters raised at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
The form of proxy confers discretionary authority on the persons named therein to vote with respect to the election of any person as a director where the nominee is unable to serve or for good cause will not serve. It also confers discretionary authority with respect to matters incident to the conduct of the Annual Meeting and with respect to any other matter presented to the Annual Meeting if notice of such matter has not been delivered to us in accordance with our Articles of Incorporation. Except for procedural matters incident to the conduct of the Annual Meeting, we do not know of any other matters that are to come before the Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting as to which proxies in the accompanying form confer discretionary authority, the persons named in the accompanying proxy will vote the shares represented by such proxies on such matters as determined by a majority of the Board of Directors. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  Who will bear the cost of soliciting votes for the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
We will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing, and distributing these proxy materials and soliciting votes. If you choose to access the proxy materials and/or vote over the Internet, you are responsible for Internet access charges you may incur. If you choose to vote by telephone, you are responsible for telephone charges you may incur. Additional solicitations of proxies or votes may be made in person, by telephone, or by electronic communication by our directors, officers, and other regular associates, who will not receive any additional compensation for such solicitation activities. We also have hired Georgeson LLC to assist us in the distribution of proxy materials. We will pay Georgeson LLC a fee of $9,500 plus customary costs and expenses for these services, and we will indemnify Georgeson LLC against any losses arising out of Georgeson LLC's proxy solicitation services on our behalf. We will reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses for forwarding materials to the beneficial owners of shares held of record by others. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
We will disclose voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") within four business days after the Annual Meeting, which will also be available on our website. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  When must shareholder proposals be submitted for the 2019 Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
Shareholder proposals submitted for inclusion in our 2019 Proxy Statement must have been received in writing by our Secretary no later than the close of business on December 10, 2018. Shareholder proposals which are not submitted for inclusion in the 2019 Proxy Statement must have been received from shareholders of record no later than March 10, 2019.

Proposal I—Election of Directors 
Directors and Nominees 
Effective at the Annual Meeting, the Board of Directors will consist of nine members. Due to the death of Dr. Welch and the retirements of Ms. Abell and Mr. Cooper, to be effective at the Annual Meeting, the Board of Directors determined to eliminate the vacancies and reduce the number of directors authorized under the Bylaws. 
Our Articles of Incorporation provide that the Board of Directors will be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with each class elected by the shareholders for staggered three-year terms, and until their successors are elected and qualified. Effective at the Annual Meeting the Board will be composed as follows: two directors whose term expires in 2022; four directors whose term expires in 2021; and three directors whose term expires in 2020. To equalize the classes the Board expects to nominate additional directors, to nominate directors to serve for terms of less than three years, or to otherwise divide the classes as nearly equal as possible. No person will be eligible for nomination or election as a director who will have attained the age of 76 years. 
Unless otherwise directed, each proxy executed and returned by a shareholder will be voted "FOR" the election of the two nominees listed below. In the unanticipated event that any nominee is unable or unwilling to stand for election at the time of the Annual Meeting, the Bylaws provide that the number of authorized directors will be automatically reduced by the number of such nominees unless the Board determines otherwise, in which case proxies will be voted for any replacement nominee or nominees recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. At this time, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee knows of no reason why any of the nominees might be unable to serve, if elected. 
Consistent with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to nominate candidates with diverse experiences and perspectives who have the ability to contribute to some aspects of our business and a willingness to make the significant commitment of time and effort required of our directors. Community involvement and leadership are important criteria for our Board members. Each of the nominees listed below possesses these attributes. 
Majority Voting for Directors; Director Resignation Policy 
In 2012, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to our Corporate Governance Guidelines regarding majority voting for directors. The Board reviewed corporate governance developments and an interested shareholder proposal on the subject of majority voting in the election of directors. The Board concluded that when shareholder "WITHHOLD" votes exceed "FOR" votes with regard to a director nominee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board should carefully consider and assess whether it would be appropriate for the director nominee to remain on the Board. 
As amended, the Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that in an uncontested director election, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "WITHHOLD" from his or her election than votes "FOR" such election (a "Majority Withheld Vote") would promptly tender his or her resignation following certification by the Secretary of the shareholder vote. The current plurality vote standard will be retained for contested director elections (elections in which the number of director nominees exceeds the number of Board seats). 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would promptly consider the resignation offer, and a range of possible responses based on the circumstances that led to the Majority Withheld Vote, if known, and make a recommendation to the Board. The Board would act on the Committee's recommendation within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote. 
If each member of the Committee received a Majority Withheld Vote at the same election, then the directors who did not receive a Majority Withheld Vote would consider the resignation offers and recommend to the Board whether to accept them. If four or fewer directors failed to receive a Majority Withheld Vote, all directors may participate in the action regarding the resignation offers. Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to the Guidelines would not participate in the Committee's recommendation or Board action regarding whether to accept his or her individual offer to resign. Thereafter, the Board would promptly disclose its decision-making process and decision regarding whether to accept the director's resignation offer (or the reason(s) for rejecting the resignation offer, if applicable) in a Current Report on Form 8-K furnished to the SEC.

Corporate Governance 
Board of Directors and Shareholders Meetings 
The Board of Directors met nine times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. All directors attended at least 75% of the total of all meetings of the Board of Directors and assigned committees in 2018. We encourage directors' attendance at our annual shareholder meetings and request that directors make reasonable efforts to attend such meetings. All of the members of the Board of Directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Pursuant to our Bylaws, at the first meeting of each newly elected Board of Directors, or at such other time when there is a vacancy, the Board solicits input and nominations from its members and elects one of its members as Chairman to serve at the Board's pleasure. The Chairman presides over each Board meeting and performs such other duties as may be incident to the office. 
Although our Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines would allow our Chairman to hold the position of CEO, it is the current policy of the Board to separate these offices. This separation allows our Chairman to maintain an independent role in management oversight. 
Risk Management 
Our Board of Directors recognizes that risk management is an enterprise–wide responsibility. Our Board assumes a significant role in risk management both through its actions as a whole and through its committees. 
While each of these committees is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of these risks, the entire Board of Directors is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks. 
In addition, the Board of Directors and the CEO have appointed a Chief Risk Officer, who is an executive officer of the Company, to support the risk oversight responsibilities of the Board and its committees, and to oversee the corporation's enterprise-wide risk management program, including various management committees. The Chief Risk Officer also manages a team of senior officers who are assigned responsibility for oversight of particular risks and serves as the chairman of the Management Risk Committee.

Corporate Governance 
Board of Directors Independence 
Each year, the Board of Directors reviews the relationships that each director has with us and with other parties. Only those directors who do not have any of the categorical relationships that preclude them from being independent within the meaning of applicable NASDAQ listing standards and who the Board of Directors affirmatively determines have no relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director are considered to be "independent directors." The Board of Directors has reviewed a number of factors to evaluate the independence of each of its members. These factors include its members' relationships with us and our competitors, suppliers, and clients; their relationships with management and other directors; the relationships their current and former employers have with us; and the relationships between us and other companies of which our Board members are directors or executive officers. After evaluating these factors, the Board of Directors has determined that directors Abell, Barton, Breaux, Casbon, Cooper, Fenstermaker, Koerner, Maples, Shea, and Sugrañes are independent directors of IBERIABANK Corporation within the meaning of applicable NASDAQ listing standards. Independent Board members met in executive session without management present eight times during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Shareholders may communicate directly with members of the Board of Directors or the individual chairperson of a standing Board of Directors' committee by writing directly to those individuals at the following address: 200 West Congress Street, Lafayette, Louisiana, 70501.

The Board of Directors reserves the right to revise this policy in the event it is abused, becomes unworkable or otherwise does not efficiently serve the policy's purpose. 
Codes of Ethics 
The Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and senior financial officers, including the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Accounting Officer, and persons performing similar functions.

Preferred Stock Issuance Representation 
The Board of Directors represents that it will not, without prior shareholder approval, issue any series of preferred stock for any defensive or anti-takeover purpose, for the purpose of implementing any shareholder rights plan or with features specifically intended to make any attempted acquisition of the Company more difficult or costly. Subject to these limitations, the Board of Directors may issue preferred stock in connection with capital raising transactions, acquisitions, and joint ventures and for other corporate purposes that may have the effect of making such an acquisition more difficult or costly, as could also be the case if the Board of Directors were to issue additional shares of common stock.

Stock Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 
In addition to the beneficial ownership of common stock, our executive officers hold restricted share units that were granted in 2017, 2018 and 2019 that are not reported in the stock ownership table but represent additional financial interests that are subject to the same market risks as common stock. The value of these units is the same as the value of the corresponding number of shares of common stock. These units are more completely described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section. As of the record date, executive officers named in the stock ownership table hold the following restricted stock units: 54,971 units by Mr. Byrd; 15,658 units by Mr. Restel; 17,930 units by Mr. Brown; 
 18,414 units by Mr. Perez-Hickman; 13,114 units by Mr. Parker; and 159,660 units held by all executive officers as a group.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires each of our directors and executive officers, and each beneficial owner of more than 10% of our common stock, to file with the SEC an initial report of the person's beneficial ownership of our equity securities and subsequent reports regarding changes in ownership. These directors, officers, and greater than 10% shareholders are required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms and certain other forms that they file. On the basis of reports and representation of our directors, executive officers and greater than 10% shareholders, we believe that each person subject to the filing requirements with respect to us satisfied all required filing requirements during 2018. During 2018, John E Koerner III, a director of the Company, elected to acquire phantom stock under the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan. In early 2019, Mr. Koerner became aware of his failure to file reports on Form 4 to disclose each of his phantom stock acquisitions. In 2018, there were sixteen phantom stock acquisitions that were not reported. Upon recognition of his inadvertent failure to report the phantom stock acquisitions, Mr. Koerner filed a Form 5 in 2019 to report the late transactions in 2018.

Committees of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors of the Company has established six committees: the Audit Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Board Risk Committee, the Executive Committee, and the Investment 
 Committee. A link to the charter of each of these committees, except for the Executive Committee and the Investment Committee, can be found on the "Investor Relations" portion of our website, at http://www.iberiabank.com. 
Audit Committee 
The members of the Audit Committee are Mr. Barton, who serves as the chairman, Messrs. Koerner and Maples and Ms. Sugrañes. Each of the members of the Audit Committee is independent within the meaning of applicable NASDAQ listing standards. The Board of Directors has determined that each of the Audit Committee members has the requisite expertise generally required of an audit committee member under NASDAQ standards and that the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Mr. Barton, is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of SEC Regulation S-K. 
The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for the quality and integrity of our financial statements. The Audit Committee meets privately with the independent registered public accounting firm, has the sole authority to retain and dismiss the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews their performance and independence from management. The independent registered public accounting firm has unrestricted access and reports directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee met ten times during 2018. 
The primary functions of the Audit Committee are to oversee: (i) the audit of the financial statements of the Company provided to the SEC, the shareholders, and the general public; (ii) the Company's internal financial and accounting processes; and (iii) the internal audit process. Additionally, the Audit Committee has responsibilities with respect to: (i) complaints relating to accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters; (ii) authority to engage advisors; and (iii) funding as determined by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also monitors our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. 
The Audit Committee has adopted a formal policy concerning approval of audit and non-audit services to be provided to us by our independent registered public accounting firm. The policy requires that all services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, including audit services and permitted audit-related and non-audit services, must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee pre-approved all audit and non-audit services provided by Ernst & Young LLP during 2018. The Audit Committee will also pre-approve 2019 services to be provided by Ernst & Young LLP. 
Pursuant to its Charter, the Audit Committee is authorized to conduct an appropriate review of all related party transactions for potential conflict of interest situations to determine that the related party transaction is consistent with the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. The term "related party transaction" generally means a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of the same) in which we or our subsidiaries are or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which the related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest. A related party generally means a director, nominee or executive officer of the Company; a person known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock; and any "immediate family member" of the foregoing persons (as defined by the SEC). See "—Committee Interaction" and "Certain Transactions—Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons." 
While it is the responsibility of management and the Board Risk Committee to assess, manage and monitor the Company's enterprise-wide exposure to risk, the Audit Committee will review in a general manner the guidelines and policies to govern the processes used by the Board Risk Committee and the management-level risk committee with respect to enterprise-wide risk management. See "—Committee Interaction." 
These and other aspects of the Audit Committee's authority are more particularly described in the Audit Committee Charter. A link to the Audit Committee Charter is on the "Investor Relations" portion of our website, at: http://www.iberiabank.com.

Committees of the Board of Directors 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The independent members of the Board of Directors—Ms. Abell, Ms. Sugrañes, and Messrs. Barton, Breaux, Casbon, Cooper, Fenstermaker, Koerner, Maples, and Shea, who serves as Chairman, serve as our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for evaluating and recommending individuals for election or re-election to the Board of Directors, including those recommendations submitted by shareholders, the evaluation of the performance of the Board of Directors and its committees, and the evaluation and recommendation of corporate governance policies. In 2018, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held six meetings. A link to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter is on the "Investor Relations" portion of our website, at: http://www.iberiabank.com. 
It is a policy of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee that candidates for director possess the highest personal and professional integrity, have demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment, and have skills and expertise appropriate for us and serving the long-term interests of our shareholders. The Committee's process for identifying and evaluating nominees is as follows: 
Consistent with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to nominate candidates with diverse experiences and perspectives. In evaluating candidates, the Committee considers, among other things, diverse backgrounds, professional experience, education, and community involvement, as well as racial and gender diversity. The Committee has not formalized this practice into a written policy. 
The Committee meets to discuss and consider these candidates' qualifications, including whether the nominee is independent within the meaning of NASDAQ listing standards, and then selects a candidate by majority vote. In seeking potential nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee uses its management's network of contacts to compile a list of potential candidates, but may also engage, if it deems appropriate, a professional search firm. To date, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has not paid a fee to any third party to assist in the process of identifying or evaluating director candidates, nor has the Committee rejected a timely director nominee from a shareholder holding more than 5% of our voting stock. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders, provided the shareholders follow the procedures set forth in Article 6F of our Articles of Incorporation. The Committee does not intend to alter the manner in which it evaluates candidates, including the criteria set forth above, based on whether the candidate was recommended by a shareholder or otherwise. 
Article 6F of our Articles of Incorporation governs nominations of candidates for election as director at any annual meeting of shareholders and provides that such nominations, other than those made by the Board, may be made by any shareholder entitled to vote at such meeting, if the nomination is made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article 6F, which are summarized below. 
A shareholder's notice of nomination must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, our principal executive offices not later than 60 days before the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of shareholders and must set forth as to each person who the shareholder proposes to nominate for election as a director and as to the shareholder giving the notice: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
24           2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
Committees of the Board of Directors 
To be timely under the Articles of Incorporation, nominations by any shareholder eligible to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must have been received by us on or before March 10, 2019. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may reject any nomination by a shareholder not made in accordance with the requirements of Article 6F. Notwithstanding the foregoing procedures, if neither the Board of Directors nor the Committee makes a determination as to the validity of any nominations by a shareholder, the presiding officer of the annual meeting shall determine and declare at the annual meeting whether the nomination was made in accordance with the terms of Article 6F. 
Compensation Committee 
Our Compensation Committee has five members and is chaired by Mr. Maples; the other members of the Committee are Messrs. Shea, Fenstermaker, Cooper, and Casbon. Each member of the Compensation Committee has been determined by our Board of Directors to meet NASDAQ, SEC, and Internal Revenue Code independence criteria. The Compensation Committee met seven times during 2018. 
Compensation Committee Responsibilities and Authority. Our Compensation Committee, in consultation with our President and Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for establishing and monitoring the overall compensation and benefits philosophy and strategy of IBERIABANK Corporation and its subsidiaries. As set forth in its Charter, the responsibilities of the Compensation Committee include: 
The Compensation Committee determines the compensation for the CEO. With respect to our other senior executive officers, the CEO annually reviews performance and presents his conclusions and compensation recommendations to the Compensation 
 Committee. The Committee reviews and considers the CEO's recommendations when making its final compensation decisions for all executives other than the CEO. The Compensation Committee also administers our equity incentive programs and oversees risk management with respect to our material incentive compensation arrangements. In addition, the Compensation Committee recommends to the full Board compensation for directors. 
The Chair of the Compensation Committee works with the Chief Human Resources Officer to set the meeting agenda for the Compensation Committee. 
Compensation Committee Charter. The Charter of the Compensation Committee describes the principles upon which the Committee was founded and operates. The Charter is reviewed and reassessed annually, and any proposed changes are recommended to the Board, to ensure that the Compensation Committee is fulfilling its duties in aligning our executive compensation programs with shareholder value creation, helping us attract and retain talented executives and managers, and being responsive to the legitimate needs of our shareholders. A current copy of the Charter of the Compensation Committee can be found on the "Investor Relations" portion of our website, at http://www.iberiabank.com. 
Involvement of Compensation Consultants and Executive Management in Compensation Decisions. Among other matters, the Compensation Committee is authorized to engage outside advisors (including compensation consultants and legal counsel) to assist the Committee in achieving its mission and responsibilities. In 2018, the Committee retained Frederic W. Cook and 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019 Proxy Statement     25   
[END TABLE]
Committees of the Board of Directors 
Co., Inc. ("FW Cook") to serve as the Committee's independent advisor. The decision to retain independent advisors is at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee, and these consultants work at the direction of the Committee. The Committee assessed the independence of FW Cook, taking into account related factors in accordance with SEC and NASDAQ rules and concluded that the work of FW Cook did not raise any conflict of interest that would prevent them from independently advising the Committee. The Committee has also retained FW Cook to serve as the Committee's independent advisor for 2019. 
The Compensation Committee believes that it is important for members of management to provide input on the overall effectiveness of our executive compensation programs. The Committee believes that the advice of outside advisors must be combined with the input of senior management and the Compensation Committee's own individual experiences and best judgment to seek to achieve a proper alignment of compensation philosophies, programs, and practices. The CEO, the Director of Communication, Corporate Real Estate and Human Resources and the Chief Human Resources Officer are the members of management who interact most closely with the Compensation Committee. These individuals work with the Compensation Committee to provide their perspectives on reward strategies and how to align them with our business and retention goals. They provide feedback and insights into how well our compensation programs and practices appear to be working. In addition, the CEO, the Director of Communication, Corporate Real Estate, and Human Resources, the Chief Human Resources Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer attend all or portions of certain Compensation Committee meetings to participate in the presentation of materials and discussion of management's point of view regarding compensation issues. 
Executive Session. At certain meetings, the Compensation Committee meets in executive session without members of management present for the purpose of discussing matters independently from management. 
Compensation Risk. The Compensation Committee reviewed the relationship between our risk management and the incentive compensation provided to associates, including our Named Executive Officers and other executive and non-executive officers, and determined that our incentive compensation programs do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking. These conclusions were made after consultations with senior executive officers, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the chairman of the Board Risk Committee (who is also a member of the Compensation Committee), and representatives of the Compensation Committee's independent executive compensation advisor. See "Committee Interaction." 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation. The Compensation Committee is composed entirely of independent directors. None of the members of the Compensation Committee was an officer or other associate of our Company or any of our subsidiaries during 2018, or is a former officer or other associate of our Company or any of our subsidiaries. Members of the Compensation Committee may, from time to time, have banking relationships in the ordinary course of business with IBERIABANK, as described under "Certain Transactions." 
Board Risk Committee 
The Board Risk Committee is a standing committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. The purpose of the Board Risk Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the Company's enterprise risk management framework, risk appetite, risk exposure, risk governance, and significant policies. The members of the Board Risk Committee are Mr. Casbon, who serves as Chairman, Ms. Abell, Ms. Sugrañes, and Messrs. Breaux, Koerner, and Shea. The Board Risk Committee met six times in 2018. 
The primary purpose of the Board Risk Committee is to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       Company, including the Company's credit, operational, market, liquidity, legal, regulatory/compliance, and strategic/reputational risks;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
26           2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
Committees of the Board of Directors 
The Board Risk Committee's primary duties and responsibilities include: 
The Board Risk Committee has authority to conduct any investigation appropriate to fulfilling its responsibilities, and it has direct access to all persons in the organization. The Board Risk Committee may retain, at the Company's expense, such special consultants and experts as it deems necessary or appropriate to execute its duties. 
At certain meetings, the Board Risk Committee meets without members of management present for the purpose of discussing matters independently from management. The Board Risk Committee meets privately at various times through the year with the Chief Risk Officer and such other officers as the Board Risk Committee deems appropriate to discuss any matters that the Board Risk Committee believes should be discussed. 
The function of the Board Risk Committee is solely oversight; management is responsible for executing the Company's risk management processes. Each Board Risk Committee member is entitled to rely on persons and organizations within and outside the Company that provide information and advice to management and the Board Risk Committee and on the accuracy and completeness of this information and advice absent actual knowledge to the contrary. 
The Board Risk Committee conducts its business pursuant to a written Board Risk Committee Charter adopted and reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors. A link to the Board Risk Committee Charter can be found on the "Investor Relations" portion of our website, at http://www.iberiabank.com. 
Committee Interaction 
In connection with the responsibilities of the Board Risk Committee, with respect to the relationship between the Company's risk management and the incentive compensation provided to associates, including Named Executive Officers identified in this Proxy Statement and other executive and non-executive officers, the Compensation Committee determines whether incentive compensation programs encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking. The Compensation Committee will seek to limit any unnecessary or excessive risks that these programs may pose to the Company in order to avoid programs that might encourage such risks. The Board of Directors recognizes that information and reports prepared for and reviewed by the Compensation 
 Committee and the Board Risk Committee may each be relevant to the oversight and responsibilities of the other and should be provided to the other, as appropriate. 
In connection with the responsibilities of the Audit Committee with respect to compensation risk assessment, the Board of Directors recognizes that information and reports prepared for and reviewed by each of the Compensation Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Board Risk Committee may be relevant to the oversight and responsibilities of the other committees and should be provided to the other committees, as appropriate.

Proposal II—Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, subject to shareholder ratification, currently intends to appoint the firm of Ernst & Young LLP, independent certified public accountants, to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm and to perform the audit of the financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and further directed that the selection of auditors be submitted for ratification by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. 
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate shareholder questions. 
Shareholder ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by our Bylaws or other applicable legal requirements. However, the Audit Committee is submitting the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to the shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. In the event shareholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee may reconsider this appointment. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in our and our shareholders' best interests. 
Audit Fees and Other Matters 
Ernst & Young LLP provided audit services to us consisting of the annual audit of our 2018 and 2017 consolidated financial statements contained in our 
 Annual Reports on Form 10-K and reviewed the financial statements contained in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for 2018 and 2017.

Proposal II—Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Pre-approval Policy 
The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the independence of Ernst & Young LLP. The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and other services. Pre-approval is generally provided for up to one year, and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is generally subject to a specific budget. The independent registered public accounting firm and management are required to periodically report to the Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with this pre-approval and the fees for the services performed to date. The Audit Committee or the Chairman of the Audit Committee may also pre-approve particular services on a case-by-case basis.

The responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set forth in the Charter of the Audit Committee, as adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company. This is a report on the Committee's activities relating to fiscal year 2018. 
The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal controls. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed the audited financial statements for fiscal year 2018 with the Company's management, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, underlying estimates and significant judgments used in the financial statements. Management has the responsibility for the preparation of the Company's financial statements. Management represented to the Audit Committee that the financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
The Audit Committee reviewed the audited financial statements with the independent registered public accounting firm, who is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those statements with generally accepted accounting principles, and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm their judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles. The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standards (AS) 1301, "Communication with Audit Committees", as currently in effect. 
The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by Rule 3526, "Communication with Audit Committee Concerning Independence", of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as currently in effect, and the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence. 
The Audit Committee also considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. In assessing requests for services by the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee considers whether the independent registered public accounting firm is likely to provide the most effective and efficient services based upon their familiarity with the Company and whether the services could enhance the Company's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. 
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Committee met with the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their audits, their evaluations of the Company's systems of internal controls and the overall quality and adequacy of the Company's financial reporting. The Audit Committee discussed with management, the internal auditors, and the independent registered public accounting firm the internal audit function's organization, responsibilities, budget, and staffing. Both the internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee held ten meetings during fiscal year 2018. 
The Audit Committee received reports throughout the year on the Company's internal controls for compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated there under. The Audit Committee will continue to obtain updates by management on the process and has reviewed management's and the independent registered auditors' evaluation of the Company's system of internal controls included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

Report of the Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee, or its Chairman, met with, or held telephonic discussions with, the independent registered public accounting firm and management prior to the release of the Company's quarterly and annual financial information or the filing of any such information with the SEC. In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee also recommended that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC. Subject to shareholder ratification, the Audit Committee currently intends to appoint the independent registered public accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.

Proposal III—Approval of the Compensation of the Named Executive Officers 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in July 2010, requires that we provide you the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. 
At the 2018 annual meeting, our shareholders were provided the opportunity to cast an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, also commonly known as a "say on pay" proposal. The Company's shareholders overwhelmingly approved the Company's executive compensation program, with 88% of the votes cast in favor of the proposal. At the 2017 annual meeting, shareholders were asked to recommend how often shareholders should be given the opportunity to cast a "say on pay" vote. Over 83% of the votes were for the "one year" option, and the option was later approved by the Board. As a result and as required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are again providing shareholders the opportunity to cast an advisory vote to approve Named Executive Officer compensation. 
As described in detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section, we seek to closely align our compensation programs with short-term and long-term goals, while avoiding unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. We believe the program changes in 2016 that carried forward throughout 2017 and 2018 demonstrate the Committee's continuing commitment to strengthen the alignment between compensation outcomes and shareholder returns. 
We urge you to read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section and other related executive compensation disclosures so that you have an understanding of our executive compensation philosophy, policies, and practices. 
The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation, rather the vote relates to the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, as described in this Proxy Statement. The vote is advisory, which means that the vote is non-binding on the Company, our Board of Directors, or the Compensation Committee. 
The Company's management will present the following resolution to the meeting: 
"RESOLVED, That the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and narrative disclosures." 
Although this advisory vote will be non-binding, it will serve as a recommendation to the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee and the Board will seriously consider the voting results in connection with their ongoing evaluation of the Company's executive compensation arrangements. The next such shareholder advisory vote will occur at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

Proposal IV—Approval of the IBERIABANK Corporation 2019 Stock Incentive Plan 
On March 19, 2019, the Board of Directors approved, upon the unanimous recommendation of the Compensation Committee and, subject to shareholder approval, the IBERIABANK Corporation 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2019 Plan"). The principal features of the 2019 Plan are summarized below. This summary is qualified in its entirety, however, by reference to the full text of the 2019 Plan, which is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A. 
Why Shareholders Should Vote to Approve the Plan 
Equity Incentive Awards are an Important Part of Our Compensation Philosophy.
We believe that providing officers, directors, employees, consultants, and advisors with a proprietary interest in the growth and performance of our Company stimulates individual performance and enhances shareholder value. We also believe that a significant portion of an executive's compensation should be directly linked to our performance. Consistent with this philosophy, during 2018, 52% of the total target compensation of our CEO, and 40% of the average total target compensation of our other Named Executive Officers was delivered in the form of long-term incentive awards. 
Our current stock incentive plan is almost depleted. 
We currently grant annual long-term incentive awards to our executives and key employees under our 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2016 Plan"). As of December 31, 2018, approximately 1,162,931 shares of common stock remained available for grant under the 2016 Plan. During the first quarter of 2019, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") approved long-term incentive awards for 2019. As a result of these awards, there were only 672,414 shares of common stock remaining available for grant under the 2016 Plan as of the record date. As such, there are not enough shares remaining available under the 2016 Plan to support our long-term incentive program next year and beyond. If the 2019 Plan is approved by our shareholders, no future awards will be made from the 2016 Plan. 
If the 2019 Plan is not approved by our shareholders, we will not have sufficient shares to fund our long-term incentive program, especially with regard to our executive officers, and the Company may be required to increase significantly the cash component of our executive compensation program in order to remain competitive and adequately compensate our employees. Such a drastic decline in our long-term incentive program would misalign our executive and shareholder interests. 
Determination of Share Reserve for the 2019 Plan 
In its determination to recommend Board adoption of the 2019 Plan and in determining the appropriate number of shares to make available under the Plan, the Compensation Committee considered the recommendation of FW Cook, its independent compensation consultant, and reviewed potential dilution and burn rate data, as well as the estimated value transfer cost of the 2019 Plan. If our shareholders approve the 2019 Plan, the overall dilution of our equity-based incentive plans on a fully-diluted basis would be 8.63% as of the record date, based on 3,472,414 shares proposed under the 2019 Plan, 54,552,042 shares of common stock outstanding, and 1,518,083 shares issuable pursuant to outstanding awards. 
Burn rate refers to how fast a company uses the supply of shares authorized for awards under its stock plans. The burn rate is calculated by dividing the number of shares subject to equity awards (stock and options) granted in a particular year by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. Over the last three years we have maintained an average annual burn rate of 1.80% of shares of common stock outstanding.

Description of the 2019 Plan 
The terms of the 2019 Plan as presented to our shareholders for approval at the Annual Meeting are summarized below. As noted above, you should read the full plan as set forth in Exhibit A to this Proxy Statement before deciding how to vote. 
Eligibility. Employees, consultants and directors of our Company and our affiliates may be granted awards. There are currently 9 directors and approximately 590 employees eligible to receive awards under the 2019 Plan. 
Awards. Awards under the 2019 Plan may be granted in any one or a combination of the following forms: 
Shares Issuable Through the 2019 Plan. A maximum of 3,472,414 shares of common stock plus shares subject to outstanding awards under our prior plans that are subsequently canceled, expired, forfeited or otherwise not issued or are settled in cash may be made the subject of awards under the 2019 Plan. Any of the Shares reserved and available for issuance under the Plan may be used for any type of Award under the Plan. The closing

Proposal IV—Approval of the IBERIABANK Corporation 2019 Stock Incentive Plan sale price of a share of common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on March 19, 2019, was $75.72 per share. 
Limitations and Adjustments to Shares Issuable Through the 2019 Plan. The plan uses a fungible share design, which means that each share issued subject to a stock option or SAR counts as 1 share against the plan limit and each share issued subject to any other incentive (the full value awards) counts as 2 shares against the plan limit. The maximum overall limit described above may be issued subject to incentive stock options. 
In addition, no more than (i) 500,000 stock options and SARs, and (ii) 500,000 restricted shares, restricted share units, unrestricted shares, and performance units may be granted to a participant in a single year. 
With respect to non-management directors, the maximum number of shares subject to awards that may be granted during a single fiscal year, taken together with any cash fees paid to such non-management director during the fiscal year, shall not exceed $400,000 in total value (calculating the value of any such Awards based on the grant date fair value of such Awards for financial reporting purposes). This limit shall not apply to the non-executive Chairman of the Board, whose compensation will be approved by the other independent directors on the Board with the non-executive Chairman of the Board abstaining. 
Generally, for purposes of determining the maximum number of shares of our common stock available for delivery under the 2019 Plan, shares that are not delivered because an award is forfeited, cancelled, or settled in cash will not be deemed to have been delivered under the 2019 Plan. In addition, Shares delivered or withheld in satisfaction of tax obligations with respect to Awards other than stock options or SARs will again be available for issuance as Awards under the Plan. With respect to SARs paid in shares, all shares to which the SARs relate are counted against the plan limits rather than the net number of shares delivered upon exercise. If shares are delivered or withheld to satisfy the exercise price of a stock option or the tax withholding obligation associated with a stock option or SAR, those shares will not be available for reissuance under the plan. In addition, shares purchased on the open market with the proceeds of an option exercise will not be available for reissuance under the plan. 
Minimum Vesting Requirements. Stock options and SARs granted under the 2019 Plan must be made subject to a minimum one-year vesting period. The minimum vesting requirements do not apply to awards with respect to 5% of the plan limit. 
Amendments to the Plan. The Board may amend or discontinue the 2019 Plan at any time. However, our shareholders must approve any amendment that would: 
No amendment or discontinuance of the 2019 Plan may materially impair any previously granted incentive without the consent of the recipient. In addition, the Committee may amend the 2019 Plan to eliminate provisions that are no longer necessary as a result of changes in tax or securities laws or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof. 
Term of the Plan. No awards may be granted under the 2019 Plan after May 7, 2029. 
Administration. The 2019 Plan is administered by the Committee. The Committee has authority, subject to the terms of the 2019 Plan, to determine when and to whom to make awards under the 2019 Plan, the type of award and the number of shares to be covered by the awards, the fair market value of shares, the terms of the awards, which include the exercise price of the shares of common stock covered by options, any applicable vesting provisions, and conditions under which awards may be terminated, expired, cancelled, renewed or replaced, and to construe and interpret the terms of the 2019 Plan and awards. Subject to applicable law and the terms of the 2019 Plan, the Committee may delegate administrative functions to officers or other designated employees of the Company or its affiliates.

Proposal IV—Approval of the IBERIABANK Corporation 2019 Stock Incentive Plan 
Description of Awards.
Options and SARs. The Committee may grant non-qualified stock options or ISOs to purchase shares of our common stock. The Committee will determine the number and exercise price of the options, provided that the option exercise price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant, except for an option granted in substitution of an outstanding award in an acquisition transaction. In addition, the Committee will determine the time or times that the options become exercisable, provided that options are subject to the minimum vesting requirements and exceptions described above. The term of an option will also be determined by the Committee, but may not exceed ten years from the date of the grant. The Committee may accelerate the exercisability of any stock option at any time. As noted above, the Committee may not, without the prior approval of our shareholders, decrease the exercise price for any outstanding option after the date of grant. In addition, an outstanding option may not, as of any date that the option has a per share exercise price that is greater than the then current fair market value of a share of common stock, be surrendered to us as consideration for the grant of a new option with a lower exercise price, another incentive, a cash payment or shares of common stock, unless approved by our shareholders. ISOs will be subject to certain additional requirements necessary in order to qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code. In addition, participants holding stock options will not be entitled to any dividend equivalent rights for any period of time prior to exercise of the stock option. 
SARs generally permit participants to receive, upon exercise, cash or shares equal in value to the excess of (i) the fair market value, on the date of exercise, of the shares with respect to which the SAR is being exercised, over (ii) the exercise price of the SAR for such shares. The Committee may grant SARs in tandem with options or independently of them. The Committee will determine the exercise price used to measure share appreciation, whether the right may be paid in cash and the number and term of SAR, provided that the term of a SAR may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. SARs are subject to the minimum vesting requirements and exceptions described above. The Committee may accelerate the exercisability of any SAR at any time. The 2019 Plan restricts decreases in the exercise price and certain exchanges of SAR on terms similar to the restrictions described above for stock options. Participants holding 
 SARs will not be entitled to any dividend equivalent rights for any period of time prior to exercise of the SAR. 
To the extent exercisable, an option or SAR may be exercised in whole or in part, and from time to time during its term, subject to earlier termination relating to a holder's termination of employment or service. With respect to options, the Committee has discretion to accept payment of the exercise price in any of the following forms (or combination of them): cash or check, shares of common stock, cashless exercise through a broker or a net exercise exchange if approved by the Committee. 
Except as otherwise provided in the award agreement, an option may be exercised, to the extent the option was exercisable upon termination, during the six-month period after the optionee retires, during the one-year period after the optionee's termination of service due to death or permanent disability, and during the 90-day period after the optionee's termination of employment without cause (but in no case later than the termination date of the option). Forfeiture occurs on termination for cause. The agreement evidencing the grant of an option may, in the discretion of the Committee, set forth additional or different terms and conditions applicable to the option upon a termination or change in status of the employment or service of the option holder. 
Restricted Shares, Restricted Share Units, Unrestricted Shares, and Performance Units. Under the 2019 Plan, the Committee, in its discretion, may grant restricted shares that are forfeitable unless and until certain vesting requirements are met, may grant restricted share units which represent the right to receive shares after certain vesting requirements are met, and may grant unrestricted shares as to which a participant's interest is immediately vested. The Committee, in its discretion, may also grant performance units which must vest based on the attainment of performance goals. The 2019 Plan provides the Committee with discretion to determine the terms and conditions of these awards. 
Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, whenever shares are released pursuant to restricted shares or restricted share units under the 2019 Plan, the recipient will be entitled also to receive cash or additional shares that reflect any cash or stock dividends that the Company's common shareholders receive between the

[END TABLE]
Proposal IV—Approval of the IBERIABANK Corporation 2019 Stock Incentive Plan date of the award and issuance or release of the shares. Notwithstanding the above, if vesting of the award is based on the attainment of performance goals, any and all cash and stock dividends or equivalents paid with respect to the award must also be subject to attainment of the performance goals. 
Income Tax Withholding. As a condition for the issuance of shares pursuant to awards, the 2019 Plan requires satisfaction of any applicable federal, state, local, or foreign withholding tax obligations that may arise in connection with the awards or the issuance of shares. 
Transferability. Awards may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, except to the extent the Committee permits lifetime transfers of awards other than ISOs to charitable institutions, certain family members, or related trusts. 
Certain Corporate Transactions. The Committee will equitably adjust the number of shares covered by each outstanding award, all share limitations, and the number of shares that have been authorized for issuance under the 2019 Plan but as to which no awards have yet been granted or that have been returned to the 2019 Plan upon cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of an award, as well as the price per share covered by each such outstanding award, to reflect any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of common stock resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, spin-off, stock or extraordinary cash dividend, combination, consolidation, recapitalization or reclassification of the shares, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company. In the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee may provide, in substitution for any or all outstanding awards under the 2019 Plan, alternative consideration (including securities of any surviving entity) as the Committee may in good faith determine to be equitable under the circumstances, and the Committee may require in connection therewith the surrender of all awards so replaced. In any case, a substitution will not require the consent of any recipient of awards previously granted awards pursuant to the 2019 Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may not cancel an outstanding option that is not in-the-money for the purpose of reissuing the option to the participant at a lower exercise price or granting a replacement award of a different type. 
In the event of any distribution to the Company's shareholders of securities of any other entity or other assets (other than dividends payable in cash or stock of the Company) without receipt of consideration by the Company, the Committee may, in its discretion, appropriately adjust the price per share covered by each outstanding award to reflect the effect of such distribution. If the Company dissolves or liquidates, all awards will immediately terminate, subject to the ability of the Board of Directors to exercise any discretion that the Board may exercise in the case of a Change in Control. 
Impact of a Change in Control. Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, Awards will automatically vest in full (and to the extent applicable, become exercisable) and any repurchase rights of the Company will automatically lapse upon a Change in Control of the Company. In addition, in the event of a Change in Control, the Committee may in its sole and absolute discretion and authority, without obtaining the approval or consent of the Company's shareholders or any Participant with respect to his or her outstanding Awards, take one or more of the following actions:

Expected Federal Income Tax Consequences. 
The following is a general discussion of certain current U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to awards granted under the 2019 Plan. This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation, does not discuss state, local, and foreign tax issues and does not discuss considerations applicable to a holder who is, with respect to the United States, a non-resident alien individual. This summary of federal income tax consequences does not purport to be complete and is based upon interpretations of existing laws, regulations, and rulings, which could be altered materially with enactment of any new tax legislation. Participants who are granted awards under the 2019 Plan should consult their own tax advisors to determine the tax consequences based on their particular circumstances. 
Under the Code, the Company will generally be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes at the same time and in the same amount as the ordinary income that participants recognize pursuant to awards (subject to the participant's overall compensation being reasonable, and to the discussion below with respect to Code Section 162(m)). For participants, the expected U.S. tax consequences of awards are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       disposition of the shares will be characterized as long-term capital gain and any loss will be characterized as long-term capital loss. If both of these holding period requirements are not met,  then a "disqualifying disposition" occurs and (i) the participant recognizes gain in the amount by which the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise exceeded the exercise price for the ISO and (ii) any remaining  amount realized on disposition (except for certain "wash" sales, gifts or sales to related persons) will be characterized as capital gain or loss.

New Plan Benefits. 
The Committee made equity awards in the first quarter of 2019 under the 2016 Plan. However, no awards pursuant to the proposed 2019 Plan have been, or will be, granted prior to the plan's approval by the Company's shareholders. If our shareholders approve the 2019 Plan at the Annual Meeting, grants of awards to eligible participants will be made in the future by the Compensation Committee as it deems necessary or appropriate.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Summary of 2018 Compensation Actions 
Executive Compensation Program Overview 
Significant changes were made to the executive compensation program in 2016. The shareholder advisory vote on the compensation of our NEOs (commonly known as "Say-on-Pay") at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, at which 88% of the vote was in support of the advisory proposal, clearly demonstrated approval of those changes and reaffirmed to us the alignment between our shareholders and executive compensation program. 
A summary of the key changes made in 2016 that carried into 2018 include:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The significant changes made to our executive compensation programs in 2016 carried forward to 2018 and were very well received by our shareholders as evidenced by overwhelming support of our 2018 Say-on-Pay vote (88% favorable support). Our Compensation Committee believes that these voting results reflect our shareholders' support for the structural changes made to, and the current direction of, our executive compensation program, and affirm alignment of our program with shareholder interests. We continue to maintain an open and active dialogue with our shareholders and advisors to identify ways to further refine and improve our executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee believes our current program adequately and effectively promotes the Company's business strategies and aligns pay with performance and shareholder value.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PHILOSOPHY 
Philosophy and Objectives of Our Executive Compensation Program 
The Compensation Committee's general philosophy is that all elements of target compensation (e.g., base salary, target annual incentive award opportunity, and target long-term incentive award opportunity) should be based on competitive market data, with incentive compensation targeted at the median of similarly situated executives among our peer group or other relevant industry benchmarks. The competitive positioning of target compensation levels for individuals may vary above or below the median based on individual, executive-specific factors such as tenure, experience, and proficiency in role or criticality to the Company. The Compensation Committee's objective is to provide a program that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attracts and retains high-performing executives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Has a significant portion of pay tied to business performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aligns compensation with shareholder interests, while rewarding long-term value creation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Discourages excessive risk-taking by rewarding both short-term and long-term performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reinforces high ethical conduct; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maintains flexibility to respond to industry dynamics.  
[END TABLE]
Unlike target compensation levels, which are set by the Compensation Committee near the beginning of the year, actual compensation is a function of our operational, financial, and stock price performance, as reflected through annual incentive payouts and the value of all long-term incentive awards at vesting. These factors may be considered in decisions to increase or decrease compensation materially. Actual compensation is intended to vary above or below target levels commensurate with our performance. Although not applied to any NEO in 2018, discretion can be exercised by the Committee to award compensation absent attainment of the relevant performance goals. 
Compensation Mix 
Our strategy for compensating our NEOs and other associates has been based on programs that emphasize performance-based variable compensation. During 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the following incentive plan designs for our NEOs, which included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Incentive Awards: a transparent and formulaic plan, rewarding achievement of profitable growth and credit quality.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-Term Incentive Awards: granted three types of equity based awards that in combination balance alignment with  shareholder interest (stock options), retention (restricted stock), and long-term performance accountability (performance shares).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
46           2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Company's emphasis on performance-based compensation is best illustrated by the mix of 2018 compensation for NEOs which was as follows: 
This illustrates that the majority of our NEO's total direct compensation package is variable pay. Furthermore, it also shows our emphasis on long-term incentive compensation over short-term (annual) incentive compensation. 
DECISION MAKING PROCESS 
Role of Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee administers the Company's compensation program for the President and CEO and other NEOs. The Compensation Committee's authority and responsibilities are set forth in its charter and include, but are not limited to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewing and approving the compensation for the President and CEO and other executives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Selecting and approving the performance metrics and goals for all executive officer compensation programs and evaluating  performance at the end of each performance period; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approving annual incentive award and long-term incentive award opportunities.  
[END TABLE]
In making compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee uses multiple resources and tools, including the services of its independent compensation advisor. 
Role of Executive Officers 
Authority and responsibilities of executive officers in determining executive compensation are also set forth in the Compensation Committee charter including, but not limited to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The CEO and other members of management will consult, as necessary and appropriate, with the Committee.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Compensation Decisions for the Named Executive Officers 
Individual compensation decisions (base salary adjustments and incentive awards) for all NEOs are based upon core performance, achievement of strategic initiatives, and individual performance. The Committee, in its sole discretion, determines any salary adjustments and approves the annual and long-term incentive awards for the President and CEO. 
Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee has retained FW Cook as its independent consultant reporting directly to the Compensation Committee. 
In its role as the Committee's independent advisor, FW Cook attends most Committee meetings and advises on matters including compensation program design, competitive benchmarking, and relative pay for performance. FW Cook also provides market data, analysis, and advice regarding compensation of our NEOs and other executive officers. FW Cook does not provide any services to the Company other than executive compensation consulting services to the Committee. 
Competitive Benchmarking 
Annually, the Compensation Committee reviews competitive data for comparable executive positions in the market. External market data is used by the Compensation Committee as a point of reference in its executive pay decisions in conjunction with financial and individual performance data. 
The Committee also considers analysis from a comprehensive total compensation study, which delineates each compensation element for NEOs, competitive benchmarking, and other analysis, as further described below.

In addition, the Compensation Committee reviewed compensation survey data for national commercial banking companies as provided by the independent compensation consultant. All of this national survey data was size-adjusted to reflect commercial banks with approximately $30 billion in assets, which was the approximate size of the Company at the time of the compensation review. This national industry perspective provides the Compensation Committee with both a broader view of the executive labor market and additional context from which to evaluate the competitiveness of the Company's compensation program. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM ELEMENTS 
The purpose and key characteristics of each element of our 2018 executive compensation program are summarized below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Base Salary    Represents each NEO's base level of responsibility, leadership, tenure, qualifications, and contribution to the success and profitability of the Company and the competitive marketplace for executive talent specific to our  industry.    Fixed compensation that is reviewed annually and adjusted if and when appropriate. 
 Annual Incentive Awards    Motivates NEOs to achieve our short-term business objectives that drive long-term performance while providing flexibility to respond to opportunities and changing market conditions.    Variable performance-based annual cash award. Awards are based on achieving pre-established performance goals.

 Performance-Based Restricted Share units ("RSUs")    Motivates NEOs to achieve our business objectives by tying incentives to our financial and key operational metrics over the performance period while continuing to reinforce the link between the interests of our NEOs and our  shareholders.    Variable performance-based long-term award. The number of units earned is based on the achievement over a three year period of absolute ROTCE goals, coupled with ROTCE performance against banks in the KBW Regional Bank Index. The  ultimate number of units may be calculated by applying an adjustment of +/- 25% based on TSR performance relative to the peer group.

Long-term restricted stock award with a ratable vesting period over three years. The ultimate value realized varies with our common stock price. 
 Stock Options    Motivates NEOs to achieve our business objectives by tying incentives to the appreciation of our common stock over the long term; reinforces the link between the interests of our NEOs and our shareholders.    Long-term option award with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant and a ratable vesting period over three years; the ultimate value realized, if any, depends on the appreciation of our common stock  price. 
 Other Compensation    Provides benefits that promote employee health and work-life balance, which assists in attracting and retaining our NEOs.    Indirect compensation element consisting of health and welfare plans and minimal perquisites.

Base Salary 
We view annual base salary as an important component of compensation for attracting and retaining executive talent. Annual base salaries serve as the foundation for our employee pay structure. Executive base salaries are set after considering factors including external market competitiveness, individual performance, and internal equity. Prior to determining the base salary for each NEO, the Compensation Committee evaluates the results from the comprehensive total compensation study, along with competitive benchmarking discussed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. 
After reviewing the total compensation targets for our NEOs against market peers, base salaries in 2018 for NEOs, including the CEO, were not increased and remained at 2017 levels.

Annual Incentive Awards 
The annual incentive award program focuses executive officers on key operating drivers of long-term success and strikes a balance between profitable growth and credit quality. The Compensation Committee approves specific targets for each performance metric and evaluates performance against these targets. All executive officers have a target award opportunity, as well as a maximum award, that may be paid under the annual incentive award program. 
During the first quarter of 2018, the Compensation Committee established the target percentage of base salary for each of the NEOs. The Committee used the 2018 base salary in calculating the annual incentive award payments. The following chart shows the range of annual incentive award opportunities expressed as a percentage of base salary for the NEO.

The following formula was used to calculate the payment that could be awarded to a NEO under the 2018 annual incentive award program: 
Base Salary x Target Percentage of Base Salary x Total Weighted Performance Factor (0 - 200%) 
For 2018, the Compensation Committee established the following metrics as the basis for the determination of payouts, if any, under the annual incentive plan. These financial metrics were selected to provide a holistic evaluation of Company performance with an emphasis on profitability, but not at the expense of growth or asset quality.

Based on the core performance of the Company relative to the targets established for 2018, our NEO Total Weighted Performance Factor was 137.51%. The Compensation Committee reviewed the overall performance of the Company and concluded that no qualitative adjustments were required and that the Total Weighted Performance Factor fairly captured core performance for 2018. Accordingly, the Total Weighted Performance Factor used for the annual incentive payout was set at 137.51%. The Compensation Committee believes these incentive payments are aligned with the Company's philosophy, market-based compensation practices, and the contribution of each NEO.

We consider long-term equity-based compensation to be critical to the alignment of executive compensation with shareholder value creation. Therefore, a market competitive, long-term equity-based incentive component is an integral part of our overall executive compensation program. 
The total long-term incentive award in a given year is based on a multiple calculated as a percentage of base salary. The multiple is converted into an aggregate long-term incentive award. The following chart reflects the 2018 target award opportunities for each NEO:

Target long-term incentive opportunities are established based on competitive market practices. The fair value of 2018 long-term incentive awards is reflected in the Summary Compensation Table. In 2018, our long-term equity incentive program consisted of the following components: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance-based RSUs, which measure 60% of LTI award: Since 2016, a majority of the annual LTI award has  been delivered via performance-based RSUs which measure three year performance against a combination of internally established ROTCE goals and our ROTCE relative to the KBW Regional Bank Index, as measured through the use of a matrix, and relative  TSR performance.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Committee determined that the use of a matrix, measuring a combination of relative and absolute performance goals,  addressed many issues associated with long-term performance plans. By establishing absolute goals, coupled with performance against banks in the KBW Regional Bank Index, a matrix mitigates some of the challenges associated with setting precise  long-term goals in an uncertain economic environment and avoids the "best of the worst" outcome that is possible with the exclusive use of relative measurement. The matrix developed to measure ROTCE performance over the three-year-period  spanning from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 is presented below:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The column headings "A%", "B%", "C%", and "D%" correspond to specific, absolute  ROTCE targets set by the Committee based on the Company's confidential business plan for the three-year performance period. Because these targets are based on the Company's non-public business plan  and may be misinterpreted as earnings guidance, the Company will not publicly disclose the actual target levels until the completion of the performance period. No payouts can be made unless the minimum threshold level of absolute ROTCE performance  is achieved.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The calculated payout earned based on ROTCE performance outlined above, if any, can be modified by TSR performance relative  to the peer group as follows:

• Stock Options, which measure 10% of LTI award: Stock options reward NEOs for increasing the market price  above the exercise price. We maintain a policy against repricing stock options without shareholder approval. Stock options awarded to the NEOs during 2018 are detailed in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table in the Executive Compensation section.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted Stock, which measure 30% of LTI award: Restricted shares are awarded subject to transfer and  vesting restrictions. Restricted share awards are intended to build stock ownership and foster executive retention. All of these restricted share awards have dividend and voting rights. Restricted shares awarded to the NEOs during 2018 are detailed  in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table in the Executive Compensation section.

2016-2018 Performance-based RSUs 
During 2016, the NEOs received performance-based RSUs that are earned in shares based on meeting three-year absolute ROTCE goals, coupled with ROTCE performance against banks in the KBW Regional Bank Index. The final payout percentage for these awards was 99.3% of the target grant, as illustrated in the table below:

[END TABLE]
On March 1, 2019, the NEO's cliff-vested in 99.3% of their performance-based RSU grant, settled in shares, for the 2016-2018 performance period. The calculation required no adjustment resulting from the TSR Modifier. 
Other Benefits and Limited Perquisites 
We provide our NEOs with a few perquisites, including club memberships, an annual physical examination, an automobile allowance, social dues, security alarm services, and corporate aircraft flight benefits. We also provide our NEOs a non-qualified deferred compensation plan and individual long-term disability insurance coverage. 
Acknowledging our expanded footprint and desire to achieve greater travel efficiencies, the Company acquired a corporate aircraft in 2014. Personal use of the corporate aircraft is limited. However, any personal use will trigger imputed income to the NEO, calculated according to the IRS guidelines. 
Personal use of the corporate aircraft is included under "Other Compensation" in the Summary Compensation Table. 
Post Termination and Other Employment Arrangements 
The Company provides benefits to our NEOs upon certain terminations of employment from the Company. These benefits are in addition to the benefits to which the executives would be entitled upon a termination of employment generally (i.e., vested retirement benefits accrued as of the date of termination, stock awards that have vested as of the date of termination and the right to elect continued health coverage pursuant to COBRA). The incremental benefits payable to the executives are described below.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Daryl G. Byrd—President and CEO 
The Company has a three-year employment agreement with our President and CEO, Daryl G. Byrd, that automatically renews for an additional year on each anniversary of the agreement unless not earlier than 90 days before the anniversary, the Company gives notice that it will not be renewed. The purpose of this employment agreement is to help retain Mr. Byrd and to define severance benefits for various types of employment terminations. In addition to change in control payments consistent with those of the other NEOs except Mr. Perez-Hickman, Mr. Byrd's employment agreement requires payment of compensation and/or benefits under various other termination of employment situations. Under the terms of this agreement, if Mr. Byrd's employment is terminated other than for Cause (as defined), disability, retirement, or death, or if Mr. Byrd terminates his employment for Good Reason (as defined), then he would be entitled to severance benefits. Under this termination, he would be entitled to cash severance payments equal to the greater of one year's base salary or his base salary for the remaining term of the agreement. 
In the event that Mr. Byrd's employment is terminated for disability, we would provide continued medical insurance for his benefit and the benefit of his spouse and minor children for the remaining term of the agreement. In the event of Mr. Byrd's death during the term of the agreement, the Company would continue to provide medical insurance for his spouse and minor children for the remaining term. Also, in the event of his death, Mr. Byrd's spouse, estate, legal representative, or named beneficiaries would be entitled to receive his annual compensation (including base salary and any discretionary cash bonus the Compensation Committee would then deem appropriate) for 12 months from his date of death. 
If Mr. Byrd terminates his employment within 30 days of a Change in Control (as defined), or within 90 days of an event constituting Good Reason occurring within three years of a Change of Control, or within 30 days of the first anniversary of a Change in Control, or if the company terminates his employment without Cause within three years of a Change of Control, then he would be entitled to receive either the greater of his salary for the remaining term of the agreement, twice his salary, or Code Section 280G ("280G Maximum") defined generally as 2.99 times his average compensation over the previous five years. If any payments to be made under the agreement are deemed to constitute "excess parachute payments," and therefore are subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the Company would pay him the amount of the excise tax plus an amount equal to any additional federal, state, or local taxes that may result because of such additional payment. In addition to the cash severance benefits described, Mr. Byrd would be entitled to a continuation of benefits similar to those he was receiving at the time of such termination for the period otherwise remaining under the term of the agreement or until he obtains full-time employment with another employer, whichever occurs first. Additional details concerning these benefits can be found under the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" heading. 
Fernando Perez-Hickman—Vice Chairman and Director of Corporate Strategy 
Commencing as of the closing date of the Sabadell United acquisition, IBERIABANK entered into a 36-month employment agreement with Fernando Perez-Hickman, our Vice Chairman and Director of Corporate Strategy. The agreement may be renewed by Mr. Perez-Hickman for an additional 24 months (the "Renewal Term"). Under the terms of the employment contract Mr. Perez-Hickman received a retention bonus of $1,250,000, payable in increments of $750,000 at the execution of the agreement, and $250,000 due on each of the first and second anniversaries of the first payment if he is still employed at IBERIABANK, except as otherwise provided in the agreement. In addition, under the terms of the employment contract Mr. Perez-Hickman received a sign-on award of 40,000 shares of restricted stock. If Mr. Perez-Hickman elects to extend the term of the contract for an additional two years, he will receive a renewal award of 20,000 shares of restricted stock, which shall vest on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the Sabadell United closing. The purpose of this employment agreement is to help retain Mr. Perez-Hickman and to define severance benefits for various types of employment termination. The employment agreement requires payment of compensation and/or benefits under various terminations of employment situations. 
In connection with the closing, Mr. Perez-Hickman and IBERIABANK agreed that the Sabadell United acquisition constituted a change in control pursuant to his employment agreement with Sabadell United, entitling him to receive $3.6 million if he resigned following the closing. The parties agreed that in lieu of, and in full satisfaction of, his right to

Compensation Discussion and Analysis receive the severance payment, IBERIABANK would contribute on his behalf an equal amount into a Deferred Compensation Account under its Executive Nonqualified Excess Plan. The terms and conditions of the contribution are governed by the Plan, but the contribution is fully vested. 
If Mr. Perez-Hickman's employment is terminated with or without Just Cause (as defined), he will be bound by certain Restrictive Covenants (as defined, including non-competition, non-solicitation, and non-recruitment), and he will be entitled to the following severance benefits: the remaining unpaid portion of his Retention Bonus of $1,250,000 and an Annual Bonus with a target amount equal to 75% of Base Salary, but only if terminated for Just Cause. If without Just Cause, he will also receive his Base Salary of $650,000 per annum for 24 months from the date of termination and awards of restricted stock and long-term incentive awards would vest. If Mr. Perez-Hickman voluntarily resigns with Good Reason (as defined), he will be bound by the Restrictive Covenants and entitled to receive: the remaining unpaid portion of his Retention Bonus; the Annual Bonus; and his Base Salary for 24 months. In addition, unvested awards will vest. If Mr. Perez-Hickman resigns without Good Reason, he may be entitled to receive the remaining unpaid portion of his Retention Bonus, which would be subject to certain forfeiture repayment requirements, and, if due and payable on the resignation date, the Annual Bonus; unvested stock awards will be forfeited. Upon Mr. Perez-Hickman's death, his estate would be entitled to receive: the remaining unpaid portion of his Retention Bonus and the Annual Bonus payable for 2017 and 2018; 200% of his Base Salary; and unvested stock awards. These amounts may be payable from life insurance proceeds of a policy, the costs of which are to be paid by IBERIABANK. In the event of Mr. Perez-Hickman's disability (as defined), he would be bound by the Restrictive Covenants, and be entitled to receive the remaining unpaid portion of his Retention Bonus and the Annual Bonus, and all unvested awards and the Renewal Award, if applicable, would vest. 
The Change in Control Severance Agreement for Mr. Perez-Hickman provides for severance pay and benefits in the event if within three months prior or two years after a Change in Control Mr. Perez-Hickman resigns for Good Reason, as defined, or is terminated by the Company or its successor without Just Cause, as defined. The severance payment is equal to a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of a pro rata bonus (unless entitled to a guarantee bonus payment) in an amount determined by multiplying (1) his target bonus for the year of termination or, the average of the annual bonuses awarded, if he does not have a target bonus, for the three fiscal years immediately preceding the date of termination; provided, however, that if he is not employed during each of the three most recently completed fiscal years, then the amount shall be the average of the annual bonuses awarded to him for each fiscal year he was eligible to receive a bonus, by (2) the fraction obtained by dividing the number of days in the year through the date of termination by 365, plus an amount equal to 2.5 times the sum of (x) his base salary in effect at termination and (y) a bonus amount determined as follows in the stated order of priority: (A) if applicable, his guarantee bonus, (B) if not entitled to a guarantee bonus, the target bonus for the year, (C) if he does not have a target bonus, the average of the annual bonuses awarded to him for the three most recently completed fiscal years, or (D) that if he is not employed during each of the three most recently completed fiscal years, then the amount shall be the average of the annual bonuses awarded to him for each fiscal year he was eligible to receive a bonus. In addition, he will receive a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of the aggregate monthly premium that would be paid by him and the Company to obtain group health plan coverage plus the aggregate monthly premium that would be paid by him and the Company to obtain group term life insurance, multiplied by 36, less applicable withholding taxes. 
Mr. Perez-Hickman's Change in Control severance agreement does not provide for a Section 280(g) gross up payment. The agreement stipulates that in the event severance benefits are subject to the excise tax under Code Section 4999, the amount payable to him would be reduced to the 280G Maximum if the reduction would result in him receiving a greater after-tax amount. 
Change in Control Severance Agreements With Other Named Executive Officers 
We have entered into Change in Control Severance Agreements with members of senior management, including each of our NEOs other than Mr. Byrd. The agreements for Mr. Restel, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Parker provide for severance pay and benefits to the individuals upon voluntary resignation within 30 days after a Change in Control of IBERIABANK Corporation, as defined, or if within three years of a Change in Control the individual resigns for Good Reason, as defined, or is terminated by the Company or its successor without Just Cause, as defined. The severance payment is equal to 100% of each individual's 280G Maximum. In addition, each will be entitled to continued medical and life insurance benefits at the Company's expense for 39 months following termination of employment. We will also make the individual

OTHER COMPENSATION PROGRAM ASPECTS 
Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines 
We believe it is important for our NEOs and other senior executive officers to be significant shareholders so that their financial interests are aligned with our other shareholders. To foster executive stock ownership, we maintain executive stock ownership guidelines. We believe that these ownership guidelines, as well as our total long-term incentive program, have been effective in building an ownership culture. Thus, the financial interests of our executive leadership team are directly aligned with other shareholders. These ownership guidelines are stated as a multiple of base salary. NEOs have five years from the date the guideline applies to meet the target ownership level. The table below summarizes the share guidelines for NEOs expressed as a multiple of current base salary.

Equity Grant Practices 
The Compensation Committee generally grants equity awards in February of each year. The Compensation Committee does not have any programs, plans, or practices of timing these awards in coordination with the release of material non-public information. We have never backdated, re-priced, or spring-loaded any of our equity awards. 
Anti-Hedging Policy and Trading Restrictions 
Our current policy limits the timing and types of transactions in our securities by "covered persons," defined to include directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries and members of their immediate families. Among other restrictions, the policy:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Anti-Pledging Policy 
In March 2016, the Board of Directors amended the Company's insider trading policy to prohibit directors, executive officers, and other persons subject to such policy, subsequent to the date of adoption, from holding shares in margin accounts or pledging shares as collateral for a loan. These restrictions will not apply to shares of Company common stock held in a margin account or pledged as collateral for a loan prior to the date of adoption of amendments to such policy. Under certain limited circumstances, an exception to the prohibition on pledged common stock may be granted. 
Compensation Recovery Policy 
The Company maintains a written Compensation Recovery Policy. This policy applies to each of the NEOs and permits the recovery of incentive-based compensation paid to an officer if: (1) incentive-based compensation, bonuses, or equity awards were paid or vested during fiscal periods based on materially inaccurate financial statements, and (2) that officer engaged in fraud, willful misconduct, or a violation of Company policy that caused or otherwise contributed to the need for a material restatement of the Company's financial results. The Board, considering the best interests of shareholders and the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, has sole discretion to determine whether the applicable standard of conduct has been met and whether any such recovery should be pursued. 
The Compensation Recovery Policy is part of the IBERIABANK Corporation Corporate Governance Guidelines. A link to the Corporate Governance Guidelines is on the "Investor Relations" portion of our website at: http://www.iberiabank.com. 
Risk Management Considerations 
The Compensation Committee reviews risks and rewards associated with our compensation programs, which include features that we believe mitigate risks without reducing incentives. Our compensation programs are intended to both encourage and reward prudent business judgment and appropriate long-term risk-taking. The Compensation Committee seeks to identify and remediate risk-taking incentives that may exist in these programs. The Chairman of the Board Risk Committee is also a member of the Compensation Committee. 
Indemnification Agreements 
The Company has indemnification agreements with Daryl G. Byrd and Michael J. Brown that provide for indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted by law with respect to pending or threatened claims against them in their capacities as our officers. Following a Change in Control (as defined), all determinations regarding a right to indemnity and advancement of expenses are to be made by an independent legal counsel. In the event of a potential Change in Control, we must create a trust for the benefit of the indemnified executive officers, which upon a Change in Control may not be revoked or the principal thereof invaded without the indemnities' written consent. While not requiring the maintenance of directors' and officers' liability insurance, the indemnification agreements require that the indemnities be provided with maximum coverage if there is such insurance. 
Section 162(m) 
Section 162(m) of the Code limits to $1 million a public company's annual tax deduction for compensation paid to certain executive officers. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, Section 162(m) provided an exemption from this deduction limitation for compensation that qualified as "performance-based compensation". However, among other changes to Section 162(m), the exemption for performance-based compensation was repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, subject to transition relief for certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. The Compensation Committee's policy is to structure compensation awards that will be deductible, where doing so will further the purposes of our executive compensation programs. The Committee also considers it important to retain flexibility, to design compensation programs that recognize a full range of criteria important to our success, even where compensation payable under the programs may not be fully deductible. The elimination of the performance-based exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit has not altered the Committee's commitment to a pay-for-performance executive compensation program. The Committee believes that the Section 162(m) related tax deduction is only one of 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019 Proxy Statement     59   
[END TABLE]
Compensation Discussion and Analysis several relevant considerations in setting compensation. The Committee also believes that the Section 162(m) tax deduction limitation should not be permitted to compromise its ability to design and maintain executive compensation arrangements that, among other things, are intended to attract, retain, and motivate talented, high-performing leaders. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the changes to Section 162(m) will significantly impact the design of our compensation program going forward. 
The Committee will give careful consideration to the possible impact of other tax and accounting treatments of particular forms of consideration to NEOs, other executives, and other Company associates.

Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company is composed entirely of non-employee directors, each of whom has been determined in the Board's business judgment to be independent. The Compensation Committee is responsible for oversight and review of the Company's compensation and benefit plans. 
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis is management's report on the Company's compensation programs and, among other things, describes material elements of compensation paid to the President and Chief Executive Officer and the other Named Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis as required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with the management of the Company. Based on such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Executive Compensation 
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation 
We offer directors and a select group of management and highly compensated key associates the right to participate in a Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Participants may elect to defer up to 90% of their annual base salary or incentive compensation, including incentive bonuses, service bonuses, and commissions. The Plan allows for discretionary employer contributions. The investment options available under the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan are similar to those available under the Company's 401(k) plan. Earnings are credited to the account based on the performance of the investment options selected. Participants vest immediately in their deferrals. As a general rule, payment terms of deferred amounts and investment options are determined by the participant during enrollment and are subject to a deferral of at least two years, except under certain qualifying events, including the participant's separation from service, a change in control, an unforeseeable emergency, or death. Payment shall be made in a single lump sum or, in the event of a separation from service after reaching age 65, disability, or scheduled in-service distribution, in equal annual installments over the period specified by the participant, not to exceed five years. The following table shows certain information for Named Executive Officers under the Corporation's Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Messrs.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
The Company provides benefits to the Named Executive Officers upon certain terminations of employment from the Company. These benefits are in addition to the benefits to which the executives would be entitled upon a termination of employment generally (i.e., vested retirement benefits accrued as of the date of termination, stock awards that have vested as of the date of termination, and the right to elect continued health coverage pursuant to COBRA). The incremental benefits payable to the executives are described below. 
We have entered into Change in Control Severance Agreements with members of senior management, including each of our Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Byrd. Except for these agreements, and our broad-based severance policy, none of our Named Executive Officers, other than President and CEO Byrd and Vice Chairman and Director of Corporate Strategy Perez-Hickman, have employment agreements. 
Mr. Byrd's employment agreement requires payment of compensation and/or benefits under various termination of employment situations. In addition to change in control payments consistent with those of the other Named Executive Officers, if Mr. Byrd's employment had been terminated at December 31, 2018, he would have been entitled to (i) a salary of $2,812,500 and benefits of $77,531, in the event of termination other than for Cause, death or disability, (ii) annual compensation of $1,125,000, benefits of $43,888, and any appropriate bonus as determined by the Compensation Committee, in the event of termination due to death, and (iii) $43,888 in benefits in the event of termination due to disability. These agreements are described more fully in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section. 
Mr. Perez-Hickman's employment agreement requires payment of compensation under various termination of employment situations. In addition to change in control payments under a separate agreement, if Mr. Perez-Hickman's employment had been terminated at December 31, 2018, he would have been entitled to (i) a retention bonus of $250,000, in the event of termination due to Just Cause within two years of the Sabadell United acquisition closing date, (ii) a salary of $1,300,000, annual bonus of $670,362, retention bonus of $250,000, and unvested stock awards totaling $2,772,589, in the event of termination without Just Cause, (iii) annual compensation of $1,300,000, annual bonus of $670,362, retention bonus of $250,000, and unvested stock awards totaling $2,772,589, in the event of termination due to death, (iv) annual bonus of $670,362, retention bonus of $250,000, and unvested stock awards totaling $2,772,589, in the event of termination due to disability, (v) annual compensation of $1,300,000, annual bonus of $670,362, retention bonus of $250,000, and unvested stock awards totaling $2,772,589, in the event of resignation with Good Reason within three years of the Sabadell United acquisition closing date, and (vi) retention bonus of $250,000, in the event of resignation without Good Reason within two years of the Sabadell United acquisition closing date. These agreements are described more fully in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section. 
In 2017, commencing as of the closing date of the Sabadell United acquisition, we entered into a Change in Control Severance Agreement with Fernando Perez-Hickman. The Change in Control Severance Agreement for Mr. Perez-Hickman provides for severance pay and benefits if within two years of a Change in Control Mr. Perez-Hickman resigns for Good Reason, as defined, or is terminated by the Company or its successor without Just Cause, as defined. The severance payment is equal to a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of a pro rata bonus (unless entitled to a guarantee bonus payment) in an amount determined by multiplying (1) his target bonus for the year of termination or, the average of the annual bonuses awarded, if he does not have a target bonus, for the three fiscal years immediately preceding the date of termination; provided, however, that if he is not employed during each of the three most recently completed fiscal years, then the amount shall be the average of the annual bonuses awarded to him for each fiscal year he was eligible to receive a bonus, by (2) the fraction obtained by dividing the number of days in the year through the date of termination by 365, plus an amount equal to 2.5 times the sum of (x) his base salary in effect at 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation termination and (y) a bonus amount determined as follows in the stated order of priority: (A) if applicable, his guarantee bonus, (B) if not entitled to a guarantee bonus, the target bonus for the year, (C) if he does not have a target bonus, the average of the annual bonuses awarded to him for the three most recently completed fiscal years, or (D) that if he is not employed during each of the three most recently completed fiscal years, then the amount shall be the average of the annual bonuses awarded to him for each fiscal year he was eligible to receive a bonus. In addition, he will receive a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of the aggregate monthly premium that would be paid by him and the Company to obtain group health plan coverage plus the aggregate monthly premium that would be paid by him and the Company to obtain group term life insurance, multiplied by 36, less applicable withholding taxes. 
Mr. Perez-Hickman's Change in Control severance agreement does not provide for a Section 280(g) gross up payment. The agreement stipulates that in the event severance benefits are subject to the excise tax under IRC Section 4999, the amount payable to him would be reduced to the 280G Maximum if the reduction would result in him receiving a greater after tax amount. 
In 2000, we entered into a separate Change in Control Severance Agreement with Michael J. Brown providing for severance pay and benefits upon voluntary resignation within 30 days after a Change in Control of IBERIABANK Corporation, as defined, or if within three years of a Change in Control Mr. Brown resigns for Good Reason, as defined, or is terminated by the Company or its successor without Just Cause, as defined. In 2006, we amended and restated the 2005 Change in Control Severance Agreement with Anthony J. Restel, and in 2009, we entered into a separate Change in Control Severance Agreement with Jefferson G. Parker. The severance payment is 100% in the case of Mr. Brown, Mr. Restel, and Mr. Parker, of each individual's 280G Maximum, defined generally as 2.99 times their average compensation over the previous five years. In addition, each will be entitled to continued medical and life insurance benefits at the Company's expense for 39 months following termination of employment. We will also make the individual whole for any excise tax imposed by the Code with respect to any payments under the agreement. Each of these agreements was amended in 2008 to comply with the deferred compensation requirements of Code Section 409A. 
As of December 31, 2018, NEOs held unexercisable options to purchase common stock and unvested shares of restricted common stock, restricted share units and performance units listed in the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" table.

CEO Pay Ratio 
In August 2015 pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median associate's annual total compensation to the total annual compensation of the principal executive officer ("PEO"). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019 Proxy Statement     69   
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation 
Mr. Byrd, President and CEO, had 2018 annual total compensation of $5,287,769 as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. Our median associate's annual total compensation for 2018 was $62,049. The resulting ratio of our CEO's pay to the pay of our median associate for fiscal year 2018 is approximately 85:1. 
Based upon our determination that neither pay distribution nor the profile of our average associate had materially changed, we intended to use the same median associate that was used for purposes of our 2017 disclosure. It was determined that the individual identified as our median associate for purposes of our 2017 disclosure terminated from the company in October 2018. As a result, we believe it is not appropriate to use the same median associate for purposes of this year's pay ratio calculation. Therefore, we selected a new median associate utilizing the same methodology and database that we used in selecting the median associate for our 2017 calculation. We identified the new median associate by examining the 2017 total cash compensation for all individuals, excluding the CEO, who were employed by us on October 2, 2017, and remained actively employed through December 31, 2018. We included all associates, whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation which, for purposes of this calculation, includes annualized base salary, annual cash bonus, incentives, and commissions. We believe the use of total cash compensation for all associates is a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to associates. 
After identifying the median associate based on total cash compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for such associate using the same methodology we use for our Named Executive Officers as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement.

Cash and Stock Payments. A new compensation package was awarded to the directors effective June 1, 2017. Each director who is not employed (referred to as outside directors or non-management directors), except the Chairman, will be paid an annual cash retainer of $70,000. The Chairman will receive an annual cash retainer of $97,000. In addition to the cash retainers received, a director who is a chairman on a committee will receive an annual committee chair retainer of $7,500, with the exception of the Audit Committee, in which the director will receive an annual committee chair retainer of $10,000. 
Directors Abell, Breaux, Casbon, Maples, and Shea were paid a fee of $6,458 per month in 2018. Directors Cooper and Koerner were paid a fee of $5,833 per month in 2018. Director Welch was paid a fee of $5,833 per month from January to August, and director Sugrañes was paid a fee of $5,833 per month from May to December. Director Barton was paid a fee of $6,667 per month in 2018 and Chairman Fenstermaker was paid $8,083 per month in 2018. During 2018, Daryl G. Byrd, President and CEO, was the only director employed by the Company. 
During 2018, the Compensation Committee authorized each outside director to receive 1,200 shares of restricted stock (which were valued based on the closing price of the common stock of $80.70 as of June 1, 2018, the date of the award). All of these shares of restricted stock will vest over a one-year period, and the total value of these awards will be allocated on the first anniversary from the date of the award. The Company did not issue any stock options or non-equity incentive compensation to any member of its Board of Directors. In addition, the Company does not sponsor a defined benefit pension plan and has not paid other forms of compensation as defined in Item 402(j) of Regulation S-K to its Board of Directors during 2018. 
The Compensation Committee annually reviews and makes recommendations regarding director compensation. These recommendations are based upon, among other things, the Committee's consideration of compensation paid to directors of comparable financial institutions and advice from its independent compensation consultant as to the reasonableness of the compensation package. 
Other Benefits. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law so that they will be free from undue concern about personal liability in connection with their service to the Company. We also provide our directors with customary directors and officers liability insurance coverage.

Certain Transactions 
A number of our directors, executive officers, and members of their immediate families, as well as organizations with which they are affiliated, were clients of IBERIABANK during 2018. All loans to our related persons-as defined in Instruction 1 to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K-were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those provided at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the lender, and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. 
On August 28, 2017, John R. Davis resigned as Senior Executive Vice President—Mergers and Acquisitions and Investor Relations of the Company, effective August 31, 2017. In connection with his resignation, Mr. Davis entered into a Separation Agreement dated August 28, 2017 with the Company pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay him a severance payment of $600,000 in exchange for and in consideration of the obligations set out in the agreement. In addition, if Mr. Davis elects and maintains benefits under COBRA, the Company will pay medical and dental benefits for the 18-month eligibility period following the last day of his employment and, in consideration of Mr. Davis having complied with his obligations under the agreement, the Company paid Mr. Davis $400,000 on March 1, 2018. As a condition to his receipt of benefits under the agreement, Mr. Davis agreed to release any and all claims against the Company and to covenants with respect to client non-solicitation and employee non-recruitment.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits a public company from extending or renewing credit or arranging the extension or renewal of credit to an officer or director. However, this prohibition does not apply to loans made by depository institutions such as IBERIABANK that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and are subject to the insider lending restrictions of the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation O. Accordingly, we permit our directors and executive officers, their family members and their related interests, to establish and maintain banking and business relationships in the ordinary course of business with IBERIABANK. With respect to lending activities, IBERIABANK has policies governing affiliate and insider lending transactions. These policies prohibit extensions of credit to "insiders," as defined in the policies, unless the extension of credit: 
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions With Related Persons 
Audit Committee review is required for any lending transaction that alone or together with other extensions of credit to an "insider" exceeds $120,000 and does not meet the criteria noted above or which becomes a past due, nonaccrual, restructured or a potential problem loan as of year-end under applicable SEC rules. Also, in compliance with Regulation O, a majority of the Board of Directors of IBERIABANK must approve in advance any extension of credit to any director or executive officer or any of their related entities where the aggregate lending relationship exceeds $500,000. A director with an interest in the extension of credit must abstain from voting or participating in the discussion and approval of the extension of credit. 
An extension of credit covered by Regulation O to executive officers must be promptly reported to the Board of Directors of IBERIABANK; preceded by the submission of a detailed personal financial statement; and made subject to the written provision that the loan will, at the option of IBERIABANK, be due and payable at any time that the executive officer is indebted to any other bank or banks in an amount greater than the dollar thresholds set forth above. 
In order to promote compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and rules pertaining to "insider" lending transactions discussed above, we have appointed an officer to assist in identifying and reviewing pertinent transactions with identified "insiders." The officer annually receives lists of all directors and executive officers of the Company and IBERIABANK and any other subsidiaries, as well as a list of our principal shareholders, if any. The information collected from directors and executive officers includes the names of these individuals and their family members, as well as the names of their related interests, which are referred to as "covered entities." The officer will promptly notify the chief risk officer in the event the officer detects an extension of credit to an "insider" that appears to violate the policy.

[END TABLE]
Exhibit A 
IBERIABANK CORPORATION 
2019 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN 
1. Establishment, Purpose, and Types of Awards. 
IBERIABANK Corporation (the "Company") hereby establishes this equity-based incentive compensation plan to be known as the "IBERIABANK Corporation 2019 Stock Incentive Plan" (the "Plan"), in order to provide incentives and awards to select employees, consultants, and directors of the Company and its Affiliates. 
The Plan permits the granting of the following types of Awards, according to the Sections of the Plan listed here: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Section 6     Option Awards 
 Section 7     Share Appreciation Rights 
 Section 8     Restricted Shares, Restricted Share Units, and Unrestricted Shares 
 Section 9     Performance Units 
[END TABLE]
The Plan is not intended to affect, and shall not affect, any stock options, equity-based compensation, or other benefits that the Company or its Affiliates may have provided, or may separately provide in the future pursuant to any agreement, plan, or program that is independent of this Plan. 
2. Defined Terms. 
Terms in the Plan that begin with an initial capital letter have the defined meaning set forth in the Appendix, unless defined elsewhere in this Plan or an Award Agreement, or the context of their use clearly indicates a different meaning. 
3. Shares Subject to the Plan. 
(a) Number of Shares. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 12, the maximum number of Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan shall be equal to the following: 3,472,414 Shares (which consists of 2,800,000 new Shares plus 672,414 Prior Plan Shares), less Shares subject to any Awards granted after March 19, 2019 under any Prior Plan, using the share counting provisions set forth in Section 3(b), and plus any Shares that are subject to outstanding awards under any Prior Plan as of the Effective Date that are subsequently canceled, expired, forfeited or otherwise not issued or are settled in cash. Any of the Shares reserved and available for issuance under the Plan may be used for any type of Award under the Plan. Upon approval of this Plan by the Company's shareholders, the Company will cease making new Awards under any Prior Plan. 
(b) Share Counting. 
(i) The above authorized Plan limit shall be reduced by one (1) Share for every one Share subject to an Option or SAR granted under the Plan, and by two (2) Shares for every one Share subject to Awards granted under the Plan in a form other than Options or SARs. 
(ii) To the extent any Shares covered by an Option or SAR granted under the Plan are not delivered to a Participant or permitted transferee because the Award is forfeited or canceled, or Shares are not delivered because an Award is paid or settled in cash, such Shares shall not be deemed to have been delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under this Plan and such Shares may again be issued under the Plan. 
(iii) In the event that Shares issued as an Award under the Plan are forfeited or reacquired by the Company pursuant to rights reserved upon issuance thereof, such forfeited or reacquired Shares will again be available for issuance as Awards under the Plan. In addition, Shares delivered or withheld in satisfaction of tax obligations with respect to Awards other than stock options and SARs will again be available for issuance as Awards under the Plan. 
(iv) The following Shares may not again be made available for issuance as Awards under the Plan: (1) Shares delivered or withheld in payment of the exercise price of an Option, (2) Shares delivered or withheld in satisfaction of tax obligations with respect to Options or SARs, and (3) Shares repurchased on the open market with the proceeds of the exercise price of an Option. 
(v) With respect to SARs, if the SAR is payable in Shares, all Shares to which the SARs relate are counted against the Plan limits, rather than the net number of Shares delivered upon exercise of the SAR. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019 Proxy Statement     A-1   
[END TABLE]
(vi) Any Share that again becomes available for grant under the Plan shall be added back to the total number of Shares available for grant under the Plan as one (1) Share if such Share was subject to an Option or SAR, and as two (2) Shares if such share was subject to an Award other than an Option or SAR. 
(c) Limitations on Awards. Subject to adjustments as provided in Section 12, the following additional limitations are imposed under the Plan: 
(i) The maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon exercise of Options intended to qualify as ISOs under Section 422 of the Code shall be the maximum number of shares reserved for issuance under Section 3(a). 
(ii) The following limits will apply to Awards of the specified type granted to any one Participant in any single fiscal year: 
(1) Appreciation Awards (Options and SARs): 500,000 Shares; and 
(2) Full Value Awards (Restricted Shares, Restricted Share Units, Unrestricted Shares and Performance Units that are denominated in Shares): 500,000 Shares. 
In applying the foregoing limits, (a) all Awards of the specified type granted to the same Participant in the same fiscal year will be aggregated and made subject to one limit; (b) the limits applicable to Options and SARS refer to the number of Shares subject to the Award; (c) the Share limit under clause (2) refers to the maximum number of Shares that may be delivered under an Award or Awards of the type specified in clause (2) assuming the maximum payout; and (d) each of the specified limits in clauses (1) and (2) is multiplied by two (2) for Awards granted to a Participant in the year employment commences. 
(iii) Participants who are granted Options and SARs will be required to continue to provide services to the Company (or an Affiliate) for not less than one-year following the date of grant in order for any such Option or SAR to fully or partially vest or be exercisable (other than in case of death, Disability or a Change in Control). Notwithstanding the foregoing, up to five percent of the available shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan pursuant to Section 3(a) may provide for vesting of Options and SARs, partially or in full, in less than one-year. 
(iv) The maximum number of Shares subject to Awards granted during a single fiscal year to any non-management director, taken together with any cash fees paid to such non-management director during the fiscal year, shall not exceed $400,000 in total value (calculating the value of any such Awards based on the grant date fair value of such Awards for financial reporting purposes). This limit shall not apply to the non-executive Chairman of the Board, whose compensation will be approved by the other independent directors on the Board with the non-executive Chairman of the Board abstaining. 
(d) Type of Shares. Shares issued under the Plan may be authorized and unissued Shares. 
4. Administration. 
(a) General. The Committee shall administer the Plan in accordance with its terms, provided that the Board may act in lieu of the Committee on any matter. The Committee shall hold meetings at such times and places as it may determine and shall make such rules and regulations for the conduct of its business as it deems advisable. In the absence of a duly-appointed Committee or if the Board otherwise chooses to act in lieu of the Committee, the Board shall function as the Committee for all purposes of the Plan. 
(b) Committee Compositioni) . The Board shall appoint the members of the Committee. If and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Committee may authorize one or more Reporting Persons (or other officers) to make Awards to Eligible Persons who are not Reporting Persons (or other officers whom the Committee has specifically authorized to make Awards). The Board has sole discretion, at any time, to appoint additional members to the Committee, to remove and replace members of the Committee for any reason, and to fill vacancies on the Committee however caused. 
(c) Powers of the Committee. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have the authority, in its sole discretion: 
(i) to determine Eligible Persons to whom Awards shall be granted from time to time and the number of Shares, units, or SARs to be covered by each Award; 
(ii) to determine, from time to time, the Fair Market Value of Shares; 
(iii) to determine, and to set forth in Award Agreements, the terms and conditions of all Awards, including any applicable exercise or purchase price, the installments and conditions under which an Award shall become vested 
[BEGIN TABLE]
A-2           2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
 (which may be based on performance), terminated, expired, cancelled, or replaced, and the circumstances for vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and other restrictions and limitations; 
(iv) to approve the forms of Award Agreements and all other documents, notices, and certificates in connection therewith, which need not be identical either as to type of Award or among Participants; 
(v) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and any Award Agreement, to determine the meaning of their terms, and to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and procedures relating to the Plan and its administration; 
(vi) in order to fulfill the purposes of the Plan and without amending the Plan, modify, cancel, or waive the Company's rights with respect to any Awards (including the time or manner of vesting), to adjust or to modify Award Agreements for changes in Applicable Law, and to recognize differences in foreign law, tax policies, or customs; and 
(vii) to make all other interpretations and to take all other actions that the Committee may consider necessary or advisable to administer the Plan or to effectuate its purposes. 
(d) Delegation of Authority. Subject to Applicable Law and the restrictions set forth in the Plan, the Committee may delegate administrative functions to individuals who are Reporting Persons, officers, or Employees of the Company or its Affiliates. With respect to Participants not subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the Committee may delegate to appropriate officers of the Company its authority to designate Participants, to determine the size and type of Awards to be received by those Participants and to set and modify the terms of such Awards; provided, however, that all such Awards shall comply with the terms of this Plan. Any actions taken by the delegee shall be treated as actions by the Committee. 
(e) Deference to Committee Determinations. The Committee shall have the sole discretion to interpret or construe ambiguous, unclear, or implied (but omitted) terms in any fashion it deems to be appropriate, and to make any findings of fact needed in the administration of the Plan or Award Agreements. The Committee's prior exercise of its discretionary authority shall not obligate it to exercise its authority in a like fashion thereafter. The Committee's interpretation and construction of any provision of the Plan, or of any Award or Award Agreement, shall be final, binding, and conclusive. The validity of any such interpretation, construction, decision, or finding of fact shall not be given de novo review if challenged in court, by arbitration, or in any other forum, and shall be upheld unless clearly arbitrary or capricious. 
(f) No Liability; Indemnification. Neither the Board nor any Committee member, nor any Person acting at the direction of the Board or the Committee, shall be liable for any act, omission, interpretation, construction, or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan, any Award, or any Award Agreement. The Company and its Affiliates shall pay or reimburse any member of the Committee, as well as any Director, Employee, or Consultant who takes action in connection with the Plan, for all expenses incurred with respect to the Plan, and to the full extent allowable under Applicable Law shall indemnify each and every one of them for any claims, liabilities, and costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising out of their good faith performance of duties under the Plan. The Company and its Affiliates may obtain liability insurance for this purpose. 
5. Eligibility. 
(a) General Rule. The Committee may grant ISOs only to Employees (including officers who are Employees) of the Company or an Affiliate that is a "parent corporation" or "subsidiary corporation" within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code, and may grant all other Awards to any Eligible Person. A Participant who has been granted an Award may be granted an additional Award or Awards if the Committee shall so determine, if such Participant is otherwise an Eligible Person and if otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Plan. 
(b) Grant of Awards. Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall determine from the class of Eligible Persons those individuals to whom Awards under the Plan may be granted, the number of Shares subject to each Award, the price (if any) to be paid for the Shares or the Award and, in the case of Awards subject to performance conditions, the specific objectives, goals and performance criteria that further define the Award. Each Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement signed by the Company and, if required by the Committee, by the Participant. The Award Agreement shall set forth the material terms and conditions of the Award established by the Committee. 
(c) Replacement Awards. Subject to Applicable Laws (including any associated shareholder approval requirements), the Committee may, in its sole discretion and upon such terms as it deems appropriate, require as a condition of the grant of an Award to a Participant that the Participant surrender for cancellation some or all of the Awards that have previously been granted to the Participant under this Plan or otherwise. An Award that is conditioned upon such surrender may or may not be the same type of Award, may cover the same (or a lesser or greater) number of Shares as such surrendered 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019 Proxy Statement     A-3   
[END TABLE]
 Award, may have other terms that are determined without regard to the terms or conditions of such surrendered Award, and may contain any other terms that the Committee deems appropriate. In the case of Options and SARs, these other terms may not involve an exercise price that is lower than the exercise price of the surrendered Option or SAR (as was determined under Section 6(e) or 7(b), respectively) unless approved by the Company's shareholders. 
6. Option Awards. 
(a) Types; Documentation. The Committee may in its discretion grant ISOs to any Employee and Nonqualified Stock Options to any Eligible Person, and shall evidence any such grants in an Award Agreement that is delivered to the Participant. Each Option shall be designated in the Award Agreement as an ISO or a Nonqualified Stock Option, and the same Award Agreement may grant both types of Options. Options granted under the Plan may contain such terms and provisions not inconsistent with the Plan that the Committee shall deem advisable in its sole and absolute discretion. 
(b) ISO $100,000 Limitation. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares with respect to which Options designated as ISOs first become exercisable by a Participant in any calendar year (under this Plan and any other plan of the Company or any Affiliate) exceeds $100,000, such excess Options shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options. For purposes of determining whether the $100,000 limit is exceeded, the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to an ISO shall be determined as of the Grant Date. In reducing the number of Options treated as ISOs to meet the $100,000 limit, the most recently granted Options shall be reduced first. In the event that Section 422 of the Code is amended to alter the limitation set forth therein, the limitation of this Section 6(b) shall be automatically adjusted accordingly. 
(c) Minimum Vesting Requirements. Options granted under this Section 6 shall be subject to the vesting requirement set forth in Section 3(c)(iii). 
(d) Term of Options. Each Award Agreement shall specify a term at the end of which the Option automatically expires, subject to earlier termination provisions contained in Section 6(f)(ii) hereof, provided, that, the term of any Option may not exceed ten years from the Grant Date. In the case of an ISO granted to an Employee who is a Ten Percent Holder on the Grant Date, the term of the ISO shall not exceed five years from the Grant Date. 
(e) Exercise of Option. 
(i) Exercise Price. The exercise price of an Option shall be determined by the Committee in its discretion and shall be set forth in the Award Agreement, provided that (1) if an ISO is granted to an Employee who on the Grant Date is a Ten Percent Holder, the per Share exercise price shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Grant Date, and (2) for all other Options, such per Share exercise price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Grant Date, except as set forth in Section 15(b) in the case of an Option granted in assumption of or substitution for an outstanding award of a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines. 
(ii) Terms and Conditions. The Committee shall in its sole discretion determine the times, circumstances, and conditions under which an Option shall be exercisable, and shall set them forth in the Award Agreement. The Committee shall have the discretion to determine whether and to what extent the vesting of Options shall be tolled during any unpaid leave of absence; provided, however, that in the absence of such determination, vesting of Options shall be tolled during any such leave approved by the Company. 
(iii) Minimum Exercise Requirements. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share. The Committee may require in an Award Agreement that an Option be exercised as to a minimum number of Shares, provided that such requirement shall not prevent a Participant from purchasing the full number of Shares as to which the Option is then exercisable. 
(iv) Methods of Exercise. Prior to its expiration pursuant to the terms of the applicable Award Agreement, each Option may be exercised, in whole or in part (provided that the Company shall not be required to issue fractional shares), by delivery of notice of exercise to the Company or its delegee, in such form as the Company shall determine, which notice shall be accompanied by the full exercise price of the Shares being purchased. In the case of an ISO, the Committee shall determine the acceptable methods of payment on the Grant Date and it shall be included in the applicable Award Agreement. The methods of payment that the Committee may in its discretion accept or commit to accept in an Award Agreement include: 
(1) cash or check payable to the Company (in U.S. dollars); 
(2) other Shares that (A) are owned by the Participant who is purchasing Shares pursuant to an Option, (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which the Option 
[BEGIN TABLE]
A-4           2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
 is being exercised, (C) are all, at the time of such surrender, free and clear of any and all claims, pledges, liens and encumbrances, or any restrictions which would in any manner restrict the transfer of such shares to or by the Company (other than such restrictions as may have existed prior to an issuance of such Shares by the Company to such Participant), and (D) the certificates of which are duly endorsed for transfer to the Company or attestation of ownership and transfer to the Company is effected to the Company's satisfaction; 
(3) a cashless exercise program pursuant to which a Participant may concurrently provide irrevocable instructions (A) to such Participant's broker to effect the immediate sale of the purchased Shares and remit to the Company, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the exercise price of the Option plus all applicable taxes required to be withheld by the Company by reason of such exercise, and (B) to the Company to (upon receipt of payment from the broker) deliver the certificates for or electronic evidence of ownership of the purchased Shares directly to such broker in order to complete the sale; 
(4) if approved by the Committee, through a net exercise procedure whereby the Participant surrenders the Option in exchange for that number of Shares with an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the difference between the aggregate exercise price of the Option being surrendered and the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Option; 
(5) in such other manner as may be authorized from time to time by the Committee; or 
(6) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment. 
(v) Delivery of Shares. The Company shall not be required to deliver Shares pursuant to the exercise of an Option until payment of the full exercise price therefore is received by the Company. 
(f) Effect of Termination of Continuous Service. 
(i) The Committee may establish and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement the terms and conditions on which an Option shall remain exercisable, if at all, following termination of a Participant's Continuous Service. The Committee may waive or modify these provisions at any time. To the extent that a Participant is not entitled to exercise an Option at the date of his or her termination of Continuous Service, or if the Participant (or other Person entitled to exercise the Option) does not exercise the Option to the extent so entitled within the time specified in the Award Agreement or below (as applicable), the Option shall terminate and the Shares underlying the unexercised portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan and become available for future Awards. In no event may any Option be exercised after the expiration of the Option term as set forth in the Award Agreement. 
(ii) Unless otherwise provided in the Participant's Award Agreement, the following provisions shall apply when there is a termination of a Participant's Continuous Service. Notwithstanding the terms below, no Option may be exercised after the expiration of the Option term as set forth in the Award Agreement. 
(1) Termination other than Upon Disability or Death or for Cause. In the event of termination of a Participant's Continuous Service (other than as a result of Participant's death, Disability, Retirement or termination for Cause), the Participant shall have the right to exercise an Option at any time within 90 days following such termination to the extent the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option at the date of such termination. 
(2) Disability. In the event of termination of a Participant's Continuous Service as a result of his or her being Disabled, the Participant shall have the right to exercise an Option at any time within one year following such termination to the extent the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option at the date of such termination. 
(3) Retirement. In the event of termination of a Participant's Continuous Service as a result of Participant's Retirement, the Participant shall have the right to exercise the Option at any time within six months following such termination to the extent the Participant was entitled to exercise such Option at the date of such termination. 
(4) Death. In the event of the death of a Participant during the period of Continuous Service since the Grant Date of an Option, or within 30 days following termination of the Participant's Continuous Service, the Option may be exercised at any time within one year following the date of the Participant's death by the Participant's estate or by a Person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by bequest or inheritance, but only to the extent the right to exercise the Option had vested at the date of death or, if earlier, the date the Participant's Continuous Service terminated. 
(5) Cause. If the Committee determines that a Participant's Continuous Service terminated due to Cause, the Participant shall immediately forfeit the right to exercise any Option, and it shall be considered immediately null and void. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019 Proxy Statement     A-5   
[END TABLE]
(g) Reverse Vesting. The Committee in its sole and absolute discretion may allow a Participant to exercise unvested Options, in which case the Shares then issued shall be Restricted Shares having analogous vesting restrictions to the unvested Options. 
(h) No Dividend Equivalent Rights. Participants holding Options shall not be entitled to any dividend equivalent rights for any period of time prior to the exercise of the Option. 
7. Share Appreciation Rights (SARs). 
(a) Grants. The Committee may in its discretion grant Share Appreciation Rights (SARs) to any Eligible Person, in any of the following forms: 
(i) SARs related to Options. The Committee may grant SARs either concurrently with the grant of an Option or with respect to an outstanding Option, in which case the SAR shall extend to all or a portion of the Shares covered by the related Option. A SAR shall entitle the Option holder, upon exercise of the SAR and surrender of the related Option, or portion thereof, to the extent the SAR and related Option each were previously unexercised, to receive payment of an amount determined pursuant to Section 7(d) below. Any SAR granted in connection with an ISO will contain such terms as may be required to comply with the provisions of Section 422 of the Code. 
(ii) SARs Independent of Options. The Committee may grant SARs which are independent of any Option subject to such conditions as the Committee may in its discretion determine, which conditions will be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, SARs granted independent of any Options shall be subject to the vesting requirement set forth in Section 3(c)(iii). 
(iii) Limited SARs. The Committee may grant SARs exercisable only upon or in respect of a Change in Control or any other specified event, and such limited SARs may relate to or operate in tandem or combination with or substitution for Options or other SARs, or on a stand-alone basis, and may be payable in cash or Shares based on the spread between the exercise price of the SAR, and (1) a price based upon or equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares during a specified period, at a specified time within a specified period before, after or including the date of such event, or (2) a price related to consideration payable to the Company's shareholders generally in connection with the event. 
(b) Exercise Price. The per Share exercise price of a SAR shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, shall be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, and shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one Share, except as set forth in Section 14(b) in the case of a SAR granted in assumption of or substitution for an outstanding award of a company acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines. The exercise price of a SAR related to an Option shall be the same as the exercise price of the related Option. 
(c) Exercise of SARs. Unless the Award Agreement otherwise provides, a SAR related to an Option will be exercisable at such time or times, and to the extent, that the related Option will be exercisable. A SAR may not have a term exceeding ten years from its Grant Date. A SAR granted independently of any other Award will be exercisable pursuant to the terms of the Award Agreement. Whether a SAR is related to an Option or is granted independently, the SAR may only be exercised when the Fair Market Value of the Shares underlying the SAR exceeds the exercise price of the SAR. 
(d) Payment. 
(i) Upon exercise of a SAR related to an Option and the attendant surrender of an exercisable portion of any related Award, the Participant will be entitled to receive payment of an amount determined by multiplying— 
(1) the excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise of the SAR over the exercise price per Share of the SAR, by 
(2) the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR has been exercised. 
(ii) Notwithstanding Section 7(d)(i), a SAR granted independently of an Option: 
(1) may limit the amount payable to the Participant to a percentage, specified in the Award Agreement but not exceeding one hundred percent (100%), of the amount determined pursuant to Section 7(d)(i), and 
(2) shall be subject to any payment or other restrictions that the Committee may at any time impose in its discretion, including restrictions intended to conform the SARs with Section 409A of the Code. 
(e) Form and Terms of Payment. Subject to Applicable Law, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, settle the amount determined under Section 7(d) above solely in cash, solely in Shares (valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of the SAR), or partly in cash and partly in Shares. In any event, no fractional Shares shall be issued and the 
[BEGIN TABLE]
A-6           2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
 Committee shall determine whether cash shall be paid in lieu of any fractional Shares, or whether such fractional Shares and the rights thereto shall be cancelled or eliminated without payment therefor. Absent a contrary determination by the Committee, all SARs shall be settled in cash as soon as practicable after exercise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in an Award Agreement, determine the maximum amount of cash or Shares or combination thereof that may be delivered upon exercise of a SAR. 
(f) Effect of Termination of Continuous Service. The Committee shall establish and set forth in the applicable Award Agreement the terms and conditions on which a SAR shall remain exercisable, if at all, following termination of a Participant's Continuous Service. The provisions of Section 6(f)(ii) above shall apply to the extent an Award Agreement does not specify the terms and conditions upon which a SAR shall terminate when there is a termination of a Participant's Continuous Service. 
(g) No Dividend Equivalent Rights. Participants holding SARs shall not be entitled to any dividend equivalent rights for any period of time prior to the exercise of the SAR. 
8. Restricted Shares, Restricted Share Units, and Unrestricted Shares. 
(a) Grants. The Committee has the discretion to grant Awards of Restricted Shares, Restricted Share Units, and Unrestricted Shares under this Section 8. 
(i) The Committee may in its discretion grant restricted shares ("Restricted Shares") to any Eligible Person and shall evidence such grant in an Award Agreement that is delivered to the Participant and that sets forth the number of Restricted Shares, the purchase price for such Restricted Shares (if any), and the terms upon which the Restricted Shares may become vested. 
(ii) The Committee may in its discretion grant the right to receive Shares after certain vesting requirements are met ("Restricted Share Units") to any Eligible Person and shall evidence such grant in an Award Agreement that is delivered to the Participant which sets forth the number of Shares (or formula, that may be based on future performance or conditions, for determining the number of Shares) that the Participant shall be entitled to receive upon vesting and the terms upon which the Shares subject to a Restricted Share Unit may become vested. 
(iii) The Committee may condition any Award of Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units to a Participant on receiving from the Participant such further assurances and documents as the Committee may require to enforce the restrictions. 
(iv) Subject to the limit set forth in Section 3(c)(ii), the Committee may grant Awards hereunder in the form of unrestricted shares ("Unrestricted Shares"), which shall vest in full upon the date of grant or such other date as the Committee may determine or which the Committee may issue pursuant to any program under which one or more Eligible Persons (selected by the Committee in its discretion) elect to receive Unrestricted Shares in lieu of cash bonuses that would otherwise be paid. 
(b) Vesting and Forfeiture. 
(i) Award Agreements for Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units. The Committee shall set forth in an Award Agreement granting Restricted Shares or Restricted Share Units, the terms and conditions under which the Participant's interest in the Restricted Shares or the Shares subject to Restricted Share Units will become vested and non-forfeitable. 
(ii) Effect of Termination of Continuous Service. Except as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement or the Committee otherwise determines, upon termination of a Participant's Continuous Service for any other reason, the Participant shall forfeit his or her unvested Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Units; provided that if a Participant purchases the Restricted Shares and forfeits them for any reason, the Company shall return the purchase price to the Participant only if and to the extent set forth in an Award Agreement. 
(c) Issuance of Restricted Shares Prior to Vesting. The Company shall issue stock certificates that evidence Restricted Shares pending the lapse of applicable restrictions, and that bear a legend making appropriate reference to such restrictions. Alternatively, the Company may reflect such ownership and restrictions in electronic format. Except as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement or the Committee otherwise determines, the Company or a third party that the Company designates shall hold such Restricted Shares and any dividends that accrue with respect to Restricted Shares pursuant to Section 8(e) below. 
(d) Issuance of Shares upon Vesting. As soon as practicable after vesting of a Participant's Restricted Shares (or Shares underlying Restricted Share Units) and the Participant's satisfaction of applicable tax withholding requirements, the 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019 Proxy Statement     A-7   
[END TABLE]
 Company shall release to the Participant, free from the vesting restrictions, one Share for each vested Restricted Share (or issue one Share free of the vesting restriction for each vested Restricted Share Unit), unless an Award Agreement provides otherwise. No fractional shares shall be distributed, and cash shall be paid in lieu thereof. 
(e) Treatment of Dividends. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, whenever Shares are released to a Participant under Section 8(d) above pursuant to the vesting of Restricted Shares or the Shares underlying Restricted Share Units are issued to a Participant pursuant to Section 8(d) above, such Participant shall receive, with respect to each Share released or issued, an amount equal to any cash dividends (plus, in the discretion of the Committee, simple interest at a rate as the Committee may determine) and a number of Shares equal to any stock dividends, which were declared and paid to the holders of Shares between the Grant Date and the date such Share is released or issued. If the vesting of the Award is based upon the attainment of performance goals, any and all cash and stock dividends paid with respect to the Shares underlying the Award shall also be subject to the attainment of the performance goals. 
(f) Section 83(b) Elections. To the extent permitted by the Committee, a Participant may make an election under Section 83(b) of the Code (the "Section 83(b) Election") with respect to Restricted Shares. If a Participant who has received Restricted Share Units provides the Committee with written notice of his or her intention to make Section 83(b) Election with respect to the Shares subject to such Restricted Share Units, the Committee may in its discretion, if permitted by Section 409A of the Code, convert the Participant's Restricted Share Units into Restricted Shares, on a one-for-one basis, in full satisfaction of the Participant's Restricted Share Unit Award. The Participant may then make a Section 83(b) Election with respect to those Restricted Shares. 
9. Performance Units. 
Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 3(c)(ii), the Committee has discretion to grant Performance Units to any Eligible Person and shall evidence such grant in an Award Agreement that is delivered to the Participant which sets forth the terms and conditions of the Award. Performance Units shall vest based upon the attainment of performance goals as determined by the Committee. 
10. Taxes. 
(a) General. As a condition to the issuance or distribution of Shares pursuant to the Plan, the Participant (or in the case of the Participant's death, the person who succeeds to the Participant's rights) shall make such arrangements as the Company may require for the satisfaction of any applicable federal, state, local, or foreign withholding tax obligations that may arise in connection with the Award and the issuance of Shares. The Company shall not be required to issue any Shares until such obligations are satisfied. If the Committee allows the withholding or surrender of Shares to satisfy a Participant's tax withholding obligations, the Committee shall not allow Shares to be withheld in an amount that exceeds the minimum statutory withholding rates (or, if permitted by the Committee, such other rate as will not cause adverse accounting consequences and is permitted under applicable IRS withholding rules) for federal and state tax purposes, including payroll taxes. 
(b) Surrender of Shares. If permitted or required by the Committee, in its discretion, and in accordance with Section 10(a), a Participant may satisfy the applicable tax withholding and employment tax obligations associated with an Award by surrendering Shares to the Company (including Shares that would otherwise be issued pursuant to the Award) that have a Fair Market Value determined as of the applicable Tax Date equal to the amount required to be withheld. 
(c) Special Rules. In the case of (i) a Participant other than an Employee, (ii) an Employee where the next payroll payment is not sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations, with respect to any remaining tax obligations, (iii) a Participant who is an Executive Officer of the Company or a member of the Board, in the absence of any other arrangement and to the extent permitted under Applicable Law, the Participant shall be deemed to have elected to have the Company withhold from the Shares or cash to be issued pursuant to an Award that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value determined as of the applicable Tax Date (as defined below) or cash equal to the amount required to be withheld. For purposes of this Section 10, the Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined under the Applicable Law (the "Tax Date"). 
(d) Income Taxes. Participants are solely responsible and liable for the satisfaction of all taxes and penalties that may arise in connection with Awards (including any taxes arising under Section 409A of the Code), and the Company shall not have any obligation to indemnify or otherwise hold any Participant harmless from any or all of such taxes. 
(e) Section 409A of the Code. The Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code to the extent subject thereto, and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, the Plan shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance 
[BEGIN TABLE]
A-8           2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
 therewith. Any payments described in the Plan that are due within the "short-term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A of the Code shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless any Applicable Law requires otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, to the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to the Plan during the six (6) month period immediately following a Participant's termination of Continuous Service shall instead be paid on the first payroll date after the six-month anniversary of the Participant's separation from service (or the Participant's death, if earlier). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor the Committee shall have any obligation to take any action to prevent the assessment of any excise tax or penalty on any Participant under Section 409A of the Code and neither the Company nor the Committee will have any liability to any Participant for such tax or penalty. 
11. Non-Transferability of Awards. 
(a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 11, or as otherwise approved by the Committee, Awards may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution. The designation of a beneficiary by a Participant will not constitute a transfer. An Award may be exercised, during the lifetime of the holder of an Award, only by such holder, the duly-authorized legal representative of a Participant who is Disabled, or a transferee permitted by this Section 11. 
(b) Limited Transferability Rights. Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 11, the Committee may in its discretion provide in an Award Agreement that an Award other than an ISO may be transferred, on such terms and conditions as the Committee deems appropriate, either (i) by instrument to the Participant's "Immediate Family" (as defined below), (ii) by instrument to an inter vivos or testamentary trust (or other entity) in which the Award is to be passed to the Participant's designated beneficiaries, or (iii) by gift to charitable institutions. Any transferee of the Participant's rights shall succeed and be subject to all of the terms of this Award Agreement and the Plan. "Immediate Family" means any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, former spouse, sibling, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law,son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, and shall include adoptive relationships. 
12. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Merger, or Certain Other Transactions. 
(a) Changes in Capitalization. The Committee shall equitably adjust the number of Shares covered by each outstanding Award, all Share limitations contained herein and the number of Shares that have been authorized for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Awards have yet been granted or that have been returned to the Plan upon cancellation, forfeiture, or expiration of an Award, as well as the price per Share covered by each such outstanding Award, to reflect any increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock-split, reverse stock-split, spin-off, stock or extraordinary cash dividend, combination, consolidation, recapitalization or reclassification of the Shares, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company. In the event of any such transaction or event, the Committee may provide in substitution for any or all outstanding Awards under the Plan such alternative consideration (including securities of any surviving entity) as it may in good faith determine to be equitable under the circumstances and may require in connection therewith the surrender of all Awards so replaced. In any case, such substitution of securities shall not require the consent of any person who is granted Awards pursuant to the Plan. Except as expressly provided herein, or in an Award Agreement, if the Company issues for consideration shares of stock of any class or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, the issuance shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be required to be made with respect to the number or price of Shares subject to any award. 
(b) Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the dissolution or liquidation of the Company other than as part of a Change in Control, each Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such action, subject to the ability of the Committee to exercise any discretion authorized in the case of a Change in Control. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         2019 Proxy Statement     A-9   
[END TABLE]
(c) Change in Control. Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, Awards will automatically vest in full (and to the extent applicable, become exercisable) and any repurchase rights of the Company will automatically lapse upon a Change in Control of the Company. In addition, in the event of a Change in Control, the Committee may in its sole and absolute discretion and authority, without obtaining the approval or consent of the Company's shareholders or any Participant with respect to his or her outstanding Awards, take one or more of the following actions: 
(i) arrange for or otherwise provide that each outstanding Award shall be assumed or a substantially similar award shall be substituted by a successor corporation or a parent or subsidiary of such successor corporation (the "Successor Corporation"); 
(ii) require that all outstanding Options and Share Appreciation Rights be exercised on or before a specified date (before or after such Change in Control) fixed by the Committee, after which specified date all unexercised Options and Share Appreciation Rights shall terminate; 
(iii) arrange or otherwise provide for the payment of cash or other consideration to Participants representing the value of such Awards in exchange for the satisfaction and cancellation of outstanding Awards; provided, however, that the case of any Option or Share Appreciation Right with an exercise price that equals or exceeds the price paid for a Share in connection with the Change in Control, the Committee may cancel the Option or Share Appreciation Right without the payment of consideration therefor; or 
(iv) make such other modifications, adjustments or amendments to outstanding Awards or this Plan as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate, subject however to the terms of Section 14(a) below. 
(d) Certain Distributions. In the event of any distribution to the Company's shareholders of securities of any other entity or other assets (other than dividends payable in cash or stock of the Company) without receipt of consideration by the Company, the Committee may, in its discretion, appropriately adjust the price per Share covered by each outstanding Award to reflect the effect of such distribution. 
13. Time of Granting Awards. 
The date of grant ("Grant Date") of an Award shall be the date on which the Committee (or its delegee pursuant to Section 4(d)) makes the determination granting such Award or such other later date as is determined by the Committee, provided that in the case of an ISO, the Grant Date shall be the later of the date on which the Committee makes the determination granting such ISO or the date of commencement of the Participant's employment relationship with the Company. 
14. Modification of Awards and Substitution of Options or SARs. 
(a) Modification, Extension, and Renewal of Awards. Within the limitations of the Plan, the Committee may modify an Award to accelerate the rate at which an Option or SAR may be exercised (including without limitation permitting an Option or SAR to be exercised in full without regard to the installment or vesting provisions of the applicable Award Agreement or whether the Option or SAR is at the time exercisable, to the extent it has not previously been exercised), to accelerate the vesting of any Award, to extend or renew outstanding Awards in compliance with Section 409A, to the extent applicable, or to accept the cancellation of outstanding Awards to the extent not previously exercised. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, no modification of an outstanding Award shall materially and adversely affect such Participant's rights thereunder, unless either the Participant provides written consent or there is an express Plan provision permitting the Committee to act unilaterally to make the modification. 
(b) Substitution of Options. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions or limits under the Plan, in the event the Company or an Affiliate acquires (whether by purchase, merger, or otherwise) all or substantially all of outstanding capital stock or assets of another corporation or in the event of any reorganization or other transaction qualifying under Section 424 of the Code, the Committee may, in a manner satisfying the provisions of Section 424(a) of the Code, substitute Options or SARs for options or stock appreciation rights under the plan of the acquired company. 
(c) Limitations on Repricing. Except as permitted in Section 12(a) for a change in capitalization or Section 12(c) for a Change in Control, the terms of outstanding Awards may not be amended to reduce the exercise price of outstanding Options or SARs or cancel outstanding underwater Options or SARs in exchange for cash, other Awards, or Options or SARs with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Options or SARs without stockholder approval.

(ii) amend Section 14(c) to permit repricing of Options or SARs without the approval of shareholders; or 
(iii) materially impair, without the written consent of the Participant, an Award previously granted, except that the Company retains all of its rights under Section 12(c). 
(b) Committee's Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may amend the Plan to eliminate provisions which are no longer necessary as a result of changes in tax or securities laws or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof. 
17. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any agreement entered into by the Company pursuant to the Plan, the Company shall not be obligated, and shall have no liability for failure, to issue or deliver any Shares under the Plan unless such issuance or delivery would comply with Applicable Law, with such compliance determined by the Company in consultation with its legal counsel. 
18. Reservation of Shares. 
The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan. Neither the Company nor the Committee shall, without shareholder approval, allow for a repricing within the meaning of the federal securities laws applicable to proxy statement disclosures. 
19. Effective Date. 
This Plan shall become effective on the date of its approval by the shareholders of the Company. 
20. Controlling Law. 
All disputes relating to or arising from the Plan shall be governed by the internal substantive laws (and not the laws of conflicts of laws) of the State of Louisiana, to the extent not preempted by United States federal law. If any provision of this Plan is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue to be fully effective. 
21. Laws and Regulations. 
(a) U.S. Securities Laws. This Plan, the grant of Awards, the exercise of Options and SARs under this Plan, and the obligation of the Company to sell or deliver any of its securities (including, without limitation, Options, Restricted Shares, Restricted Share Units, and Shares) under this Plan shall be subject to all Applicable Laws. In the event that the Shares are not registered under the Securities Act, or any applicable state securities laws prior to the delivery of such Shares, the Company may require, as a condition to the issuance thereof, that the persons to whom Shares are to be issued represent and warrant in writing to the Company that such Shares are being acquired by him or her for investment for his or her own account and not with a view to, for resale in connection with, or with an intent of participating directly or indirectly in, any distribution of such Shares within the meaning of the Securities Act, and a legend to that effect may be placed on the certificates representing the Shares. 
(b) Other Jurisdictions. To facilitate the making of any grant of an Award under this Plan, the Committee may provide for such special terms for Awards to Participants who are foreign nationals or who are employed by the Company or any

 Affiliate outside of the United States of America as the Committee may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate differences in local law, tax policy or custom. The Company may adopt rules and procedures relating to the operation and administration of this Plan to accommodate the specific requirements of local laws and procedures of particular countries. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company is specifically authorized to adopt rules and procedures regarding the conversion of local currency, taxes, withholding procedures and handling of stock certificates which vary with the customs and requirements of particular countries. The Company may adopt sub-plans and establish escrow accounts and trusts as may be appropriate or applicable to particular locations and countries. 
22. No Shareholder Rights. 
Neither a Participant nor any transferee of a Participant shall have any rights as a shareholder of the Company with respect to any Shares underlying any Award until the date of issuance of a Share certificate or other evidence of Share ownership to a Participant or a transferee of a Participant for such Shares in accordance with the Company's governing instruments and Applicable Law. Prior to the issuance of Shares pursuant to an Award, a Participant shall not have the right to vote or to receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the Award, notwithstanding its exercise in the case of Options and SARs. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right that is determined based on a record date prior to the date the stock certificate or other evidence of ownership is issued, except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Plan. 
23. No Employment Rights. 
The Plan shall not confer upon any Participant any right to continue an employment, service or consulting relationship with the Company, nor shall it affect in any way a Participant's right or the Company's right to terminate the Participant's employment, service, or consulting relationship at any time, with or without Cause. 
24. Deferral. 
Payment of an Award may be deferred only if permitted in the Award Agreement. Any deferral arrangement shall comply with Section 409A of the Code.
