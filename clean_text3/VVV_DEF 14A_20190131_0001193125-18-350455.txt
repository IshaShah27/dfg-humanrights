Dear Valvoline Inc. Shareholder: 
On behalf of our Board of Directors and management, we cordially invite you to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Valvoline Inc. The meeting will be held on Thursday, January 31, 2019, at 8:00 a.m. (ET), at Valvoline's principal office, 100 Valvoline Way, Lexington, KY 40509. 
We are pleased to provide access to our proxy materials via the Internet under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's "notice and access" rules. As a result, we are mailing to most of our shareholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice") instead of a paper copy of this Proxy Statement, a proxy card and our 2018 Annual Report. The Notice contains instructions on how to access those documents over the Internet, as well as instructions on how to request a paper copy of our proxy materials. All shareholders who do not receive a Notice, including shareholders who have previously requested to receive paper copies of proxy materials, will receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail. We believe that this approach provides a convenient way for you to access our proxy materials and vote your shares, while reducing the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials and conserving natural resources. 
The attached Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement describe the business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, it is important that your shares be represented and voted at the meeting. We encourage you to promptly vote and submit your proxy via the Internet or by telephone using the instructions on the Notice, or, if you received paper copies of the proxy materials, you may also vote by following the instructions on the proxy card and signing and returning it in the pre-addressed postage-paid envelope provided for your convenience. If you attend the Annual Meeting, you can vote in person even if you previously submitted your proxy. 
We appreciate your continued confidence in Valvoline and look forward to seeing you at the meeting. 
Sincerely, 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
You are invited to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Valvoline Inc. ("Valvoline," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our") and vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement because you were a shareholder of record of Valvoline common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), as of the close of business on December 3, 2018 (the "Record Date"), the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. Valvoline is soliciting proxies for use at the Annual Meeting, including any postponements or adjournments. 
The Annual Meeting is being held at 8:00 a.m. (ET) on January 31, 2019, at Valvoline's principal office, 100 Valvoline Way, Lexington, KY 40509. 
If you received printed versions by mail, these printed proxy materials also include the proxy card or voting instruction form for the Annual Meeting. 
In accordance with rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we may furnish proxy materials, including this Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement, together with our 2018 Annual Report, by providing access to such documents on the Internet instead of mailing printed copies. Most shareholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless they have specifically requested them. Instead, a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice") will be mailed to shareholders starting on or around December 17, 2018. 
The Notice will provide you with instructions regarding how to view Valvoline's proxy materials for the Annual Meeting, including this Proxy Statement and the 2018 
 Annual Report, on the Internet. The Notice also instructs you on how you may submit your vote. If you would like to receive a paper or email copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials in the Notice. 
Each shareholder of record of Valvoline as of the Record Date is invited to attend the Annual Meeting, although seating is limited. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to bring valid photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport, and an account statement, proxy or letter from that nominee that confirms you are the beneficial owner of those shares as of the Record Date. 
Only shareholders of record of Valvoline as of the Record Date are entitled to receive the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and to vote their shares at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 188,164,687 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of Common Stock entitles the shareholder to one vote on each matter properly brought before the Annual Meeting. 
At our Annual Meeting, shareholders will consider and vote on the following matters: 
If you are a registered shareholder as of the Record Date, you can vote (i) by attending the Annual Meeting, (ii) by following the instructions on the proxy card for voting by telephone or Internet or (iii) by signing, dating and mailing in your proxy card. If you hold shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, that institution will instruct you as to how your shares may be voted by proxy, including whether telephone or Internet voting options are available. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee and would like to vote in person at the meeting, you must first obtain a proxy issued in your name from the institution that holds your shares. 
All shares represented by validly executed proxies will be voted at the Annual Meeting, and such shares will be voted in accordance with the instructions provided. If no voting specification is made on your returned proxy card, Samuel J. Mitchell, Jr. or Julie M. O' Daniel, as individuals named on the proxy card, will cast the votes represented by such proxy card (i) FOR the election of each of the eight director nominees, (ii) FOR the ratification of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year, (iii) FOR the non-binding advisory resolution approving our executive compensation, and (iv) FOR the approval of an amendment to the 2016 Valvoline Inc. Incentive Plan. 
If you are a participant in the Valvoline 401(k) Plan and are invested in the Valvoline Common Stock Fund within such plan as of the Record Date, you are entitled to instruct the trustee, Fidelity Management Trust Company, on how to vote any shares attributable to the units of Valvoline Common Stock credited to your account. The trustee will vote such shares as you instruct. To allow sufficient time for the trustee to vote, your voting instructions must be received by no later than 6:00 a.m. (ET) on January 29, 2019. If you do not provide instructions by that time, the shares attributable to the units of Valvoline Common Stock credited to your account will be voted by the trustee in the same proportion as it votes all the shares for which it has received timely voting instructions.
Your proxy card represents all shares of Common Stock that are registered in your name. If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive either a voting instruction form or a proxy card from your broker, bank or other nominee instructing you on how to vote your shares. 
Yes. You have the right to change or revoke your proxy (1) at any time before the Annual Meeting by (a) notifying our Corporate Secretary in writing, (b) returning a later-dated proxy card or (c) entering a later dated telephone or Internet vote; or (2) by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person, which will automatically cancel any proxy previously given, or by revoking your proxy in person, but attendance alone will not revoke any proxy that you have previously given. 
If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee to change your vote. 
A representative of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will serve as the inspector of election for the Annual Meeting. The inspector of election will determine whether a quorum is present and will tabulate the votes cast by proxy and in person. 
Yes. Your vote is confidential. 
As of the Record Date, 188,164,687 shares of Common Stock were outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. A majority of the shares issued and outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Annual Meeting must be present in person or by proxy to constitute a quorum to transact business at the Annual Meeting. If you vote in person, by telephone, over the Internet or by returning a properly executed proxy card, you will be considered a part of that quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes (i.e., when a broker does not have authority to vote on a specific issue) will be treated as present for the purpose of determining whether a quorum exists. 
If your shares are held by a broker, you must instruct the broker on how to vote your shares. If you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on any proposal for which the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is referred to as a "broker non-vote." Broker non-votes are counted as present in determining whether a quorum exists at the Annual Meeting, but will not be able to vote on those matters for which specific authorization is required under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). 
Under the NYSE rules, your broker has discretionary authority to vote your shares on the ratification of Valvoline's independent registered public accounting firm, even if your broker does not receive voting instructions from you. However, your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote on the election of Directors, the advisory vote on executive compensation, or the approval of an Amendment to the 2016 Valvoline Inc. Incentive Plan, without instructions from you. If you do not instruct your broker on these discretionary matters, a broker non-vote will occur and your shares will not be voted on these matters. 
The Company is making this proxy solicitation and will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to these proxy materials, the solicitation of proxies may be made in person, by telephone or by other electronic communication by our directors, officers and employees, who will not receive any additional compensation for such solicitation activities. We have also retained Georgeson LLC to assist in the solicitation for estimated fees of $10,500 plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. We may also reimburse brokers, banks, or other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners. 
Yes. This Proxy Statement and the 2018 Annual Report are available on our investor relations website at http://investors.valvoline.com/financial-reports/proxy, and at the SEC's website, http://www.sec.gov. 
Yes. If you wish to view Valvoline's future proxy materials and annual reports over the Internet instead of receiving copies in the mail, follow the instructions provided when you vote through the Internet. If you vote by telephone, by mail or in person, you will not have the option to elect electronic delivery while voting. If you elect electronic delivery, we will discontinue mailing our proxy materials and annual reports to you beginning next year and will instead send you an e-mail message notifying you of the Internet address or addresses where you may access such proxy materials and annual reports and vote your shares. 
We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. We will report the final results on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting. If final voting results are not available to us in time to file a Form 8-K with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting, we intend to file a Form 8-K to disclose preliminary voting results and, within four business days after the final results are known, we will file an amended Form 8-K with the SEC to disclose the final voting results. You can obtain a copy of the Form 8-K from our investor relations website at http://investors.valvoline.com/sec-filings or through the SEC's EDGAR system at http://www.sec.gov.

Proposal and Required Vote 
Our Board of Directors (the "Board") currently consists of the following eight members: Richard J. Freeland, Stephen F. Kirk, Carol H. Kruse, Stephen E. Macadam, Vada O. Manager, Samuel J. Mitchell, Jr., Charles M. Sonsteby and Mary J. Twinem. Other than Ms. Kruse, each member of the Board was elected at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Ms. Kruse was elected by the Board, effective December 4, 2018. Each of the current members of our Board has been nominated for election at the Annual Meeting. See the "Corporate Governance—Valvoline's Board of Directors" section of this Proxy Statement for further information about the structure, operations and roles of our Board. The Governance and Nominating Committee ("G&N Committee") of our Board has confirmed that all eight nominees will be available to serve as directors upon election and recommends their election. 
Directors are elected at each annual meeting of shareholders and hold office until the following annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. Pursuant to our Articles, a director nominee in an uncontested election must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast with respect to that director nominee in order to be elected to our Board. Therefore, to be elected at the Annual Meeting, a director nominee must receive more votes cast "for" his or her election than votes cast "against" his or her election. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast. Nominees elected at the Annual Meeting will serve until our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and will hold office until their successors are duly elected and qualified. 
Pursuant to the Board's resignation policy in our Corporate Governance Guidelines (published on our website at http://investors.valvoline.com/governance), any nominee who is serving as a director at the time of an uncontested election who fails to receive a greater number of votes "for" his or her election than votes "against" his or her election will tender his or her resignation for consideration by the Board no later than two weeks following the certification of the shareholder vote. The Board will decide, through a process managed by the G&N Committee, whether to accept the resignation within 90 days following the annual meeting of shareholders. The Company will then promptly disclose the Board's decision and reasons therefor. As a condition to his or her nomination, each person nominated by the G&N Committee must agree in advance to abide by the policy. Each of the current members of our Board has been nominated for election at the Annual Meeting and has agreed to abide by this policy. 
If no voting specification is made on a properly returned or voted proxy card, Samuel J. Mitchell, Jr. or Julie M. O'Daniel (as proxies named on the proxy card) will cast the votes represented by such proxy card FOR each of the eight nominees named in this Proxy Statement. Should any of the nominees be unable or unwilling to stand for election at the time of the Annual Meeting, the proxies may vote for a replacement nominee recommended by the Board, or the Board may reduce the number of directors to be elected at the Annual Meeting. 
Information Concerning Director Nominees 
The eight individuals nominated for election as directors at the Annual Meeting are Richard J. Freeland, Stephen F. Kirk, Carol H. Kruse, Stephen E. Macadam, Vada O. Manager, Samuel J. Mitchell, Jr., Charles M. Sonsteby and Mary J. Twinem. Each of these nominees is currently a member of our Board and has agreed to stand for election. Background information about each director nominee is set forth below, including information regarding the specific experiences, characteristics, attributes and skills considered in connection with the nomination of each director nominee, all of which the Board believes provide the Company with the perspective and judgment needed to guide, monitor and execute its strategies.

The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors (the "Audit Committee") reviews our accounting firm's qualifications, performance and independence in accordance with regulatory requirements and guidelines to determine whether to reappoint such firm as our independent registered public accounting firm. We refer to the fiscal years ending September 30, 2017, 2018 and 2019 as "fiscal 2017," "fiscal 2018," and "fiscal 2019," respectively. Based on its review, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP to audit Valvoline's Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting for fiscal 2019. See the "Corporate Governance—Valvoline's Board of Directors—Committees" section of this Proxy Statement for further information about the role and responsibilities of our Audit Committee. 
The following table presents the aggregate fees (including out-of-pocket costs) for professional services rendered by the member firms of Ernst & Young LLP and their respective affiliates (collectively, "EY") for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. The fees paid to EY shown in the table below were all pre-approved in accordance with Audit Committee procedures discussed in the "Audit Committee Matters" section of this Proxy Statement.

Our shareholders are being asked to ratify the appointment of EY as Valvoline's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019. The appointment of EY will be deemed ratified if the number of votes cast "for" ratification exceed the number of votes cast "against" it. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast "for" or "against" ratification. If our shareholders fail to ratify the appointment of EY, the Audit Committee may, but is not required to, reconsider the selection of such firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, direct the appointment of a different accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. 
The Company has been advised by EY that neither the firm, nor any covered person of the firm, has any financial interest, direct or indirect, in any capacity in Valvoline or its subsidiaries. 
One or more representatives of EY will be present at the Annual Meeting to respond to questions from shareholders and will be given the opportunity to make a statement. 
If no voting specification is made on a properly returned or voted proxy card, Samuel J. Mitchell, Jr. or Julie M. O'Daniel (as proxies named on the proxy card) will cast the votes represented by such proxy card FOR the ratification of EY as Valvoline's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019.

As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, under Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), we are seeking your vote, on a non-binding advisory basis, on the compensation of our named executive officers as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative disclosure, as provided in this Proxy Statement. Specifically, shareholders are being asked to vote upon, and the Board has approved and unanimously recommends, the following non-binding advisory resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Valvoline's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion is hereby APPROVED. 
The Board believes that our executive compensation program is well-designed, appropriately aligns executive pay with company performance and incentivizes desirable executive performance. This proposal gives you an opportunity to express your own view of our fiscal 2018 executive compensation practices. While the vote does not address any specific item of compensation and is not binding on the Board, the Board and its Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") value the opinions of our shareholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions. 
The advisory resolution approving our executive compensation shall be deemed approved if the number of votes cast "for" the resolution exceed the number of votes cast "against" the resolution. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast "for" or "against" the resolution. 
If no voting specification is made on a properly returned or voted proxy card, Samuel J. Mitchell, Jr. or Julie M. O'Daniel (as proxies named on the proxy card) will cast the votes represented by such proxy card FOR the approval of the resolution.

We are seeking your vote to approve an amendment to the 2016 Valvoline Inc. Incentive Plan (the "2016 Incentive Plan") to increase the number of shares of Valvoline Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan by an additional 10,000,000 shares. The proposed amendment to the 2016 Incentive Plan also: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• revises the fungible share ratio to 4-to-1 (from 4.5-to-1.0) for full value awards (restricted stock, restricted stock  units, performance stock units, recognition awards, incentive awards and dividend equivalents) granted on or after January 31, 2019. Under such provision, full value awards will reduce the shares authorized for issuance (the "share  reserve") under the 2016 Incentive Plan by four shares for every share awarded. Stock options and stock appreciation rights will continue to reduce the share reserve on a one-for-one basis;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provides that if an employee is terminated without cause within two years (increased from one year) after a change in  control, any outstanding equity award that is assumed, continued, converted or replaced in connection with the change in control will become fully vested upon such termination; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• revises an administrative provision regarding the determination of target incentive awards.  
[END TABLE]
The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders to approve this Proposal. The Board has approved the amendment of the 2016 Incentive Plan subject to shareholder approval and recommends that shareholders vote in favor of this Proposal at the Annual Meeting. 
Reasons for the Proposal 
Background 
The 2016 Incentive Plan was initially approved by the Board and the Company's sole shareholder (Ashland Global Holdings Inc.) on September 26, 2016. At the time, 7,000,000 shares of our Common Stock were reserved for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan. In November 2018, the Compensation Committee approved annual equity awards for fiscal 2019 for the Company's executive officers and other key employees, leaving 1,543,930 shares available for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan as of December 3, 2018, or based on the current 4.5-to-1.0 fungible share ratio, a maximum of 343,095 shares if the Company issues all remaining shares as full value awards. Based on the Company's annual share usage ("burn rate"), we do not expect to have sufficient shares to meet our anticipated equity compensation needs for fiscal 2020, which begins on October 1, 2019. 
Shares Available for Future Awards 
To meet our future equity compensation needs, the Board approved and adopted the amendment to the 2016 Incentive Plan on December 5, 2018, subject to approval by our shareholders at the Annual Meeting, and the amendment will become effective upon receiving shareholder approval at the Annual Meeting. By reserving an additional 10,000,000 shares for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan, a total of 11,543,930 shares of our Common Stock will be available for future issuance, or a maximum of 2,885,982 shares if the Company issues solely full value awards utilizing the amended 4-to-1 fungible share ratio. We expect that the shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan will meet the Company's equity compensation needs for approximately three to four years. 
The 10,000,000 additional shares approved for issuance by the Board represents approximately 5.3% of the total number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding as of December 3, 2018. Our Common Stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol "VVV." On December 3, 2018, the closing price of our Common Stock on the NYSE was $21.14 per share. 
Reasons for Voting for the Proposal 
Our Board recommends that our shareholders approve the amendment to the 2016 Incentive Plan. As noted above, absent an increase in the share reserve, we do not expect to have sufficient shares to meet our anticipated equity compensation needs for fiscal 2020. As discussed in the "Compensation Discussion & Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement, we rely on equity compensation to attract, retain and motivate key employees, link compensation with key business objectives and share price, and align interests with shareholders. Approval of the amendment to the 2016 Incentive Plan would further these objectives by allowing us to continue to grant equity awards to key employees. In addition, approval of the amendment provides participants with accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards in the event they are terminated without cause within the two-year period (versus the current one-year period) following a change in control. Based on a review of the competitive market, including the Company's peer group, the Board approved this provision to provide additional security to participants related to change in control uncertainties. If shareholders do not approve the amendment to the 2016 Incentive Plan, our ability to attract, retain and motivate the key employees we need to compete in our industry could be seriously harmed and negatively impact our long-term success. 
In determining the number of additional shares to reserve for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan, our Board considered the number of shares available for future awards, the burn rate, the potential dilution resulting from the proposed increase, the shareholder value transfer resulting from the proposed increase, equity plan guidelines established by certain proxy advisory firms and advice provided by Deloitte, the compensation consultant to the Compensation Committee. 
Burn Rate 
A key equity metric utilized by the Compensation Committee in determining awards under the 2016 Incentive Plan is our "burn rate," which is generally the total number of shares we award pursuant to the 2016 Incentive Plan each year relative to our weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. As noted above, our Board considered our burn rate in determining the number of additional shares to reserve for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan. The following table shows our use of equity under the 2016 Incentive Plan during the last two fiscal years (awards granted in fiscal 2016 were granted pursuant to the Ashland equity plans):

2016 Incentive Plan Combines Compensation and Corporate Governance Best Practices 
The 2016 Incentive Plan includes provisions that are designed to protect our shareholders' interests and to reflect corporate governance best practices including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Administration.    The 2016 Incentive Plan is administered by the  Compensation Committee, which consists entirely of independent, non-employee directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Fungible Share Ratio.    Full value awards reduce the share reserve  more heavily than stock options and stock appreciation rights. As noted above, full value awards reduce the share reserve on a 4.5-to-1.0 basis (decreasing to 4-to-1 if the proposed amendment is approved by our shareholders) and stock options and  stock appreciation rights reduce the share reserve on a 1-to-1 basis.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Liberal Share Counting or Recycling.    The share reserve shall  not be increased by (i) any shares of Common Stock tendered to us for payment of a stock option's exercise price; (ii) any shares of Common Stock withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with an award; or (iii) any shares  of Common Stock repurchased by the Company with stock option proceeds.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Evergreen Provision.    The 2016 Incentive Plan does not provide  for an automatic annual increase to the share reserve (i.e., an "evergreen" provision), but instead reserves a fixed number of shares of our Common Stock for issuance. Shareholder approval is required to increase the share reserve.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Minimum Vesting for Equity Awards.    The 2016 Incentive Plan  provides that no portion of a stock option or stock appreciation right award may vest before the one-year anniversary of the grant date. The 2016 Incentive Plan further provides that the minimum restricted period is one year for performance stock  units and three years for restricted stock and restricted stock units, subject to a five percent carve-out, as discussed below.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Repricing.    The 2016 Incentive Plan prohibits the repricing,  cash-out or other exchange of underwater stock options and stock appreciation rights without prior shareholder approval.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Discounted Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights.    All  stock options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2016 Incentive Plan must have an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of our Common Stock on the grant date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Liberal Change in Control Provisions.    The 2016 Incentive Plan  generally prohibits "single trigger" accelerated vesting of outstanding awards in connection with a change in control unless such awards are not assumed, continued, converted or replaced. If awards are assumed, continued, converted or  replaced, the 2016 Incentive Plan permits accelerated vesting only if the employee is terminated without cause within the one-year period following the change in control (increased to the two-year period, if the amendment to the 2016 Incentive Plan  is approved). In addition, the definition of change in control requires the actual consummation of a transaction.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Awards subject to forfeiture/clawback.    Awards granted under the  2016 Incentive Plan are subject to forfeiture/recovery in accordance with the Company's clawback policy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Tax Gross-ups.    The 2016 Incentive Plan does not provide for  any tax gross-ups.  
[END TABLE]
Summary of Material Terms of the 2016 Incentive Plan 
A summary of the material terms of the 2016 Incentive Plan, as proposed to be amended, is set forth below. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2016 Incentive Plan, as proposed to be amended, which is filed with this Proxy Statement as Appendix A. 
Authorized Shares 
Subject to adjustment as provided in the 2016 Incentive Plan, a total of 7,000,000 shares of our Common Stock were initially reserved for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan. Of such amount, 1,543,930 shares remained available for issuance as of December 3, 2018. If the amendment to the 2016 Incentive Plan is approved, an additional 10,000,000 shares of our Common Stock will be reserved for issuance for an aggregate of 11,543,930 shares of our Common Stock available for future issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan. In the event of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, combination, or exchange of shares, split-up, split-off, stock distribution, liquidation or other similar change in capitalization, or any distribution to common shareholders other than normal cash dividends, an automatic adjustment will be made in the number or kind of shares reserved for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan, the number or kind of shares subject to any outstanding award and the price per share and performance goals applicable to any outstanding award, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, in order to maintain the proportionate interest of the participants before and after the event. 
Any shares of Common Stock issued or delivered under the 2016 Incentive Plan pursuant to restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, recognition awards, incentive awards, performance stock units and dividend equivalents (collectively, "Full Value Awards") reduce the shares authorized for issuance on a 4.5-to-1.0 basis. If the amendment to the 2016 Incentive Plan is approved, any shares of Common Stock issued or delivered under the 2016 Incentive Plan pursuant to Full Value Awards on or after January 31, 2019 will reduce the shares authorized for issuance on a 4-to-1 basis. Stock options and stock appreciation rights reduce the shares authorized for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan on a one-for-one basis. 
Plan Administration 
Our Compensation Committee will administer the 2016 Incentive Plan, and will have full and exclusive authority to interpret the terms of the 2016 Incentive Plan and select the participants; determine the type, size and terms of the awards to be made to each participant; determine the time when awards will be granted; prescribe the form of agreement for awards; establish, amend and rescind rules and regulations related to the 2016 Incentive Plan; provide for accelerated vesting of any outstanding awards; make any determinations which it believes are necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2016 Incentive Plan; and correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the 2016 Incentive Plan or in any award. 
Eligibility 
Non-employee directors, officers and employees of Valvoline are eligible to be granted awards under the 2016 Incentive Plan. 
Approximately 6,700 employees are eligible to receive awards under the 2016 Incentive Plan, including all of Valvoline's executive officers. There are seven non-employee directors eligible to receive awards under the 2016 Incentive Plan. As of September 30, 2018, equity awards under the 2016 Incentive Plan were held by a total of 2,194 current and former employees and non-employee directors. 
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit ("RSU") Awards 
Participants in the 2016 Incentive Plan may receive one or more restricted stock awards or RSU awards as the Compensation Committee may from time to time determine. Except as otherwise provided in an award agreement (or other agreement), upon a termination of employment or pursuant to a change in control, a restricted stock award or RSU award will have a minimum restricted period of (i) one year in the case of restrictions that lapse based on the achievement of performance goals; and (ii) three years in the case of restrictions that lapse based solely on the passage of time, which period may, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, lapse on a pro-rated, graded, or cliff basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the Compensation Committee's sole discretion, no more than 5% of the shares of Common Stock available for issuance as restricted stock awards or pursuant to RSU awards may have a restricted period of less than three years. 
Participants will be entitled to all rights incident to ownership of Common Stock with respect to his or her restricted stock, including, but not limited to, the right to vote such shares of restricted stock and to receive dividends thereon when, as and if paid, in cash, shares of restricted stock or dividend equivalents, as set forth in the applicable award agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee, in its discretion. Participants will not have any rights as a shareholder with respect to the shares of Common Stock subject to RSU awards until such time, if any, that shares of Common Stock are delivered to a participant pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement. Participants with RSU awards will have such rights, if any, to dividend equivalents as are set forth in the applicable award agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee, in its discretion. Payment of vested RSUs (and dividend equivalents, if applicable) may be made in one or more installments and may be made wholly in cash, wholly in shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
Except as otherwise provided in the award agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee, in the event that a restricted stock award or RSU award has been made to a participant whose employment or service as a director is subsequently terminated for any reason prior to the lapse of all restrictions thereon, such award will be forfeited in its entirety by such participant. 
Incentive Awards 
Any participant may receive one or more incentive awards, as the Compensation Committee may from time to time determine. The target incentive award will be a fixed percentage of a participant's base salary paid during the year (or such other amount as determined by the Compensation Committee, if the amendment to the 2016 Incentive Plan if approved). Payments may be made in one or more installments and may be made in cash, shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement (or other agreement) or determined and directed by the Compensation Committee, an incentive award will terminate if the participant does not remain continuously employed and in good standing with Valvoline or any of its subsidiaries until the last business day of the month immediately preceding the month in which such incentive award is otherwise payable. Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement (or other agreement) or determined and directed by the Compensation Committee, in the event a participant's employment is terminated because of death, disability, retirement, or other employment termination event determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, the participant (or his or her beneficiaries or estate) will receive the prorated portion of the payment of an incentive award for which the participant would have otherwise been eligible based upon the portion of the performance period during which he or she was so employed so long as the performance goals are subsequently achieved. 
Performance Stock Unit ("PSUs") Awards 
Any participant may receive one or more PSU awards, as the Compensation Committee may from time to time determine. Each PSU award will be established in dollars or shares of Common Stock, or a combination of both, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The amount of payment with respect to PSU awards will be determined by the Compensation Committee and will be based on the original amount of such PSU award (including any dividend equivalents with respect thereto) adjusted to reflect the attainment of the performance goals during the performance period. Payment may be made in one or more installments and may be made wholly in cash, wholly in shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement (or other agreement) or determined and directed by the Compensation Committee, a PSU award (including any dividend equivalents with respect thereto) will terminate for all purposes if the participant does not remain continuously employed and in good standing with Valvoline or any of its subsidiaries until the last business day of the month immediately preceding the month in which such PSU award is otherwise payable. Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement (or other agreement) or determined and directed by the Compensation Committee, a participant (or his or her beneficiaries or estate) whose employment was terminated because of death, disability, retirement or other employment termination event determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee will receive a prorated portion of the payment of his or her PSU award (including any dividend equivalents with respect thereto) based upon the portion of the performance period during which he or she was so employed so long as the performance goals are subsequently achieved. 
Recognition Awards 
Any participant may receive a recognition award of shares of Common Stock for such reasons and in such amounts as the Compensation Committee may from time to time determine. 
Option and SAR Awards 
Any participant may receive one or more option or SAR awards, as the Compensation Committee may from time to time determine. Any option may be granted as an incentive stock option ("ISO") or as a nonqualified stock option (or "NQSO") as designated by the Compensation Committee at the time of the grant of such option; provided that only employees of Valvoline and its subsidiaries may be granted ISOs. Every ISO will provide for a fixed expiration date of not later than ten years from the date such ISO is granted. Every NQSO and SAR will provide for a fixed expiration date of not later than ten years and one month from the date such NQSO or SAR is granted. 
The exercise price of Common Stock issued pursuant to each option or SAR will be fixed by the Compensation Committee at the time of the grant and may in no event ever be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date such award is granted, subject to adjustment upon changes in capitalization. The Compensation Committee may provide for options or SARs granted to be exercisable in whole or in part. 
Except as otherwise provided in the 2016 Incentive Plan, the exercise price for the Common Stock subject to an option must be paid in full when the option is exercised. Subject to such rules as the Compensation Committee may impose, the exercise price may be paid in whole or in part: (i) in cash; (ii) by tendering (either by actual delivery or attestation) unencumbered shares of Common Stock previously acquired by the participant exercising such option having an aggregate fair market value at the time of exercise equal to the total exercise price; (iii) by a combination of such methods of payment; or (iv) by such other consideration as will constitute lawful consideration for the issuance of Common Stock and approved by the Compensation Committee (including, without limitation, effecting a cashless exercise of the option with a broker) or by having Valvoline withhold shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to the exercise of the option. 
A SAR will entitle the participant, upon exercise, to surrender the SAR and receive in exchange therefore an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the fair market value of a share of Common Stock at the time the SAR is exercised over (y) the exercise price specified in such SAR, (ii) multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock covered by such SAR, or portion thereof, which is so surrendered. Such amount will be paid to the participant in shares of Common Stock the number of which will be determined by dividing such amount by the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time of exercise; provided that the exercise of any SAR may be settled wholly in cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock as set forth in the award agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement (or other agreement) or determined by the Compensation Committee, options and SARs granted under the 2016 Incentive Plan will not be exercisable prior to the first anniversary of the date of grant, or, in the case of options and SARs granted to non-employee directors, the next annual meeting of shareholders immediately following the date of grant if earlier than the first anniversary of grant. Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement (or other agreement) or determined by the Compensation Committee, a participant (or his or her beneficiaries or estate) whose employment or service was terminated because of death, disability, retirement or other termination event determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee will be entitled to exercise options or SARs exercisable at the time of such termination until the original expiration date set forth in the award agreement. In the event of other terminations of employment, vested options will be exercisable by the participant until the earlier of 90 days following such termination and the original expiration date set forth in the award agreement. 
Performance Goals 
When granting PSUs or incentive awards, the Compensation Committee may base the relevant performance goals on one or more of the following criteria: (i) earnings measures, including net earnings on either a LIFO, FIFO or other basis and including earnings, earnings before interest, earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (ii) operating measures, including operating income, operating earnings, or operating margin; (iii) income or loss measures, including net income or net loss, and economic profit; (iv) cash flow measures, including cash flow or free cash flow; (v) revenue measures; (vi) reductions in expense measures; (vii) operating and maintenance, cost management, and employee productivity measures; (viii) company return measures, including return on assets, investments, equity, or sales; (ix) share price (including attainment of a specified per-share price during the performance period, growth measures, total return to shareholders or attainment of a specified price per share for a specified period of time); (x) strategic business criteria, consisting of one or more objectives based on meeting specified revenue, market share, market penetration, business expansion targets, project milestones, production volume levels, or cost targets; (xi) accomplishment of, or goals related to, mergers, acquisitions, dispositions, public offerings, or similar extraordinary business transactions; (xii) achievement of business or operational goals such as market share, business development and/or customer objectives, and debt ratings; or (xiii) growth or rate of growth of any of the performance criteria set forth herein. The performance goals may be absolute in their terms or measured against or in relation to other companies comparably or otherwise situated. The performance goals may be relative to stock market indices or such other published or special indices as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate and/or may be based on the performance of the Company generally or one or more of its subsidiaries, divisions, departments, units, functions, partnerships, joint ventures or minority investments, product lines or products and/or the performance of the individual participant. 
Change in Control 
Unless the award agreement (or other agreement) specifies otherwise, awards may be assumed or replaced by the surviving entity in connection with a change in control of Valvoline as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion prior to the change in control and without the consent of the participant. In the event an award is assumed or replaced, it will continue to vest following the change in control in accordance with its terms subject to the participant's continued employment or service. In the event the participant's employment or service is terminated without cause (as defined in the 2016 Incentive Plan) within the one-year period (increased to the two-year period, if the amendment to the 2016 Incentive Plan is approved) immediately following the change in control, any portion of the award that is unvested as of the date of such termination will immediately vest and become free of all restrictions. In the event the surviving entity does not assume or replace outstanding awards in connection with a change in control, all such awards will immediately vest and become free of all other restrictions as of the date of the change in control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless another agreement provides otherwise, the Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide that, prior to a change in control, any outstanding award will be, as of the change in control, canceled in exchange for a cash payment equal to the fair market value of a share of Common Stock subject to the award, less any applicable exercise price, which cash payment may be zero. 
For purposes of the 2016 Incentive Plan, change in control is generally defined to mean (i) the consummation of a merger of Valvoline in which immediately thereafter the shareholders of Valvoline own less than 50% of the combined voting power of the surviving entity, (ii) the consummation of a sale of 80% or more of the total assets of Valvoline, (iii) the shareholders of Valvoline approve a plan of liquidation or dissolution of Valvoline, (iv) any person acquires securities of Valvoline representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of Valvoline, without the approval of our Board of Directors, or (v) at any time during a period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the board of directors of Valvoline cease for any reason to constitute a majority thereof, unless such directors were approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the incumbent directors. 
Repricing Prohibited 
The 2016 Incentive Plan prohibits the cash-out or repricing of "underwater" options or SARs without shareholder approval. That is, except for adjustments made pursuant to changes in capitalization, our Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee will not, without the further approval of our shareholders, authorize the amendment of any outstanding option or SAR to reduce the exercise price, and no option or SAR will be cancelled and replaced with cash or with another award having a lower exercise price, except as provided in the event of a change in control. Furthermore, no option or SAR will provide for the payment, at the time of exercise, of a cash bonus or grant or sale of another award without further approval of our shareholders. 
Non-Transferability 
A participant may not assign or transfer, in whole or in part, an award granted to the participant under the 2016 Incentive Plan, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. 
Forfeiture 
Unless the award agreement specifies otherwise, the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, require a participant to forfeit all unexercised, unearned, unvested or unpaid awards if: 
1. the participant, without written consent of Valvoline, engages directly or indirectly in any manner or capacity as principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee or otherwise in any business or activity competitive with the business conducted by Valvoline or any of its subsidiaries, as determined by the Compensation Committee; 
2. the participant performs any act or engages in any activity that is detrimental to the best interests of Valvoline or any of its subsidiaries, as determined by the Compensation Committee; or 
3. the participant breaches any agreement or covenant with, or obligation or duty to, Valvoline or any subsidiary, including without limitation, any non-competition agreement, non-solicitation agreement, confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement, or assignment of inventions or ownership of works agreement, as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
Additionally, awards granted under the 2016 Incentive Plan will be subject to forfeiture or repayment pursuant to the Clawback Policy (as described in the "Governance Policies and Practices—Clawback Policy" section of this Proxy Statement) or the terms of any other applicable compensation recovery policy adopted by us as in effect from time to time. 
Foreign Awards 
In order to comply with the laws in other countries in which we operate or have employees or otherwise to foster and promote achievement of the purposes of the 2016 Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, has authority, without amending the 2016 Incentive Plan, to: (i) determine which non-U.S. subsidiaries will be covered by the 2016 Incentive Plan; (ii) determine which foreign nationals and employees outside the United States are eligible to participate; (iii) modify the terms and conditions of awards granted to foreign nationals who are employed outside the United States or are otherwise subject to the laws of one or more foreign jurisdictions; (iv) grant awards to participants who are foreign nationals, who are employed outside the United States or who are otherwise subject to the laws of one or more non-U.S. jurisdictions, on terms and conditions that are different from those specified in the 2016 Incentive Plan; (v) modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures with respect to foreign participants; and (vi) take any action, before or after an award is made, that Compensation Committee deems necessary or advisable to obtain approval or comply with any local government regulatory exemptions, approvals or requirements. 
Amendment; Termination 
Subject to any shareholder approval that may be required by law or the rules of the NYSE, our Board of Directors may amend, alter, suspend or terminate the 2016 Incentive Plan in whole or in part and at any time. 
Unless terminated earlier by our Board of Directors, the 2016 Incentive Plan will terminate on October 1, 2026 and no awards may be granted under the 2016 Incentive Plan after that date. 
Certain Federal Income Tax Effects 
The following summary briefly describes U.S. federal income tax consequences of awards granted under the 2016 Incentive Plan, but is not a detailed or complete description of all U.S. federal tax laws or regulations that may apply, and does not address any local, state or other country laws. Therefore, no one should rely on this summary for individual tax compliance, planning or decisions. Participants should consult their own professional tax advisors concerning tax aspects of awards granted under the 2016 Incentive Plan. The discussion below concerning tax deductions that may become available to the Company under U.S. federal tax law is not intended to imply that the Company will necessarily obtain a tax benefit from those deductions. Taxation of equity-based payments in other countries is complex, does not generally correspond to U.S. federal tax laws, and is not covered by the summary below. 
Incentive Stock Options.    Neither the grant nor the exercise of an ISO results in taxable income to the participant for regular federal income tax purposes. However, an amount equal to (i) the per-share fair market value on the exercise date minus the exercise price at the time of grant multiplied by (ii) the number of shares with respect to which the ISO is being exercised will count as "alternative minimum taxable income" which, depending on the particular facts, could result in liability for the "alternative minimum tax" or AMT. If the participant does not dispose of the shares issued pursuant to the exercise of an ISO until the later of the two-year anniversary of the date of grant of the ISO and the one-year anniversary of the date of the acquisition of those shares, then (a) upon a later sale or taxable exchange of the shares, any recognized gain or loss would be treated for tax purposes as a long-term capital gain or loss and (b) the Company would not be permitted to take a deduction with respect to that ISO for federal income tax purposes. 
If shares acquired upon the exercise of an ISO were disposed of prior to the expiration of the two-year and one-year holding periods described above (a "disqualifying disposition"), generally the participant would realize ordinary income in the year of disposition in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) any excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise of the ISO over the amount paid for the shares or (ii) the excess of the amount realized on the disposition of the shares over the participant's aggregate tax basis in the shares (generally, the exercise price). A deduction would be available to the Company equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant, subject to the limitation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Any further gain realized by the participant will be taxed as short-term or long-term capital gain and would not result in any deduction by the Company. A disqualifying disposition occurring in the same calendar year as the year of exercise would eliminate the alternative minimum tax effect of the ISO exercise. 
Special rules may apply where all or a portion of the exercise price of an ISO is paid by tendering shares, or if the shares acquired upon exercise of an ISO are subject to substantial forfeiture restrictions. The foregoing summary of tax consequences associated with the exercise of an ISO and the disposition of shares acquired upon exercise of an ISO assumes that the ISO is exercised during employment or within three months following termination of employment. The exercise of an ISO more than three months following termination of employment will result in the tax consequences described below for NQSOs, except that special rules apply in the case of disability or death. An individual's stock options otherwise qualifying as ISOs will be treated for tax purposes as NQSOs (and not as ISOs) to the extent that, in the aggregate, they first become exercisable in any calendar year for stock having a fair market value (determined as of the date of grant) in excess of $100,000. 
Nonqualified Stock Options.    A nonqualified stock option would result in no taxable income to the participant or deduction to the Company at the time it is granted. A participant exercising an NQSO would, at that time, realize taxable compensation equal to (i) the per-share fair market value on the exercise date minus the exercise price at the time of grant multiplied by (ii) the number of shares with respect to which the option is being exercised. If the NQSO was granted in connection with employment, this taxable income would also constitute "wages" subject to withholding and employment taxes. A corresponding deduction would be available to the Company, subject to the limitation under Section 162(m) of the Code, described below. The foregoing summary assumes that the shares acquired upon exercise of an NQSO option are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. 
Restricted Stock.     An award of restricted stock would result in no taxable income at the time of grant unless the participant elects otherwise under Section 83(b) of the Code (a "Section 83(b) Election"). Unless a Section 83(b) Election is made, the participant will recognize ordinary income, at the time the restrictions applicable to the restricted stock award lapse, equal to the excess of the fair market value of such stock at such time over the amount (if any) paid therefor. Participants who receive dividends on restricted stock that are paid in additional shares of restricted stock will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of such additional shares at the time the restrictions on such additional shares lapse. Participants who receive dividends on restricted stock paid in cash will recognize ordinary income equal to the amount of cash received. Subject to the limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code described below, Valvoline would be entitled to a corresponding deduction with respect to restricted stock awards and dividends paid thereon at the same time that income is recognized by the participant. 
Restricted Stock Units.    An RSU would not result in taxable income at the time of the award. At the time the restrictions applicable to the RSUs lapse, the participant will be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock or cash compensation equal to the product of (1) the number of units that have vested and (2) the closing price of one share of Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite Tape as of such vesting date. When RSUs are settled, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of such shares of Common Stock or the amount of such cash compensation. Participants who receive dividends on RSUs that are paid in additional RSUs will recognize ordinary income at the same time and in the same manner as specified above. Subject to the limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code described below, Valvoline would be entitled to a corresponding deduction with respect to RSUs and dividends paid thereon at the same time that income is recognized by the participant. 
Performance Stock Units.    A PSU would not result in taxable income at the time of the award. At the end of the performance period, the Compensation Committee shall adjust the number of PSUs to reflect the attainment of the performance goals during the performance period. At the time the restrictions applicable to the PSUs lapse, the participant will be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock or cash compensation equal to the product of (1) the number of units that have been earned based on the attainment of the performance goals and (2) the closing price of one share of Common Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite Tape as of such vesting date. When PSUs are settled, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of such shares of Common Stock or the amount of such cash compensation. Subject to the limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code described below, Valvoline would be entitled to a corresponding deduction with respect to PSUs at the same time that income is recognized by the participant. 
Section 162(m).     Section 162(m) of the Code provides that if, in any year, the compensation that is paid to certain executive officers exceeds $1,000,000 per person, any amounts that exceed the $1,000,000 threshold will not be deductible by Valvoline for federal income tax purposes. The exception for "qualified performance-based compensation" awards was eliminated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. 
Section 409A.     Section 409A of the Code imposes restrictions on nonqualified deferred compensation. If an award is subject to Section 409A, and if the requirements of Section 409A are not met, the taxable events as described above could apply earlier than described, and could result in the imposition of additional taxes and penalties. While most awards granted under the 2016 Incentive Plan are anticipated to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A, awards that are not exempt are intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. 
New Plan Benefits 
The benefits to be received pursuant to the 2016 Incentive Plan by the Company's non-employee directors, executive officers and employees are not determinable at this time. Any future awards granted to eligible participants under the 2016 Incentive Plan will be made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, and no such determination as to future awards or who might receive them has been made. 
The amendment to the 2016 Incentive Plan shall be deemed approved if the number of votes cast "for" the amendment exceeds the number of votes cast "against" the amendment. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast "for" or "against" the amendment. 
If no voting specification is made on a properly returned or voted proxy card, Samuel J. Mitchell, Jr. or Julie M. O'Daniel (as proxies named on the proxy card) will cast the votes represented by such proxy card FOR the approval of the Amendment to the 2016 Valvoline Incentive Plan.

Valvoline's Board of Directors 
Composition 
Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that two-thirds of our directors be independent, as defined in our Director Independence Standards (published on our investor relations website at http://investors.valvoline.com/governance) ("Independence Standards"), which incorporate the requirements of SEC rules and NYSE listing standards. Within this framework, the G&N Committee is charged with determining and refreshing, as appropriate, the composition of our Board. The G&N Committee seeks to fill our Board with exceptionally talented and diverse directors, with expertise and leadership experience in the markets in which we operate. 
Our Board currently consists of the following eight members: Richard J. Freeland, Stephen F. Kirk, Carol H. Kruse, Stephen E. Macadam, Vada O. Manager, Samuel J. Mitchell, Jr., Charles M. Sonsteby, and Mary J. Twinem. All of the directors, other than Ms. Kruse, were elected at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. At its meeting on November 19, 2018, the Board increased its size from seven to eight members and elected Ms. Kruse, effective December 4, 2018, to serve as a member of the Board with a term expiring at the 2019 Annual Meeting.    Each of the current directors has been nominated for re-election at the Annual Meeting. See the "Proposal One—Election of Directors" section of this Proxy Statement. 
During fiscal 2018, six meetings of the Board were held. Each director attended at least 75% of the total meetings of the Board and the Committee(s) on which he or she served. Overall attendance at Board and Committee meetings by directors in fiscal 2018 was 98%. 
Leadership Structure 
Our By-Laws provide the Board flexibility in determining the appropriate leadership structure for the Company. Currently, Mr. Mitchell serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Kirk serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board currently believes that separating the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is in the best interest of the Company because it allows Mr. Mitchell to focus on operating and managing the day-to-day activities of our business, while Mr. Kirk can focus on Board leadership independent of management. 
The Board will periodically review and reassess our Board leadership structure and determine whether it is in the Company's and our shareholders' best interest to continue the separate roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In the event that the Board combines the role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require the Board to appoint a lead independent director. 
Independence 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that two-thirds of our directors be independent, as defined in the Independence Standards. The Independence Standards incorporate the requirements of SEC rules and NYSE listing standards, and were adopted by our Board to assist in its determination of director independence. Pursuant to these rules, our Board must make an affirmative determination that those members of the Board who serve as independent directors have no material relationship with our company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company). Members of the Audit and Compensation Committees are also subject to heightened standards for independence under SEC rules and NYSE listing standards. 
Our Board annually reviews director independence in accordance with these requirements. In making its independence determinations, the Board considered relationships and transactions between each director, on the one hand, and Valvoline, its subsidiaries and its affiliates, on the other hand, including the director's commercial, economic, charitable and familial relationships. As a result of this review, the Board affirmatively determined that Ms. Kruse, Ms. Twinem and Messrs. Freeland, Kirk, Macadam, Manager and Sonsteby are each independent of Valvoline and its affiliates. Mr. Mitchell was determined not to be independent because he currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. 
In determining the independence of Mr. Freeland, our Board considered transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business with Cummins Inc., a company in which Mr. Freeland serves as an executive officer and director. 
 In Cummins' last fiscal year, Valvoline paid $3.5 million to Cummins and Valvoline received $40.5 million from Cummins, representing 0.02% and 0.2%, respectively, of Cummins' consolidated gross revenues of $20.4 billion for such fiscal year. Similarly, the amount Valvoline paid to Cummins and the amount received by Valvoline from Cummins in each of the two preceding fiscal years did not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of Cummins' consolidated gross revenues in such fiscal years. All transactions with Cummins were made at arms-length, included standard commercial terms, and Mr. Freeland did not personally benefit from any of such transactions. The Board concluded that Mr. Freeland was independent, because the transactions were not material to Cummins such that Mr. Freeland could be unduly influenced by, and thus not independent of, Valvoline management. The G&N Committee determined that the transactions with Cummins were not "Related Person Transactions" as defined in the Company's Related Person Transaction Policy. 
In addition, the Board determined that Ms. Twinem and Messrs. Manager and Sonsteby each satisfy the heightened independence standards applicable to audit committee members, including those under Exchange Act Rule 10A-3. Similarly, the Board determined that Ms. Kruse, Ms. Twinem and Messrs. Freeland, Kirk, Macadam, Manager and Sonsteby each satisfy the heightened independence standards applicable to compensation committee members as set forth in NYSE listing standards. 
Committees 
Our Board of Directors has established three standing committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Governance & Nominating Committee (each a "Committee" and, collectively, the "Committees") to assist in the performance of the Board's various functions. All Committee members are appointed by our Board upon recommendation of the G&N Committee. 
Listed below are the members of each of the three Committees. As discussed above in "—Independence," our Board has determined that all of the members of these Committees are independent as defined by our Independence Standards, including, in the case of Audit and Compensation Committee members, the heightened standards for independence under SEC rules and NYSE listing standards.

The Board has established the Audit Committee in accordance with Section 3(a)(58) of the Exchange Act. The Audit Committee is currently composed of three members and the Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is "independent" and "financially literate," as such terms are defined by NYSE listing standards. In addition, the Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined by SEC rules. A director may not serve on the Audit Committee if he or she serves on the audit committee of more than two other public companies, unless the Board determines that such simultaneous service and time commitment would not impair the director's ability to effectively serve on the Audit Committee.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
None of the members of the Compensation Committee (Ms. Kruse, Ms. Twinem and Messrs. Freeland, Kirk, Macadam, Manager and Sonsteby) (i) was an officer or employee of Valvoline at any time during or prior to fiscal 2018 or (ii) is or was a participant in a "related person" transaction with Valvoline since the beginning of fiscal 2018. No executive officer of the Company served on the compensation committee or board of any company that employed any member of Valvoline's Compensation Committee or Board of Directors. 
The Board's Operations 
Chairman of the Board.     Mr. Kirk was unanimously appointed by the Board to serve as our Non-Executive Chairman, effective October 1, 2017. The Chairman of the Board organizes Board activities to effectively provide guidance to, and oversight and accountability of, management. To fulfill that role, the Chairman of the Board, among other things, creates and maintains an effective working relationship with the Chief Executive Officer and the other members of senior management and the Board, assures that the Board agenda is appropriately directed to the matters of greatest importance to the Company and provides senior management with the Board's advice, direction and opinions. The Non-Executive Chairman preserves the distinction between management and oversight, maintaining the responsibility of management to develop corporate strategy and the responsibility of the Board to review and express its views on corporate strategy. 
Board and Committee Meetings.    The Board and Committees must hold regularly scheduled meetings. Directors are expected to attend all meetings of the Board and of the Committees on which they serve. Non-management directors meet in executive session at each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board, and at other times as they may determine appropriate. 
Evaluation of Board Effectiveness.    The Board must conduct annual self-evaluations to determine whether it and its Committees are functioning effectively. The G&N Committee receives comments from all directors and reports to the Board with an annual assessment of the Board's performance, with a focus on the Board's contribution to the Company and areas in which the Board or its Committees can improve. We may also engage independent, third-party governance experts from time to time to conduct interviews and/or assessments regarding the structure and effectiveness of our Board and its committees. The Committees of our Board of Directors have all adopted charters defining their respective purposes and responsibilities. Pursuant to these charters, the Committees must review their respective performances at least annually and each of the Committees has authority to engage independent legal, accounting or other advisors. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board has an active role, as a whole, and also at the committee level, in overseeing management of the Company's risk. The Board approves and monitors the fundamental financial and business strategies of the Company and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that the assets of the Company are properly safeguarded and enterprise risks are properly managed, that appropriate financial and other controls are maintained, that processes are in place for maintaining the integrity of the Company and that the Company's business is conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risk, and members of our senior management regularly report to the Board and its Committees on current and emerging risks and the Company's approach to avoiding and mitigating risk exposure. The Board reviews in detail the Company's most significant risks and whether management is responding consistently within the Company's overall risk management and mitigation strategy. While the Board is ultimately responsible for overall risk oversight at our Company, the Committees assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas. In particular, the Audit Committee has primary responsibility for monitoring the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps the Company has taken to control such exposures, including the Company's risk management policies and processes. The Audit Committee also assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to environmental, health and safety risks and programs. The Compensation Committee monitors the risks associated with our compensation policies and procedures. The G&N Committee is charged with reviewing and recommending governance policies and procedures, including Board and Committee structure, leadership and membership, that ensure independence of the Board as it exercises its corporate governance and risk 
 oversight roles. The G&N Committee also reviews transactions pursuant to our Related Person Transaction Policy (which is further described in "—Other Governance Policies and Practices—Related Person Transaction Policy"). 
Other Governance Policies and Practices 
Overview of Governance Principles 
We are committed to adhering to sound corporate governance practices. We have adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which include our Related Person Transaction Policy. These Guidelines provide the framework for our Board of Directors' governance of the Company and include a general description of our Board's purpose, responsibilities and member qualification standards. As further discussed in "—Valvoline's Board of Directors—Independence," our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that at least two-thirds of our directors be independent. Our Related Person Transaction Policy requires our directors and executive officers to identify annually and on an as needed basis potential transactions with related persons or their firms that meet certain criteria set forth in our Related Person Transaction Policy. 
We also require compliance with our code of business conduct, entitled "Global Standards of Business Conduct," which applies to all of our directors and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and persons performing similar functions, as well as employees of Valvoline Instant Oil Change ("VIOC") stores. Our Global Standards of Business Conduct promote honest and ethical conduct, compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, prompt reporting of violations of the standards set forth therein and full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports filed with the SEC. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines (including our Related Person Transaction Policy), Global Standards of Business Conduct and Committee charters are published on our investor relations website at http://investors.valvoline.com/governance. These documents are also available in print at no cost to any shareholder who requests them. We intend to post any amendments or waivers to our Global Standards of Business Conduct (to the extent applicable to our directors and executive officers) on our investor relations website or in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 
Related Person Transaction Policy 
Federal securities laws require us to describe any transaction since the beginning of the last fiscal year, or any currently proposed transaction, in which the Company was or is to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Related persons are directors and executive officers, nominees for director and any immediate family members of directors, executive officers or nominees for director. We are also required to describe our policies and procedures for the review, approval or ratification of any Related Person Transaction. 
Pursuant to our written Related Person Transaction Policy (the "Policy"), the G&N Committee is responsible for reviewing the material facts of all transactions that could potentially be "transactions with related persons." The Policy covers any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, (2) the Company is a participant, and (3) any related person has or will have a direct or indirect interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). Transactions between the Company and any firm, corporation or entity in which a related person is an executive officer or general partner, or in which any related persons collectively hold more than 10% of the ownership interests, are also subject to review under the Policy. 
Under the Policy, our directors and executive officers are required to identify annually potential transactions with related persons or their firms that meet the criteria set forth in the Policy, and management is required to forward all such disclosures to the G&N Committee. The G&N Committee reviews each disclosed transaction. The G&N Committee has discretion to approve, disapprove or otherwise act if a transaction is deemed to be a Related Person Transaction subject to the Policy. Only disinterested members of the G&N Committee may participate in the determinations made with regard to a particular transaction. If it is impractical to convene a meeting of the G&N Committee, the Chair of the G&N Committee is authorized to make a determination and promptly report such determination in writing to the other G&N Committee members. All determinations made under the Policy are required to be reported to the full Board of Directors. 
Under the Policy and consistent with SEC regulations, certain transactions are not Related Person Transactions, even if such transactions exceed $120,000 in a fiscal year. Those exceptions are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation to a director or executive officer which is or will be disclosed in our Proxy Statement;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation to an executive officer which is approved by the Compensation Committee and would have been disclosed in our  Proxy Statement if the executive officer was a "named executive officer";  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A transaction in which the rates or charges involved are determined by competitive bids, or which involves common, contract  carrier or public utility services at rates or charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A transaction that involves services as a bank depository of funds, transfer agent, registrar, indenture trustee or similar  services; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A transaction in which the related person's interest arises solely from the ownership of Valvoline stock and all  shareholders receive the same benefit on a pro rata basis.  
[END TABLE]
The G&N Committee determined that there were no other Related Person Transactions that were required to be reported under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K since the beginning of fiscal 2018, nor are there any currently proposed. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Pursuant to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the Company's directors and certain executive officers are required to report, within specified due dates, their initial ownership of the Company's Common Stock and all subsequent acquisitions, dispositions or other transfers of interest in such securities, if and to the extent reportable events occur which require reporting by such due dates. The Company is required to identify in its Proxy Statement whether it has knowledge that any person required to file such a report may have failed to do so in a timely manner. Based on that review, all of the Company's directors and all executive officers subject to the reporting requirements satisfied such requirements in full. 
Communication with Directors 
As set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board believes that management is responsible for communicating on behalf of the Company. However, at the request of management, individual Board members may meet or otherwise communicate with shareholders and other interested parties. Persons interested in communicating with the Board, or with a specific member or Committee of the Board, may do so by writing to the Chief Legal Officer of Valvoline, 100 Valvoline Way, P.O. Box 55270, Lexington, KY 40555-1000. Communications directed to our Chief Legal Officer will be reviewed and distributed to individual directors, as appropriate, depending on the subject matter and facts and circumstances outlined in the correspondence. Communications that are not related to the duties and responsibilities of the Board, or are otherwise inappropriate, will not be forwarded to the directors, although all communications directed to the Board will be available to any director upon request. 
Attendance at Annual Meeting 
Although Valvoline does not have a formal policy regarding attendance by directors at Valvoline's annual meetings of shareholders, Valvoline strongly encourages all directors to attend. All of Valvoline's then current directors were present at the prior year's annual meeting of shareholders. 
Nomination of Directors 
G&N Committee Recommendations for and Nominations of Directors.    Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the G&N Committee's charter, the G&N Committee is responsible for leading the search for and recommending qualified director nominees for shareholder election to the Board for the next annual meeting of shareholders and for proposing director nominees for election by the Board to fill vacancies which occur between 
 annual meetings of shareholders. The G&N Committee does not set specific, minimum qualifications that director nominees must meet to be nominated for election to the Board, but rather believes that each nominee should be evaluated on his or her individual merits, taking into account the needs and composition of the Board at the time. The G&N Committee considers candidates who bring a wide range of attributes to the Board. The general criteria the G&N Committee looks for in selecting an individual as a director nominee is someone who exhibits the highest personal and professional integrity, who has demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment and who shall be effective in serving the interests of the Company's shareholders. The G&N Committee shall seek director candidates who exhibit the following personal and professional qualifications: (1) significant experience in the lubricants, automobile or consumer marketing industries; (2) product or process innovation experience; (3) international business expertise; (4) diverse experience in policy-making in business, government, education and/or technology, or in areas that are relevant to the Company's global business and strategy; (5) possess an inquisitive and objective nature, practical wisdom and mature judgment; and (6) the ability to work with the Company's existing directors and management. The G&N Committee also believes that diversity of race, ethnicity, gender and age are important factors in evaluating candidates for Board membership. The G&N Committee has from time to time retained the services of Russell Reynolds Associates, a third party search firm, to assist the G&N Committee in identifying and evaluating candidates for Board membership who best match the personal and professional criteria described above. 
Shareholder Recommendations for Directors.

(5)  Mr. Puckett's fiscal 2018 target annual incentive opportunity was 60% of his base salary in effect at the end of the  performance period. Of such amount, 50% is measured according to Valvoline Incentive Plan metrics and the other 10% is measured on pre-established strategic initiatives approved by the Compensation Committee, including quick lube acquisitions and  delivering average ticket improvements for company-owned stores. At its meeting in November 2018, the Compensation Committee certified target performance for quick lube acquisitions and below threshold performance for average ticket improvements,  resulting in partial achievement and a 50% payout of Mr. Puckett's strategic initiatives for fiscal 2018.

To reinforce our pay-for-performance philosophy, the total compensation program for the NEOs is highly incentive-based and therefore fluctuates based on financial results and stock price performance. This approach motivates executives to consider the impact of their decisions on both the short-term and long-term performance of the Company and shareholder value creation, while taking appropriate types and amounts of risk. 
For fiscal 2018, eighty percent (80%) of the CEO's target compensation and sixty percent (60%) of the other NEOs' target compensation, on average, was at-risk.

The Compensation Committee believes that, given the nature and scope of these projects, these additional services did not raise a conflict of interest and did not impair Deloitte's ability to provide independent advice to the Compensation Committee concerning executive compensation matters. 
In making this determination, the Compensation Committee considered, among other things, the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The types of non-compensation services provided by Deloitte;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The amount of fees for such non-compensation services, noting in particular that  such fees are negligible when considered in the context of Deloitte's total revenues for the period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deloitte's policies and procedures concerning conflicts of interest;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deloitte representatives who advise Valvoline's Compensation Committee do not provide any non-compensation related services to Valvoline;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• There are no other business or personal relationships between Valvoline management or members of the Valvoline Compensation  Committee and the Deloitte representatives who provide compensation services to Valvoline; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Neither Deloitte nor any of the Deloitte representatives who provide compensation services to Valvoline own any Common  Stock or other securities of Valvoline.  
[END TABLE]
Peer Group 
As detailed in our compensation philosophy, we benchmark pay levels and practices against a peer group for the purposes of evaluating NEO compensation. Annually, the Compensation Committee utilizes the services of Deloitte to prepare a peer group analysis and make recommendations on the companies to be included in the peer group. To establish the peer group for fiscal 2018 compensation decisions, Deloitte performed a comprehensive review of our peer group in June 2017 using the following criteria: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Industry; specifically, companies that market consumer (durable and non-durable)  goods, focus on the automotive industry, operate in the lubricants / chemical space, and/or maintain a large retail footprint or market primarily through retail channels;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Size;

• Competitive market for talent.

Benchmarking / Survey Data 
Over the course of the year, our Compensation Committee analyzes the total compensation of our executive officers. To facilitate this analysis, management works with the independent compensation consultant to provide the Compensation Committee with data that include base salaries, and short-term and long-term incentive opportunities. The independent compensation consultant also provides information on performance metrics, long-term incentive vehicles and weightings of those vehicles, post-employment benefits, such as severance and retirement vesting provisions, and compensation trends, as necessary. This data reflects recent publicly available information for our peer group and other market survey data discussed further below. We believe that it provides the Compensation Committee with a sufficient basis to analyze both the level and design of the total compensation provided to our executive officers. As stated in our compensation philosophy, we target the 50th percentile of the competitive range for target total direct compensation, with a significant element of compensation "at-risk". Therefore, actual compensation levels are highly dependent on company, operating segment, and / or individual performance. 
Where sufficient benchmark data is not available from public filings, we utilize published survey data as a supplementary source. The survey data focuses on consumer products, retail and general industry companies and is size-adjusted based on revenues and a statistical regression analysis that is consistent with the corporate or business segment responsibilities for each executive. 
Internal Pay Equity 
In addition to being competitive with the external market, we believe that our executive compensation program should be internally consistent and equitable. In its review of total compensation, our Compensation Committee considers the relationship between our CEO's total compensation and that of our other Named Executive Officers, as well as the consistency and pay equity among those Named Executive Officers. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee concluded that our CEO's compensation was reasonable compared to that of our other Named Executive Officers, and the fiscal 2018 compensation of each of our non-CEO Named Executive Officers was internally consistent and equitable in light of their respective roles, responsibilities, experience, and reporting relationships. 
"Say on Pay" 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on January 31, 2018, Valvoline shareholders voted on a non-binding advisory vote on our executive compensation ("Say on Pay") as disclosed in the Proxy Statement for fiscal 2017. Our shareholders approved the Say on Pay proposal with more than 95% of votes cast in favor of the proposal. The Compensation Committee considered the Say on Pay voting results and believes that the significant level of shareholder support is a positive endorsement of our executive compensation program. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee did not make any material changes to our executive compensation program in fiscal 2018. 
We value the feedback provided by our shareholders regarding Valvoline's executive compensation programs and, in fiscal 2018, members of our Board and management met with one of our largest shareholders to receive input on Valvoline's executive compensation program. We will consider this feedback and any other shareholder feedback pertaining to these programs in future decision making and program design. 
Compensation Decisions for Fiscal 2018 
Base Salary 
Valvoline utilizes compensation increase guidelines based on an individual's performance and his or her position relative to the competitive market median to formulate recommendations. All employees, including the Valvoline NEOs, are generally subject to the same salary increase guidelines, and increases have historically been effective in the Spring of each year. The compensation consultant prepares a competitive assessment of Valvoline's NEOs for the Compensation Committee on an annual basis. At its meeting on January 30, 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the analysis for fiscal 2018 and approved increases to the base salary of each NEO, other than Mr. Mitchell, as reflected in the table below, effective March 26, 2018. Mr. Mitchell did not receive an increase for fiscal 2018 because he had received a base salary increase at the time of Separation, reflecting his role as Chief Executive Officer of an independent, publicly-traded company.

[END TABLE]
Annual Incentive 
Under the annual incentive plan, target annual incentive opportunities for all Valvoline NEOs are expressed as a percentage of the base salary in effect at the end of the performance period. For fiscal 2018, Messrs. Moughler's and Puckett's target was increased by 10 percentage points. The incremental 10% target is aligned to the competitive market and tied to the achievement of pre-established strategic initiatives (as described below) approved by the Compensation Committee for each Operating Segment leader. All other NEOs' target opportunities remained the same for fiscal 2018.

[END TABLE]
For fiscal 2018, the primary corporate metrics for the annual incentive plan were Valvoline Operating Income and Valvoline Total Lubricant Volume, weighted 80% and 20%, respectively. Operating Income is a key indicator of Valvoline corporate and Operating Segment profitability. Operating Income may be adjusted by the Compensation Committee for unplanned or one-time items, such as gains or losses on the disposition of assets, impairment or restructuring charges or gains on divestitures of major businesses. Lubricant volume highlights the importance of growing the business at both the operating segment and overall corporate levels. This measurement was chosen because volume is an important measure to drive profitability. The annual incentive opportunity for each of Mr. Mitchell and Mses. Meixelsperger and O'Daniel is based on these metrics. 
For our operating segment leaders, including Messrs. Moughler and Puckett, the metrics for the fiscal 2018 incentive plan were Valvoline Operating Income, weighted 25%; Operating Segment Operating Income, weighted 41.67%; an Operating Segment metric (International Volume for the International segment and Same Store Sales Growth and Franchise/Express Care Unit Growth for the Quick Lubes segment), weighted 16.67%; and the achievement of strategic initiatives (supply chain improvements and developing OEM business for Mr. Moughler and quick lube acquisitions and delivering average ticket improvements for company-owned stores for Mr. Puckett), weighted 16.67%.

In fiscal 2018, our long-term incentive program for the NEOs consisted of 25% stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), 25% restricted stock units ("RSUs"), and 50% performance stock units ("PSUs"). The Compensation Committee chose these vehicles and weightings to (a) align executive pay with shareholder value creation, (b) provide PSUs that directly link executive pay with the Company's long-term goals, and (c) facilitate stock ownership and retention. Pursuant to the terms of the Awards, each recipient is subject to non-compete and non-solicitation covenants during employment and for 24-months following termination. 
Equity Mix for Fiscal 2018 SARs 25% 3-year vesting; 50% on 1-year anniversary and 25% on 2nd and 3rd anniversaries 10-year term Exercise price equal to closing price of Valvoline common stock on date of grant RSUs 25% (Time-vested) 3 year vesting; 33-1/3% per year Settled in Valvoline common stock PSUs 50% (Performance-Based) Vests at the end of the 3-year performance period based on goal achievement 100% of award based on earnings per share ("EPS'') can be modified 25% up or down based on relative total shareholder return (''TSR") against the S&P Midcap 400 index 
The performance of the 2016-2018 PSUs and Mr. Mitchell's award made under the Executive Performance Incentive and Retention Plan ("EPIRP"), awarded by Ashland in November of 2015 and assumed by Valvoline at the Separation, were certified by Ashland's P&C Committee and our Compensation Committee during fiscal 2017 pursuant to the award agreements. 
2016-2018 PSUs 
In anticipation of the Separation, the 2016-2018 PSUs were designed to measure performance from October 1, 2015 through 120 days after the Separation. Based on the timing of the Separation, one-third of the target award was converted to time-based RSUs, with the remaining two-thirds subject to performance conditions. Ashland ROI performance was slightly below the target performance level while Ashland's and Valvoline's combined relative TSR performance was below the 35th percentile threshold performance level. Based on the combined performance results, the portion of the award subject to performance-criteria was earned at 48.4% of target, as shown in the table below. The converted RSUs and earned 2016-2018 PSUs vested and were settled in shares of Valvoline common stock on November 18, 2018, the original vesting date.

EPIRP 
The EPIRP, awarded by Ashland and assumed by Valvoline, was designed in a similar manner to the 2016-2018 PSUs, but the entire performance component of the award was based on Ashland's and Valvoline's combined relative TSR performance. The awards were granted at the maximum level, and the portion of the award subject to the performance condition was determined by the timing of the Separation from Ashland. Based on the Separation date, a total of one-sixth of the shares awarded converted to time-based RSUs. The converted RSUs vested and were settled in shares of Valvoline common stock on November 18, 2018, the original vesting date. Combined relative TSR performance was below the 35th percentile threshold performance level, resulting in no earned shares for the performance-based portion of the award.

Design of 2018-2020 PSUs 
In November 2017, consistent with our regular grant cycle, the Compensation Committee awarded PSUs to the NEOs for the fiscal 2018-2020 performance period. These awards were granted pursuant to the 2016 Valvoline Inc. Incentive Plan and to the extent earned will be settled in shares of Valvoline stock at the end of the performance period. The awards are based solely on EPS growth with a relative TSR modifier, as shown below:

Governance Policies and Practices 
Clawback Policy 
Valvoline adopted a clawback policy for executive officers, including the NEOs. This policy further strengthens the risk mitigation of our incentive programs by defining the economic consequences that misconduct has on the executive officers' incentive based compensation. In the event of a financial restatement due to fraudulent activity or intentional misconduct as determined by the Board of Directors, the culpable executive officer is required to reimburse Valvoline for incentive-related compensation paid to him or her. In addition, the Board of Directors has the discretion to determine whether an executive will be required to repay incentive-related compensation, whether or not such officer was involved in the fraudulent activity or misconduct. Valvoline has a period of three years after the payment or award is made to seek reimbursement. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Valvoline maintains stock ownership guidelines that align the interests of leadership, including the NEOs and non-employee directors, with those of its stockholders, by requiring each of the NEOs and directors to maintain a minimum ownership stake in the company. Each Covered Individual (defined as non-employee members of the Board of Directors and all U.S. employees designated as Section 16 Officers and/or in positions at the Senior Vice President level and above) by the guidelines will have 5 years from the later of (i) the effective date of the guidelines or (ii) the date such individual is hired or promoted into a covered role before they will be required to meet the requirements under the Valvoline Stock Ownership Guidelines. In the event that a Covered Individual is promoted to a new role within the organization and, as a result of such promotion, is subject to a higher guideline, the impacted individual shall have an additional 3 years from the date of promotion to achieve the new ownership guidelines.

Anti-Hedging / Anti-Pledging Policy 
Valvoline's insider trading policy prohibits any director or executive officer, including the NEOs, from purchasing any financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds) that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of equity securities of Valvoline: (i) granted to such person by Valvoline as part of the person's compensation or (ii) held, directly or indirectly, by such person. Valvoline also prohibits all of its directors and officers from directly or indirectly pledging equity securities of Valvoline. Under the policy, the term "pledging" includes the intentional creation of any form of pledge, security interest, deposit, lien or other hypothecation, including the holding of shares in a margin account, that entitles a third party to foreclose against, or otherwise sell, any equity securities, whether with or without notice, consent, default or otherwise. The equity securities attributable to a director or officer for these purposes shall include equity securities attributable to the director or officer under applicable securities laws. 
Risk Assessment 
Valvoline's compensation program is designed to motivate and reward employees and executive officers for their performance during the fiscal year and over the long term, while taking appropriate business risks. The Compensation Committee asked its independent compensation consultant to conduct a risk assessment of Valvoline's incentive compensation plans in January 2018. Based on its review of the consultant's risk assessment, a review of Valvoline's internal controls and the risk mitigating components of Valvoline's compensation programs, the Compensation Committee determined that Valvoline's compensation programs do not encourage executives or other employees to take inappropriate risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Valvoline. 
Compensation Decisions for Fiscal 2019 
Looking forward to fiscal 2019, the Compensation Committee continued to review and refine the compensation program to better align with our compensation philosophy and interests of our shareholders. As a result, the compensation actions below were made effective for fiscal 2019:

Deductibility of Compensation 
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 and certain "grandfathered" awards issued prior to November 2, 2017, the Section 162(m) tax rules allow for the tax deductibility of amounts paid to the NEOs in excess of $1 million, provided such amounts meet the performance-based exception requirements of the Section 162(m) rules. 
Valvoline considers the tax deductibility of compensation awarded to the NEOs, and weighs the benefits of awarding compensation that may be non-deductible against the conditions required by the tax law to obtain tax deductibility. The Compensation Committee believes that in certain circumstances the benefits of awarding nondeductible compensation exceed the benefits of awarding deductible compensation that is subject to limitations imposed by the applicable tax laws. 
The exception for qualified performance-based awards was eliminated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Accordingly, future compensation that is paid to the NEOs in excess of $1 million per person, will not be deductible by Valvoline for federal income tax purposes (other than certain grandfathered amounts noted above). 
Valvoline also considers various other tax rules governing compensation for our NEOs including (but not limited to) tax rules relating to fringe benefits, qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation, and compensation triggered by a change in control.

(1)  The Ashland Hercules Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan") is a  tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. The Ashland Inc. Nonqualified Excess Benefit Pension Plan (the "Excess Plan") is a non-qualified plan  that is coordinated with the tax-qualified plan. The Ashland Inc. Supplemental Early Retirement Plan for Certain Employees (the "SERP") is a non-qualified  plan. The material terms of each of these plans are described in the narrative below.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  The maximum number of years of credited service under the SERP is 20 years. The number of years of service for the SERP is  measured from the date of hire. The number of years of service under the Pension Plan and the Excess Plan is measured from the date the NEO began participating in the Pension Plan.  
[END TABLE]
Assumptions 
The present values of the accumulated benefits were calculated as of September 30, 2018, based on the earliest age a participant could receive an unreduced benefit under the qualified Pension Plan and the Excess Plan because his or her qualified Pension Plan benefits are calculated under the cash balance pension formula. 
The SERP provides an umbrella (or gross) benefit that is subject to certain reductions. The amount in the Pension Benefits table for the SERP benefit for applicable Named Executive Officers is the net benefit under the SERP, after applicable reductions. The reductions referred to in this paragraph are described in the "Ashland Inc. Supplemental Early Retirement Plan for Certain Employees (SERP)" section below. 
Under the SERP, the earliest age a Named Executive Officer could receive an unreduced benefit is the earlier of age 55 or when the sum of the NEO's age and service equals at least 80, provided that the NEO has at least 20 years of service under the SERP. 
Post-Employment Obligations Following Separation 
In conjunction with the Separation of Valvoline from Ashland, sponsorship of several qualified and non-qualified plans previously sponsored by Ashland were transferred to Valvoline as of September 1, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, benefits under these plans were frozen with regard to future accruals. The Ashland Hercules Pension Plan, the Ashland Inc. Nonqualified Excess Benefit Pension Plan, and the Ashland Inc. Supplemental Early Retirement Plan for Certain Employees are discussed below based on the fact that each of the Named Executive Officers, other than Ms. Meixelsperger and Mr. Rios, were participants in these plans during fiscal 2018. 
Ashland Hercules Pension Plan (Pension Plan) 
The Pension Plan is a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan under Code Section 401(a). The Pension Plan provides retirement income for eligible participants. Beginning in January 2011, the Pension Plan was closed to new participants and to additional credits in the retirement growth account. Benefit accruals were frozen effective as of September 30, 2016. 
The Pension Plan has two benefit formulas—a traditional formula, referred to as the annuity benefit, and a cash balance formula, referred to as the retirement growth account. The traditional formula produces an annuity benefit at retirement based on a percentage of final average compensation multiplied by years of plan service (see the description in the "—Traditional Benefit/Annuity Formula" section below). The cash balance formula produces a hypothetical account balance based on the sum of contribution credits and interest on those contribution credits (see the description in the "—Retirement Growth Account Benefit/Cash Balance Formula" section below). In general, participants who were actively employed by Ashland on June 30, 2003, with at least 10 years of service remained in the annuity benefit formula. All other participants moved to the retirement growth account formula. The formula under which a participant's benefit is computed is a matter of plan design and not participant election. 
The Pension Plan operated in conjunction with the Ashland Inc. Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "LESOP") for eligible participants. The LESOP transferred to Valvoline upon separation from Ashland. Effective May 1, 2017, Valvoline merged the LESOP into the Valvoline Inc. 401(k) Plan. Provisions for coordination with the Pension Plan remained unchanged. 
Traditional Benefit/Annuity Formula 
Under this formula, for certain highly compensated employees, compensation only includes base compensation, up to the maximum amount allowed under Code Section 401(a)(17). For all other participants, compensation includes base compensation and bonus amounts. This applies to both the annuity formula and the cash balance formula. 
The final average compensation formula is the average for a 48-consecutive month period producing the highest average for the last 120 months of credited service. For participants who were employees of Hercules prior to the acquisition of Hercules, the final average compensation is the average for the 60-consecutive month period producing the highest average for the last 120 months of credited service. 
The annual annuity benefit formula is: 
(1.08% x final average compensation up to $10,700) + (1.5% x final average compensation exceeding $10,700) 
× 
(years of credited service, which means years as a participant in the plan up to a maximum of 35 years) 
For participants who were employees of Hercules prior to the acquisition, the annual annuity benefit formula is: 
(1.2% x final average compensation up to $53,400) + (1.6% x final average compensation exceeding $53,400) 
× 
(years of credited service) 
The normal form of benefit payment under the annuity benefit is a single life annuity. However, as required by federal law, the normal form of benefit for a married participant is a joint and survivor annuity, unless the spouse consents to a different benefit distribution. A participant may also elect a non-spousal joint and survivor annuity or a 10-year term certain annuity. All payment forms are actuarially equivalent. 
The normal retirement age is 65, but an unreduced benefit is paid for retirement at age 62. A participant may retire early once the participant is either at least age 55 or when the sum of the participant's age and service equals at least 80. 
Retirement Growth Account Benefit/Cash Balance Formula 
Under this formula, contribution credits are accumulated in a notional account. Interest credits are allocated to each participant's account monthly. The interest rate is from a minimum of 4.0% to a maximum of 7.0% and is set at the beginning of each plan year. The interest rate for fiscal 2018 was 4.25%. 
The accrued benefit under this formula is the balance in the retirement growth account. The benefit is payable in the same forms that apply to the annuity benefit formula or may be paid as a single lump sum. 
The normal retirement age under the retirement growth account formula is also age 65. The earliest that a participant can receive an unreduced benefit is at age 55 with at least five years of service. 
Non-Qualified Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan ("Excess Plan") 
The Excess Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified pension plan providing a benefit payable, based on the applicable Named Executive Officer's pension plan eligibility, equal to the difference between the benefit under the Pension Plan in the absence of the Code limits (the gross benefit) and the actual benefit that would be payable under the Pension Plan. 
The Excess Plan covers employees (i) who are eligible for the Pension Plan and whose benefit under the Pension Plan were limited because of either Code Section 401(a)(17) or Section 415(b) and (ii) who are not terminated for cause as defined in the Excess Plan. For purposes of computing the Excess Plan benefits, a participant's compensation is defined the same as it is for the Pension Plan. However, the limits on the compensation under the Pension Plan that are imposed by the Code do not apply under the Excess Plan. 
The benefit under the Excess Plan is payable in a lump sum and may be transferred to the Employees' Deferral Plan. A benefit payable to certain highly compensated participants cannot be paid for six months following separation from service. Messrs. Mitchell, Moughler and Puckett participate in the Excess Plan. The Excess Plan was frozen effective September 30, 2016, in conjunction with the freezing of the Pension Plan. 
Supplemental Early Retirement Plan for Certain Employees ("SERP") 
The SERP is an unfunded, non-qualified plan allowing designated employees to retire prior to their sixty-fifth birthday without an immediate substantial loss of income. The SERP is a supplemental retirement arrangement for a select group of management participating in the SERP as of December 31, 2010. Beginning January 1, 2011, the eligibility for this program was restricted to employees with a traditional Pension Plan benefit who were subsequently promoted into an executive level position, on or after January 1, 2011. On November 18, 2015, the SERP was closed to all new participants. 
In conjunction with the Separation of Valvoline from Ashland, sponsorship of the SERP was transferred to Valvoline as of September 1, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, benefits under the SERP were frozen with regard to future accruals. The final average compensation used in determining the value of a participant's benefit was fixed as of this date. Final average bonus as defined under the plan will include fiscal 2016 annual incentive payments made in December 2016. 
The SERP benefit formula covering the applicable Named Executive Officers and certain other designated executive level participants provides a benefit of 25% of final average compensation multiplied by the participant's years of service up to 20 years. For this purpose, the final average compensation formula for participants as of December 30, 2010, is total compensation (base plus incentive compensation) for the 36 months out of the 84 months before retirement that produces the highest average. For Participants who became eligible on or after January 1, 2011, final average compensation is total compensation for the 60 months out of the 120 months before retirement that produces the highest average. 
The applicable Named Executive Officers may retire on the earlier of age 55 with three years of service or when the sum of the executive's age and service equals at least 80. The benefit produced by the above described formula is subject to proportionate reduction for each year of service credited to the participant that is less than 20 years of service. Additionally, the benefit is reduced by the sum of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the participant's qualified Pension Plan benefit (assuming the LESOP offset account is transferred to the Pension  Plan); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the participant's Excess Plan benefit.  
[END TABLE]
SERP benefits become vested upon attaining three years of service. Messrs. Mitchell, Moughler and Mr. Puckett are vested in the SERP. Mses. Meixelsperger and O'Daniel and Mr. Rios are not eligible to participate in the SERP. 
The SERP benefit is payable in a lump sum and may be transferred to the Valvoline Employee Deferral Plan, as defined below. Distributions to the Named Executive Officers and certain other highly compensated participants are subject to a six-month delay after separation from service.

Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan ("NQDC Plan") 
The NQDC Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified defined contribution plan that provides a contribution equivalent to Valvoline's match and supplemental company contributions on annual incentive compensation paid and eligible earnings in excess of limits established under Code Section 401(a)(17) not permitted in the qualified 401(k) plan. The account balance may be invested in the mutual funds available in the Employees' Deferral Plan, as described below. The benefit payable under the NQDC Plan will be made in installments or as a lump sum based on a participant's distribution election. Named Executive Officers and certain other highly compensated participants are subject to a six-month delay on distributions on account of their separation from service. 
Employee Deferral Plans 
In September 2016, our Board approved the Valvoline Inc. 2016 Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees (the "Valvoline Employee Deferral Plan"), which is described below. 
Participants elect how to invest their account balances from among a diverse set of mutual fund offerings and a hypothetical Valvoline common stock fund. No guaranteed interest or earnings are available and there are no above market rates of return on investments in the Valvoline Employee Deferral Plan. New investments in the Valvoline common stock fund must remain so invested and must be distributed as Valvoline common stock. In all other events, participants may freely elect to change their investments. Withdrawals are allowed for an unforeseeable emergency (lump sum payment sufficient to meet the emergency), disability (lump sum payment), upon separation from employment (payable as a lump sum or installments per election) and at a specified time (paid as a lump sum). 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control for Fiscal 2018 Table 
The following table summarizes the estimated amounts payable to each Valvoline Named Executive Officer in the event of a termination from employment or change in control of Valvoline as of September 30, 2018. A narrative description follows the table. Different termination events are identified in columns (b)-(g). Column (a) enumerates the types of potential payments for each Valvoline Named Executive Officer. As applicable, each payment or benefit is estimated across the table under the appropriate column or columns. 
These estimates are based on the assumption that the various triggering events occur on September 30, 2018, the last day of fiscal 2018. The equity incentive-based components are based on the closing price of Valvoline's common stock as of September 28, 2018 ($21.51). Other material assumptions used in calculating the estimated compensation and benefits under each triggering event are noted below. The actual amounts that would be paid to a Valvoline named executive officer upon certain terminations of employment or upon a change in control can only be determined at the time an actual triggering event occurs.

(1)  Mr. Mitchell's EPIRP award agreement contains change in control provisions governing the Executive Performance  Incentive and Retention Program.

[BEGIN TABLE]
      For the 2018-2020 and 2017-2019 PSU awards: If one of the events represented by columns (b), (c) or  (e) occurred, the pro-rata payments would be based on actual results, rather than target. Pursuant to the terms of the award agreements, if the change in control occurs during the first twelve  (12) months of the performance period, a pro-rata portion of the PSUs will become vested at target as of the date of the change in control (column (f)) and the remaining PSUs will be converted at target  to time-based, stock-settled RSUs and continue to vest, subject to the participant's continued employment through the vesting date; provided that any such outstanding unvested RSUs will immediately vest upon the termination of the  participant's employment without "cause," and not as a result of the participant's disability or death, during the one-year period (two-year period for Mr. Mitchell) beginning on the date  of the change in control (column (g)). If the change in control occurs after the first twelve (12) months of the performance period, a pro-rata portion of the PSUs will become vested as of the date of the  change in control based on the performance goals through the date of the change in control and the remaining PSUs will be converted to time-based, stock-settled RSUs, and will continue to vest, subject to the participant's continued employment  through the vesting date; provided that any such outstanding unvested RSUs will immediately vest upon the termination of the participant's employment without cause, and not as a result of the Participant's disability or death, during the one-year period (two-year period for Mr. Mitchell) beginning on the date of the change in control.

(3)  The amounts identified in the Incentive Compensation row of columns (b), (c) and (e) represent a payment of the  fiscal 2018 annual incentive compensation based on actual results for the entire performance period. Upon a change in control, the performance period relating to any incentive award will be accelerated and payment will be made based upon achievement  of the performance goals up to the date of the change in control.

(4)  For purposes of column (c), it is assumed that the NEO incurred a disabling event and termination on September 30,  2018. Subject to coordination with other income received while disabled, the Long-Term Disability Plan ("LTD Plan") provides a benefit equal to 60% of base compensation. The compensation covered by the LTD Plan is limited in 2018 to  $12,000 per month. If the NEO died, his or her beneficiaries would receive the same accelerated vesting of the PSUs as the NEO would in the event of disability.

(6)  The values in this column represent benefits under the 2016 Incentive Plan due upon a Qualifying Termination, defined as  having reached age fifty-five (55) with ten years of continuous service at the time the NEO's employment with the Company terminates. As of September 30, 2018, only Messrs. Mitchell, Moughler, and Puckett met these requirements.   
[END TABLE]
Severance Pay Plan 
The Valvoline Named Executive Officers are covered by the Valvoline Severance Pay Plan, which provides benefits in the event of a covered termination from employment in the absence of a change in control. A termination for which benefits under the plan will be considered include those directly resulting from the permanent closing of a facility, job discontinuance, termination by a participant for Good Reason (as defined in the plan), or other termination at Valvoline's initiative for which Valvoline elects to provide benefits. Certain terminations are excluded from coverage by the Severance Pay Plan (for example, refusal to sign a severance agreement and release; discharge for less than effective performance, absenteeism or misconduct; or voluntary resignation). In order for any executive to receive benefits and compensation payable under the Severance Pay Plan, the executive must agree to a general release of liability which relates to the period of employment and the termination. 
The benefit payable under the Severance Pay Plan to the Valvoline Named Executive Officers is 78 weeks of base pay, except for Mr. Mitchell, whose benefit is 104 weeks of base pay. Payments will be made in bi-weekly increments over the severance period in accordance with the Company's regular payroll. Any executive who receives benefits under the plan is also entitled to continued coverage under the Company's group health plans via company-paid COBRA during the severance period. 
Executive Change in Control Agreements 
Mr. Mitchell has a change in control agreement, effective May 15, 2017. If, within two years after a Change in Control (as defined in the agreement), Mr. Mitchell's employment is terminated as a result of a Qualifying Termination (as defined in the agreement) he would be entitled to the following payments and benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• payment of three times the sum of his highest annual base compensation and highest target percentage annual incentive  compensation in respect of the prior three fiscal years preceding the fiscal year in which the termination occurs in a lump sum paid in the seventh month following termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued participation in Valvoline's medical, dental and group life plans through December 31 of the third  calendar year following the calendar year in which he was terminated;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• full payment at target in cash of any outstanding PSUs as of his termination (less any amounts already paid with regard to  the PSUs because of the change in control);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• payment in cash of all earned and unpaid incentive compensation and pro-rata  payment of any incentive compensation for the fiscal year in which he terminates at target level;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• outplacement services and financial planning services for one year after termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• payment of all unused, earned and accrued vacation in a lump sum in the seventh month following termination; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vesting of all outstanding restricted shares, RSUs, SARs and stock options.  
[END TABLE]
As a condition to receiving the benefits and compensation payable under the agreement, Mr. Mitchell has agreed for a period of 36 months following a Qualifying Termination, absent prior written consent of Valvoline's Chief Legal Officer, to refrain from engaging in competitive activity against Valvoline; and to refrain from soliciting persons working for Valvoline, soliciting customers of Valvoline or otherwise interfering with Valvoline's business relationships. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Mitchell has also agreed not to disclose confidential information. If Mr. Mitchell breaches the agreement, Valvoline has the right to recover benefits that have been paid to him. Finally, Mr. Mitchell may recover legal fees and expenses incurred as a result of Valvoline's unsuccessful legal challenge to the agreement or Mr. Mitchell's interpretation of the agreement. 
Mr. Mitchell's change in control agreement excludes all excise tax "gross-up" provisions and instead provides for a "best-after-tax" cutback. 
Each of the other Valvoline Named Executive Officers entered into change in control agreements, effective May 15, 2017. In the event of a Qualifying Termination (as defined within the agreements) within two years following a Change in Control (as defined within the agreements), these benefits would include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• payment of two times the sum of the NEO's annual base salary and target annual bonus  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued participation in Valvoline's group health plans during the 24-month  period immediately following a Qualifying Termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• payment in cash of all earned and unpaid incentive compensation and pro-rata  payment of any incentive compensation for the fiscal year in which the NEO terminates at target level;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• payment of all unused, earned and accrued vacation  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• outstanding equity awards shall be treated in accordance with the terms of the 2016 Incentive Plan (as described below)   
[END TABLE]
As a condition to receiving the benefits and compensation payable under the agreements, the NEOs have agreed for a period of 24 months following a Qualifying Termination to refrain from engaging in competitive activity against Valvoline, including but not limited to solicitation of Valvoline employees and customers and non-disclosure of confidential information. Each NEO's change in control agreement excludes all excise tax "gross-up" provisions and instead provides for a "best-after-tax" cutback. 
2016 Valvoline Inc. Incentive Plan Change in Control Provisions 
Participants who have been granted long-term incentive awards (restricted stock, RSUs, PSUs and SARs) pursuant to the 2016 Valvoline Inc. Incentive Plan, shall be entitled to accelerated vesting of such awards if a change in control occurs and the participant is terminated without cause (as defined in the 2016 Incentive Plan) during the protection period described below. With respect to PSUs, if a change in control occurs (i) during the first 12 months of the performance period, a pro-rata portion of the PSUs will become vested at target as of the date of the change in control or (ii) after the first 12 months of the performance period, a pro-rata portion of the PSUs will become vested as of the date of the change in control based on the actual achievement of the performance goals through the date of the change in control and the remaining PSUs, after pro-rating the award, will be converted at target to time-based, stock settled RSUs and continue to vest, subject to the participant's continued employment through the vesting date. In the event the participant's employment or service is terminated without cause within the one-year period (increased to the two-year period if the amendment to the 2016 Incentive Plan, as set forth in Proposal Four, is approved by the Company's shareholders) immediately following the change in control, any portion of the restricted stock, RSUs, SARs and converted PSUs that are unvested as of the date of such termination will immediately vest and become free of all restrictions. 
The potential payments and benefits referenced above are reflected in the "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control for Fiscal 2018" section of this Proxy Statement.

Under rules adopted by the SEC under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), Valvoline discloses the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to the annual total compensation of our median employee. We identified our median employee utilizing data as of September 30, 2018 for individuals who were employed by us on September 30, 2018. 
For purposes of identifying the Company's median employee, we calculated total compensation for each employee, other than the CEO, by including base salary, including overtime for hourly employees, paid in fiscal 2018 and target annual incentive compensation. The results of our finding are as follows:

Fiscal 2018 Director Compensation Program 
The following is a description of our director compensation program for non-employee directors for fiscal 2018. Mr. Mitchell, Valvoline's Chief Executive Officer, does not receive additional compensation for his service on the Board. 
Annual Retainer 
Valvoline's director compensation program for non-employee directors provides that each non-employee director receives an annual retainer of $100,000. In addition, the Chair of the Audit Committee receives an annual retainer of $20,000, and the Chairs of the Compensation and G&N Committees each receive an annual retainer of $15,000. Effective for fiscal 2018, the non-executive Chairman of the Board receives an additional annual retainer of $40,000 for such services. Cash payments are made to each director on a quarterly basis. 
Each non-employee director has the opportunity to participate in Valvoline's 2016 Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Directors' Deferral Plan"). Under the Directors' Deferral Plan, non-employee directors may elect to receive all or a portion of each retainer in cash or in shares of Common Stock. They may also elect to have all or a portion of each retainer deferred into the Directors' Deferral Plan. The directors who make an election to defer part of any retainer may have the deferred amounts held as common stock units (share equivalents) in the hypothetical Common Stock fund or invested in the other available investment options within the Directors' Deferral Plan. Payments from the Directors' Deferral Plan may commence upon a Director's separation from the Board. Directors may elect to have the payout in a single lump sum or in installments not to exceed 15 years. Distributions for deferrals will be made pursuant to each director's election and valued at the time of the distribution. 
One-Time Equity Award 
Effective for fiscal 2018, the Board, upon the recommendation of the independent compensation consultant, eliminated initial equity awards for new directors based upon market practices for director compensation. 
Annual Equity Award 
Under the Directors' Deferral Plan, each non-employee director is also eligible to receive an annual award of deferred stock units. The number of deferred stock units to be granted to each non-employee director shall be determined by dividing $110,000 (pro-rated as applicable for less than a full-year of service) by the grant date value of a share of Common Stock. The deferred stock units vest one year after the date of grant or, if the director does not seek re-election as a director, upon the date of the annual shareholder meeting that precedes such one-year anniversary, in each case subject to the director's continued service. Dividends are credited and reinvested in additional deferred stock units. The deferred stock units immediately vest upon a director's termination of service on or after a change in control (as defined in the Directors' Deferral Plan) of Valvoline. Any vested deferred stock units will be paid in cash or shares of Common Stock at the time specified in the director's election, or if no election is made, within 60 days after the director's termination of service. Effective for fiscal 2018, each director will have the option to have his or her annual deferred stock unit award distributed in shares of common stock upon vesting. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines for Directors 
The Board of Directors considers Common Stock ownership by directors to be of utmost importance. The Board believes that such ownership enhances the commitment of directors to Valvoline's future and aligns their interests with those of Valvoline's other shareholders. The Board has therefore established minimum stock ownership guidelines for non- employee directors which require each director to own Common Stock having a value of at least five times his or her base annual cash retainer. Each current non-employee director of Valvoline has five years from the year elected to reach this ownership level. As of September 30, 2018, Messrs. Kirk, Macadam, Manager and Sonsteby had achieved ownership in excess of the minimum stock ownership guidelines for non-employee directors. 
Director Compensation Table 
The following table is a summary of compensation information for fiscal 2018, for Valvoline's non-employee directors. Ms. Kruse was elected to the Board, effective December 4, 2018, and therefore received no compensation for fiscal 2018.

Policy on Pre-Approval of Audit Firm Services 
The Audit Committee of our Board (the "Audit Committee") has responsibility for appointing, determining compensation of and overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm that audits our financial statements. 
The Audit Committee has adopted strict guidelines on the use of the independent registered public accounting firm to provide audit and non-audit services. The Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit and non-audit services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other permissible non-audit services. In circumstances where the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm to perform work beyond the scope of and not contemplated in the original pre-approval occurs, specific pre-approval of the additional services and fees is required by the Audit Committee Chair prior to the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for those services and must be presented to the Audit Committee at its next meeting. For each proposed service, the independent registered public accounting firm provides detailed supporting documentation at the time of approval to permit the Audit Committee to make a determination whether the provision of such service would impair the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Professional services provided by EY as our independent registered accounting firm in fiscal 2018 were subject to pre-approval under the guidelines discussed above. Under these guidelines, prior to engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approved the audit and non-audit services to be rendered by EY in fiscal 2018, in each case, including all engagement fees and terms. 
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee is currently composed of three independent directors and operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. A copy of the Audit Committee's charter may be obtained from the Company's Investor Relations website at http://investors.valvoline.com. The Board, after reviewing the qualifications of the Audit Committee members and any relationships that such members may have with the Company that might affect their independence, determined that all current Audit Committee members—Messrs. Manager and Sonsteby and Ms. Twinem—are "independent" as that term is defined by Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act, the listing standards of the NYSE, and Valvoline's Director Independence Standards. The Board also determined that each member of the Audit Committee is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules. A description of each Audit Committee member's financial experience is contained in their biographies under Proposal One—Election of Directors. 
The Audit Committee assists in fulfilling the oversight responsibilities of the Board relating to the integrity of the Company's financial statements and financial reporting process; the integrity of the Company's systems of internal accounting and financial controls; the performance of the Company's internal audit function and independent auditors; the independent auditors' qualifications and independence and the independent auditors' audit of the Company's financial statements and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; the Company's risk management policies and processes; the Company's ethical compliance programs, including the Company's Codes of Business Conduct; the Company's financial affairs; legal and regulatory compliance requirements; and the Company's policies, programs and practices with respect to environmental, health and safety risks. The Audit Committee also oversees the Company's enterprise risk management ("ERM") program and has direct oversight over financial reporting and control and several other risks, noted below, within the ERM framework. In fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee met 10 times, including teleconferences to discuss and review Valvoline's quarterly financial performance and associated news releases. 
The Company's management has primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal financial controls, for preparing the financial statements and for the public reporting process. The independent auditors are responsible for expressing opinions on the conformity of the Company's audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and on management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
EY, an independent registered public accounting firm, was engaged to audit Valvoline's consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2018 and to issue an opinion on whether such statements present fairly, in all material respects, Valvoline's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. EY was also engaged to audit and to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of Valvoline's internal control over financial reporting. Prior to any engagement of EY by Valvoline, the engagement was preapproved in accordance with established policies and procedures. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management and EY the audited financial statements, management's assessment of the effectiveness of Valvoline's internal control over financial reporting and EY's evaluation of Valvoline's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee further reviewed EY's judgment as to the quality and acceptability of Valvoline's accounting principles, financial reporting process and controls and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the "PCAOB"). In addition, the Audit Committee received and reviewed EY's independence from management and Valvoline including the matters in the written disclosures regarding EY's independence required by the PCAOB, and has discussed such matters with EY. The Audit Committee considered with EY whether the provision of non-audit services provided by them to the Company during 2018 was compatible with their independence. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board has approved) that Valvoline's consolidated financial statements be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

The Audit Committee Report does not constitute soliciting material, and shall not be deemed to be filed or incorporated by reference into any other filing under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that Valvoline specifically incorporates the Audit Committee Report by reference therein.

(3)  This figure represents 3,528,001 shares available for issuance under the 2016 Valvoline Inc. Incentive Plan and 2,000,000  shares available for issuance under the Valvoline Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Under the 2016 Valvoline Inc. Incentive Plan, full value awards, which include all awards other than options and stock-settled SARs, reduce the available share  reserve on a 4.5-to-1 basis.

(4)  This figure includes 237,251 shares that may be issued under the 2016 Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Director Plan") and 227,406 shares that may be issued under the 2016 Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees (the "Employee Plan"). Both plans are unfunded,  nonqualified deferred compensation plans. Eligible Directors in the Director Plan may elect to defer all or a portion of their annual retainer and other fees in hypothetical investment options, including mutual funds and Valvoline Common Stock. The  Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of its Common Stock for issuance under the Director Plan. The Employee Plan provides an opportunity for a select group of management and highly compensated employees to elect to defer up to 50% of their eligible  base salary and up to 75% of their incentive compensation as a means of saving for retirement or other future purposes. Participants elect how to invest their account balances from a diverse set of hypothetical investment options, including mutual  funds and Valvoline Common Stock. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of its Common Stock for issuance under the Employee Plan. Because these plans are not equity compensation plans as defined by the rules of the NYSE, neither plan required  approval by the Company's stockholders.

This Plan also provides an incentive for qualified persons, who are not officers or employees of the Company, to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company and to continue to work for the best interests of the Company by rewarding such persons with Option Awards, Stock Appreciation Rights Awards, Restricted Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Unit Awards.

(C)    Any shares of Common Stock underlying Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Recognition Awards, Incentive Awards, Performance Unit Awards and Dividend Equivalents (collectively, "Full-Value 
 Awards") that are issued or delivered under the Plan shall reduce the Plan Share Limit by (i) 4.5 shares for every one share of Common Stock issued or delivered in connection with any Full-Value Award made prior to January 31, 2019 and (ii) 4.0 shares for every one share of Common Stock issued or delivered in connection with any Full-Value Award and on or after January 31, 2019, and any shares covered by an Award other than a Full-Value Award shall reduce the Plan Share Limit by one share for every one share of Common Stock issued or delivered under such Award. Any shares of Common Stock that again become available for issuance or delivery pursuant to Section 3(B) of the Plan shall be credited toward the Plan Share Limit in the same manner as such shares were originally deducted from the Plan Share Limit pursuant to this Section 3(C). 
Section 4. Administration 
The Compensation Committee shall have the exclusive authority to administer this Plan. 
In addition to any implied powers and duties that may be needed to carry out the provisions hereof the Compensation Committee shall have all the powers vested in it by the terms hereof, including exclusive authority to select the Recipients, to determine the type, size and terms of the Awards to be made to each Recipient, to determine the time when Awards will be granted, and to prescribe the form of the Agreement embodying Awards made under this Plan. The Compensation Committee shall be authorized to interpret this Plan and the Awards (including Substitute Awards) granted under this Plan, to establish, amend and rescind any rules and regulations relating to this Plan, to provide for accelerated vesting of any outstanding Awards, to make any other determinations which it believes necessary or advisable for the administration hereof, and to correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in this Plan or in any Award in the manner and to the extent the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, deems desirable to carry it into effect. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, delegate to one or more directors or Employees any of the Compensation Committee's authority under this Plan. The acts of any such delegates shall be treated hereunder as acts of the Compensation Committee with respect to any matters so delegated. 
The Compensation Committee shall have no obligation to treat Recipients or eligible Employees or non-employee directors uniformly, and the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, make determinations under this Plan selectively among Recipients who receive, or Employees or directors who are eligible to receive, Awards (whether or not such Recipients or eligible Employees or directors are similarly situated). All determinations and decisions made by the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, pursuant to the provisions of this Plan and all related orders and resolutions of the Compensation Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company, its Subsidiaries, shareholders, Participants, Outside Directors, Employees, directors and their estates, Beneficiaries and Personal Representatives. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Board may reserve to itself any or all of the authority or responsibility of the Compensation Committee under this Plan or may act as the administrator of the Plan for any and all purposes. To the extent that the Board has reserved any such authority or responsibility or during any time that the Board is acting as administrator of the Plan, it shall have all the powers of the Compensation Committee hereunder, and any reference herein to the Compensation Committee (other than in this paragraph) shall include the Board. To the extent that any action of the Board under the Plan conflicts with any action of the Compensation Committee, the action of the Board shall control. 
Section 5. Eligibility 
Awards may only be granted to Participants and Outside Directors, provided that Outside Directors may not be granted ISOs, Incentive Awards, Performance Unit Awards or Recognition Awards. 
Section 6. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Awards 
(A)    Grant. Any Recipient may receive one or more Restricted Stock Awards or RSU Awards, as the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, shall from time to time determine. 
(B)    Restricted Periods. 
(1)    Participants. The Restricted Period for each Restricted Stock Award or RSU Award to a Participant shall be set forth in the applicable Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in an Agreement upon a termination of employment or pursuant to Section 12 in the event of a Change in Control, a Restricted Stock Award or RSU Award granted to a Participant shall have a minimum Restricted Period of (i) one (1) year in the case of restrictions that lapse based on the achievement of performance goals (including Performance Goals); and (ii) three (3) years in the case of restrictions that lapse based solely on the passage of time, which period may, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, lapse on a pro-rated, graded, or cliff basis (as specified in the Agreement); provided that in the Compensation Committee's sole discretion, no more than five percent (5%) of the shares of Common Stock available for issuance as Restricted Stock Awards or pursuant to RSU Awards under the Plan may be granted with a Restricted Period of less than three (3) years. 
(2)    Termination of Employment or Service. Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, in the event that a Restricted Stock Award or RSU Award has been made to a Recipient whose employment or service as a director is subsequently terminated for any reason prior to the lapse of all restrictions thereon, such Restricted Stock or RSU shall be forfeited in its entirety by such Recipient. 
Certain Restricted Stock Award Provisions. 
(1)    Shareholder Rights; Restrictions on Transferability. Upon the granting of a Restricted Stock Award, a Recipient shall be entitled to all rights incident to ownership of Common Stock of the Company with respect to his or her Restricted Stock, including, but not limited to, the right to vote such shares of Restricted Stock and to receive dividends thereon when, as and if paid in cash, shares of Restricted Stock or Dividend Equivalents, as set forth in the applicable Agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee, in its discretion. Each such grant of Restricted Stock may be made without additional consideration or in consideration of a payment by such Recipient that may be less than the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock at the date of grant. Subject to Section 16(B) hereof, Restricted Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, or otherwise encumbered during a Restricted Period. 
(2)    Restrictions; Dividends on Restricted Stock. During the Restricted Period, (a) any certificates representing the Restricted Stock shall be registered in the Recipient's name and bear a restrictive legend to the effect that ownership of such Restricted Stock, and the enjoyment of all rights appurtenant thereto are subject to the restrictions, terms, and conditions provided in this Plan and the applicable Agreement, and (b) all uncertificated shares of Restricted Stock shall be held by the Company (or its transfer agent) in book entry form with appropriate restrictions relating to the transfer of such shares of Restricted Stock and the other terms and conditions provided in the Plan. Any such certificates shall be deposited by the Recipient with the Company, together with stock powers or other instruments of assignment, each endorsed in blank, which will permit transfer to the Company of all or any portion of the Restricted Stock which shall be forfeited in accordance with this Plan and the applicable Agreement. Restricted Stock shall constitute issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock for all corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) the Recipient will not be entitled to delivery of any stock certificates representing such Restricted Stock until the restrictions applicable thereto shall have expired; (ii) the Company will retain custody of all shares of Restricted Stock issued as a dividend or otherwise with respect to an Award of Restricted Stock (and such issued shares of Restricted Stock shall be subject to the same restrictions, terms and conditions as are applicable to the awarded Restricted Stock) until such time, if ever, as such shares of Restricted Stock shall have become vested, and Restricted Stock shall not bear interest or be segregated in separate accounts; (iii) subject to Section 16(B) hereof, the Recipient may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, exchange, encumber, or dispose of any Restricted Stock during the Restricted Period; and (iv) unless otherwise determined and directed by the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, a breach of any restrictions, terms, or conditions provided in this Plan, the applicable Agreement or established by the Compensation Committee with respect to any Restricted Stock will cause a forfeiture of such awarded Restricted Stock (including any Restricted Stock issued as a dividend or otherwise) with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6(C)(2) to the contrary, cash dividends or other distributions with respect to Restricted Stock Awards that vest based on the achievement of performance goals (including Performance Goals) shall be accumulated until such Award is earned, and the cash dividends or other distributions shall not be paid if the performance goals (including Performance Goals) are not satisfied. 
(C)    Certain Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Award Provisions. 
(1)    General. Each RSU Award shall constitute an agreement by the Company to issue or deliver shares of Common Stock or cash to the Recipient following the end of the applicable Restricted Period in consideration of the performance of services. Each such grant of Restricted Stock Units may be made without additional consideration or in consideration of a payment by such Recipient that may be less than the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock at the date of grant. 
(2)    No Shareholder Rights; Dividend Equivalents. A Recipient who receives an RSU Award shall not have any rights as a shareholder with respect to the shares of Common Stock subject to such RSUs until such time, if any, that shares of Common Stock are delivered to the Recipient pursuant to the terms of the applicable Agreement. A Recipient who receives an RSU Award shall have such rights, if any, to Dividend Equivalents as shall be set forth in the applicable Agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee, in its discretion. 
(3)    Payment. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, each Agreement shall set forth the payment date for the RSU Award, which date shall not be earlier than the end of the applicable Restricted Period. Payment of earned Restricted Stock Units (and Dividend Equivalents, if applicable) may be made in one or more installments and may be made wholly in cash, wholly in shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof, as determined by the Compensation Committee, in its discretion. 
Section 7. Incentive Awards 
(A)    Grant. Any Participant may receive one or more Incentive Awards, as the Compensation Committee shall from time to time determine. 
(B)    Terms and Conditions. 
(1)    Performance Goals. No later than one hundred and twenty (120) days (or, in the case of Awards that are intended to qualify for the Performance-Based Exception, ninety (90) days or such shorter period as is required under the Performance-Based Exception) after the commencement of each Performance Period, the Compensation Committee shall establish in writing one or more performance goals (including Performance Goals) that must be reached by a Participant in order to receive an Incentive Award for such Performance Period. Except with respect to Awards that are intended to qualify for the Performance-Based Exception, the Compensation Committee shall have the discretion to later revise the performance goals (including Performance Goals) and the amount to be paid out upon the attainment of such goals for any reason, including the reflection of promotions, transfers or other changes in a Participant's employment so long as such changes are consistent with the performance goals (including Performance Goals) established for other Participants in the same or similar positions. Performance goals (including Performance Goals) established for Awards that are intended to qualify for the Performance-Based Exception may only be adjusted to reduce or eliminate the amount of compensation otherwise payable upon attainment of the performance goals (including Performance Goals). 
(2)    Award Limits. The target Incentive Award shall be a fixed percentage of the Participant's base salary paid during the year or such other value the Compensation Committee may determine appropriate. The maximum aggregate compensation that can be paid pursuant to an Incentive Award granted in any calendar year to any one Participant shall be ten million dollars ($10,000,000) or a number of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value (as of the date of grant) not in excess of such amount. 
(C)    Payment. Payment of Incentive Awards may be made in one or more installments and may be made wholly in cash, wholly in shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
 Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Agreement, payments shall be made no later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the later of (i) the end of the tax year of the Participant in which the Performance Period ends and (ii) the end of the tax year of the Company in which the Performance Period ends. 
If payment of an Incentive Award shall be made all or partially in shares of Common Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered to a Participant on any payment date shall be determined by dividing (x) the dollar amount of such Incentive Award to be paid (or the part thereof determined by the Compensation Committee to be delivered in shares) by (y) the Fair Market Value on the date the Compensation Committee approves payment of the Incentive Award or as of such other date or dates as the Compensation Committee shall determine. 
(D)    Termination. Unless otherwise provided in an Agreement or determined and directed by the Compensation Committee, an Incentive Award shall terminate if the Participant does not remain continuously employed and in good standing with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries until the last business day of the month immediately preceding the month in which such Incentive Award is otherwise payable. Unless otherwise provided in an Agreement or determined and directed by the Compensation Committee, in the event a Participant's employment is terminated because of death, Disability, Qualifying Termination or other employment termination event determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, the Participant (or his or her Beneficiaries or estate) shall receive the prorated portion of the payment of an Incentive Award for which the Participant would have otherwise been eligible, based upon the portion of the Performance Period during which he or she was so employed, at such time such Incentive Award is otherwise payable, so long as the performance goals (including Performance Goals) are subsequently achieved. 
Section 8. Performance Unit Awards 
(A)    Grant. Any Participant may receive one or more Performance Unit Awards, as the Compensation Committee shall from time to time determine. Each Performance Unit Award shall be established in dollars or shares of Common Stock, or a combination of both, as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
(B)    Performance Goals. The performance goals (including Performance Goals) and Performance Period applicable to a Performance Unit Award shall be set forth in writing by the Compensation Committee no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days (or, in the case of Awards that are intended to qualify for the Performance-Based Exception, ninety (90) days or such shorter period as is required under the Performance-Based Exception) after the commencement of the Performance Period. Except with respect to Awards that are intended to qualify for the Performance- Based Exception, the Compensation Committee shall have the discretion to later revise the performance goals (including any Performance Goals) and the amount to be paid out upon the attainment of such goals for any reason including the reflection of promotions, transfers or other changes in a Participant's employment so long as such changes are consistent with the Performance Goals established for other Participants in the same or similar positions. Goals established for Awards that are intended to qualify for the Performance-Based Exception may only be adjusted to reduce or eliminate the amount of compensation otherwise payable upon attainment of the Performance Goals. 
(C)    Payment. 
(1)    General. The amount of payment with respect to Performance Unit Awards shall be determined by the Compensation Committee and shall be based on the original amount of such Performance Unit Award (including any Dividend Equivalents with respect thereto) adjusted to reflect the attainment of the Performance Goals during the Performance Period. Payment may be made in one or more installments and may be made wholly in cash, wholly in shares of Common Stock or a combination thereof as determined by the Compensation Committee. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable Agreement, payments shall be made no later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the later of (i) the end of the tax year of the Participant in which the Performance Period ends and (ii) the end of the tax year of the Company in which the Performance Period ends. Any payment may be subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Compensation Committee may determine. 
(2)    Payment in Common Stock. If payment of a Performance Unit Award established in dollars is to be made in shares of Common Stock or partly in such shares, the number of shares of Common Stock to be delivered to a Participant on any payment date shall be determined by dividing (i) the amount payable with respect to such Performance Unit Award by (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the Compensation Committee approves payment of the Performance Unit Award or as of such other date or dates as the Compensation Committee shall determine. 
(3)    Payment in Cash. If payment of a Performance Unit Award established in shares of Common Stock is to be made in cash or partly in cash, the amount of cash to be paid to a Participant on any payment date shall be determined by multiplying (i) the number of shares of Common Stock to be paid in cash with respect to such Performance Unit Award, by (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the Compensation Committee approves payment of the Performance Unit Award or as of such other date or dates as the Compensation Committee shall determine. 
(D)    Termination. Unless otherwise provided in an Agreement or determined and directed by the Compensation Committee, a Performance Unit Award (including any Dividend Equivalents with respect thereto) shall terminate for all purposes if the Participant does not remain continuously employed and in good standing with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries until the last business day of the month immediately preceding the month in which such Performance Unit Award is otherwise payable. Unless otherwise provided in an Agreement or determined and directed by the Compensation Committee, a Participant (or his or her Beneficiaries or estate) whose employment was terminated because of death, Disability, Qualifying Termination or other employment termination event determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee will receive a prorated portion of the payment of his or her Performance Unit Award (including any Dividend Equivalents with respect thereto), based upon the portion of the Performance Period during which he or she was so employed, at such time as such Performance Unit Award is otherwise payable, so long as the Performance Goals are subsequently achieved. 
Section 9. Recognition Awards 
Any Participant may receive a Recognition Award under this Plan for such reasons and in such amounts as the Compensation Committee may from time to time determine. 
Section 10. Options and Sar Awards 
(A)    Grant. Any Recipient may receive one or more Option or SAR Awards, as the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, shall from time to time determine. 
(B)    Designation and Price. 
(1)    Any Option granted under this Plan may be granted as an Incentive Stock Option or as a Nonqualified Stock Option as shall be designated by the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, at the time of the grant of such Option. Only Participants may be granted ISOs. Each Option and SAR shall, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, be evidenced by an Agreement, which Agreement shall specify the designation of the Option as an ISO or a NQSO, as the case may be, and shall contain such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine in accordance with this Plan. 
(2)    Every ISO shall provide for a fixed expiration date of not later than ten (10) years from the date such ISO is granted. Every NQSO and SAR shall provide for a fixed expiration date of not later than ten (10) years and one month from the date such NQSO or SAR is granted. 
(3)    The Exercise Price of Common Stock issued pursuant to each Option or SAR shall be fixed by the Compensation Committee at the time of the granting of the Option or SAR; provided, however, that such Exercise Price shall in no event ever be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date such Option or SAR is granted, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 14. 
(C)    Exercise. The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, provide for Options or SARs granted under this Plan to be exercisable in whole or in part. The specified number of shares of Common Stock will be issued after receipt by the Company of (i) notice from the holder thereof of the exercise of an Option or SAR, and (ii) with respect to Options, payment to the Company (as provided in subsection (D) of this Section) of the Exercise Price for the number of shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Each such notice and payment shall be delivered or mailed to the Company at such place and in such manner as the Company may designate from time to time. 
(D)    Payment. 
(1)    Options. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 10, the Exercise Price for the Common Stock issuable pursuant to an Option shall be paid in full when the Option is exercised. Subject to such rules as the Compensation Committee in its discretion may impose, the Exercise Price may be paid in whole or in part: (i) in cash; (ii) by tendering (either by actual delivery or attestation) unencumbered shares of Common Stock previously acquired by the Recipient exercising such Option having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the total Exercise Price; (iii) by a combination of such methods of payment; or (iv) by such other consideration as shall constitute lawful consideration for the issuance of Common Stock and approved by the Compensation Committee in its discretion (including, without limitation, effecting a cashless exercise of the Option with a broker or by having the Company withhold shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to the exercise of the Option (for the avoidance of doubt, the shares of Common Stock so withheld shall be counted against the Plan Share Limit)). 
(2)    Stock Appreciation Rights. A SAR shall entitle the holder thereof, upon exercise, to surrender the SAR and receive in exchange therefore an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock at the time the SAR is exercised over (y) the Exercise Price specified in such SAR, (ii) multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock covered by such SAR, or portion thereof, which is so surrendered. Such amount shall be paid to the holder in shares of Common Stock the number of which shall be determined by dividing such amount by the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock at the time the holder makes an effective exercise of the right to receive such amount; provided that, subject to Section 15 hereof, the exercise of any SAR may be settled wholly in cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock as set forth in the Agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. 
(E)    Expiration or Termination of Awards. 
(1)    Participants. 
(a)    Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee, and subject to the provisions of Section 12(A) hereof, every Option and SAR granted to a Participant shall provide that it may not be exercised in whole or in part prior to the first anniversary of the date of its grant of granting such Option or SAR (unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee) and if the employment of the Participant shall terminate prior to the end of such first anniversary (or such other period determined by the Compensation Committee), the Option or SAR granted to such Participant shall immediately terminate. 
(b)    Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee, in the event the Participant dies (i) while employed, (ii) during the periods in which Options or SARs may be exercised by a Participant determined to be Disabled, or (iii) after Qualifying Termination, such Option or SAR shall be exercisable, at any time or from time to time, prior to the fixed termination date set forth in the Option or SAR, by the Beneficiaries of the decedent for the number of shares which the Participant could have acquired under the Option or SAR immediately prior to the Participant's death. 
(c)    Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee, in the event the employment of any Participant shall cease by reason of Disability, as determined by the Compensation Committee at any time during the term of the Option or SAR, such Option or SAR shall be exercisable, at any time or from time to time, prior to the fixed termination date set forth in the Option or SAR, by such Participant or his or her Personal Representative for the number of shares which the Participant could have acquired under the Option or SAR immediately prior to the Participant's Disability. The determination by the Compensation Committee of any question involving Disability of a Participant shall be conclusive and binding. 
(d)    Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee, in the event the employment of any Participant shall cease by reason of Qualifying Termination, such Option or SAR shall be exercisable, at any time or from time to time, prior to the fixed termination date set forth in the Option or SAR, for the number of shares which the Participant could have acquired under the Option or SAR immediately prior to such Qualifying Termination. 
(e)    Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, any Option or SAR may, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee or as provided in the relevant Agreement, become exercisable, at any time or from time to time, prior to the fixed termination date set forth in the Option or SAR, for the full number of awarded shares or any part thereof, less such number as may have been theretofore acquired under the Option or SAR from and after the time the Participant ceases to be an Employee as a result of the sale or other disposition by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of assets or property (including shares of any Subsidiary) in respect of which such Participant had theretofore been employed or as a result of which such Participant's continued employment is no longer required. 
(f)    Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 10(E)(1) and Sections 12(A) and 16(H) hereof, every Option and SAR shall terminate on the earlier to occur of the fixed termination date set forth in the Option or SAR or ninety (90) days after cessation of the Participant's employment for any reason in respect of the number of shares of Common Stock which the Participant could have acquired under the Option or SAR immediately prior to such cessation of employment; provided, however, that no Option or SAR may be exercised after the fixed termination date set forth in the Option or SAR, which shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant. 
(2)    Outside Directors. 
(a)    Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee, and subject to the provisions of Section 12(A) hereof, every Option and SAR granted to an Outside Director shall provide that, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, (i) it may not be exercised in whole or in part until the earlier to occur of (1) the one-year anniversary of the date of granting such Option or SAR and (2) the next annual meeting of shareholders immediately following the date of granting such Option or SAR and (ii) if the service of the Outside Director shall terminate prior to the end of such one year period (or such other period determined by the Compensation Committee), the Option or SAR granted to such Outside Director shall immediately terminate. 
(b)    Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement or as determined by the Compensation Committee, in the event the service of any Outside Director as a director of the Company ceases by reason of Qualifying Termination, death, Disability or other event as determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, then any unexercised Options or SARs granted to such Outside Director shall be exercisable, at any time or from time to time, prior to the fixed termination date set forth in the Option or SAR, by such Outside Director, his or her Personal Representative or his or her Beneficiaries for the number of shares which the Outside Director could have acquired under the Option or SAR immediately prior to the Outside Director's Qualifying Termination, death or Disability, as applicable. The determination by the Compensation Committee of any question involving Disability of an Outside Director shall be conclusive and binding. 
Section 11. Continued Employment 
Nothing in this Plan, or in any Award granted pursuant to this Plan, shall confer on any individual any right to continue in the employment of, or service (as an Outside Director or otherwise) to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the Participant's employment with or service to the Company at any time. 
Section 12. Change in Control 
(A)    Treatment of Awards. The following provisions of this Section 12(A) shall govern the treatment of Awards in the event of a Change in Control, except to the extent otherwise provided in an applicable Agreement: 
(1)    Outstanding Awards may be assumed, continued, converted or replaced by the surviving or resulting entity in connection with a Change in Control, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion prior to such Change in Control in accordance with Section 12(A)(3), without the consent of the affected Recipient. Any outstanding Award that is assumed, continued, converted or replaced by the surviving or resulting entity in connection with a Change in Control shall continue to vest (and become exercisable, as applicable) subject to the Recipient's continued employment or service with such surviving or resulting entity or its Subsidiaries in accordance with the vesting schedule and other terms set forth in the applicable Agreement; provided that, in the event of the termination of a Participant's employment with such surviving or resulting entity or its Subsidiaries without Cause during the two-year period immediately following the date of the Change in Control, any such Award (or portion thereof) that is then unvested shall immediately vest (and become exercisable, as applicable) and become free of all other restrictions. 
(2)    Any outstanding Award that is not assumed, continued, converted or replaced by the surviving or resulting entity in connection with a Change in Control shall immediately vest and become free of all other restrictions upon the date of the Change in Control. 
(3)    An Award will not be considered to be assumed, continued, converted or replaced by the surviving or resulting entity in connection with a Change in Control unless, in each case as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion prior to such Change in Control, the number and kind of shares or other securities underlying the Award, and the exercise prices and performance goals (including Performance Goals) applicable thereto, if any, are adjusted (or, in the case of performance goals (including Performance Goals), measured or deemed achieved in full or in part as of immediately prior to such Change in Control) to prevent dilution of the Recipient's rights hereunder and to preserve the intrinsic value and material terms and conditions of the Award as in effect as of immediately prior to the Change in Control. 
(B)    Cash-out of Awards. In connection with a Change in Control, the Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, and without the consent of the affected Recipient, either by the terms of the Agreement applicable to any Award or by resolution adopted prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control, provide that any outstanding Award (or a portion thereof) shall, upon the occurrence of such Change in Control, be cancelled in exchange for a payment in cash in an amount based on the Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award (less any Exercise Price), which amount may be zero (0), if applicable. 
Section 13. Withholding Taxes 
Federal, state, local, non-United States or other law may require the withholding of taxes applicable to gains resulting from the payment or vesting of an Award. Unless otherwise prohibited by the Compensation Committee, the Company may permit or require (subject to such conditions or procedures as may be established by the Compensation Committee in its discretion) any such tax withholding obligation of a Recipient to be satisfied by any of the following means, or by a combination of such means: (i) a cash payment from Recipient; (ii) withholding from the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to the Recipient pursuant to the vesting or exercise of an Award a number of shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value, as of the Tax Date, equal to the maximum amount that may be withheld under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 without creating an additional accounting charge; or (iii) having the Recipient deliver to the Company a number of shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value as of the Tax Date which will satisfy the withholding tax obligation (in whole or in part) arising from the vesting or exercise of an Award. If the payment specified in clauses (i) or (iii) of the preceding sentence is not paid by a Recipient, the Compensation Committee may refuse to issue Common Stock under this Plan. 
Section 14. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization 
In the event of any change in the outstanding Common Stock of the Company by reason of any stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, combination, or exchange of shares, split-up, split-off, stock distribution, liquidation or other similar change in capitalization, or any distribution to common shareholders other than normal cash dividends, the number or kind of shares (or other property) that may be issued under this Plan pursuant to Section 3 hereof, the number or kind of shares (or other property) subject to any outstanding Award and the price per share and performance goals applicable to any outstanding Award shall be automatically adjusted, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, so that the proportionate interest of the Recipient shall be maintained as before the occurrence of such event. Such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes hereof. 
Awards may, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, be granted under this Plan in assumption of, or in substitution for, the Assumed Valvoline Awards and outstanding awards previously granted by a company acquired by the Company or any of its affiliates or with which the Company or any of its affiliates combines ("Substitute Awards"). The number of Shares underlying any Substitute Awards (including the Assumed Valvoline Awards) shall not be counted against the Plan Share Limit; provided, however, that, Substitute Awards issued in connection with the assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding stock options intended to qualify for special tax treatment under Sections 421 and 422 of the Code that were previously granted by a company that is acquired by the Company or any of its affiliates or with which the Company or any of its affiliates combines shall be counted against number of shares of Common Stock which may be delivered with respect to ISO Awards. Except as otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, any Substitute Awards granted under this Plan in assumption of, or in substitution of, the Assumed Valvoline Awards shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as were in effect with respect to the Assumed Valvoline Awards as of immediately prior to such assumption or substitution. 
Section 15. Amendment and Termination 
The Board may amend, alter, suspend or terminate this Plan in whole or in part and at any time; provided, however, that no alteration or amendment that requires shareholder approval in order for the Plan to continue to comply with the New York Stock Exchange rules or any rule promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other securities exchange on which shares of Common Stock are listed or any other applicable laws shall be effective unless such amendment shall be approved by the requisite vote of shareholders of the Company entitled to vote thereon within the time period required under such applicable listing standard or rule. 
Except for adjustments made pursuant to Section 14 hereof, the Board or the Compensation Committee will not, without the further approval of the shareholders of the Company, authorize the amendment of any outstanding Option or SAR to reduce the Exercise Price. No Option or SAR will be cancelled and replaced with Awards having a lower Exercise Price or for another Award or for cash without further approval of the shareholders of the Company, except as provided in Section 12 or 14 hereof. Furthermore, no Option or SAR will provide for the payment, at the time of exercise, of a cash bonus or grant or sale of another Award without further approval of the shareholders of the Company. This Section 15 is intended to prohibit the cash-out or repricing of "underwater" Options or SARs without shareholder approval and will not be construed to prohibit the adjustments provided for in Section 12 or 14 hereof. 
Termination of this Plan shall not affect any Awards made hereunder which are outstanding on the date of termination and such Awards shall continue to be subject to the terms of this Plan notwithstanding its termination. Except as otherwise provided pursuant to this Plan, no amendment, suspension, or modification of this Plan or an Agreement shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted under the Plan, without the written consent of the Recipient holding such Award; provided that the Compensation Committee in its discretion may modify an ISO held by a Participant to disqualify such Option from treatment as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code without the Participant's consent. 
Section 16. Miscellaneous Provisions 
(A)    Rights to Awards. No Recipient or other person shall have any claim or right to be granted an Award under this Plan. 
(B)    Assignment and Transfer. A Recipient's rights and interests under this Plan (including any Awards granted hereunder) may not be assigned or transferred in whole or in part, either directly or by operation of law or otherwise (except in the event of a Recipient's death, by will or the laws of descent and distribution), including, but not by way of limitation, execution, levy, garnishment, attachment, pledge, bankruptcy or in any other manner, and no such rights or interests of any Recipient in this Plan shall be subject to any obligation or liability of such individual; provided, however, that a Recipient's rights and interests under this Plan (including any Awards granted hereunder) may, subject to the discretion and direction of the Compensation Committee, be made transferable by such Recipient during his or her lifetime. Except as specified in Section 6 hereof, the holder of an Award shall have none of the rights of a shareholder until the shares subject thereto shall have been registered in the name of the person receiving or person or persons exercising the Award on the transfer books of the Company. 
(C)    Compliance with Legal and Exchange Requirements. The Plan, the granting and exercising of Awards hereunder, the issuance of Common Stock and other interests hereunder, and the other obligations of the Company under the Plan and any Agreement pursuant to the Plan, shall be subject to all applicable United States federal and state laws, rules and regulations, the applicable laws, rules and regulations of any other country or jurisdiction, and to such approvals by any regulatory or governmental agency as may be required. The Company or the Compensation Committee, in their respective discretion, may postpone the granting, vesting and exercising of Awards, the issuance or delivery of Common Stock under any Award or any other action permitted under the Plan to permit the Company, with reasonable diligence, to complete such stock exchange listing or registration or qualification of such Common Stock or other required action under any federal or state law, rule, or regulation and may require any Recipient to make such representations and furnish such information as the Compensation Committee may consider appropriate in connection with the issuance or delivery of Common Stock in compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The Company shall not be obligated by virtue of any provision of the Plan to recognize the vesting or exercise of any Award or to otherwise sell or issue Common Stock in violation of any such laws, rules, or regulations; and any postponement of the vesting, exercise or settlement of any Award under this provision shall not extend the term of such Awards, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, directors or officers shall have any obligations or liability to any Recipient with respect to any Award (or Common Stock issuable thereunder) that shall lapse because of such postponement. 
(D)    Ratification and Consent. By accepting any Award under this Plan, each Recipient and each Personal Representative or Beneficiary claiming under or through him or her shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated his or her acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, any action taken under this Plan by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Board, or the Compensation Committee in its discretion. 
(E)    Additional Compensation. Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to shareholder approval if such approval is required. 
(F)    Grant Date. Each Recipient shall be deemed to have been granted any Award on the date the Compensation Committee took action to grant such Award under this Plan or such date as the Compensation Committee in its discretion shall determine at the time such Award is authorized. The grant date shall not be earlier than the date of the resolution and action therein by the Compensation Committee. 
(G)    Fractional Shares. No fractional shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to this Plan or any Award. The Compensation Committee in its discretion shall determine whether cash, other Awards, or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of fractional shares or whether such fractional shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated. 
(H)    Forfeiture Provision. Unless the Agreement specifies otherwise, the Compensation Committee in its discretion may require a Recipient to forfeit all unexercised, unearned, unvested or unpaid Awards if: 
(1)    the Recipient, without written consent of the Company, engages directly or indirectly in any manner or capacity as principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee or otherwise in any business or activity competitive with the business conducted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion; 
(2)    the Recipient performs any act or engages in any activity that is detrimental to the best interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion; or 
(3)    the Recipient breaches any agreement or covenant with, or obligation or duty to, the Company or any Subsidiary, including without limitation, any non-competition agreement, non-solicitation agreement, confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement, or assignment of inventions or ownership of works agreement, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. 
(I)    Compensation Recovery Policy. Each Award granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be subject to forfeiture or repayment pursuant to the terms of any applicable compensation recovery policy adopted by the Company as in effect from time to time, including any such policy that may be adopted or amended to comply with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or any rules or regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission or applicable securities exchange. 
(J)    Severability. The validity, legality, or enforceability of the Plan will not be affected even if one or more of the provisions of this Plan shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect. 
(K)    Section 409A. The Company intends that Awards granted under the Plan will be designed and administered in such a manner that they are either exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. To the extent that the Compensation Committee in its discretion determines that any award granted under the Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Agreement shall incorporate the terms and conditions necessary to avoid the imposition of an additional tax under Section 409A of the Code upon a Recipient. The Compensation Committee reserves the right to make amendments to any Award as it deems necessary or desirable to avoid the imposition of taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Agreement (unless the Agreement provides otherwise with specific reference to this Section): (i) an Award shall not be granted, deferred, accelerated, extended, paid out, settled, substituted or modified under the Plan in a manner that would result in the imposition of an additional tax under Section 409A of the Code upon a Recipient; and (ii) if an Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code, and if the Recipient holding the Award is a "specified employee" (as defined in Section 409A of the Code, with such classification to be determined in accordance with the methodology established by the Company), no distribution or payment of any amount under the Award as a result of such Recipient's "separation from service" (as defined in Section 409A of the Code) shall be made before a date that is six (6) months following the date of such separation from service or, if earlier, the date of the Recipient's death. Although the Company intends to administer the Plan so that Awards will be exempt from, or will comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Company does not warrant that any Award under the Plan will qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 409A of the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local, non-United States or other law. The Company shall not be liable to any Recipient for any tax, interest, or penalties a Recipient might owe as a result of the grant, holding, vesting, exercise, or payment of any Award under the Plan. 
(L)    Awards to Participants Outside the United States. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in order to comply with the laws in other countries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate or have Employees or otherwise to foster and promote achievement of the purposes of this Plan, the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, shall have the power and authority, without any amendment to the Plan, to: (i) determine which non-United States Subsidiaries shall be covered by this Plan; (ii) determine which foreign nationals and Employees outside the United States are eligible to participate in this Plan; (iii) modify the terms and conditions of any Award granted to Participants who are foreign nationals, who are employed outside the United States or who are otherwise subject to the laws of one or more non-United States jurisdictions; (iv) grant Awards to Participants who are foreign nationals, who are employed outside the United States or who are otherwise subject to the laws of one or more non-United States jurisdictions, on such terms and conditions different from those specified in the Plan; (v) modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures with respect to such Participants, to the extent such actions may be necessary or advisable; and (vi) take any action, before or after an Award is made, that it deems necessary or advisable to obtain approval or comply with any local government regulatory exemptions, approvals or requirements. 
Notwithstanding the above, the Compensation Committee may not take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted that would violate any applicable law. 
(M)    Headings. The headings in this Plan are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation hereof. 
(N)    Dividend Equivalents. At the discretion of the Compensation Committee, Awards granted pursuant to the Plan may provide Recipients with the right to receive Dividend Equivalents, which may be paid currently or credited to an account for the Recipients, and may be settled in cash and/or shares of Common Stock, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, subject in each case to such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee shall establish. No Dividend Equivalents shall relate to shares underlying an Option or SAR unless such Dividend Equivalent rights are explicitly set forth as a separate arrangement and do not cause any such Option or SAR to be subject to Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the contrary, Dividend Equivalents with respect to Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Incentive Awards, Performance Unit Awards and Recognition Awards that vest based on the achievement of Performance Goals shall be accumulated until such Award is earned, and the Dividend Equivalents shall not be paid if the Performance Goals are not satisfied. 
(O)    Deferrals. Except with respect to Options and SARs, the Compensation Committee in its discretion may permit Recipients to elect to defer the issuance or delivery of shares of Common Stock or the settlement of Awards in cash under the Plan pursuant to such rules, procedures or programs as it may establish for purposes of the Plan. The Compensation Committee in its discretion also may provide that deferred issuances and settlements include the payment or crediting of Dividend Equivalents or interest on the deferral amounts. All elections and deferrals permitted under this provision shall comply with Section 409A of the Code, including setting forth the time and manner of the election (including a compliant time and form of payment), the date on which the election is irrevocable, and whether the election can be changed until the date it is irrevocable. 
(P)    Successors. All obligations of the Company under the Plan and with respect to Awards shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or other event, or a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company and references to the "Company" herein and in any Agreements shall be deemed to refer to such successors. 
Section 17. Effectiveness of this Plan 
This Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Date. No Award may be granted under the Plan after the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date, or such earlier date as the Board shall determine. The Plan will remain in effect with respect to outstanding Awards until no Awards remain outstanding. 
Section 18. Governing Law 
The provisions of this Plan shall be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
