Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Meeting To Be Held on March 21, 2019
This Proxy Statement is available online free of charge at www.proxyvote.com.
Other Methods of Proxy Solicitation
In addition to the solicitation of proxies by Internet or mail, regular employees of KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC (the           "Adviser") and officers and employees of U.S. Bancorp Fund Services LLC ("US Bancorp"), the Fund's transfer agent and administrator, may also solicit proxies by telephone, Internet or in person and will not receive any compensation therefor from           the Fund.  The Fund has also engaged Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge"), an independent proxy solicitation firm, to assist in the distribution of the proxy materials and the solicitation and tabulation of proxies.  The cost of           Broadridge's services with respect to the Fund is estimated to be approximately $20,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.  The Fund will pay all expenses incurred in connection with preparing the Proxy Statement and its enclosures and           expenses associated with proxy solicitation.  The Fund will also reimburse brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of the Fund's Shares (as defined below).
The Fund's most recent annual and semi-annual report, including audited financial statements for the           year ended October 31, 2018, is available upon request, without charge, by writing to the Fund at c/o KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, 555 California Street, 50th           Floor, San Francisco, California 94104, by calling the Fund at 1-855-862-6092, or via the Internet at www.kkrfunds.com/kio.
If the enclosed proxy card is properly executed and returned in time to be voted at the Meeting and has           not been revoked, the Shares (as defined below) represented thereby will be voted "FOR" the proposal listed in the Notice, unless instructions to the contrary are marked thereon, and in the discretion of the proxy holders as to the transaction of           any other business that may properly come before the Meeting or any postponements or adjournments thereof. Any shareholder who has given a proxy has the right to revoke it at any time prior to its exercise either by attending the Meeting and           voting his or her shares in person or by submitting a letter of revocation or a later-dated proxy to the Fund at the above address prior to the date of the Meeting.
The holders of one third of the Shares entitled to vote on any matter at the Meeting present in person           or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at the Meeting for purposes of conducting business.  If a quorum is not present at the Meeting, or if a quorum is present at the Meeting, but sufficient votes to approve any of the proposed items are not           received, the Chairman of the Meeting may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies.  A shareholder vote may be taken on one or more of the proposals in this Proxy Statement prior to such           adjournment if sufficient votes have been received for approval and it is otherwise appropriate.  Any such adjournment, if proposed by the Chairman of the Meeting, will require the approval of the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares           present at the Meeting in person or by proxy.  If a quorum is present, the persons named as proxies will vote those proxies that they are entitled to vote "FOR" any proposal in favor of such adjournment and will vote those proxies required to be           voted "AGAINST" any proposal against such adjournment.

As of the Record Date, there were           20,340,314.602 Shares outstanding. In order that your Shares may be represented at the Meeting, you are requested to vote on the following matter:
PROPOSAL:
ELECTION OF CLASS II NOMINEE
TO THE FUND'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES
Election of Class II Nominee ("Nominee") for the Fund's Board of Trustees (the "Board")
The Fund's Board is currently comprised of four Trustees, three of whom are not "interested persons" of the Fund as that           term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 Act, as amended (the "1940 Act") (the "Independent Trustees"): Michael E. Cahill, Suzanne Donohoe, Tobin V. Levy and Jeffrey L. Zlot.  At a meeting of the Board held on December 13, 2018, the           Board, upon the recommendation of the Board's Nominating Committee, determined to submit to a vote of shareholders re-election of Mr. Levy as an Independent Trustee of the Fund. If elected by shareholders at the Meeting, Mr. Levy will hold office           for a three-year term and until his successor is duly elected and qualifies.
Unless authority is withheld, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy to vote the proxy "FOR" the election           of Mr. Levy.  Mr. Levy has indicated his consent to serve as a Trustee if approved by shareholders at the Meeting. If Mr. Levy declines or otherwise becomes unavailable for election, however, the proxy confers discretionary power on the persons           named therein to vote in favor of a substitute nominee or nominees.
The Fund's Board is responsible for the management of the business and affairs of the Fund in accordance with the laws           of the State of Delaware.  The Board appoints officers who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Fund and who execute policies authorized by the Board.
The current Trustees of the Fund know of no reason why Mr. Levy will be unable to serve.
Information about the Nominee's and each Trustee's Experience
Provided below is a brief               summary of the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of Mr. Levy that warrant his consideration as Nominee for the Fund's               Board.
Mr. Levy was selected to join the Board based upon the following: his character and integrity; his           service as a member of other boards of directors; his prior experience as an executive of Goldman Sachs & Co.; his prior experience in management roles at Caisee Nationale de Credit Agricole, Norwest Bank and First Pennsylvania Corporation;           and his willingness to serve and willingness and ability to commit the time necessary to perform the duties of a Trustee.
No factor, by itself, was controlling. In addition to the information provided in the table included below, Mr. Levy           possesses significant experience as an investment professional.  References to the qualifications, attributes and skills of the Trustees are pursuant to requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), do not constitute           holding out the Board or any Trustees as having any special expertise or experience, and shall not impose any greater responsibility or liability on any such person or on the Board by reason thereof.

Board Leadership Structure
The Board is currently composed of four Trustees, three of whom are Independent Trustees.  The Fund's           business and affairs are managed under the direction of its Board. Among other things, the Board sets broad policies for the Fund and approves the appointment of the Fund's Administrator and officers. The role of the Board, and of any individual           Trustee, is one of oversight and not of management of the Fund's day-to-day affairs.
Under the Fund's By-Laws, the Board may designate one of the Trustees as chair to preside over meetings           of the Board and meetings of shareholders, and to perform such other duties as may be assigned to him or her by the Board.  Presently, Suzanne Donohoe serves as Chair of the Board and is an Interested Trustee by virtue of her employment           relationship with an affiliate of the Adviser. The Board believes that it is in the best interests of Fund shareholders for Ms. Donohoe to serve as Chair of the Board because of her significant experience in matters of relevance to the Fund's           business.  The Board does not, at the present time, have a lead Independent Trustee; the Board has determined that the compositions of the Audit Committee and the Nominating Committee are appropriate means to address any potential conflicts of           interest that may arise from the Chair's status as an Interested Trustee.  The Board believes that flexibility to determine its chair and to recognize its leadership structure is in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders at this           time. All of the Independent Trustees play an active role on the Board.  The Independent Trustees compose a           majority of the Board and will be closely involved in all material deliberations related to the Fund.  The Board believes that, with these practices, each Independent Trustee has an equal involvement in the actions and oversight role of the Board           and equal accountability to the Fund and its shareholders.  The Independent Trustees are expected to meet separately (i) as part of each regular Board meeting and (ii) with the Fund's chief compliance officer, as part of at least one Board           meeting each year.
The Board believes that its leadership structure is the optimal structure for the Fund at this time.            The Board, which will review its leadership structure periodically as part of its annual self-assessment process, further believes that its structure is presently appropriate to enable it to exercise its oversight of the Fund.
Board Role in Risk Oversight
The Trustees meet periodically throughout the year to discuss and consider matters concerning the Fund           and to oversee the Fund's activities, including its investment performance, compliance program and risks associated with its activities.  Risk management is a broad concept comprising many disparate elements (for example, investment risk, issuer           and counterparty risk, compliance risk, operational risk, and business continuity risk).  The Board implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and through its committees.  The Board has adopted, and periodically reviews, policies and           procedures designed to address risks associated with the Fund's activities.  In the course of providing oversight, the Board and its committees will receive reports on the Fund's and the Adviser's activities, including reports regarding the           Fund's investment portfolio and financial accounting and reporting.  The Board also receives a quarterly report from the Fund's chief compliance officer, who reports on the Fund's compliance with the federal and state securities laws and its           internal compliance policies and procedures as well as those of the Adviser, Administrator and transfer agent.  The Audit Committee's meetings with the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm also contribute to its oversight of           certain internal control risks.  In addition, the Board meets periodically with the Adviser to receive reports regarding the Fund's operations, including reports on certain investment and operational risks, and the Independent Trustees will be           encouraged to communicate directly with senior members of Fund management.
The Board believes that this role in risk oversight is appropriate.  The Board believes that the Fund           has robust internal processes in place and a strong internal control environment to identify and manage risks.  However, not all risks that may affect the Fund can be identified or processes and controls developed to eliminate or mitigate their           occurrence or effects, and some risks are beyond the control of the Fund, the Adviser and the Fund's other service providers.
Shareholder Communications
Shareholders may send communications to the Board.  Shareholders should send communications intended for           the Board by addressing the communication directly to the Board (or individual Trustees) and/or otherwise clearly indicating in the salutation that the communication is for the Board (or individual Trustees) and by sending the communication to           either the Fund's office or directly to such Trustee(s) at the address specified for such Trustee above.  Other shareholder communications received by the Fund not directly addressed and sent to the Board will be reviewed and generally responded           to by management, and will be forwarded to the Board only at management's discretion based on the matters contained therein.
Audit Committee Reports
The Audit Committee acts according to an Audit Committee charter. Tobin V. Levy serves as Chair of the Audit Committee           of the Fund's Board. The Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities relating to accounting and financial reporting policies and practices of the Fund, including, but not limited to, the           adequacy of the Fund's accounting and financial reporting processes, policies and practices; the integrity of the Fund's financial statements; the adequacy of the Fund's overall system of internal controls; the Fund's compliance with legal and           regulatory requirements; the qualification and independence of the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm; the performance of the Fund's internal audit function provided by the Adviser and the Fund's other service providers; and the           review of the report required to be included in the Fund's annual proxy statement by the rules of the SEC. The Audit Committee is also required to prepare an audit committee report to be included in the Fund's annual proxy statement as required           by Item 407(d)(3)(i) of Regulation S-K. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a charter that was most recently reviewed by the Fund's Board on December 13, 2018. A copy of the Audit Committee's charter is attached hereto as Appendix A.  As set           forth in the charter, the function of the Audit Committee is oversight; it is the responsibility of the Adviser to maintain appropriate systems for accounting and internal control, and the independent auditors' responsibility to plan and carry           out a proper audit. The independent registered public accounting firm is ultimately accountable to the Fund's Board and Audit Committee, as representatives of the Fund's shareholders. The independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund           reports directly to the Audit Committee. In performing its oversight function, at a meeting held on December 13, 2018, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed           with management of the Fund and the independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte"), the audited financial statements of the Fund as of and for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, and discussed the audit           of such financial statements with the independent registered public accounting firm.
The Audit Committee has: (a) reviewed and discussed the Fund's audited financial statements with the management of the           Fund; (b) discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 16, as modified or supplemented; (c) received the           written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526 regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's           communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the independent registered public accounting firm's independence.
The members of the Audit Committee are not, and do not represent themselves to be, professionally engaged in the           practice of auditing or accounting and are not employed by the Fund for accounting, financial management or internal control purposes. Moreover, the Audit Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it or           representations made by management or the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting           and/or financial reporting principles and policies, or internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions           referred to above do not provide assurance that the audit of the Fund's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with           generally accepted accounting principles.
Based on its consideration of the audited financial statements and the discussions referred to above with management and           the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of the Audit Committee set forth in the charter and those discussed above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that           the Fund's audited financial statements be included in the Fund's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.

AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER
FOR KKR INCOME OPPORTUNITIES FUND
I. Audit Committee Membership and Qualifications
The Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee" or "Committee") of KKR Income Opportunities Fund (the "Trust") shall consist of at least two members appointed by the Boards of Trustees of the Trust (the "Board"). The Board may replace members of the Audit Committee for any reason.
No member of the Audit Committee shall be an "interested person" of the Trust, as that term is defined in Section           2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"), nor shall any member receive any compensation from           the Trust except compensation for service as a member of the Board or a committee of the Board. Each member of the Audit Committee must also meet the independence and experience requirements as they may be adopted and modified from time to time           by the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"). No member of the Committee may serve on the audit committees of more than three public companies           (including the audit committees of those funds that are registered pursuant to the Investment Company Act and managed by KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC (the "Adviser"), with such audit committees deemed for these purposes to be the audit committee of a single public company), unless the Board determines that such simultaneous service would not impair the ability of such member to serve           on the Committee effectively.  If such a determination is made by the Board, the listed Trust must disclose it on the fund's website, in its annual proxy statement (if any), or in the fund's annual report.
Each member of the Audit Committee must be financially literate, as that qualification is interpreted by the Board in           its business judgment, or must become financially literate within a reasonable time after appointment to the Audit Committee. The Board may presume that an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR ("ACFE") satisfies the requirement in the foregoing sentence.  The Board shall determine annually whether any member of the Audit Committee is an           ACFE.  The Committee's composition shall meet such other regulatory requirements relating to audit committees established from time to time by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and any other applicable governmental entity or           self-regulatory organization or law to which the Trust are subject.
II. Purposes of the Audit Committee
The purposes of the Audit Committee are:
A. to oversee the accounting and financial reporting processes of  the Trust and its internal control over financial reporting           and, as the Committee deems appropriate, to inquire into the internal control over financial reporting of certain third-party service providers;
B. to oversee, or, as appropriate, assist Board oversight of, the quality and integrity of the Trust's financial statements and           the independent audit thereof;
C. to oversee, or, as appropriate, assist Board oversight of, the Trust's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements that           relate to the Trust's accounting and financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting and independent audits;
D. to approve prior to appointment the engagement of the Trust's independent auditors and, in connection therewith, to review and           evaluate the qualifications, independence and performance of the Trust's independent auditors;
E. to act as a liaison between the Trust's independent auditors and the full Board;
F. to assist Board oversight of the Trust's internal audit function (if any). The independent auditors for the Trusts shall report directly to the Audit Committee.
III. Duties and Powers of the Audit Committee
To carry out its purposes, the Audit Committee shall have the following duties and powers:
A. to approve prior to appointment the engagement of auditors to annually audit and provide their opinion on the Trust's           financial statements, to recommend to those Board members who are not "interested persons" (as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act) the selection, retention or termination of the Trust's independent auditors           and, in connection therewith, to review and evaluate matters potentially affecting the independence and capabilities of the auditors.  In evaluating the auditor's qualifications, performance and independence, the Audit Committee must, among other           things, obtain and review a report by the auditor, at least annually, describing the following items:
1. all relationships between the independent auditor and the Trust, including each non-audit service provided to the Trust,           consistent with the requirements of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Ethics and Independence Rule 3526;
2. any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by           any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within the preceding five years, respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm, and any steps taken to deal with any such issues; and
3. the audit firm's internal quality-control procedures.
B. to approve prior to appointment the engagement of the auditor to provide other audit services to the Trust or to provide           non-audit services to the Trust, any of its investment advisers or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such an investment adviser ("adviser affiliate") that provides ongoing services to the Trust, if the engagement           relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Trust;
C. to develop, to the extent deemed appropriate by the Audit Committee, policies and procedures for pre-approval of the           engagement of the Trust's auditors to provide any of the services described in B above;
D. to consider the controls applied by the auditors and any measures taken by management in an effort to assure that all items           requiring preapproval by the Audit Committee are identified and referred to the Committee in a timely fashion;
E. to consider whether the non-audit services provided by the Trust's auditor to the Trust's investment adviser(s) or any adviser           affiliate that provides ongoing services to the Trust, which services were not preapproved by the Audit Committee, are compatible with maintaining the auditor's independence;

T. at least annually, obtain and review a report by the Trust's independent auditors describing: (i) the independent auditors'           internal quality-control procedures; (ii) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the independent auditors, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities,           within the preceding five years, respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the independent auditors, and any steps taken to deal with such issues; and (iii) (to assess the independent auditors' independence) all relationships           between the independent auditor and the Trust;

Any decisions of the subcommittee to grant pre-approvals shall be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
IV. Role and Responsibilities of the Audit Committee
The function of the Audit Committee is oversight; it is management's responsibility to maintain appropriate systems           for accounting and internal control over financial reporting, and the auditor's responsibility to plan and carry out a proper audit. Specifically, the Trust's management is responsible for: (i) the preparation, presentation and integrity of the           Trust's financial statements; (ii) the maintenance of appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies; and (iii) the maintenance of internal control over financial reporting and other procedures designed to assure           compliance with accounting standards and related laws and regulations. The independent auditors are responsible for planning and carrying out an audit consistent with applicable legal and professional standards and the terms of their engagement           letter. Nothing in this Charter shall be construed to reduce the responsibilities or liabilities of the Trust's service providers, including the auditors.
Although the Audit Committee is expected to take a detached and questioning approach to the matters that come before           it, the review of a Trust's financial statements by the Audit Committee is not an audit, nor does the Committee's review substitute for the responsibilities of the Trust's management for preparing, or the independent auditors for auditing, the           financial statements. Members of the Audit Committee are not full-time employees of the Trust and, in serving on this Committee, are not, and do not hold themselves out to be, acting as accountants or auditors. As such, it is not the duty or           responsibility of the Committee or its members to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews or procedures.
In discharging his or her duties, a member of the Audit Committee is entitled to rely on information, opinions,           reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by: (i) one or more officers of the Trust whom the trustee reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; (ii)           legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the trustee reasonably believes are within the person's professional or expert competence; or (iii) a Board committee of which the trustee is not a member. V. Operations of the Audit Committee
A. The Audit Committee shall meet on a regular basis and is empowered to hold special meetings as circumstances require. The           chair or a majority of the members shall be authorized to call a meeting of the Audit Committee and send notice thereof.
B. Audit Committee members may attend Committee meetings telephonically (although they are encouraged to attend in person), and           the Committee may act by written consent, to the extent permitted by law and by the Trust's By-Laws.
C. The Audit Committee shall have the authority to meet privately and to admit non-members individually by invitation.
D. The Audit Committee shall regularly meet, in separate executive sessions, with representatives of Trust management, the           Trust's internal auditors or other personnel responsible for the Trust's internal audit function (if any) and the Trust's independent auditors. The Committee may also request to meet with internal legal counsel and compliance personnel of the           Trust's investment adviser and with entities that provide significant accounting or administrative services to the Trust to discuss matters relating to the Trust's accounting and compliance as well as other Trust related matters.
E. The Audit Committee shall prepare and retain minutes of its meetings and appropriate documentation of decisions made outside           of meetings by delegated authority.
F. The Audit Committee may select one of its members to be the chair and may select a vice chair.
G. A majority of the members of the Audit Committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of           the Committee. The action of a majority of the members of the Audit Committee present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the action of the Committee.
H. The Board shall adopt and approve this Charter and may amend it on the Board's own motion. The Audit Committee shall review           this Charter at least annually and recommend to the full Board any changes the Committee deems appropriate.
I. The Audit Committee shall evaluate its performance at least annually.
