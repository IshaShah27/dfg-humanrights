Dear Fellow Shareholders, 
On behalf of the Board and management of Encana Corporation, we thank you for your continued support. 
Since launching our strategy in 2013, Encana has been relentlessly focused on becoming a leading North American, multi-basin, unconventional resource company. 
Our recent acquisition of Newfield Exploration Company accelerated execution of this objective by adding a highly desirable entry into the core oil window of the Anadarko basin. Combined with our existing growth assets in the Permian and Montney, this large-scale, liquids-weighted growth asset significantly enhances our premium inventory, investment optionality and resilience, which we believe represent key drivers of shareholder value. The transaction also enhanced our ability to return capital to shareholders through a corresponding 25 percent increase to our dividend and $1.25 billion share buyback program. 
Please join us at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Tuesday, April 30, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. MDT. The meeting will be held in Calgary, Alberta at the Oddfellows Building, Ballroom (Floor 4), 100 – 6th Avenue S.W. Live coverage will be available on our website at www.encana.com. Audio recording will be available on our website after the meeting. 
As a shareholder, you have the right to participate in and vote your common shares on items of business at the meeting. This proxy statement describes business to be conducted at the meeting and provides important information about our nominated directors, corporate governance practices and approach to executive compensation. This information is to assist you in deciding how to vote your common shares. In addition to ordinary business, two special items will be proposed to shareholders at the meeting: (i) introduction of a new Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan; and (ii) amendment and reconfirmation of our Shareholder Rights Plan. 
Your vote and participation at the meeting are important. Please review this proxy statement before the meeting. 
We look forward to your participation at the meeting on April 30, 2019. 
Sincerely, 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Only shareholders of record at close of business on the Record Date can vote at the Meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof). For each Common Share held, shareholders are entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted upon at the Meeting. 
Our shareholders do not have dissenters' rights or similar rights of appraisal regarding matters described in this Proxy Statement and do not have cumulative voting rights with respect to election of directors. 
Who is Soliciting my Proxy? 
Encana management is soliciting your proxies in connection with this Proxy Statement and the Meeting. Proxies will be solicited by mail, in person, by telephone or by electronic communications. The cost of this solicitation is borne by the Company. Encana has retained Kingsdale Advisors ("Kingsdale") as our strategic shareholder advisor and proxy solicitation agent, to assist with our communications with shareholders and solicitation of proxies. For these services, Kingsdale will receive a fee of $55,000 and will be reimbursed by Encana for reasonable disbursements and out-of-pocket expenses. Encana may also reimburse brokers and other persons holding Common Shares in their name or in the name of nominees for costs incurred in sending proxy materials to their principals to obtain their proxies. 
Encana may also use Broadridge Financial Solution Inc.'s ("Broadridge") QuickVote™ service to assist non-registered shareholders with voting their Common Shares. Kingsdale may contact non-registered shareholders to directly obtain a vote over the telephone. 
How Do I Appoint a Proxyholder? 
Shareholders wishing to be represented by proxy at the Meeting must return a properly executed proxy to Encana or its agent, AST Trust Company (Canada) ("AST"), by 10:00 a.m. MDT on April 26, 2019 or, in the case of any   adjournment or postponement of the Meeting, not less than 48 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) before the time of the adjourned or postponed Meeting. The time limit for the deposit of proxies may be waived or extended by the Chair of the Meeting at his or her discretion without notice. All Common Shares represented by a properly executed proxy will be voted or withheld from voting in accordance with the shareholder's instructions on any ballot that may be called for. If the shareholder specifies a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the Common Shares will be voted accordingly. 
If I Return a Proxy without Voting Instructions, How Will My Common Shares Be Voted? 
Shareholders who have appointed a named appointee of management to act and vote on their behalf, as provided in the enclosed form of proxy or voting instruction form, and who do not provide instructions concerning any matter identified in the Notice of the Meeting, will have the Common Shares represented by such form of proxy or voting instruction form voted FOR each Nominee, FOR the appointment of PwC as the Company's independent auditors, FOR the amendment and reconfirmation of the Shareholder Rights Plan, FOR the approval of the Omnibus Incentive Plan and FOR the resolution to approve compensation of NEOs (Say-on-Pay). 
The form of proxy or voting instruction form used in connection with the Meeting also gives a named appointee or appointees discretionary authority to vote on any amendment or variation to the matters identified in the Notice of the Meeting and on any other matter properly coming before the Meeting. Management is not aware of any such amendment, variation or other matter. If, however, any such amendment, variation or other matter properly comes before the Meeting, proxies will be voted at the discretion of the appointee or appointees named on the enclosed form of proxy or voting instruction form. 
Abstentions are not considered votes cast on any proposal. "Broker non-votes" are not considered votes cast on Item 1, 3, 4 or 5, and will have no effect on the vote outcome. Brokers will have discretionary voting power regarding Item 2 in the event beneficial owners, who own their Common Shares in "street name," do not provide voting instructions regarding Item 2. 
What if I Receive More than One Form of Proxy or Voting Instruction Form? 
If some of your Common Shares are registered in your name and some are held in the name of one or more nominees, you will need to return more than one proxy or voting instruction form in order to vote all of your Common Shares. Please follow the instructions carefully. The voting process is different for registered and non-registered shareholders. 
If I am a REGISTERED Shareholder, How Do I Vote? 
If your name appears on a Common Share certificate, you are a registered shareholder. If this is the case, this Proxy Statement will be accompanied by a form of proxy. If you are a registered shareholder, there are two ways that you can vote your Common Shares: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  Voting by Proxy  
[END TABLE]
To be valid, a proxy must be signed by the shareholder or his or her attorney authorized in writing. There are several ways to submit your form of proxy, indicated on the form of proxy. Carefully review your form of proxy for these instructions. 
You can vote your Common Shares by proxy in any of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Internet:    Visit www.astvotemyproxy.com and follow the instructions. You will need your 13-digit control number on the back of the proxy form 
 Phone:    Call 1-888-489-5760 from a touch-tone phone and follow the voice instructions. You will need your 13-digit control number on the back  of the proxy form. You cannot appoint a proxyholder via the telephone voting system 
 Mail:    Complete, sign and date your proxy form and return it in the business-reply envelope  included in your package 
 Fax:    Complete, sign and date your proxy form and fax both sides of the proxy form to 1-866-781-3111 (toll free in North America) or 1-416-368-2502 (outside of North America) 
[END TABLE]
You may also appoint the management appointee or someone else (who need not be a shareholder) to vote for you as your proxyholder by using the form of proxy. A shareholder has the right to appoint a person or company other than the named appointee of management to represent them at the Meeting. To appoint a   person or company other than the named appointee, write their name in the space provided. If you appoint a non-management proxyholder, please ensure they are aware of this appointment and can attend the Meeting to vote on your behalf. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  Voting in Person  
[END TABLE]
If you are a registered shareholder, you may attend and vote your Common Shares at the Meeting. Upon arriving at the Meeting, report to the desk of AST, our registrar and transfer agent, to sign in and revoke any proxy previously given. You do not need to complete or return your form of proxy if you intend to vote at the Meeting. 
If I am a NON-REGISTERED Shareholder, How Do I Vote? 
You are a non-registered shareholder if your Common Shares are not registered in your name and are held in the name of a nominee such as a trustee, financial institution or securities broker. If your Common Shares are listed in an account statement provided to you by your broker, those Common Shares will not likely be registered in your name, but instead are likely registered under the name of your broker or its agent. 
Without specific instructions, Canadian brokers and their agents or nominees cannot vote Common Shares for a broker's client. Without specific instructions, U.S. brokers and their agents or nominees cannot vote Common Shares for a broker's client on "non-routine" matters, including election of directors, amendment and reconfirmation of the Shareholder Rights Plan, approval of the Omnibus Incentive Plan and non-binding advisory vote to approve compensation of NEOs, but may vote on "routine" matters which, in this case, is the appointment of PwC only. When a broker is unable to vote on a "non-routine" proposal and the owner of the Common Shares does not provide voting instructions, a "broker non-vote" occurs. In these circumstances, the broker non-vote has no effect on the vote because it is not considered present and entitled to vote. 
If you are a non-registered shareholder, you can vote your Common Shares in the two ways listed below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  Give Your Voting Instructions  
[END TABLE]
To vote your Common Shares, your nominee must receive your voting instructions in advance of the Meeting. Your nominee should therefore either provide one of the following for your completion: (i) a voting instruction form, or (ii) a form of proxy, signed by the nominee and restricted to the number of Common Shares you own. These procedures enable non-registered shareholders to direct voting of Common Shares they beneficially own. 
Each nominee has its own procedures to ensure Common Shares of non-registered shareholders are voted at the Meeting. Please contact your nominee for instructions. You may vote using any of the methods outlined on the applicable voting instruction form or form of proxy. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  Vote in Person  
[END TABLE]
To vote in person at the Meeting, insert your name on the voting instruction form or form of proxy to appoint yourself as proxyholder and follow the instructions of your nominee. 
Non-registered shareholders who instruct their nominee to appoint themselves as proxyholders should present themselves to an AST representative at the Meeting. Do not complete the voting instruction form or form of proxy, as your vote will be taken and counted at the Meeting. 
Can I revoke or change my proxy once I have given it? 
Yes. A shareholder can revoke a proxy by depositing an instrument in writing executed by the shareholder or his or her attorney authorized in writing (or, in the case of a corporation, by a duly authorized officer or attorney), either: (i) at the office of the Corporate Secretary, Encana Corporation, 500 Centre Street S.E., Calgary, Alberta, T2G 1A6 prior to the Meeting; (ii) on the day of the Meeting; or (iii) in any other manner permitted by law. 
In addition to any other manner permitted by law, a shareholder can also change a previously submitted proxy or voting instruction form by submitting a new proxy or conveying new voting instructions by any of the means described under "If I am a REGISTERED Shareholder, How Do I Vote?" or "If I am a NON-REGISTERED   Shareholder, How Do I vote?", as applicable. Non-registered shareholders must ensure any change in voting instructions is communicated to the applicable nominee sufficiently in advance of voting at the Meeting. Non-registered shareholders who have voted and wish to change their voting instructions should contact their nominee promptly if assistance is required. 
What is the deadline to submit my form of proxy or voting instruction form? 
To be effective, AST must receive your proxy by 10:00 a.m. MDT on April 26, 2019 or, in the case of any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting, not less than 48 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) before the time of the adjourned or postponed Meeting. The time limit for the deposit of proxies may be waived or extended by the Chair of the Meeting at his or her discretion without notice. The Company reminds shareholders that only the most recently dated voting instructions will be counted, and any prior dated instructions will be disregarded. 
How are votes tabulated? 
Proxies are counted and tabulated by the Company's registrar and transfer agent, AST. AST maintains the confidentiality of individual shareholder votes however, proxies will be submitted to management where they contain comments clearly intended for management or to meet legal requirements. 
Who do I contact if I have questions?

Board Composition 
An overview of our Board's composition, including average age and tenure, is illustrated below: 
Role of the Board 
The Board is responsible for providing oversight of Encana's overall business and financial strength and for stewarding long-term sustainability, consistent with shareholder interests. Among the Board's fundamental responsibilities is the appointment of a skilled and committed executive team charged with managing the operational, financial and organizational effectiveness of the business. The Board is also responsible for ensuring principled and ethical corporate conduct is observed through appropriate governance and internal controls, as well as promotion and reinforcement of a strong corporate culture. 
Specific responsibilities of the Board are contained in our Board of Directors' Mandate, attached as Schedule C and available at www.encana.com/about/board-governance/mandates-guidelines.html. 
Strategic Planning 
The Board performs an integral and ongoing role in the Company's strategic planning and evaluation processes. Strategy is discussed at each regularly scheduled Board meeting. On an annual basis, the Board also holds a dedicated offsite strategy session to engage in a comprehensive evaluation of our strategy, including challenges and opportunities relative to our key strategic objectives. For 2018, the Board's annual strategy session focused on re-testing the analysis of the elements of a premium North American exploration and production company. Through ongoing dialogue with management and its technical teams, along with external advisors, who conducted in-depth analyses of various North American basins, these strategic discussions led to the decision to proceed with the acquisition of Newfield. 
Supervision of Management 
The Board is responsible for appointing our CEO, approving annual objectives and rigorously evaluating CEO performance relative to these objectives at the conclusion of the year. The Board is responsible for approving the appointment of our executive leadership team ("ELT") members, as well as reviewing their respective annual objectives and the CEO's evaluation of their performance relative to these objectives. The HRC Committee is responsible for reviewing (for Board approval) annual compensation for each ELT member. 
The Board is also responsible for establishing clear authority limits for the CEO. These primarily relate to his financial authority, approval of significant transactions, and departures from the Board-approved strategic plan. 
Risk Management 
The Board is also responsible for risk management oversight, including regular monitoring to ensure Encana's key risk management programs and control processes are functioning as intended. To assist in discharging this   responsibility, the Board delegates limited non-management oversight, including in respect of financial reporting and accounting, environment, health and safety, human resources, reserves and corporate responsibility matters, to its Committees. The Committees review policies and practices relevant to their respective risk management areas, and work closely with management to ensure key controls and processes are in place to identify, monitor and mitigate risks. This structured risk oversight is reflected in our current Committee structure, which is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Board Committee   Risk Oversight Responsibilities 
 Audit Committee    Oversight of principal financial risks  by ensuring and monitoring implementation and observance of appropriate risk management policies, processes and internal controls; review and examination of material financial disclosure; and direct engagement with Encana's internal and  external auditors on financial risk matters 
 Corporate Responsibility, Environment, Health and Safety ("CREHS") Committee    Stewardship of Encana's  environment, health and safety ("EH&S") program, including key policies, practices, systems and reporting. Monitors EH&S performance, management systems and audit protocols. Oversees corporate responsibility, government relations  and ethics and compliance program, including Business Code of Conduct 
 Corporate Responsibility, Environment, Health and Safety ("CREHS") Committee    Stewardship of Encana's  environment, health and safety ("EH&S") program, including key policies, practices, systems and reporting. Monitors EH&S performance, management systems and audit protocols. Oversees corporate responsibility, government relations  and ethics and compliance program, including Business Code of Conduct 
Nominating and Corporate Governance ("NCG") Committee    Oversight of Encana's corporate  governance framework, director appointment, annual Board, Committee and director performance evaluation processes, director education and Company corporate governance practices 
 Reserves Committee    Oversight of Encana's internal  qualified reserves evaluators, preparation and disclosure of Encana's oil and gas reserves and resources data and engagement of independent qualified reserves evaluators or auditors, if any 
[END TABLE]
Each Committee reports to the Board, which coordinates and oversees Encana's overall risk management approach. This structure encourages specialized, in-depth examination and risk assessment at the Committee level to support the Board's ultimate organizational risk management oversight. 
Sustainability 
Encana's strategy is to be among the most efficient producers of oil and natural gas. We continually strive to improve our operational efficiency and conduct our business in an ethically, environmentally and socially responsible manner. We believe our approach delivers strong performance for our shareholders, as well as responsibly sourced, affordable energy to consumers. 
We believe our portfolio and strategy are both resilient and inherently sustainable. Our risk-based approach is focused on identifying environmental, social and governance ("ESG") issues important to our key stakeholders and with potential to impact our strategy. 
The Board, supported by the CREHS Committee, is responsible for oversight of sustainability and ESG-related issues and ensuring overall corporate responsibility. The CREHS Committee is responsible for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing actions and initiatives undertaken by management to mitigate corporate responsibility, sustainability and ESG-related risk and/or related matters that may adversely affect our activities, strategy or reputation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing and making recommendations regarding corporate responsibility matters, including policies, standards and  practices, as well as ESG-related issues, occupational health, safety, business conduct and ethics.  
[END TABLE]
 Sustainability and ESG-related issues and risks are reviewed and discussed by the Board on a quarterly basis, including those relative to our internal Corporate Risk Report. The Board also engages directly with external stakeholders on topics relevant to ESG-related issues including those relative to Company strategy. 
Internal Controls 
The Board is responsible for overseeing the integrity of Encana's internal controls and management information systems. Effective oversight to monitor controls over accounting and financial reporting systems has been delegated by the Board to the Audit Committee. 
Management is responsible for maintaining appropriate internal controls over financial reporting and providing quarterly overviews to the Audit Committee. Quarterly reporting provides the Board and Audit Committee reasonable assurance that our public disclosure of financial information is reliable and accurate, our transactions are appropriately accounted for, and our assets are appropriately safeguarded. Encana also follows a quarterly organization-wide certification process to reinforce accountability for key internal controls at all levels, with results reported to the Board. 
Board Assessment Process 
The Board, assisted by the NCG Committee, assesses overall Board, Committee and individual director effectiveness and performance on an annual basis. 
The Board regularly conducts a comprehensive evaluation to assess overall Board and Committee functioning, as well as the effectiveness of our individual directors. Overseen by the Chairman of the Board, this evaluation includes a detailed effectiveness questionnaire and individual in-person interviews with each independent director. Assessment results are discussed at the NCG Committee and subsequently presented to the full Board for review and discussion, as well as identification of any necessary action items. 
Assessment results are used to identify areas requiring performance enhancement, process improvement or individual professional development. Key learnings are captured by the NCG Committee which initiates appropriate follow-up action, as required. The NCG Committee also regularly reviews the respective Board and Committee mandates to identify and address any gaps or necessary amendments due to organizational or regulatory changes or other developments. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Board Tenure   Encana does not have a mandatory retirement age or formal term limits  for our directors. The Board believes our focus on regular and structured Board assessment and evaluation, ongoing succession planning and strong corporate governance practices create an engaged and dynamic Board. The Board also seeks to maintain an  effective balance between the retention of experienced and skilled incumbent directors and regular renewal. This balance is reflected in the relatively short average tenure of our current directors of six years.

Director Skills and Experience 
To be considered for nomination to our Board, directors must possess strong commercial acumen, professional expertise and a history of business achievement. Board members must also be highly skilled and possess the requisite personal attributes to ensure effective stewardship of the Company and its future growth. 
The NCG Committee is responsible for identifying prospective Board members and ensuring a robust Board renewal process. Potential director candidates are evaluated by the Committee based on a skills matrix and factors including professional experience, geographic representation and other diversity-related considerations. The Board also regularly assesses its composition to ensure an optimal balance of skills, experience and breadth of perspective is maintained.  The skills and expertise of each of the Nominees is summarized below. The Board has identified the respective skills and expertise areas below as critical to ensuring effective stewardship of Encana and its future.

  Board and Committee Governance 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our Board leadership framework consists of an independent Chairman of the Board, independent Committee Chairs and active engagement by all directors. The Board believes this structure encourages effective balance between a strong and coordinated Board with effective risk management oversight. 
Independent Chairman of the Board 
The Board believes Encana is best served by separating the roles of the Chairman of the Board and CEO. The Chairman of the Board must be an independent Board member and is appointed by the remaining independent directors. The Chairman of the Board is responsible for leading and ensuring effective functioning of the Board as a whole, while serving as primary liaison with our CEO, Mr. Suttles. Our current Chairman of the Board, Clayton H. Woitas, is a non-executive, independent director, and has served in this capacity since July 2013. 
Duties and Responsibilities of the Chairman of the Board 
Responsibilities of the Chairman of the Board include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ensure effective functioning and overall operation of the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• facilitate active participation and encourage perspective of all directors;  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• call meetings of the independent directors; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• perform such other functions as the Board or other independent directors may request.  
[END TABLE]
Position Descriptions 
The Board has approved position descriptions for the Chairman of the Board, Committee Chairs and CEO. These are available on our website at www.encana.com. 
Director Orientation 
The NCG Committee is responsible for director orientation and continued education and evaluation of existing directors. Encana's director orientation provides new directors with detailed information on Encana's strategy, assets and operations, financial information and culture, and the role and expectations of the Board and its Committees. Directors are provided with access to orientation materials and Encana's policies and governance practices via an online director portal. New directors are encouraged to meet directly with the Chairman of the Board, other independent directors and the CEO. 
Directors are provided regular opportunities to interact with management and key personnel on an informal basis. At Board and Committee meetings, such interaction includes review and discussion of key financial, operational and industry matters. Informally, such opportunities are provided at director education or Board events scheduled by management immediately following regular Board meetings. Board and Committee meetings alternate between Encana's offices in Canada and the United States, and directors participate in annual field tours of key operations in each country.  Director Attendance 
Directors are expected to attend each meeting of the Board and Committee which he or she is a member. In 2018, Encana held five regularly scheduled Board meetings, four special meetings and 20 Committee meetings. Overall combined director attendance at Board and Committee meetings in 2018 was 98 percent. All directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. Individual director attendance is included in the "Director Nominee Profiles" beginning on page 13. 
Executive Sessions 
The independent directors meet without management present during executive (or "in-camera") sessions at each regularly scheduled Board and Committee meeting. Independent sessions are presided over by the Chairman of the Board or respective Committee Chair, as applicable. Independent advisors to the Board or its Committees, such as the compensation advisor to the HRC Committee, FW Cook, may also be invited by the Chairman of the Board or respective Committee Chair to attend all or a portion of an executive session. In 2018, there were six Board meetings and 18 Committee meetings that held executive sessions. 
Continuing Education 
Continuing education provides directors an opportunity to enhance their understanding of our business and remain current on relevant or emerging corporate governance issues. Board materials provided in advance of each regularly scheduled meeting include detailed director pre-reading and background analyses. Analyses on emerging industry, regulatory and governance matters are regularly provided at Board and Committee meetings. 
Encana supports continuing director education through individual paid subscriptions to leading national director education associations in the U.S. and Canada. Through these memberships, directors receive access to continuing education resources and are encouraged to attend conferences, seminars and webinars on board governance and related industry matters. Examples of continuing education sessions attended by Board members and/or hosted by Encana in 2018 include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continuing education and seminars via the Institute of Corporate Directors (Canada) and National Association of  Corporate Directors (U.S.);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Quarterly updates on the Company's operations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Quarterly overviews of enterprise risks, including formal enterprise risk management report;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Quarterly management overviews of key initiatives and risk management processes, including in respect of treasury, tax,  audit, corporate risk management and litigation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Regular market fundamentals overviews, including in respect of commodity price, basis differentials, geopolitical and  other macro environmental considerations and risks; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Regular analysis and review for all independent directors on key executive compensation matters, including key  governance matters, by management and the HRC Committee's independent compensation consultant.  
[END TABLE]
Succession Planning 
The Board, HRC Committee and NCG Committee are actively involved in the Company's succession planning processes. Succession planning for directors, including the Chairman of the Board and Committee Chairs, is the responsibility of the NCG Committee. Succession planning for the CEO and ELT members is annually reviewed by the HRC Committee and entire Board. The HRC Committee annually assesses the Company's overall organizational leadership and talent development framework, including succession planning program. 
Encana has a robust succession planning framework which assesses the competencies, experience, leadership capabilities and development opportunities of each succession candidate. Succession planning and professional development is directed at all levels of the organization to maintain a strong pipeline of talent to execute on our strategic objectives over the long term.  Other Board Memberships and Interlocks 
Several Nominees are also directors of other reporting issuers. The Board does not impose express limits on the number of other public company boards upon which our directors may serve. Expectations and time commitments of Board members are, however, discussed by the Chairman of the Board with prospective candidates, and incumbent directors on an ongoing basis. The respective board memberships of each Nominee are found under "Director Nominee Profiles" beginning on page 13. 
The Board does not have a formal policy on interlocking directorships, however the NCG Committee considers it good governance to avoid interlocking relationships, if possible. No Nominee sits on the same board of directors of any other reporting issuer. 
Independent Advisors 
The Board and its Committees retain independent financial, legal, compensation and other advisors as it considers appropriate to assist in the discharge of its duties. To assist in its oversight of Encana's executive compensation program, the HRC Committee has retained FW Cook, an independent compensation consultant, to provide advice and perspective to both the Committee and the Board. 
Director Selection Process 
The NCG Committee is responsible for identifying prospective director candidates and recommending Committee membership (including potential Chairpersons) to the Board. When evaluating director candidates, the NCG Committee assesses the professional experience and personal attributes of each individual relative to the specific needs of the Board or Committee and its respective oversight responsibilities. 
While the NCG Committee considers a range of individual attributes as part of its evaluation, it does not disproportionately weigh any single one. Individual candidates are assessed overall to ensure our Board comprises the necessary expertise, as well as a diversity of perspectives, to discharge its duties. In this regard, the NCG Committee seeks to ensure our Board includes a complementary mix of professional expertise, backgrounds, geographic representation and personal experiences. The Committee also refers to our Director Skills and Experience matrix on page 12 and criteria contained in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, available at http://www.encana.com/about/board-governance/documents-filings.html. 
Potential Board candidates may be referred to the NCG Committee by professional search firms, current directors, shareholders or other persons. The NCG Committee will consider candidates identified at regular or special meetings, or nominees recommended by shareholders in accordance with "Shareholder Proposals and Director Nominations" on page 74. Such nominees will be evaluated by the NCG Committee according to the same criteria, and in the same manner, as any other director nominee. 
Board Composition 
Our current Board composition is consistent with requirements found in our Articles and Corporate Governance Guidelines. Although the Board has no immediate plans to change its composition or increase its size beyond 12 directors, potential candidates will be evaluated consistent with the above considerations. As the Board currently does not have term limits, the NCG Committee annually reviews each prospective nominee for re-election, as well as current Board composition, to ensure each continues to meet Encana's governance needs. 
Board Committees 
The Board has five standing committees to assist in carrying out its responsibilities: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Audit Committee  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Corporate Responsibility, Environment, Health and Safety Committee  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Human Resources and Compensation Committee  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reserves Committee  
[END TABLE]
Each Committee is comprised solely of independent directors and chaired by an independent director. Special ad hoc committees may also be appointed by the Board from time to time for important matters. 
The mandate and responsibilities of each Committee are summarized below. Written mandates for Committee Chairs and each standing Committee are available on Encana's website at www.encana.com/about/board-governance/mandates-guidelines.html. 
Audit Committee 
At year-end 2018, the members of our Audit Committee were Bruce G. Waterman (Chairman), Margaret A. McKenzie, Suzanne P. Nimocks and Brian G. Shaw. If elected to the Board at the Meeting, Thomas G. Ricks will join the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of Encana's internal financial control systems, including quarterly and annual financial reporting by management, Encana's internal auditors and external auditors, and providing corresponding recommendations to the Board. In discharging its duties, the Audit Committee regularly meets in-camera (without management present) and with external auditors. 
Independence and Financial Literacy 
Each Audit Committee member must be independent and financially literate in accordance with applicable securities laws and stock exchange rules. All current members of our Audit Committee are both independent and financially literate. 
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") requires the Board to annually determine if the Audit Committee includes at least one "audit committee financial expert" and, if so, to name such individual(s). For this purpose, an "audit committee financial expert" must have the following attributes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an understanding of financial statements and generally accepted accounting principles;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ability to assess the general application of such principles in connection with the accounting for estimates, accruals  and reserves;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements that present a breadth and level of  complexity of accounting issues that are generally comparable to the breadth and complexity of issues that can reasonably be expected to be raised by the Company's financial statements, or experience actively supervising one or more persons  engaged in such activities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an understanding of internal controls and procedures for financial reporting; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an understanding of audit committee functions.  
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the Board determined Ms. McKenzie and Mr. Waterman to be "audit committee financial experts" as defined by the SEC. The Audit Committee held five meetings in 2018. For further information about the Audit Committee, please see our Annual Report. 
Corporate Responsibility, Environment, Health and Safety Committee 
At year-end 2018, our CREHS Committee members were Peter A. Dea (Chairman), Fred J. Fowler, Howard J. Mayson and Lee A. McIntire. If elected to the Board at the Meeting, Steven W. Nance will join the CREHS Committee. 
The CREHS Committee oversees Encana's EH&S, corporate responsibility and government relations matters, including related policies, practices and reporting. The Committee also oversees Encana's business conduct and ethics program, including its Business Code of Conduct, compliance training, investigations and integrity hotline reporting. The CREHS Committee held three meetings in 2018.  Human Resources and Compensation Committee 
At year-end 2018, the members of our HRC Committee were Suzanne P. Nimocks (Chairperson), Fred J. Fowler, Lee A. McIntire, Margaret A. McKenzie and Bruce G. Waterman. If elected to the Board at the Meeting, Thomas G. Ricks will join the HRC Committee. 
The HRC Committee is responsible for oversight of Encana's executive compensation program. Responsibilities of the HRC Committee include reviewing and recommending to the Board, for approval: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annual compensation for the CEO and ELT members;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annual performance goals relevant to compensation for the CEO and ELT members and evaluating executive performance  relative to such goals;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• performance metrics for the Company's annual bonus and long-term incentive plans; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• succession planning for the CEO and ELT members.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to the above, the HRC Committee is responsible for evaluating and approving the compensation and performance peer groups used for benchmarking purposes under our executive compensation program, as well as monitoring executive equity ownership under our share ownership guidelines. 
The HRC Committee retains an independent advisor to provide advice and perspective on executive compensation matters. The advisor reports directly to the HRC Committee Chairperson and performs no services on behalf of management. For more information, see "Independent Compensation Advisor" on page 62. 
Each of our HRC Committee members qualify as "Non-Employee Directors" under Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and as "outside directors" as defined in Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The HRC Committee held four regularly scheduled meetings and two special meetings in 2018. 
HRC Committee: Interlocks and Insider Participation 
During 2018, no HRC Committee member: (i) is a current or was a former officer or employee of Encana or any of its subsidiaries; or (ii) had a relationship that must be described under the SEC rules relating to disclosure of related person transactions. None of Encana's executive officers served on the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that had one or more of its executive officers serving on Encana's Board or HRC Committee during 2018. 
Compensation Risk 
Compensation-related risk is mitigated by the Board and HRC Committee using a structured decision-making process and program safeguards. All compensation matters impacting our executive officers, including the CEO, are subject to review and approval by the independent members of our Board. 
To ensure our program does not encourage our executives to take unnecessary risks that could materially adversely impact the Company, the HRC Committee conducts annual compensation risk assessments. These assessments are reviewed and/or conducted by the HRC Committee's independent compensation consultant. The most recent risk assessment of our compensation program and practices conducted in April 2018 recognized Encana's strong governance practices and concluded "it was not reasonably likely the Company's executive pay programs will have a material adverse impact on the Company, its business or its value". More information regarding how the HRC Committee and the Board oversee compensation-related risk is found at "Compensation Risk Management" on page 64. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
At year-end 2018, our NCG Committee members were Clayton H. Woitas (Chairman), Peter A. Dea, Howard J. Mayson, Suzanne P. Nimocks and Bruce G. Waterman.  The NCG Committee is responsible for providing oversight of corporate governance matters, monitoring regulatory developments, director recruitment and annual Board, Committee and director evaluation processes. The NCG Committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending director compensation to the Board for approval. The NCG Committee held three meetings in 2018. 
Reserves Committee 
At year-end 2018, the members of our Reserves Committee were Howard J. Mayson (Chairman), Peter A. Dea and Brian G. Shaw. If elected to the Board at the Meeting, Steven W. Nance will join the Reserves Committee. 
The Reserves Committee oversees our internal qualified reserves evaluators, as well as independent qualified reserves evaluators or auditors (if any) retained to evaluate and audit management's procedures for determining and reporting our oil and gas reserves and resources data. The Committee also reviews Encana's annual reserves and resources estimates prior to public disclosure. The Reserves Committee held three meetings in 2018. 
Policies and Standards 
Policy on Majority Voting 
A director who receives more "withhold" than "for" votes at the Meeting must immediately tender their resignation to the Board, even though they may be duly elected under applicable law. The NCG Committee will review and make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the director's resignation, having regard to Encana's best interests and any other relevant factors in the circumstances. Absent exceptional circumstances, the Board will accept the resignation, deemed effective upon acceptance. The director may not participate in Board (or NCG Committee) deliberations on the issue. 
A decision will be reached by the Board regarding the matter within 90 days following the Meeting. If it accepts the resignation, the Board may appoint a new director to fill the vacancy in accordance with our Articles, the Company's By-laws ("By-laws") and applicable law. The Company will promptly issue a news release with the Board's decision. If the Board determines not to accept the resignation, the news release will fully state the reasons for that decision. 
The Policy on Majority Voting only applies to uncontested elections where the number of nominated directors equals the number of directors to be elected at the Meeting. In a contested election (where the number of nominated directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected), directors with the highest number of Common Shares voted in their favour will be elected to the available Board seats. 
Business Code of Conduct 
The Board and NCG Committee are responsible for overseeing our corporate governance approach. This includes developing appropriate practices to ensure the Board functions independently of management and applicable legal, regulatory and other compliance matters are effectively addressed. Canadian and U.S. regulatory and corporate governance developments are regularly monitored by the Board to ensure our policies and practices remain consistent with best practices. 
Encana has a comprehensive Business Code of Conduct (the "Code") and other corporate governance policies which apply to our directors, officers, employees and contractor personnel. Based on our Foundational Values of Safety, Trust, Integrity and Respect, the Code outlines Encana's expectations in respect of ethical business conduct, ensuring legal and regulatory compliance and how to report suspected or actual wrongdoing. 
Formal annual recommitment to the Code and its related policies is required each year. Regular and extensive in-person training on the Code and key compliance issues is also provided to office and field staff and leaders throughout the year. 
Reporting of concerns by staff or the public of actual or potential violations of the Code or applicable law or policy is strongly encouraged, including through our 24-7 Integrity Hotline (the "Hotline"). The Hotline enables confidential or anonymous reporting, online or by telephone, of suspected illegal, unethical or improper conduct. Hotline reports are received by an external third party and directed to Encana's Ethics & Compliance Team for investigation and   handling. Investigation and Hotline activities are regularly reported by management to the CREHS Committee. Concerns involving accounting, internal accounting control, auditing or other financial irregularity are reported to the Audit Committee. Any material items or investigations are reported directly to the Board. In addition to monitoring compliance with the Code, the Board also regularly reviews audit procedures conducted by Encana's internal audit team to assess compliance with the Code. 
Any waivers of the Code in respect of any officer or director may only be approved by the Board and must be promptly disclosed as required by law. The Board has not waived any aspect of the Code to date, and we have never been required to make filings in accordance with securities laws regarding a departure from the Code. The Code is available at www.encana.com/pdf/about/board-governance/policies/business-conduct.pdf. 
Disclosure Policy 
Our Disclosure Policy reflects Encana's commitment to timely, balanced and accurate public disclosure regarding our business affairs and activities. The Policy provides guidance regarding the disclosure of material information, authorized corporate spokespersons, and interactions with analysts, investors and the media to avoid selective disclosure. The Policy describes the role and responsibilities of our internal Disclosure Committee to oversee public disclosure matters. The Policy, which applies to all directors, officers, employees and contract personnel is available at www.encana.com/about/board-governance/policies.
Securities Trading and Insider Reporting Policy 
Our directors, officers, employees and contractors are subject to our Securities Trading and Insider Reporting Policy. The Policy prohibits insider trading, establishes a regular blackout period schedule, outlines the trading restrictions and reporting obligations of Company insiders, and related obligations to stock exchanges and regulators. 
The Policy expressly prohibits our directors, officers and employees from engaging in any form of equity monetization transactions (including the purchase of financial instruments to hedge or offset a decrease in value), as well as the following activities, involving Encana securities: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• selling securities they do not own, have not fully paid for or have no right to own (engaging in  a "short sale");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• selling a "call option" or buying a "put option";  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• entering into equity monetization transactions involving any securities subject to the Company's share ownership  guidelines or that is the equivalent of "short selling"; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• entering into brokerage arrangements that might result in a sale at a time when he or she is not permitted  to trade.

The Policy is available at www.encana.com/about/board-governance/policies. 
Diversity 
Encana believes a diversity of experience and perspective enhances the effectiveness of our Board and management by enabling broader identification and examination of potential opportunities, risks and potential impacts to our business. Encana actively considers diversity, including gender diversity, when identifying qualified candidates for leadership opportunities. Encana is proud of its long history of female representation on its Board and ELT and robust succession and leadership development process, described below. Our commitment to consideration of diversity when evaluating director candidates is also expressly reflected in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
Encana has a long history of strong representation of women on our Board. Since 2003, at least two of our Board members have been women. In 2018, 20 percent (or two) of our directors were women. For this Meeting, two of our Nominees are women. 
At the executive level, three (or 43 percent) of our seven ELT members are women, each widely recognized for their professional accomplishments and industry contributions. Of our five NEOs, two (or 40 percent) are female   executives occupying key executive leadership roles in our organization. Within Encana's significant subsidiaries (disclosed in our Annual Report), approximately 63 percent of board positions and 47 percent of officer positions are held by women (as at December 31, 2018). Below the executive level, professional development for women is actively encouraged by Encana, including through our internal women's network, targeted succession planning and formal mentoring programs. 
Given our demonstrated commitment to diversity and related considerations in our appointment, hiring and promotion practices, we have not adopted a formal, standalone diversity policy or specific diversity targets for determining Board membership or executive appointments. Encana remains however committed to monitoring best practices and corporate governance developments in this area.

    Director  Compensation 
    Director  Compensation 
[END TABLE]
Philosophy and Objectives 
Our director compensation program is designed to reflect current market practices and enhance alignment with shareholder interests. Independent directors do not receive performance-based compensation, benefits or other perquisites from the Company. Mr. Suttles receives no compensation from Encana in his capacity as a director. Our directors are also subject to share ownership guidelines, as described below. 
Director Compensation Structure 
Prior to December 31, 2017, directors received an initial DSU grant upon joining the Board. As part of their annual compensation, directors also received a fixed number of DSUs. In lieu of cash, directors could also elect to receive all or a portion of their annual retainer as DSUs. 
In 2018, directors received annual compensation of $225,000 ($400,000 for the Chairman of the Board), comprised of (i) 75 percent Director RSUs under the Director Restricted Share Unit Plan ("Director RSU Plan"); and (ii) 25 percent either cash or DSUs under the Director DSU Plan, at the director's election. 
Committee Chairs also receive a retainer of $10,000 (CREHS and Reserves Committees), $15,000 (HRC Committee) or $20,000 (Audit Committee) and are subject to the same 75/25 percent distribution. Mr. Woitas, Chairman of the Board, does not receive any additional fees in his capacity as NCG Committee Chair. In 2018, annual retainers were paid to our directors in quarterly installments. Annual retainers and any initial DSU grants are pro-rated for periods of partial service. If elected, DSUs are granted quarterly as units. Cash, if elected, is payable on a quarterly basis. This structure is reflected in the tables below.

(1)  Director RSUs granted based on the five-day volume weighted average price  (VWAP) of US$10.87 on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") immediately prior to the February 26, 2018 grant date.  
[END TABLE]
 Director RSUs are settled the earlier of three years from the grant date or retirement from the Board. Director RSUs are currently settled in cash, and subject to shareholder approval of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, may be settled in Common Shares. 
Director DSU Plan 
Although DSUs vest immediately, they cannot be redeemed until retirement from the Board. Redeemed DSUs are paid in cash, less applicable withholding taxes, with value determined by multiplying the number of DSUs by the current market value of a Common Share. For this purpose, market value is defined as the closing price of Common Shares on the day immediately prior to redemption. Directors may redeem DSUs all at once or in stages, provided they do so before the redemption deadline. Directors are credited with dividend equivalent DSUs whenever a dividend is paid on Common Shares. Information on the total number and market value of DSUs and the total market value of Common Shares and DSUs held by our directors is found in "Director Nominee Profiles" beginning on page 13. 
Director Share Ownership Guidelines 
To encourage alignment with shareholder interests, our independent directors must maintain an ownership stake in the Company. Each independent director is required to purchase Common Shares or hold DSUs or Director RSUs with an aggregate value of at least three times annual director compensation by the later of: (i) December 31, 2018; or (ii) the fifth anniversary of the director joining the Board. In the event of non-compliance solely due to share price decline, directors have one year to restore compliance. Our director share ownership guidelines are in the upper quartile for share ownership requirements among our Compensation Peer Group (on an absolute dollar value basis). Common Shares held directly or beneficially through a nominee, DSUs and RSUs count towards the guidelines and compliance with the guidelines is evaluated on an annual basis. 
Director Compensation Table 
Annual compensation of our directors for the year ended December 31, 2018 is summarized in the following table.

 Trading and Hedging Restrictions 
Directors are subject to Encana's governance policies and practices, including our Securities Trading and Insider Reporting Policy.

   Director Independence and  Related Person Transactions   
   Director Independence and  Related Person Transactions   
   Director Independence and  Related Person Transactions   
[END TABLE]
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, consistent with applicable securities laws and stock exchange rules, require the Board consist of a majority of independent directors. To determine whether a director is "independent", the Board observes the following criteria: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the director must not have a disqualifying relationship as specified by applicable securities laws and stock exchange  rules; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Board must affirmatively determine the director otherwise has no material relationship with the Company directly, or  as an officer, shareholder or partner of an organization that has a relationship with the Company.  
[END TABLE]
When determining director independence, the Board does not consider transactions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• with entities for which a director or immediate family member served only as a director or trustee;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• of less than $120,000; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• with entities in which director's or an immediate family member's only interest is less than a 10 percent  ownership interest.  
[END TABLE]
The Board, assisted by the NCG Committee, annually reviews all relevant business relationships each director nominee and any person who served as a director during that year may have with the Company. Following its annual review, the Board determined none of the Nominees has a material relationship with the Company and, as a result, all Nominees (excluding the CEO) are independent. 
All directors who serve as members of each of the Audit, HRC and NCG Committees are independent in accordance with applicable securities laws and stock exchange rules. SEC regulations and NYSE rules for listed companies require the Audit, HRC and NCG Committees meet additional independence criteria, all of which were satisfied during the 2018 fiscal year. Information regarding Encana's definition of director independence is available at http://www.encana.com/about/board-governance/documents-filings.html. 
Related Person Transaction Policy and Process 
A "Related Person Transaction" is a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which the Company (including any of its subsidiaries) was, is or will be a participant and, as it relates to directors or shareholders who have an ownership interest in the Company of more than five percent, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any "Related Person" (as defined below) had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 
A "Related Person" means (i) a director, nominee director or executive officer of the Company, (ii) an immediate family member of a director, nominee director or executive officer or (iii) a beneficial holder of greater than five percent of the Common Shares or an immediate family member of such holder. 
In general, the Company will enter into or ratify Related Person Transactions only when the Board, acting through the NCG Committee, determines that the Related Person Transaction is reasonable and fair to the Company. When considering whether a Related Person Transaction is reasonable and fair to the Company, among other things, the NCG Committee considers the evaluation of the transaction by employees directly involved and the recommendation of the Chief Financial Officer. In addition, any Related Person Transaction involving an executive officer must be pre-approved by the CEO and any Related Person Transaction involving the CEO or a beneficial owner of more than five percent of the outstanding Common Shares must be submitted to the Audit Committee for   approval. If a Related Person Transaction is ongoing, any amendments or changes are reviewed and the transaction is reviewed annually for reasonableness and fairness to the Company. 
To identify potential Related Person Transactions, directors and officers must complete annual questionnaires and annually verify information about (i) where the director is an employee, director or executive officer, (ii) each entity where an immediate family member of a director is an executive officer, (iii) each firm, corporation or other entity in which the director or an immediate family member is a partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person has a five percent or greater beneficial ownership interest and (iv) each charitable or non-profit organization where the director or an immediate family member is an employee, executive officer, director or trustee. 
Any Related Person Transaction would be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Audit Committee to identify and prevent any conflict of interest.

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's executive officers, directors and persons who own more than 10 percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of the Common Shares with the SEC. SEC regulations require executive officers, directors and greater than 10 percent shareholders to furnish the Company with copies of all forms they file pursuant to Section 16(a). Based on a review of such forms, the Company believes that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were timely met during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, except that the Form 4 filed by Lee A. McIntire on February 4, 2019 reported one late transaction. 
As a matter of practice, the Company's administrative staff assists the Company's executive officers and directors in preparing initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership and filing such reports with the SEC.

   Report of the Audit  Committee   
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee operates under an Audit Committee Mandate adopted by the Board that outlines its responsibilities and practices, available at www.encana.com/pdf/about/board-governance/mandate-audit.pdf. The Audit Committee reviews and assesses the adequacy of its mandate on an annual basis and, when appropriate, recommends to the Board, for approval, changes that reflect the Audit Committee's evolving role. In 2018, the Audit Committee was composed of four directors, each of whom is independent as defined by applicable securities laws and stock exchange rules and that at least one member is an "audit committee financial expert". 
Responsibilities 
Management is responsible for preparing the Company's consolidated financial statements, managing accounting and financial reporting processes, devising and maintaining systems of internal controls over financial reporting, and assessing the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The independent auditor is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting. The Audit Committee's primary responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes and procedures on behalf of the Board. 
Oversight of Independent Auditors 
The Audit Committee monitors the qualifications, performance and independence of the Company's independent auditors and recommends to the Board on an annual basis whether to propose the reappointment of the Company's current independent auditors at the next annual meeting of shareholders or propose the appointment of another auditor. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were the Company's independent auditors for the year ended December 31, 2018 and, subject to an affirmative majority of the votes duly cast at the Meeting, will be reappointed in such capacity at the Meeting until the close of the next annual meeting of shareholders. 
The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors those matters required to be discussed by the auditors with the Audit Committee under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB"). The Audit Committee has also received written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by the PCAOB regulating the independent auditors' communication with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent auditors their independence from the Company's management and the Company as well as whether the provision of non-audit services by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is compatible with maintaining auditor independence.  2018 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed together with management and the independent auditors the audited consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the results of management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting, and the independent auditors' audit of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. 
In reliance on these reviews and discussions, and the reports of the independent auditors, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

The Audit Committee has authority and responsibility to review and evaluate the Company's independent auditors and to recommend to the Board whether to propose the reappointment of such auditors at the Meeting, or regarding the discharge of such auditors, if necessary, and to recommend alternate independent auditors. Subject to applicable law and the rights of shareholders, the Audit Committee is also responsible for compensation, retention and general oversight of the work of the independent auditors. 
Shareholders are being asked to appoint PwC, a registered public accounting firm, to serve as the Company's independent auditors until the close of the next annual meeting of shareholders. PwC (including its predecessors) has served as the Company's independent auditors for over 10 years. 
Annual Evaluation and Selection of Independent Auditors 
The Audit Committee annually evaluates the performance of the Company's independent auditors, including the senior audit engagement team, and recommends to the Board whether to propose the reappointment of the current independent auditors at the Meeting or to consider other audit firms. Factors considered by the Audit Committee in deciding whether to recommend to the Board retaining PwC include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PwC's independence;  
• PwC's global capabilities;  
• PwC's technical expertise and knowledge of the Company's global operations and industry;   
• Quality and candor of PwC's communications with the Audit Committee and management;  
• Quality and efficiency of services provided by PwC, including input from management on PwC's performance and how  effectively PwC demonstrated its independent judgment, objectivity and professional skepticism;  
• External data on audit quality and performance, including recent PCAOB reports on PwC and its peer firms; and   
• Appropriateness of PwC's fees, PwC's tenure as independent auditor, including benefits of a longer tenure, and  controls and processes in place to help ensure PwC's continued independence.  
[END TABLE]
 Audit Fees and All Other Fees 
The Audit Committee is responsible for approving audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditors and associated fees. The following table provides information about fees for audit and other services rendered by PwC during fiscal years 2018 and 2017. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees(1)        2,858          2,897

 Total        3,557          3,371   
[END TABLE]
Notes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Audit fees consist of fees for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements (including required  quarterly reviews), subsidiary audits, or services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.  
(2)  Audit-related fees consist of fees for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of  the audit or review of the Company's financial statements and are not reported as Audit Fees. During fiscal 2018 and 2017, the services provided in this category included reviews in connection with acquisitions and divestitures, research of  accounting and audit-related issues, review of new accounting standards, preparation of quarterly French translations, review of reserves disclosures and other regulatory filings.  
(3)  Tax fees consist of fees for tax compliance services, tax advice and tax planning. During fiscal 2018 and 2017, the  services provided in this category included assistance and advice in relation to the preparation of corporate income tax returns.  
(4)  During fiscal 2018 and 2017, the services provided in this category included the payment of maintenance fees associated  with a research tool that grants access to a comprehensive library of financial reporting and assurance literature.  
[END TABLE]
All audit, audit-related, tax and other services were pre-approved by the Audit Committee, which concluded the provision of such services by PwC was compatible with the firm's independence in conduct of its auditing functions. The Audit Committee has taken into consideration whether the provision of non-audit services by PwC is compatible with maintaining auditor independence. 
The Company did not rely on the de minimis exemption provided by Section (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of SEC Regulation S-X in 2018 or 2017. 
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee approves all audit and non-audit services to be provided by our independent auditors prior to the receipt of such services. The Company has adopted policies and procedures with respect to the pre-approval of audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by PwC. The Audit Committee has established a budget for the provision of a specified list of audit and permitted non-audit services that the Audit Committee believes to be typical, recurring or otherwise likely to be provided by PwC. The budget generally covers the period between the adoption of the budget and the next meeting of the Audit Committee, but at the option of the Audit Committee it may cover a longer or shorter period. The list of services is sufficiently detailed as to the particular services to be provided to ensure that: (i) the Audit Committee knows what services it is being asked to pre-approve; and (ii) it is not necessary for any member of management to make a judgment as to whether a proposed service fits within the pre-approved services.

   Item 3. Amend and Reconfirm the Company's Shareholder Rights Plan   
[END TABLE]
Encana adopted a shareholder rights plan (the "Rights Plan") effective July 30, 2001, which has been amended and restated several times. The Rights Plan was last reconfirmed and approved at Encana's annual meeting of shareholders held May 3, 2016. 
At the Meeting, shareholders will be asked to consider and, if deemed appropriate, approve an ordinary resolution to amend and reconfirm the Rights Plan (the "Rights Plan Resolution"). The text of the Rights Plan Resolution and summary of proposed amendments are described below. To be amended and continue in effect after the Meeting, the Rights Plan Resolution must be approved by a simple majority of votes (50 percent plus one) cast by shareholders at the Meeting. If the Rights Plan Resolution is not passed, the Rights Plan will terminate on April 30, 2019. If the Rights Plan Resolution is passed, the Rights Plan will require reconfirmation by Encana's shareholders at the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. 
Proposed Amendments 
Proposed amendments to the Rights Plan are intended to conform to reflect certain governance practices and recommendations provided by shareholder proxy advisory firms, and other amendments of a general housekeeping nature. The proposed amendments update the Rights Plan by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• amending the definition of "Acting Jointly or in Concert" to remove the reference in such definition to a  similar definition found in Multilateral Instrument 62-104 Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids ("MI 62-104");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• replacing all remaining references to MI 62-104 with references to National  Instrument 62-104 – Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids ("NI 62-104"), which replaced MI 62-104 upon the  adoption of a harmonized take-over bid regime for all Canadian jurisdictions in 2016;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• amending the definition of "Competing Permitted Bid" to clarify that Common Shares tendered pursuant to such a  bid cannot be taken up until the close of business on the later of (i) the earliest date on which Common Shares may be taken up under any other Permitted Bid (as defined in the Rights Plan) or Competing Permitted Bid then in existence; and  (ii) the last day of the minimum initial deposit period prescribed for such a bid by NI 62-104; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• making certain additional conforming, technical and administrative amendments to correct typographical errors and ensure  consistency and clarity among provisions.  
[END TABLE]
 The amendments to the Rights Plan are not proposed in response to or in anticipation of any acquisition or take-over bid that is known to the management of the Company, nor is the Rights Plan, as it is proposed to be amended, intended to prevent a take-over of the Company, to secure the continuance of current management and directors of the Company in office, or to deter fair offers for the Common Shares. 
The purpose and principal terms of the Rights Plan, including the proposed amendments, are set forth in Schedule B to this Proxy Statement. A copy of the Rights Plan, as proposed to be amended, may be obtained by contacting the Corporate Secretary at (403) 645-2000 or by fax at (403) 645-4617, and will be available on Encana's website at www.encana.com.

Unless otherwise instructed, the persons designated in the proxy form and the voting information form intend to vote FOR the Rights Plan Resolution below. The text of the Rights Plan Resolution, subject to such amendments, variations or additions as may be approved at the Meeting, is set forth below:

   Item 4. Approve the Omnibus Incentive Plan   
   Item 4. Approve the Omnibus Incentive Plan   
[END TABLE]
On February 13, 2019, the Board adopted, subject to shareholder approval, the Omnibus Incentive Plan. The Omnibus Incentive Plan is a long-term incentive plan that permits the grant of stock options ("Stock Options"), stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), RSUs, PSUs, restricted stock ("Restricted Stock") and other share-based awards ("Other Share-Based Awards") to directors, officers and employees of the Company and its affiliates, as well as prospective directors, officers and employees who have accepted offers of employment or directorship from the Company or its affiliates (collectively, the "Eligible Individuals"). 
The Omnibus Incentive Plan is designed to, among other things, promote a proprietary interest in the Company among Eligible Individuals and to align the interests of such individuals with the interests of shareholders. The Omnibus Incentive Plan, if approved, will also help to streamline the administration of long-term incentive awards, as all new awards granted by the Company will be governed by a single plan.  A complete copy of the Omnibus Incentive Plan is attached to this Proxy Statement as Schedule A, and a summary of the principal terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan is set forth below. A summary of certain U.S. and Canadian federal income tax consequences to Eligible Individuals and to the Company of Awards (as defined below) granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan is provided in Schedule E to this Proxy Statement. 
At the Meeting, shareholders will be asked to consider and, if deemed appropriate, approve an ordinary resolution approving the Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Incentive Plan Resolution"). If the Omnibus Incentive Plan Resolution is passed the Omnibus Incentive Plan will replace the Encana Corporation Employee Stock Appreciation Rights Plan, the Performance Share Unit Plan for Employees of Encana Corporation, the Restricted Share Unit Plan for Employees of Encana Corporation, the Restricted Share Unit Plan for Directors of Encana Corporation and the Encana Corporation Employee Stock Option Plan (the "ESOP", and together with the foregoing plans, the "Prior Plans") in respect of future awards, and no new awards will be granted under such Prior Plans. Outstanding awards granted under the Prior Plans will continue to be governed by the terms of such plans until such awards are exercised, expire, or are otherwise terminated or cancelled, with the exception of 1,623,491 RSUs and 2,016,468 PSUs at target (corresponding to 4,032,936 PSUs at maximum) granted in 2018 to certain employees and directors of the Company, which are proposed to be amended to become subject to and settled pursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, pending shareholder approval at the Meeting. 
In addition, subsequent to the Board's adoption of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Company granted an aggregate of 918,633 Stock Options (together with tandem SARs), 1,518,690 SARs, 10,613,059 RSUs and 3,908,182 PSUs at target (corresponding to 7,816,364 at maximum) to Eligible Individuals in March 2019. Further details about these prior grants are provided in the table included below under the heading "New Plan Benefits". Each of the above-described 2018 RSU and PSU grants and the March 2019 grants are intended to be governed by and subject to the Omnibus Incentive Plan, but if the Company's shareholders do not approve the Omnibus Incentive Plan and the grant of these awards under that plan at the Meeting, these awards will remain outstanding and instead be amended to become subject to and governed by the applicable Prior Plan. These awards cannot be exercised or settled under the terms of the proposed Omnibus Incentive Plan (i.e., settled with Common Shares in the case of RSUs and PSUs) until such time that shareholders of the Company have approved and ratified the Omnibus Incentive Plan and these grants. 
The 2018 RSU and PSU grants that are subject to shareholder ratification at the Meeting consist of: (i) 1,623,491 RSUs (including 156,575 Director RSUs); and (ii) 2,016,468 PSUs at target (corresponding to 4,032,936 PSUs at maximum). The March 2019 grants that are subject to shareholder ratification at the Meeting consist of: (i) 918,633 Stock Options; (ii) 1,518,690 SARs; (iii) 10,613,059 RSUs (including 283,350 Director RSUs); and (iv) 3,908,182 PSUs at target (corresponding to 7,816,364 PSUs at maximum). The RSU and PSU grants that are proposed to be ratified at the Meeting contemplate a cliff vesting date three years from the grant date, except Director RSU grants contemplate immediate vesting followed by settlement on the third anniversary of the grant date or upon the applicable director's retirement from the Board (whichever occurs first). The Stock Option grants that are proposed to be ratified at the Meeting contemplate vesting over a period of three years, with 30 percent of each such grant vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date, an additional 30 percent vesting on the second anniversary of the grant date, and the final 40 percent vesting on the third anniversary of the grant date. The exercise price applicable to such Stock Option grants, being C$9.54, was determined on the grant date based on the volume-weighted average price of a Common Share on the TSX for the five trading days immediately prior to the grant date. 
In connection with the proposed Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Board is seeking approval for 30,000,000 Common Shares to be made available for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, which number includes all Common Shares which may be issued on the settlement of the 2018 RSU and PSU awards described above and on the exercise or settlement of Stock Options (together with tandem SARs), SARs, RSUs and PSUs granted in March 2019, all of which are proposed to be governed by the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Common Shares issued pursuant to awards granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan that expire, or are terminated, forfeited or cancelled, will again be available for issuance pursuant to awards subsequently granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. The number of Common Shares available for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan will be subject to adjustment in the event of a share split, share dividend,   reverse share split, reorganization, share combination, recapitalization or similar event affecting the capital structure of the Company. 
New Plan Benefits1 
The awards that have been granted as of the date of this Proxy Statement that are governed, or proposed to be governed, by the Omnibus Incentive Plan are included in the table below. The additional benefits or amounts that will be received by or allocated to each of the individuals and groups listed in the table below in the future are not presently determinable.

Description of the Omnibus Incentive Plan 
The purpose and principal terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan are summarized below. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the Omnibus Incentive Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, a copy of which is included at Schedule A to this Proxy Statement. 
Purpose 
The Omnibus Incentive Plan is designed to, among other things, promote a proprietary interest in the Company among Eligible Individuals and to align the interests of such individuals with the interests of shareholders through the issuance of long-term incentive awards, including Stock Options, SARs, PSUs, RSUs, Restricted Stock and Other Share-Based Awards (each, an "Award" and collectively the "Awards").  Eligibility 
Awards may be granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan to Eligible Individuals. A Stock Option designated as an "incentive stock option" under the applicable grant agreement may be granted only to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code")). 
Administration 
The Omnibus Incentive Plan will be administered by the HRC Committee or another committee of the Board consisting of at least two directors (such administering body to be referred to in this section as the "Committee"). The Committee has absolute authority to determine the Eligible Individuals to whom Awards may be granted, and to establish the terms, conditions and limitations of each Award (subject to the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan and the applicable provisions of the Code), including without limitation, the type and amount of an Award, the number of Common Shares subject to an Award, the exercise price, any vesting conditions, restrictions or limitations attaching to an Award (including any performance criteria to be achieved during any performance period and the length of such performance period) and any vesting acceleration or forfeiture waiver (including on termination of service) regarding any Award and Common Shares relating thereto. The Committee also has full power and authority to interpret the terms and provisions of the Omnibus Incentive Plan as well as any Award issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan (and any grant agreement relating thereto). 
Number of Authorized Shares 
The maximum number of Common Shares that may be issued pursuant to Awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan will be 30,000,000, representing 2 percent of the issued and outstanding Common Shares as at the date of this Proxy Statement. Common Shares issued pursuant to Awards granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan may, subject to the terms of the grant agreement in respect of an Award, be issued from treasury or purchased in the open market or otherwise, at the sole discretion of the Committee. 
All Awards outstanding under the Prior Plans ("Prior Plan Awards") on the date on which the Omnibus Incentive Plan becomes effective will remain subject to and be settled in accordance with the terms of the applicable Prior Plan, with the exception of 1,623,491 RSUs and 2,016,468 PSUs at target (corresponding to 4,032,936 PSUs at maximum) granted in 2018 to certain employees and directors of the Company, which are proposed to be amended to become subject to and settled pursuant to the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, pending shareholder approval at the Meeting. There are 8,129,492 Common Shares relating to currently outstanding Stock Option grants listed and reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding awards under the ESOP. 
If any Award is forfeited, terminates, expires or lapses instead of being exercised, or any Award is settled for cash, the Common Shares subject to such Awards will not be counted as Common Shares issued pursuant to Awards granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Common Shares subject to an Award intended to qualify for the employment inducement award exception under Section 303A.08 of the New York Stock Exchange Company Manual or Section 613(c) of the TSX Company Manual shall not reduce the number of Common Shares available for issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
If the exercise price of any Stock Option or SAR and/or the tax withholding obligations relating to any Stock Option or SAR are satisfied by delivering Common Shares or the Company withholding Common Shares relating to such Award, the gross number of Common Shares subject to the Award shall be deemed to have been issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. If the tax withholding obligation relating to any Award other than a Stock Option or SAR is satisfied by delivering Common Shares or the Company withholding Common Shares relating to such Award, the net number of Common Shares subject to the Award after payment of the tax withholding obligation shall be deemed to have been issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
Limits on Awards to Insiders, Non-Employee Directors and Any One Person 
No Awards shall be granted to any Eligible Individual if, at the time of such grant, such grant could result in the number of Common Shares (a) issued to Company "insiders" (as defined by the TSX Company Manual) in any one   year period, or (b) issuable to Company "insiders" (as defined in the TSX Company Manual) at any time, in each case, pursuant to the exercise or settlement of Awards issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, or when combined with all other securities-based compensation arrangements, exceeding 10 percent of the outstanding Common Shares. 
A non-employee director of the Company shall not be granted Awards covering Common Shares with an aggregate grant date Fair Market Value (as defined below) in excess of US$800,000 during any one-year period, and no more than US$100,000 of such allocated grant date Fair Market Value may be comprised of Stock Options or SARs. In addition, a non-employee director shall not be granted any Awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan if, at the time of such grant, such grant could result in the aggregate number of Common Shares issued to all non-employee directors exceeding 1 percent of the Company's then issued and outstanding Common Shares. 
No Stock Option that is intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" may be granted to any Eligible Individual who, at the time of such grant, owns Common Shares possessing more than 10 percent of the total combined voting power of all Common Shares, unless at the time such Stock Option is granted, the exercise price is at least 110 percent of the Fair Market Value of a Common Share and such Stock Option expires before the fifth anniversary of the date on which it was granted. 
Subject to the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, "Fair Market Value" means, with respect to any particular date, the volume weighted average trading price per Common Share on the stock exchange designated in the applicable grant agreement during the five trading days immediately preceding such date. 
Adjustments 
In the event of a merger, arrangement, consolidation, acquisition of property or shares, share rights offering, liquidation, disposition of an affiliate (including by reason of a disaffiliation) or similar transaction affecting the Company or any of its affiliates, the Committee may make such adjustments as it deems equitable and appropriate to (a) the aggregate number and kind of securities reserved for issuance and delivery under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, (b) the number and kind of securities subject to Awards then outstanding, and (c) the exercise price of outstanding Awards. 
In the event of a share split, reverse share split, share dividend, share combination, reorganization, recapitalization or similar event affecting the capital structure of the Company, or a disaffiliation, separation or spinoff, in each case without consideration, or other extraordinary dividend of cash or other property to the Company's shareholders, the Committee may make adjustments as it deems equitable and appropriate to (a) the aggregate number and kind of securities reserved for issuance and delivery under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, (b) the number and kind of securities subject to Awards then outstanding, and (c) the exercise price of outstanding Awards. 
Types of Awards 
Stock Options and SARs 
Each Stock Option granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan will entitle an Eligible Individual to purchase one or more Common Shares upon payment of an exercise price, subject to the terms and conditions of the Omnibus Incentive Plan and the applicable grant agreement. SARs may be granted as a separate Award or in conjunction with a Stock Option. Upon the exercise of a SAR, the Eligible Individual will be entitled to receive an amount equal to the product of (a) the excess of the closing price of one Common Share on the last trading day preceding the date of exercise of the SAR, over the exercise price of the applicable SAR, multiplied by (b) the number of Common Shares in respect of which the SAR has been exercised. Stock Options granted with a tandem SAR will allow the Eligible Individual to surrender the Stock Option and exercise the related SAR or to exercise the Stock Option, in which case the related SAR will immediately terminate, and no payment will be made, or Common Shares issued in respect thereof. The applicable grant agreement for SARs grants not in conjunction with a Stock Option will specify whether such payment is to be made in cash or Common Shares or will reserve to the Committee or the Eligible Individual the right to make that determination prior to or upon the exercise of the SAR.  The exercise price per Common Share subject to a Stock Option or SAR will be determined by the Committee and set forth in the applicable grant agreement and will not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Common Share on the applicable grant date. 
The term of each Stock Option and each SAR will be fixed by the Committee, however in no event will any Stock Option or SAR be exercisable more than 10 years following the grant date of such Award, subject to the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the date on which a Stock Option or SAR is meant to terminate, expire or lapse (the "Termination Date") occurs during a trading blackout period imposed by the Company and applicable to the relevant participant, or within 10 business days of the expiry thereof, then the Termination Date will be extended to the date that is 10 business days following the expiry date of such trading blackout period. 
Stock Options and SARs currently outstanding under the Prior Plans and Stock Options granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan in March 2019 will expire no more than seven years from the grant date of such Award. 
RSUs 
RSUs are Awards denominated in Common Shares that will be settled in a specified number of Common Shares or a cash amount equal to the Fair Market Value of a specified number of Common Shares, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. 
The vesting of RSUs is conditioned upon the continued service of the applicable Eligible Individual. RSUs will vest in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Omnibus Incentive Plan and the applicable grant agreement. 
An Eligible Individual to whom RSUs are awarded will have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the Common Shares represented by the RSUs until Common Shares are actually delivered to the Eligible Individual in settlement thereof. 
The effect of an Eligible Individual's period of absence or termination of service on such Eligible Individual's RSUs will be as set forth in the applicable grant agreement. 
PSUs 
PSUs are Awards denominated in Common Shares that will be settled in Common Shares or a cash amount equal to the Fair Market Value of Common Shares, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. The number of PSUs settled will vary depending on the Company's achievement over a designated performance period of performance criteria determined by the Committee and set forth in the applicable grant agreement. 
The vesting of PSUs is conditioned upon the continued service of the applicable Eligible Individual. PSUs will vest in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Omnibus Incentive Plan and the applicable grant agreement. 
An Eligible Individual to whom PSUs are awarded will have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the Common Shares represented by the PSUs until Common Shares are actually delivered to the Eligible Individual in settlement thereof. 
The effect of an Eligible Individual's period of absence or termination of service on such Eligible Individual's PSUs will be as set forth in the applicable grant agreement. 
Restricted Stock 
Shares of Restricted Stock are actual Common Shares issued to an Eligible Individual, subject to certain restrictions on the ability to sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber shares of Restricted Stock during the restriction period determined by the Committee. Subject to the foregoing and the terms of the applicable grant agreement, the applicable Eligible Individual will have, in respect of his or her shares of Restricted Stock, all the rights of a shareholder of the Company holding the class or series of Common Shares that is the subject of the Restricted Stock, including the right to receive dividends and, subject to TSX approval, the right to vote the Common Shares. 
Vesting of Restricted Stock (i) shall be conditional upon the continued service of the applicable Eligible Individual, and (ii) may be subject to the achievement of performance criteria as determined by the Committee.  The effect of an Eligible Individual's period of absence or termination of service on such Eligible Individual's shares of Restricted Stock will be as set forth in the applicable grant agreement. 
Other Share-Based Awards 
Subject to the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Committee may grant equity-based or equity-related awards not otherwise described in the Omnibus Incentive Plan in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions consistent with the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan as the Committee may determine, which may: (a) involve the transfer of actual Common Shares to Eligible Individuals, either at the time of grant or thereafter, or payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of Common Shares, (b) be subject to performance-based and/or service-based conditions, (c) be in the form of phantom stock, deferred share units or other awards denominated in, or with a value determined by reference to, a number of Common Shares that is specified at the time of the grant of such award, and (d) be designed to comply with applicable laws of jurisdictions other than the United States or Canada. 
No Repricing 
Without shareholder approval and except as described above under the heading "Adjustments", the Committee is not authorized to reduce the exercise price of an outstanding Stock Option or SAR, including by way of a cancellation in exchange for cash or other Awards or in conjunction with the grant of any new Stock Option or SAR with a lower exercise price. 
Transferability 
Except as set forth below, Awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan are not transferable except by will or by laws of descent and distribution (or otherwise for estate settlement purposes). A Stock Option that is not designated as an "incentive stock option" under the applicable grant agreement or a SAR may be transferred by a participant, for no value or consideration, to such participant's family members, whether directly or indirectly or by means of a trust or partnership or otherwise, if such transfer is expressly permitted by the Committee. 
Change in Control 
Under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, in the event of a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) in which outstanding Awards are not assumed or replaced by the resulting entity, then immediately prior to the time of such Change in Control all outstanding Awards will vest in full and the Company will generally be required to settle such Awards, together with any previously vested but unexercised Awards, in cash, property or a combination thereof, as applicable, as soon as practicable (and in any event within 30 days of the Change in Control), and for every performance-based Award that vests in connection with a Change in Control, the level of achievement of the performance criteria in respect of the applicable performance period shall be deemed to be the greater of (a) the median performance criteria and (b) the level of achievement of the performance criteria applicable to a performance period as determined by the Committee no later than the date of the Change in Control, taking into account performance through the latest date preceding the Change in Control as to which performance can, as a practical matter, be determined (but no later than the end of the performance period). 
In the event of a Change in Control in which outstanding Awards are assumed or replaced by the resulting entity, then any outstanding and unvested Awards held by a participant will immediately vest in full and will generally be paid or, become exercisable (if applicable), and all vesting and exercisability restrictions on such Awards will immediately lapse, if within a specified period after the Change in Control the participant's employment or service is terminated by the Company other than for CIC Cause (as defined in the Omnibus Incentive Plan) or by the participant for Good Reason (as defined in the Omnibus Incentive Plan).

   Item 5. Advisory Vote to Approve Compensation of Named Executive Officers   
[END TABLE]
Encana is committed to providing shareholders with clear, comprehensive and transparent executive compensation disclosure. For information on Encana's approach to executive compensation, see our "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 47. 
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and related SEC rules, Encana is providing shareholders with an opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, commonly known as "Say-on-Pay". As a result of the advisory vote on frequency of Say-on-Pay votes at our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, Encana has determined that it will hold, on a non-binding advisory basis, an annual Say-on-Pay vote. The Corporation's decision regarding the frequency of future Say-on-Pay votes will remain in effect until the next required vote on such frequency. 
The Board recognizes a thoughtful executive compensation framework is critical to managing risk and appropriately incentivizing executive leadership relative to both actual performance and demonstrated behaviours. The HRC Committee has worked diligently to develop an executive compensation program that attracts and retains top talent, while motivating and rewarding performance that drives sustainable, long-term shareholder value. In this regard, the Board believes Encana's approach to executive compensation is balanced and effectively aligns the performance of our executive officers with the long-term interests of our shareholders. 
As this is an advisory vote, the results will not be binding upon the Board. However, when considering the Company's approach to compensation for the NEOs, the Board will take results of this vote into account, together with other shareholder feedback and best practices in compensation governance. During 2018, the Company engaged with shareholders to solicit their feedback on its approach to compensation. This feedback and the corresponding actions undertaken by the Board in response are discussed at "Shareholder Outreach" on page 50. 
The Board recommends that shareholders vote FOR the resolution set out below and, unless otherwise instructed, the persons designated in the form of proxy or the voting instruction form intend to vote FOR the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers of the Company as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure". 
Vote Required for Approval 
To be approved, the advisory resolution on the compensation of the NEOs requires an affirmative majority of the votes duly cast at the Meeting.

Our Strategy – Disciplined Focus on Profitable Growth 
Encana is a leading North American energy producer focused on developing our multi-basin portfolio of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas producing plays. Encana is committed to growing long-term shareholder value through a disciplined focus on generating profitable growth. In the pursuit of growing shareholder value, the Company has undertaken a rigorous portfolio optimization process that resulted in the divestiture of approximately $12 billion in assets over the past five years. This portfolio optimization has meaningfully increased the quality of Encana's assets and significantly enhanced our financial health (as referenced by the chart below).  For 2018, our objective was the delivery of quality returns and sustainable value growth, with a focus on the following key objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cash flow growth, with the goal of self-funding production growth  
• Corporate level returns  
• Capital efficiency  
• Strong balance sheet  
• Industry leading environmental, health, and safety performance

Direct Compensation Components 
Executive compensation at Encana is designed with two key elements in mind: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compete in the Market – determining base pay against a carefully selected group of industry peers   
• Pay for Performance – ensuring short and long-term incentives are calculated based on company and individual  performance  
[END TABLE]
 To underpin these elements, we have developed a competitive, performance-based compensation program, outlined in the following table:

2018 Pay Outcomes Demonstrate Pay and Performance Alignment 
Since launching our strategy in 2013, we have established a powerful track record of efficiency, discipline, as well as meeting and beating our performance targets. We believe our realized compensation and 2018 compensation decisions reflect these strong results. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2018 Annual Bonus  
[END TABLE]
The Company's performance against our annual scorecard met or exceeded each of our goals. In addition, the Board's reward of the safety modifier, gave us a total Company Score of 162 percent. For further details on the Company Score, see page 56.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2019 Long Term Incentive Payout (PSUs)  
[END TABLE]
Our consistent performance delivered TSR that exceeded the median of our PSU Performance Peer Group over the three-year performance period. We also met or exceeded each of our strategic milestones over that same period, giving us a PSU multiplier of 168 percent. For further details on the strategic milestones see page 60. 
Shareholder Outreach 
We reach out to targeted investors to engage in discussions regarding issues that are important to them and to seek their input in executive compensation and corporate governance matters. Our outreach team includes Investor Relations and Corporate Governance representatives from the Company's management team, including the Corporate Secretary, the independent Chair of the HRC Committee and the Chairman of the Board. As we prepare for the proxy season, we consider investor feedback and perspectives in evaluating and structuring our executive compensation program and preparing proxy statement disclosures. Following the annual meeting, we engage with our largest investors on issues of importance to them. As outlined on page 77 of this Proxy Statement, there are also a number of established channels that any investor may use to communicate with the Company. 
Regular and meaningful engagement with our shareholders is a key priority for our Board. Feedback is sought through ongoing comprehensive outreach by a team which includes our Chairman of the Board and HRC Chairperson as well as representatives of management and our investor relations team. In 2018, these discussions addressed topics including executive compensation, corporate governance and ESG issues. A snapshot of our ongoing approach to shareholder engagement is provided below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Shareholder Engagement 
     Throughout the year, we reach out to and engage with shareholders on issues of importance to  them. These discussions, conducted by representatives of management and our investor relations team, seek shareholder perspective on topics ranging from compensation approach and design, corporate governance, ESG and strategy.

[END TABLE]
 Feedback received from our engagement efforts is carefully considered by the Board throughout the year. The perspectives of governance institutions and proxy advisors are also considered in Board discussion and decision-making on compensation and governance-related topics. 
In 2017-2018, we engaged in a comprehensive outreach program to over 45 percent of our total share ownership. Details regarding these engagement efforts and the corresponding changes made to our program are discussed on pages 34 to 35 of our 2018 Proxy Statement. For 2018, these changes included introduction of double trigger change in control vesting provisions in our LTI plans and increased share ownership requirements for our directors. 
Encana shareholders indicated strong support of our program in 2018 with an 89 percent "FOR" or favorable "Say-on-Pay" vote at our annual meeting of shareholders. We believe this result reflects our shareholders perspective that our program is structured to encourage strategic performance and aligned with their long-term interests. 
In 2018, the Board carefully considered this feedback and continued to seek the perspective of those with whom we did not have opportunity to engage prior to our 2018 vote. To this end, the Chairman of the Board, HRC Chairperson and management representatives continued to engage with key shareholders, pension funds and key governance institutions, including the Canadian Coalition of Good Governance, to seek additional feedback on our program and Board governance. Results were shared with all directors at regular Board meetings throughout the year. 
These conversations were constructive and confirmed our program is aligned with our strategy and shareholder focused. Our efforts also reinforced our commitment to regular and ongoing shareholder feedback as a key element of compensation governance.

Alignment with Shareholders through Realized Compensation 
Over the past five years since the launch of our new strategy, we have outperformed our median peer company. However, over this same time-period, our absolute share price has reduced, largely as a result of the significant   decline in commodity prices over that period. Our pay programs have recognized these overall market conditions, as demonstrated by the CEO's realized compensation over this period. Over the past five years, the CEO's realized compensation is 56 percent below his target compensation. 
Our three-year performance through 2018 was in the upper end of the 2nd quartile of our PSU Performance Peer Group (described on page 64). 
The following graph shows CEO target and realized compensation from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2018 and compares our TSR performance to that of the median of our peer companies over this same period. 
CEO Target and Actual Pay vs. Indexed TSR 
Pay-for-Performance 
Executive compensation is predominantly in the form of variable, at-risk pay. The following charts show that 90 percent of the CEO's compensation and 82 percent of the NEOs average compensation is in the form of performance-based compensation: 
Paying Competitively 
To remain competitive, we set annual target compensation for our executives around the median (or 50th percentile) of comparable roles within our Compensation Peer Group, which is listed on page 63. Target compensation may be set above or below the median based on various factors, including time in role, sustained performance over time, readiness for promotion, skill set and experience relative to external market counterparts. Actual compensation varies above or below the target based on company and individual performance, and absolute and relative changes in our share price over time.  Sound Risk Management 
The following table outlines the executive compensation governance best practices that we incorporate and the governance pitfalls that we avoid:

Annual Bonus 
All employees participate in our Annual Bonus program, which provides opportunity to earn a cash award based on a combination of performance against Company metrics, and performance against individual objectives for the year.  An important principle of the Annual Bonus is to ensure that all employees are aligned around the same key Company metrics. To achieve this, we create a Company Scorecard, which is then used to communicate the metrics and to track our performance against them throughout the year, resulting in an overall Company Score for the year. 
Each year the HRC Committee establishes rigorous targets that balance the desire for stretch performance with the need to motivate our employees and executives. 
Within the Company Scorecard, the Board has two modifying mechanisms to assist in determining the appropriate final Company Score: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Safety Modifier (-20% to +20%)  
[END TABLE]
Safety is a foundational value of Encana. This modifier serves to both reinforce our commitment to achieving our Company metrics safely, and to enable the Board to adjust our overall score to reflect the strength or weakness of our performance in this area. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Board Discretion Modifier (-25% to +25%)  
[END TABLE]
This modifier enables the Board to adjust payments upwards or downwards, based on unforeseen or unusual circumstances that may arise during the year. 
These modifiers are used judiciously by our HRC Committee to ensure that bonuses are truly reflective of company performance. 
The split of Annual Bonus between Company performance and individual performance varies by job level. For the CEO and other NEOs, this split is 75 percent based on the Company Scorecard and 25 percent based on individual performance. 
The Annual Bonus target is expressed as a percentage of base salary, having a range from zero to a maximum of two times bonus target. 
Company Scorecard Metrics Focused on Returns 
The following quantitative metrics were selected in 2018 as our Company Scorecard, both to align with the key components of our strategic plan, and as the building blocks of delivering strong financial returns to shareholders.

 Cash Flow Margin    Highlights and reinforces our focus on value creation. 
 Capital Efficiency    Keeps us focused on strengthening our track record of delivering  better wells at lower cost. 
 Total Costs    Strict financial discipline to retain and enhance the efficiencies  we have captured over the past four years. 
 Total Production    Focus on high margin oil and condensate opportunities; delivering  year over year growth in total production. 
 Growth Within Cash Flow    This metric underpins the fundamental  deliverable from our strategy – return of cash to shareholders. Our 2018 goal represents a milestone towards achieving that  strategy.

LTI awards are the largest portion of the target compensation of our executives. They are primarily performance-based, are designed to focus executive management on strategy, delivery and long-term value creation and are highly correlated with the Company's share price performance. 
LTI awards are issued annually, following approval at the February HRC Committee meeting. In setting the target value of LTI awards, the HRC Committee reviews individual performance, retention risk, internal equity and overall market competitiveness.  There are three LTI vehicles currently used by the Company – RSUs, Stock Options/SARs, and PSUs. 
RSUs 
The number of shares underlying each RSU award is determined by dividing the target grant value by the volume-weighted average price ("VWAP") of a Common Share of the Company on the TSX (for Canadian employees) or NYSE (for U.S. employees) for the five trading days immediately prior to the award date. RSU awards "cliff vest" after three years, generally subject to continued employment, and are then settled in cash or for certain grants subsequent to February 2018 and subject to approval of the Omnibus Incentive Plan at the Meeting, in Common Shares. The cash settlement value is determined by multiplying the five-trading day VWAP immediately prior to the vesting date by the total number of Common Shares of the Company underlying the award, subject to any blackout period. Therefore, the realized value from RSUs exactly mirrors the shareholder experience over the same period. When cash dividends are paid by the Company on outstanding Common Shares, the Company credits additional dividend equivalent RSUs to the participant's account. Dividend equivalent RSUs are subject to the same terms and conditions as the RSUs and vest and are settled at the same time and in the same form as the RSUs to which such dividend equivalent RSUs relate. 
Stock Options and SARs 
Our Canadian-based employees receive stock option grants, whereas our U.S. based employees receive SARs. Stock options and SARs have a strike price per Common Share equal to the VWAP of a Common Share on the TSX or NYSE, as applicable, for the five trading days immediately prior to the award date, and the number of our Common Shares subject to each award is determined by dividing the target grant value by a Black-Scholes value. Stock option and SAR awards vest over three years, 30 percent on each of the first and second anniversaries of grant and 40 percent on the third anniversary of grant, generally subject to continued employment through the applicable date, expiring 7 years from the grant date. As any value realized requires an increase in our share price relative to the strike price, we consider these grants to be performance-based, or "at-risk" compensation. Any value lost from the strike price results in a zero payment to the participant. Any value realized above the strike price also mirrors the experience of a shareholder over the same period. 
PSUs 
The target number of shares underlying each PSU award, and the settlement value of each PSU award, is determined in the same manner as described above for RSU awards. PSUs awards "cliff vest" after three years, generally subject to continued employment and are then settled in cash or, for certain grants subsequent to February 2018 and subject to approval of the Omnibus Incentive Plan at the Meeting, in Common Shares. The number of PSUs settled, however, can range from 0 to 200 percent, determined solely by Encana's performance relative to metrics chosen by the HRC Committee at the time of grant. These metrics are tied to multi-year strategy delivery, and relative total shareholder return. When cash dividends are paid by the Company on outstanding Common Shares, the Company credits additional dividend equivalent PSUs to the participant's account. Dividend equivalent PSUs are subject to the same terms and conditions as PSUs and vest and are settled at the same time and in the same form as the PSUs to which such dividend equivalent PSUs relate.  2018 PSU Design 
In recommending performance metrics for the 2018 PSU awards to the Board, the HRC Committee wanted to continue to ensure our NEOs were incentivized to achieve a combination of total shareholder return relative to our peers ("Relative TSR") and absolute performance of the Company against key components of our strategic plan ("Strategic Milestones").

  IV. 2018 COMPENSATION DECISIONS 
2018 Base Salary 
Base salaries for the CEO and other NEOs were reviewed in February 2018. Based on total compensation positioning within the market, the HRC Committee recommended no increases to CEO or other NEO salaries for 2018. 
2018 Annual Bonus 
Similar to base salaries, the HRC Committee recommended no changes to target bonuses in 2018.

Notes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Cash Flow Margin is defined as Non-GAAP Cash Flow Margin excluding long-term incentive costs.  
(2)  Total Costs is defined as transportation and processing expense, operating expense, excluding long-term incentive  costs, administrative expense, excluding restructuring and long-term incentive costs, and capitalized indirect costs, excluding long-term incentive costs.  
[END TABLE]
 The calculated Company Score above was then modified based on safety and Board discretion as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A safety modifier of 20 percent was awarded. The Board determined that achieving the company's safest year ever for  the fifth consecutive year justified adjusting the company score by the maximum amount allowed within the plan.  
• No Board discretion modifier was applied.  
[END TABLE]
As a result of these modifications, the final Company Score for 2018 was 162 percent. For the CEO and other NEOs, this score was applied to 75 percent of their Annual Bonus payment. 
Individual Goals Focus on Key Initiatives for Delivering Shareholder Value 
The CEO and other NEOs are rewarded for achievement against individual goals. A summary of each NEO's performance against those goals is as follows:

2016 PSUs Settlement 
Vesting and payout of 2016 PSU awards was assessed by the HRC Committee at its February 2019 meeting. At that meeting, the HRC Committee reviewed Encana's TSR performance from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018, relative to the 2016 PSU Performance Peer Group described on page 64. 
The Company's performance over that period resulted in a relative TSR ranking above the 50th percentile, which resulted in 50 percent of the payout at 136 percent of award. 
The strategic goals applicable to the 2016 PSU awards resulted in 50 percent of the payout at 200 percent of target. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strategic Milestones focused on Margin Growth, Balance Sheet Strength and Portfolio and the following results led to the  maximum payout for this portion of the 2016 PSUs:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    Met or exceeded every key strategic metric on the five-year plan launched in 2013  
  –    Non-GAAP cash flow margin up 147% percent from 2016  
  –    Delivered free cash flow in 2018, one year earlier than projected in the five-year plan  
  –    Balance sheet leverage declined by more than half since 2016  
  –    Core assets delivering 96 percent of total 2018 production, up from 72 percent overall in 2016   
  –    Permian production more than doubled since 2016; Montney liquids production up nearly 300 percent Q4 2016 to Q4  2018  
[END TABLE]
The total payout multiplier for the 2016 PSU awards was 168 percent of target. 
Other Compensation Elements 
In addition to the compensation programs described above, the Company also provides the following additional compensation elements to NEOs, generally consistent with market practice within our Compensation Peer Group. 
Pension and Retirement Benefits 
NEOs participate in the same Company pension and retirement programs as all other employees, based on the country in which they reside. Further details of the CEO's and other NEOs' retirement arrangements can be found beginning on page 70. 
Welfare Benefits 
NEOs participate in the same Company-sponsored welfare benefit programs as our employees, based on the country in which they reside.  Lump sum cash payment in lieu of perquisites 
A lump sum cash payment is provided in lieu of payment for any specific perquisites that are offered by some of our Compensation Peer Group companies. The lump sum is intended for items such as, but not limited to, professional association dues, company vehicle, and financial advice. 
Additional CEO Benefits 
Additional benefits were provided to Mr. Suttles as part of his compensation arrangements upon his appointment as CEO in 2013. These benefits include: (i) a prescribed-value annual allowance for personal travel on Company aircraft; and (ii) two round-trip business class flights per year for personal travel. These benefits are treated as employment income and are fully taxable. Following Mr. Suttles' relocation to Denver in 2018, he is no longer entitled to two round-trip business class flights per year for personal travel. Mr. Suttles receives no tax gross-ups or loans in respect of the travel allowance, and any unused balance at year end is forfeited and cancelled. Further details of these benefits are included under the "All Other Compensation" column for Mr. Suttles in the Summary Compensation Table on page 66. 
Employee Deferred Share Unit Plan 
Under the Employee Deferred Share Unit Plan ("Employee DSU Plan"), executives can elect to convert either 25 percent or 50 percent of their Annual Bonus award into DSUs. DSU holdings are intended to encourage shareholder alignment and assist executives to achieve required equity ownership levels. To defer his or her Annual Bonus award into DSUs, an executive must elect prior to December 31 of the preceding calendar year. Such elections, once made, are irrevocable. Once an election is made, the number of DSUs credited to an executive is calculated as follows: 
DSUs are payable only following an executive's cessation of employment. DSUs are settled in cash and are credited with additional DSUs equivalent to dividends payable on our Common Shares during the deferral period. In 2017, Ms. Brillon elected to convert 25 percent of her 2018 Bonus award into DSUs. 
CIC Arrangements 
Encana does not have general employment contracts with our NEOs. Each NEO has a CIC agreement that provides for payment of severance and other termination benefits on a qualifying termination following a CIC. The treatment of each NEO's LTI awards upon a termination of employment following a CIC is governed by the applicable LTI plan.  Following shareholder feedback, and in keeping with what has recently become the prevailing market practice among our Compensation Peer Group, we amended our LTI plans in February 2018. The amendments replaced existing "single trigger" vesting provisions in our LTI plans with "double trigger" vesting provisions (providing for CIC vesting only upon the occurrence of both (i) a CIC of Encana; and (ii) subsequent termination of the NEO's employment by the Company, other than for "Cause", or by the executive for "Good Reason" (each as defined within the CIC agreement) within 24 months following the CIC). The CIC agreements were also amended in February 2018 to reflect certain updates and clean-up changes intended to ensure consistency across the agreements. These changes included reducing the post-CIC protection period from 36 months to 24 months as described above in order to bring the CIC agreements into alignment with the Company's LTI awards. 
CIC Arrangement Terms 
The relevant terms of our executive CIC arrangements are summarized in the table below:

Peer Groups and Competitive Market Data 
Compensation Peer Group 
As a North American energy producer, we compete for executive talent in both Canada and in the United States and our compensation must be competitive to attract and retain the executive talent we need to achieve our business objectives. For this reason, we define our competitive market as companies of similar size, industry focus, and geography as Encana, and assess our compensation against a group of North American industry peers selected by the HRC Committee (our "Compensation Peer Group"). The HRC Committee is careful to include relevant exploration and production focused companies, since their performance is similarly linked to changes in commodity prices during similar measurement periods. 
In selecting our Compensation Peer Group, the HRC Committee utilizes the following criteria:

 Market competitiveness of compensation for the CEO and other members of the ELT is assessed each year by the HRC Committee using market data from the above Compensation Peer Group. For our CEO, this assessment is conducted using the U.S. peers. For the other NEOs, country-specific data from the Compensation Peer Group is used, based on the role and country in which the executive is based. 
The HRC Committee uses a different peer group to assess our relative TSR performance under our PSU awards. The PSU Performance Peer Group includes companies with whom we compete for investment capital, as opposed to executive talent. 
PSU Performance Peer Group

The Board is committed to the identification and mitigation of compensation-related risk. The HRC Committee has adopted a structured approach to compensation risk, designed to discourage inadvertent or undue risk taking by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  i.  incorporating risk management principles directly into our program design ii.  active consideration of risk as a key element of compensation decision-making iii.  concluding regular comprehensive compensation program risk assessments of our program  
[END TABLE]
Specific examples of how our program incorporates compensation risk management include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓    use of balanced, operational and financial performance metrics in our Board-approved Company Scorecard;   
  ✓    use of balanced mix of vehicles in our annual LTI grants;  
  ✓    deferral of all vesting and payout of 85 percent of annual executive LTI grants for a three-year period; and   
  ✓    vesting and payout maximums (or caps) in our PSU grants.  
[END TABLE]
We believe these features reduce risk by diversifying rewards, scenarios and eliminating reliance on any single or limited number of performance measures to determine executive incentive compensation. Risk is also managed through the consistent application of our program, which applies to all employees, including our executives.  Compensation-related risk is also mitigated through our corporate governance practices, which include share ownership guidelines, an Incentive Compensation Clawback Policy and prohibitions regarding hedging of equity awards, all of which apply to incentive-based compensation granted to our executives. 
Executive Share Ownership Guidelines 
Encana has had share ownership guidelines since 2002. The share ownership guidelines require our executives and designated Vice-Presidents to achieve minimum share ownership levels within a five-year period of appointment to their position. If a participant is promoted, resulting in an increased target, the participant is given an additional two-year period to meet the new target. 
Targets are calculated as a multiple of base salary, with share ownership calculated based on the aggregate value of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  owned Common Shares (including beneficial ownership);  
  (ii)  unvested RSUs; and  
  (iii)  DSU holdings.  
[END TABLE]
The HRC Committee reviews the status of executive equity ownership under the share ownership guidelines on an annual basis. The status of our NEOs' share ownership as at December 31, 2018 is provided below.

Incentive Compensation Clawback Policy 
The Board adopted an Incentive Compensation Clawback Policy in 2012. Under the policy, the Board is authorized to require immediate reimbursement of all or any portion of Annual Bonus award or LTI compensation received by or payable to an executive in the event of any of the following circumstances: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Encana is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material  non-compliance with any financial reporting requirement under applicable securities laws (a "Restatement");  
• incentive compensation received by a current or former executive in respect of years to which the Restatement pertains  exceeds the amount that would have been received by the executive under the Restatement (the "Incentive Compensation"); and  
• an executive engaged in gross negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud which either caused or significantly  contributed to the material non-compliance resulting in the Restatement.  
[END TABLE]
Where such circumstances exist, the Board is authorized to: (i) require immediate reimbursement by the executive to Encana for all or any Incentive Compensation previously paid; (ii) immediately terminate and forfeit any right of the executive to any Incentive Compensation (in the event not previously paid); (iii) immediately withhold or cancel the value of any Incentive Compensation from any outstanding amounts owing to the executive (including any unvested or unexercised LTI awards) to compensate for (or off-set) the value against any unrecovered Incentive Compensation amount; and/or (iv) initiate such other action against the executive as the Board may deem necessary. 
No Hedging Policy 
Our Securities Trading and Insider Reporting Policy expressly prohibits directors and all employees, including executives, from engaging in any form of equity monetization transactions (including the purchase of financial instruments to hedge or offset a decrease in value) involving the Encana securities that represent part of their LTI awards or, in respect of our executives, Encana securities held under our share ownership guidelines.  The policy also prohibits directors and employees from engaging in the following activities involving Encana securities: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• selling securities they do not own, have not fully paid for or have no right to own (engaging in  a "short sale");  
• selling a "call option" or buying a "put option";  
• entering into equity monetization transactions involving any securities subject to our share ownership guidelines or  that is the equivalent of "short selling"; and  
• entering into brokerage arrangements that might result in a sale at a time when he or she is not permitted  to trade.

(2)  For 2018, 2017 and 2016 RSU and PSU awards, grant date fair value is calculated by multiplying the number of granted  units by the VWAP of Common Shares on the five trading days immediately prior to the February 26, 2018 grant date (C$13.76 or US$10.87), February 27, 2017 grant date (C$15.43 or US$11.75) and March 3, 2016 grant date (C$5.56 or  US$4.06). PSU and RSU compensation expenses are accounted for on a fair value basis, as required by U.S. GAAP.  
(3)  For 2018 Option and U.S. SAR grants, grant date fair value is determined in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation  – Stock Compensation ("ASC 718") by using a Black-Scholes model based on 52.4 percent for Canadian Option grants and 55.2 percent for U.S. SAR grants, applied using the following assumptions: Expected Term = 7 years;  Volatility = 54.10 percent (Canadian Option grants), 57.87 percent (U.S. SAR grants); Dividend Yield = 0.54 percent; Risk Free Rate = 1.67. percent.  
    For 2017 Option and U.S. SAR grants, grant date fair value is determined by using a Black-Scholes-Merton Model based  on 50.3 percent for Canadian Option grants and 53.3 percent for U.S. SAR grants, applied using the following assumptions:  
  (i)  Expected Term = 7 years;  
  (ii)  Volatility = 53.24 percent (Canadian Option grants), 57.18 percent (U.S. SAR grants);   
  (iii)  Dividend Yield = 0.54 percent;  
  (iv)  Risk Free Rate = 0.75 percent.  
[END TABLE]
For 2016 Option and U.S. SAR grants, grant date fair value is determined in accordance with ASC 718 by using a Black-Scholes model based on 39.2 percent for Canadian Option grants and 41.5 percent for U.S. SAR grants, applied using the following assumptions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  Expected Term = 7 years;  
  (ii)  Volatility = 45.31 percent (Canadian Option grants), 48.16 percent (U.S. SAR grants);   
  (iii)  Dividend Yield = 1.44 percent;  
  (iv)  Risk Free Rate = 0.51 percent.  
(4)  In 2017, Ms. Brillon elected to convert 25 percent of her 2018 Bonus award into DSUs. In 2016,  Ms. Brillon elected to convert 50 percent of her 2017 Bonus award into DSUs. In 2015, Ms. Brillon elected to convert 25 percent of her 2016 Bonus award into DSUs. DSUs granted during 2018 in respect of such elections are  discussed in the "Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Table for 2018".  
(5)  Pension Value represents the year over year compensatory change. Details are found in the "Defined Benefit  Pension Table" on page 71.

 CEO Pay Ratio 
Item 402(u) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-K, adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, required disclosure of the annual total compensation of our CEO to our median employee's annual total compensation. The ratio disclosed below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u). 
The median employee was determined based on actual 2018 total cash compensation for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 for the employee population as of December 31, 2018. A foreign exchange rate of C$1.00 = US$0.772 (average exchange rate during 2018) was used to convert Canadian compensation into U.S. dollars for purposes of comparison. 
Mr. Suttles' 2018 annual total compensation was $11,981,894 as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. Our median employee's annual total compensation for 2018 calculated in accordance with Item 402(c)(x) of the SEC's Regulation S-K, which includes 2018 base salary, target grant date fair value LTI awards, annual bonus, Company contributions to retirement plan, annual allowance and other benefits, was $146,983. As a result, we estimate that Mr. Suttles' 2018 annual total compensation was approximately 82 times that of our median employee.

CEO Relocation 
Mr. Suttles relocated from Calgary to Denver on June 1, 2018. For the purposes of this disclosure, please note that effective June 1, 2018, he ceased participation in our Canadian retirement plans and began participating in our U.S. retirement plans, each described below. 
Canadian Registered and Supplemental Pension Plans 
Our Canadian-based executives, including the CEO for the first five months of 2018, participate in our registered pension plan and supplemental pension plan (collectively, the "Canadian Plan"). Pension contributions to the registered plan are payable up to the level permitted by the Income Tax Act. Contributions beyond this level are made to the supplemental plan. The Canadian Plan has an active defined contribution ("DC") component. It also has a legacy defined benefit ("DB") component which has been closed to new members since 2003. Pensionable earnings, for purposes of the Canadian Plan, include a base salary and Annual Bonus award (capped to a maximum of base salary of 67 percent for the CEO and 40 percent for other NEOs). 
Canadian DC Plan 
Mr. Suttles and Ms. Brillon participated in the DC component of the Canadian Plan. Mr. Suttles only participated in this plan for the first five months of 2018. Encana contributes eight percent of pensionable earnings to an individual's DC account. Participants select from a variety of investment options and manage their own accounts. 
Canadian DB Plan 
Mr. McAllister is the only executive who participates in the DB component of the Canadian Plan. His participation commenced with a predecessor company to Encana, and his DB benefits have fully vested. 
Upon retirement, DB benefits are based on two percent of the individual's highest five consecutive years of pensionable earnings in the preceding 10 years, multiplied by years of pensionable participation in the Canadian Plan. Participants contribute four percent of pensionable earnings up to a defined annual maximum. Normal retirement is age 65, but participants can retire at age 55 or after with a reduced pension. Pension is paid on an unreduced basis from age 60 (or after age 55 with 30 years of service).  Canadian Investment Plan 
Our Canadian-based executives are also eligible to participate in our Canadian Investment Plan. Participants contribute up to a maximum of 25 percent base salary to self-selected investment options. Encana matches these contributions to a maximum of 5 percent of base salary in Common Shares purchased on the open market. 
U.S. DC Plan 
Mr. Suttles began participating in the Encana (USA) Retirement Plan on June 1, 2018. Mr. Hill and Ms. Zemljak also participate in the Encana (USA) Retirement Plan. Encana contributes 8 percent of base salary to a participant's DC account. Similar to the Canadian Investment Plan, participant contributions are matched by Encana up to 5 percent of base salary. Participants select among various investment options and manage their own accounts. 
As with the supplemental component of the Canadian Plan, Encana also credits an amount equal to 8 percent of the executives' Annual Bonus award (to a maximum of 40 percent of base salary) to a U.S. non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan ("NQDC Plan"). The NQDC Plan provides non-qualified benefits in excess of those permitted (under the Encana (USA) Retirement Plan) by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. 
Defined Benefit Pension Table 
The table below shows Mr. McAllister's estimated annual DB benefits, accrued DB pension obligations and compensatory and non-compensatory changes as at December 31, 2018.(1)

(1)  Amounts are estimates only based on assumptions (referred to in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in  the Annual Report or other footnotes below and therefore may not materialize).  
(2)  Amounts converted from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars using December 31, 2018 exchange rate of C$1.00 =  US$0.733. Calculations include no preretirement decrements. All accrued pensions are assumed payable at the later of age 60, which is the earliest unreduced retirement age, and current age.  
(3)  Michael McAllister was granted 12 additional years of service granted under an individual agreement in 2000. The  additional Supplemental Plan pension in respect of the 12 years of additional service is reduced by an annual pension offset of $16,668 (converted from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars using the December 31, 2018 exchange rate of C$1.00 =  US$0.733) payable at age 60 from Mr. McAllister's previous employer. The additional pension, reflecting the offset, is $2,834,565 of the present value listed above.  
(4)  Michael McAllister is eligible for early unreduced retirement under both plans as at December 31, 2018.

 Potential Payments Upon Termination or CIC 
Voluntary or Involuntary Termination Outside a CIC 
We do not have employment agreements with any of the NEOs and therefore any severance or termination payments would be determined at the time of the termination of employment. Our LTI plans outline vesting provisions for LTI awards in relation to termination outside a CIC. Upon termination under age 55, all RSUs, PSUs and unvested options are forfeited and cancelled with any vested options having 60 business days from termination to be exercised. For early retirement between ages 55 to 60, whether initiated by the Company or due to the applicable employee's resignation, unvested RSUs and PSUs vest on a pro-rated basis based on the number of months from the grant date to the date of retirement and are paid at the scheduled vesting date, and any vested options or SARs have six months to be exercised from termination of employment with unvested options or SARs being cancelled. For retirement above age 60, whether initiated by the Company or due to the applicable employee's resignation, all outstanding RSUs, PSUs and options/SARs will continue to vest according to the vesting schedule, with any vested options or SARs exercisable up to the expiry date. 
Termination Following a CIC 
In February 2018, we amended our award agreements such that all LTI awards granted to NEOs on or after February 14, 2018 now feature "double trigger" vesting provisions, which provide for CIC vesting only upon the occurrence of both (i) a CIC of Encana; and (ii) a subsequent termination of the NEO's employment by the Company other than for "Cause" or by such NEO for "Good Reason" (each as defined within the applicable NEO's CIC agreement) within a 24-month period following the CIC. In contrast, LTI awards granted to NEOs prior to February 14, 2018 become vested or exercisable, as applicable, immediately upon the occurrence of a CIC. For further information, see the section "CIC Arrangement Terms" on page 62. 
Upon a CIC and subsequent qualifying termination of employment, LTI awards granted to our NEOs on or after February 14, 2018 will vest and give rise to the payments detailed in the table below.  Termination Due to Death. 
Upon death, LTI treatment is similar to a voluntary or involuntary termination outside a CIC, with the exception that individuals under age 55 at the time of death are treated in the same manner as an early retirement between ages 55 to 60.

(1)  Calculated as at December 31, 2018 and converted from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars using December 31,  2018 exchange rate of C$1.00 = US$0.733.  
(2)  Calculated using two times NEO's base salary in effect at December 31, 2018.  
(3)  Calculated based on two times average of Bonus award paid in the immediately preceding three years (from 2016 to  2018, inclusive).  
(4)  Reflects estimated value from accelerated vesting of Options unvested as at December 31, 2018.   
(5)  The PSU amounts have been valued, for illustration purposes, based on a payout of 100 percent of the respective  target amount using the TSX or NYSE closing price of Common Shares on December 31, 2018, or C$7.88 and US$5.78 respectively. Value of 2018, 2017 and 2016 RSU grants reflects all RSUs outstanding as at December 31, 2018 valued, for  illustration purposes, based on the TSX or NYSE closing price of Common Shares on December 31, 2018, or C$7.88 and US$5.78 respectively.  
(6)  In the event of Change of Control and termination of employment, Mr. Suttles would be compensated based on  additional service for purposes of his DC Pension Plan participation of 24 months. The incremental value is equal to 8.0 percent of two times his annual base salary plus 8% of two times his annual bonus (capped at 67% of base salary).

The incremental  value is equal to the difference between the actuarial present values of his accrued DB pension, as modified above, less the accrued DB pension, unmodified, using the commuted value basis for the DB Plan as of December 31, 2018. The discount  rates used are 3.20 percent for 10 years and 3.40 percent thereafter.  
(9)  In the event of Change of Control and termination of employment, Mr. Hill or Ms. Zemljak (as applicable),  would be compensated based on additional service for purposes of their DC Pension Plan participation of 24 months.

If the tax withholding obligations relating to any Full Value Award are satisfied by  delivering Shares (either actually or through a signed document affirming the Participant's ownership and delivery of such Shares) or the Corporation withholding Shares relating to such Full Value Award, the net number of Shares subject to the  Award after payment of the tax withholding obligations shall be deemed to have been issued under this Plan.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  In the event of a Change in Control, all such Awards credited to the Participant immediately prior to such Change in  Control shall vest immediately prior to the time of such Change in Control ("CIC Vested Awards"), except to the extent that an Award meeting the requirements set out below in this Section 10.1(a) (such award, a  "Replacement Award") is provided to the Participant to replace such Award (each Award intended to be replaced by a Replacement Award, a "Replaced Award") effective on or immediately after the time of such Change in  Control. An award shall meet the requirements of this Section 10.1(a) (and hence qualify as a Replacement Award) if (i) it has a value equal to the value of the Replaced Award as of the date of the Change in Control determined with  reference to the Change in Control Value of the Award comprising the Replaced Award and the fair market value of the securities underlying the Replacement Award, (ii) it relates to publicly traded equity securities of (A) the Corporation,  (B) the entity surviving the Corporation following the Change in Control or (C) the parent company of such surviving entity, (iii) it contains terms relating to vesting that are substantially identical to those of the Replaced Award  (except that for any Replaced Award that is performance-based, the Replacement Award shall be subject solely to time-based vesting for the remainder of the applicable Performance Period (or such shorter period as determined by the Committee) and the  level of achievement of the Performance Criteria in respect of the applicable Performance Period shall be deemed to be the greater of (x) the median Performance Criteria and (y) the level of achievement of the Performance Criteria  applicable to a Performance Period as determined by the Committee no later than the date of the Change in Control, taking into account performance through the latest date preceding the Change in Control as to which performance can, as a practical  matter, be determined (but no later than the end of the Performance Period)), and (iv) its other terms and conditions are not less favorable to the Participant than the terms and conditions of the Replaced Award (including the provisions that  would apply in the event of a subsequent Change in Control) as of the date of the Change in Control. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Replacement Award may take the form of a continuation of the applicable Replaced Award if the  requirements of the preceding sentence are  
[END TABLE]
A-14 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     satisfied. If a Replacement Award is granted, the Replaced Award shall not immediately vest upon the Change in Control giving rise to the replacement. The determination whether the conditions of  this Section 10.1(a) are satisfied shall be made by the Committee, as constituted immediately before the Change in Control, in its sole discretion. All Awards that become CIC Vested Awards pursuant to this Section 10.1(a) shall be paid as  follows:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  as soon as practicable, and in any event within 30 days, following a Change in Control, (i) to the extent a  Participant's CIC Vested Award is expressed in dollar value form, the Participant shall receive a cash payment equal to such dollar value, and (ii) subject to clause (iii) below with respect to Stock Options, to the extent a  Participant's CIC Vested Award is expressed by reference to a number of units or Shares, the Participant shall receive in cash or property (or a combination thereof), as may be determined by the Board or the Committee, a payment equal to  (a) the number of Shares with respect to which the CIC Vested Award relates (determined, except as otherwise provided in the applicable Grant Agreement, in accordance with clause (ii) below for performance-based CIC Vested Awards) at the  time of the Change in Control (rounded up to the nearest whole number), multiplied by (b) the price at which the Shares are valued for the purpose of the transaction or series of transactions giving rise to the Change in Control, or if there is  no such transaction or transactions, the simple average of the closing price per Share on the Applicable Exchange on each day in the 30-day period ending on the date of the Change in Control (as applicable,  the "Change in Control Value");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (ii)  for each CIC Vested Award that is performance-based, the level of achievement of the Performance Criteria in respect  of the applicable Performance Period shall be deemed to be the greater of (x) the median Performance Criteria and (y) the level of achievement of the Performance Criteria applicable to a Performance Period as determined by the Committee no  later than the date of the Change in Control, taking into account performance through the latest date preceding the Change in Control as to which performance can, as a practical matter, be determined (but no later than the end of the Performance  Period);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (iii)  with respect to Awards of Stock Options, in the event of a Change in Control, CIC Vested Awards together with  previously vested but unexercised Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Change of Control may be exercised effective as of the time of the Change of Control provided that, for reasons of administrative convenience, the Participant  submits an exercise election no later than three business days prior to the effective time of the Change of Control (or within such other period as may be specified by the Committee, acting reasonably); and  
[END TABLE]

  (iv)  with respect to any Section 409A Amount (i) if the Change in Control constitutes a change in the ownership  or effective control of a corporation, or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of a corporation, as such terms are used in Section 409A of the Code and related regulations (a "409A Change of  Control"), such Section 409A Amount shall be paid at the time specified in Section 10.1(a)(i) to the extent that such payment does not result in the application of any tax or penalty under Section 409A, and (ii) if the  Change in Control does not constitute a 409A Change of Control, or payment at the time specified in Section 10.1(a)(i) would result in the application of any tax or penalty under Section 409A, such Section 409A Amount shall in all  events be paid during the calendar year or years in which such amount would have been paid had there been no Change in Control.

In no event may a U.S. Participant, directly or  indirectly, designate the calendar year of any payment to be made under any Award that constitutes non-qualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any other  provision of this Plan or any Grant Agreement to the contrary, if a U.S. Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code (as determined in accordance with the methodology established by the  Corporation), amounts that constitute "non-qualified deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A of the Code that would otherwise be payable by reason of a U.S. Participant's Separation  from Service during the six-month period immediately following such Separation from Service shall instead be paid or provided on the first business day following the date that is six months following the U.S.  Participant's Separation from Service.

PURPOSE AND PRINCIPAL TERMS OF THE SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN 
Summary of the Rights Plan 
The purpose and principal terms of the Rights Plan are summarized below. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Rights Plan. An Encana shareholder or any other interested party may obtain a copy of the agreement governing the Rights Plan, as proposed to be amended, by contacting our Corporate Secretary at (403) 645-2000 or by fax at (403) 645-4617, or by visiting Encana's website at www.encana.com. 
Purpose of Rights Plan 
The primary objective of the Rights Plan is to provide the Board with sufficient time to explore and develop all options for maximizing shareholder value if a take-over bid is made for Encana and to provide every shareholder with an equal opportunity to participate in such a bid. The Rights Plan encourages a potential acquiror to proceed either by way of a Permitted Bid (as defined in the Rights Plan), which requires the take-over bid to satisfy certain minimum standards designed to promote fairness, or with the concurrence of the Board. 
Proposed Amendments 
The proposed amendments to the Rights Plan are intended to conform the plan to reflect certain governance practices and recommendations provided by shareholder proxy advisory firms, and to make other amendments of a general housekeeping nature. The proposed amendments update the Rights Plan by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• amending the definition of "Acting Jointly or in Concert" to remove the reference in such definition to a  similar definition found in Multilateral Instrument 62-104 Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids ("MI 62-104");  
• replacing all remaining references to MI 62-104 with references to National  Instrument 62-104 – Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids ("NI 62-104"), which replaced MI 62-104 upon the  adoption of a harmonized take-over bid regime for all Canadian jurisdictions in 2016;  
• amending the definition of "Competing Permitted Bid" to clarify that Common Shares tendered pursuant to such a  bid cannot be taken up until the close of business on the later of (i) the earliest date on which Common Shares may be taken up under any other Permitted Bid (as defined in the Rights Plan) or Competing Permitted Bid then in existence; and  (ii) the last day of the minimum initial deposit period prescribed for such a bid by NI 62-104; and  
• making certain additional conforming, technical and administrative amendments to correct typographical errors and ensure  consistency and clarity among provisions.  
[END TABLE]
Term 
The Rights Plan must be reconfirmed by a simple majority of votes cast by shareholders at every third annual meeting of shareholders of Encana. The Rights Plan, including the amendments described herein, is therefore presented at the Meeting for reconfirmation and approval. If the Rights Plan is not approved at the Meeting, the Rights Plan will expire and cease to have effect effective April 30, 2019. If the Rights Plan is approved at the Meeting, the Rights Plan will require reconfirmation by Encana's shareholders at the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. 
Issue of Rights 
Upon the Rights Plan becoming effective, one right ("Right") was issued and attached to each Common Share. One Right also attached to each subsequently issued Common Share. 
Rights Exercise Privilege 
The Rights generally separate from the Common Shares and become exercisable ten trading days (the "Separation Time") after a person has acquired, or commenced a take-over bid to acquire, 20 percent or more of the Common Shares, other than by an acquisition pursuant to a take-over bid permitted by the Rights Plan (a "Permitted Bid"). The acquisition by any person (an "Acquiring Person") of 20 percent or more of the Common Shares, other than by 
B-1 
 way of a Permitted Bid, is referred to as a "Flip-in Event". Any Rights held by an Acquiring Person will become void upon the occurrence of a Flip-in Event. Ten trading days after the occurrence of the Flip-in Event, each Right (excluding Rights held by an Acquiring Person which have become void), will permit the purchase by holders of such Rights of Common Shares at a 50 percent discount to their market price. 
The issue of the Rights is not initially dilutive. Upon a Flip-in Event and Rights separating from the Common Shares, reported earnings per share of Encana on a diluted or non-diluted basis may be affected. An Acquiring Person, and holders of Rights who do not exercise their Rights upon the occurrence of a Flip-in Event, may suffer substantial dilution. 
Lock-Up Agreements 
A bidder may enter into lock-up agreements with shareholders whereby such shareholders agree to tender their Common Shares to the take-over bid (the "Subject Bid") without a Flip-in Event occurring. Such agreement must be publicly disclosed and allow the shareholder to withdraw the Common Shares to tender to another take-over bid or to support another transaction that exceeds the value of the Subject Bid either on an absolute basis or by as much or more than a specified amount, which specified amount may not be greater than seven percent. The definition of "Lock-Up Agreement" provides that no "break up" fees or other penalties that exceed, in the aggregate, the greater of two and a half percent of the price or value of the consideration payable under the Subject Bid and 50 percent of the increase in the consideration resulting from another take-over bid transaction shall be payable by the shareholder if the shareholder fails to tender its Common Shares to the Subject Bid. 
Certificates and Transferability 
Prior to the Separation Time, the Rights are evidenced by a legend imprinted on certificates for the Common Shares or by book entry form registration and are not transferable separately from the Common Shares. From and after the Separation Time, Rights are evidenced by Rights certificates or by book entry form registration, which will be transferable and traded separately from the Common Shares. 
Permitted Bid Requirements 
The requirements for a Permitted Bid include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the take-over bid must be made by way of a take-over bid circular;  
• the take-over bid must be made to all holders of Common Shares;  
• the take-over bid must be outstanding for a minimum period of 105 days or such shorter period that a take-over bid must  remain open for deposits of securities, in the applicable circumstances, pursuant to Canadian securities laws;  
• Common Shares tendered pursuant to the take-over bid may not be taken up prior to the expiry of the period and only if  at such time more than 50 percent of the Common Shares held by Independent Shareholders (as defined below) have been tendered to the take-over bid and not withdrawn; and  
• if more than 50 percent of the Common Shares held by Independent Shareholders (as defined below) are tendered to the  take-over bid within the period and the Common Shares are taken up by the bidder, the bidder must make a public announcement of that fact and the take-over bid must remain open for deposits of Common Shares for not less than 10 business days from  the date of such public announcement.  
[END TABLE]
"Independent Shareholders" is defined in the Rights Plan as all holders of Common Shares, excluding any Acquiring Person (as defined therein), any person that is making or has announced a current intention to make a take-over bid for the Common Shares, affiliates, associates and persons acting jointly or in concert with such excluded persons, and any person who is a trustee of an employee benefit, deferred profit sharing, stock participation or other similar plan or trust for the benefit of employees of Encana unless the beneficiaries of the plan or trust direct the manner in which the Common Shares are to be voted. 
The Rights Plan allows for a competing Permitted Bid (a "Competing Permitted Bid") to be made while a Permitted Bid is in existence. A Competing Permitted Bid must satisfy all the requirements of a Permitted Bid except that it must be outstanding for a minimum number of days as required under Canadian securities laws. 
B-2 
Waiver 
The Board, acting in good faith, may prior to the occurrence of a Flip-in Event, waive the application of the Rights Plan to a particular Flip-in Event where the take-over bid is made by a take-over bid circular to all holders of Common Shares or pursuant to an amalgamation, plan of arrangement or other procedure (statutory or otherwise) having similar effect which has been approved by the Board and the requisite majority of holders of Common Shares (each, an "Exempt Acquisition"). Where the Board exercises the waiver power for one take-over bid, the waiver will also apply to any other take-over bid for Encana made by a take-over bid circular to all holders of Common Shares prior to the expiry of any other bid for which the Rights Plan has been waived. 
Redemption 
The Board, with the approval of a majority of votes cast by the Independent Shareholders (or the holders of Rights if the Separation Time has occurred) voting in person or by proxy at a meeting duly called for that purpose, may redeem the Rights at $0.000001 per Right. Rights will be deemed to have been redeemed by the Board following completion of a Permitted Bid, Competing Permitted Bid or Exempt Acquisition. 
Amendment 
The Board may amend the Rights Plan with the approval of a majority of the votes cast by the Independent Shareholders (or the holders of Rights if the Separation Time has occurred) voting in person or by proxy at a meeting duly called for that purpose. The Board, without such approval, may correct clerical or typographical errors and, subject to approval as noted above at the next meeting of the holders of Common Shares (or the holders of Rights, as the case may be), may make amendments to the Rights Plan to maintain its validity due to changes in applicable legislation. 
Board 
The Rights Plan will not detract from or lessen the duty of the Board to act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of Encana. When a Permitted Bid is made, the Board will continue to have the duty and power to take such actions and make such recommendations to shareholders as are considered appropriate. 
Exemption for Investment Managers 
Investment managers (for client accounts), trust companies (acting in their capacities as trustees and administrators), statutory bodies whose business includes the management of funds and administrators of registered pension plans acquiring greater than 20 percent of the Common Shares are exempted from triggering a Flip-in Event, provided that they are not making, or are not part of a group making, a take-over bid.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN 
The ESOP is designed to encourage a proprietary interest in Encana and align the interests of eligible employees, including our executives, with those of our shareholders. Under the ESOP, stock options ("Options") are granted to eligible Canadian-based employees, including executives. The ESOP has been approved by our shareholders. 
As at February 28, 2019, there were 8,129,492 Options outstanding under the ESOP and 40,486,272 Options available for grant, representing 0.5 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively, of the total number of outstanding Common Shares at such date. 
The ESOP is administered by the HRC Committee and the Board which have full authority to interpret the ESOP and any Option granted thereunder. The HRC Committee also has discretion to attach tandem stock appreciation rights ("TSARs") to Options granted under the ESOP. 
The ESOP includes provisions that generally mirror the insider restrictions set out in the TSX Company Manual, that provide the aggregate of Common Shares issued to Encana insiders, within any one-year period, or issuable to insiders of Encana, at any time, under the ESOP and any other security-based compensation arrangement of Encana cannot exceed 10 percent of the total issued and outstanding Common Shares (calculated on a non-diluted basis). 
Options may be granted from time to time to eligible employees. Subject to regulatory requirements, the HRC Committee and the Board determine the terms and conditions of Options granted, which are set out in the ESOP and corresponding grant agreement with the recipient. 
Options granted commencing in February 2015 are exercisable for a period of seven years from the grant date. Options granted prior to such date are exercisable for five years from the grant date. Options vest 30 percent on the first anniversary of grant, an additional 30 percent on the second anniversary of the grant, and an additional 40 percent on the third anniversary of the grant. 
Upon termination of employment (other than by death or retirement), the Option holder has until the earlier of 60 trading days or the Option expiry date to exercise any vested unexercised Options. In the event of death or retirement before age 60, the Option holder has until the earlier of six months from such date or the Option expiry date to exercise any vested unexercised Options. In any of these events, any Options that are unvested as of the date of termination of employment, death or retirement do not vest and are cancelled. In the event of death or retirement after age 60, the Option holder may exercise vested Options, and any unvested Options continue to vest until the Option expiry date. 
Options granted and outstanding under the ESOP have associated TSARs that entitle the Option holder to surrender the right to exercise his or her Option to purchase Common Shares and to instead receive cash. Such amount is valued based on the difference between the strike price and for TSARs granted after February 2015, the VWAP of Common Shares on the TSX on the five trading days prior to vesting, and for TSARs granted prior to such date, the closing price of Common Shares on the TSX on the immediately preceding trading day is used. In each case such share price is multiplied by the number of optioned Common Shares surrendered. Where a TSAR is exercised, the right to the underlying Common Share is forfeited and such number of Common Shares are returned to the Common Shares reserved for issuance under the ESOP. 
An Option can only be exercised by the Option holder and is not assignable, except on death by the Option holder's estate. An Option holder only has rights as a shareholder of Encana with respect to Common Shares he or she has acquired through exercise of an Option. 
Adjustments may be made to the exercise price of an Option, the number of Common Shares delivered to an Option holder upon exercise of an Option and the maximum number of Common Shares that may be reserved for issuance under the ESOP, in certain circumstances, such as a stock dividend, split, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of Common Shares or other similar corporate change. 
D-1 
Where an Option expires during or within 10 business days after a blackout period, the exercise period is extended 10 business days from the last day of the blackout period ("Blackout Extension Period"). 
The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the ESOP in whole or in part; provided, however, no such amendment may, without the consent of Option holders, adversely affect the rights under any Option previously granted to the Option holder under the ESOP. 
Shareholder approval is required in respect of any amendment of the ESOP that relates to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any increase in the number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under the ESOP;  
• any reduction in the exercise price or cancellation and reissue of Options;  
• any extension of the term of an Option beyond the original expiry date, except as permitted under the Blackout Extension  Period;  
• any extension to the length of the Blackout Extension Period;  
• the inclusion of non-executive directors as eligible participants under  the ESOP;  
• any allowance for the transferability of Options (other than upon death of an Option holder); or   
• amendments which require shareholder approval under applicable law.  
[END TABLE]
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, the annual burn rate of the ESOP, as calculated in accordance with Section 613(p) of the TSX Company Manual, was 0.4396 percent, 0.087 percent and 0.092 percent, respectively.

SUMMARY OF CERTAIN INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF LTI AWARDS 
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 
The following discussion is intended only as a brief summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences to Eligible Individuals and to the Company of Awards granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan based on applicable U.S. federal income tax law in effect on the date of this Proxy Statement. The following discussion does not address state, local, or non-U.S. income tax rules applicable to Awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
Incentive Stock Options. An Eligible Individual who is granted an Incentive Stock Option generally does not recognize taxable income at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted or upon its exercise, except that Eligible Individuals subject to the alternative minimum tax may recognize taxable income upon exercise in certain circumstances. Upon a disposition of the Common Shares acquired upon exercise of an Incentive Stock Option ("ISO Shares") more than two years after grant of the Incentive Stock Option and one year after exercise of the Incentive Stock Option, any gain or loss is treated as long-term capital gain or loss. In such case, the Company would not be entitled to a deduction. If the Eligible Individual sells the ISO Shares prior to the expiration of these holding periods, the Eligible Individual recognizes ordinary income at the time of disposition equal to the excess if any, of the lesser of (i) the aggregate fair market value of the ISO Shares at the date of exercise and (ii) the amount received for the ISO Shares, over the aggregate exercise price previously paid by the Eligible Individual. Any gain or loss recognized on such a premature disposition of the ISO Shares in excess of the amount treated as ordinary income is treated as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long the ISO Shares were held by the Eligible Individual prior to the sale. The Company is generally entitled to a deduction at the same time and in the same amount as the Eligible Individual recognizes ordinary income. 
Non-qualified Stock Options and SARs. An Eligible Individual who is granted a Stock Option that is not an Incentive Stock Option (a "Non-qualified Stock Option") does not recognize any taxable income at the time of grant. Upon exercise, the Eligible Individual recognizes taxable income in an amount equal to the aggregate fair market value of the Common Shares subject to the Non-qualified Stock Option over the aggregate exercise price of such Common Shares. Any taxable income recognized in connection with the exercise of a Non-qualified Stock Option by an Eligible Individual who is an employee is subject to payroll taxes. The Company is generally entitled to a deduction at the same time and in the same amount as the Eligible Individual recognizes ordinary income. 
Other Awards. An Eligible Individual will generally not recognize income at the time an Award of RSUs, PSUs or Restricted Stock is granted. When the vesting restrictions lapse with regard to any installment of Restricted Stock, the Eligible Individual will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Common Shares with respect to which the restrictions lapse, unless the Eligible Individual previously elected to realize ordinary income in the year the Award was granted in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Restricted Stock awarded, determined without regard to the restrictions. An Eligible Individual will recognize ordinary income at the time that cash or Common Shares are delivered pursuant to an Award of RSUs or PSUs, in an amount equal to the cash paid or to be paid or the fair market value of the Common Shares delivered or to be delivered. The amount of ordinary income recognized by an Eligible Individual who is an employee is subject to payroll taxes. The Company is generally entitled to a deduction at the same time and in the same amount as the Eligible Individual recognizes ordinary income. 
Canadian Federal Income Tax Consequences 
The following discussion is intended only as a brief summary of certain Canadian federal income tax consequences to Eligible Individuals who are residents of and employed in Canada based on applicable provisions of the Income Tax Act (Canada) in effect on the date of this Proxy Statement. The following discussion does not address provincial, local, or non-Canadian income tax rules applicable to Awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
Stock Options. An Eligible Individual who is granted a Stock Option generally does not recognize taxable income at the time the Stock Option is granted or upon its exercise. Upon exercise of a Stock Option, the Eligible Individual 
E-1 
 recognizes income from an office or employment equal to the excess, if any, of the aggregate fair market value of the Common Shares acquired pursuant to the Stock Option at the date of exercise over the aggregate exercise price paid by the Eligible Individual (such excess being the "Option Benefit"). Provided certain conditions are met, the Eligible Individual should be entitled to deduct 50% of the Option Benefit in calculating his or her tax payable in respect of the exercise of the Stock Option. The Company is generally not entitled to a deduction in respect of Stock Options or the Common Shares issued on the exercise of Stock Options. 
Other Awards. An Eligible Individual will generally not recognize income at the time an Award of RSUs or PSUs is granted. An Eligible Individual will recognize ordinary income at the time that cash or Common Shares are delivered pursuant to an Award of RSUs or PSUs, in an amount equal to the cash paid or to be paid or the fair market value of the Common Shares delivered or to be delivered. The amount of ordinary income recognized by an Eligible Individual who is an employee is subject to payroll taxes. The Company is generally not entitled to a deduction where it issues Common Shares in settlement of vested RSUs or PSUs.

ADVISORY REGARDING NON-GAAP MEASURES 
Encana's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"). This Proxy Statement contains references that do not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, are considered non-GAAP measures. These measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Non-GAAP measures include the following: 
Non-GAAP Cash Flow (or Cash Flow) are non-GAAP measures defined as cash from operating activities excluding net change in other assets and liabilities, net change in non-cash working capital and current tax on sale of assets. Cash Flow per share is Non-GAAP Cash Flow divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Free Cash Flow is Non-GAAP Cash Flow in excess of capital expenditures, excluding net acquisitions and divestitures. Non-GAAP Cash Flow Margin is Non-GAAP Cash Flow per BOE of production. Management believes these measures are useful to the Company and its investors as a measure of operating and financial performance across periods and against other companies in the industry and are an indication of the Company's ability to generate cash to finance capital programs, to service debt and to meet other financial obligations. These measures may be used, along with other measures, in the calculation of certain performance targets for the Company's management and employees. Non-GAAP Cash Flow and Non-GAAP Cash Flow Margin are also referenced in the Annual Report in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 73. 
Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure calculated as Net Debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA. Net Debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as long-term debt, including the current portion, less cash and cash equivalents. Management uses Net Debt as a substitute for total long-term debt in certain internal debt metrics as a measure of the Company's ability to service debt obligations and as an indicator of the Company's overall financial strength. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure defined as trailing 12-month net earnings (loss) before income taxes, DD&A, impairments, accretion of asset retirement obligation, interest, unrealized gains/losses on risk management, foreign exchange gains/losses, gains/losses on divestitures and other gains/losses. Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is monitored by management as an indicator of the Company's overall financial strength. Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA can be found in the Annual Report in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 74. 
Please refer to our Non-GAAP Definitions and Reconciliations available on our website at www.encana.com for further information regarding these measures.
