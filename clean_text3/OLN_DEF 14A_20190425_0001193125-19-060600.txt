PROXY STATEMENT 
ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 
To be Held on April 25, 2019 
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON APRIL 25, 2019 
Olin's Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement and 2018 Annual Report on Form 10 - K are available at www.proxydocs.com/oln. You will need your 11-digit control number located in the upper right box on the front of your proxy card or the notice regarding the availability of proxy materials to vote your shares. 
GENERAL QUESTIONS 
Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the availability of proxy materials instead of printed copies of the proxy materials? 
In accordance with rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we may furnish proxy materials to our shareholders by providing access to these documents online instead of mailing printed copies. Unless you are a participant in the Olin Corporation Contributing Employee Ownership Plan (the CEOP), you will not receive printed copies of the materials unless you request them. Instead, we mailed you the notice regarding the availability of proxy materials (unless you have previously consented to electronic delivery or already requested to receive printed copies), which describes how you may access and review all of the proxy materials online. The notice regarding the availability of proxy materials provides instructions as to how shareholders can access the proxy materials online, contains a listing of matters to be considered at the meeting, and sets forth instructions as to how shares can be voted. Shares must be voted either online, by telephone, or by completing and returning a proxy card. Shares cannot be voted by marking, writing on and/or returning the notice regarding the availability of proxy materials. Any notices regarding the availability of proxy materials that are returned will not be counted as votes. Instructions for requesting a paper copy of the proxy materials are set forth on the notice regarding the availability of proxy materials. 
This process is designed to expedite shareholders' receipt of proxy materials, lower the cost of the annual meeting, and help conserve natural resources. However, if you prefer to receive printed proxy materials via mail or receive an e-mail with links to the electronic materials, please follow the instructions included on the notice regarding the availability of proxy materials. 
Why did I receive this proxy statement? 
You received this proxy statement because you owned shares of Olin common stock, par value $1 per share, which we sometimes refer to as common stock, at the close of business on February 26, 2019. Olin's board of directors is asking you to vote at the 2019 annual meeting FOR each of the director nominees identified in Item 1, and FOR each of Items 2 and 3 listed in the notice of the annual meeting of shareholders. This proxy statement describes the matters on which we would like you to vote and provides information so that you can make an informed decision. 
When was this proxy material mailed to shareholders? 
We began to mail the proxy statement and form of proxy to shareholders on or about March 11, 2019. 
When was the notice regarding the availability of proxy materials mailed to shareholders? 
We began to mail the notice regarding the availability of proxy materials to shareholders on or about March 11, 2019. 
What if I have questions? 
If you have questions, please write them down and send them to the Secretary at Olin's principal executive office at 190 Carondelet Plaza, Suite 1530, Clayton, MO 63105 USA. 
What will I be voting on? 
You will be voting on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  the election of the five directors identified in the proxy statement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  an advisory vote to approve the compensation for named executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  the ratification of KPMG LLP (KPMG) as Olin's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  any other business properly presented at the annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
The proposal to ratify the appointment of KPMG as Olin's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 is considered a discretionary item for which a broker will have discretionary voting power if you do not give instructions with respect to this proposal. The proposals to elect directors and to conduct an advisory vote to approve the compensation for named executive officers, are non-routine matters for which a broker will not have discretionary voting power and for which specific instructions from beneficial owners are required. As a result, a broker will not be allowed to vote on these two matters on behalf of its beneficial owner customers if the customers do not return specific voting instructions. If you are a shareholder that holds shares through a broker, please provide specific voting instructions to your broker. 
Could other matters be voted on at the annual meeting? 
As of March 11, 2019, the items listed in the preceding question are the only matters being considered. If any other matters are properly presented for action, the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy will vote the proxy in accordance with their good faith business judgment as to what is in the best interests of Olin. 
How does the board recommend I vote on the proposals? 
Our board recommends a vote FOR each of the director nominees identified in Item 1, and FOR Items 2 and 3.  What do I need to do to attend the 2019 annual meeting in person? 
Each attendee must bring a valid, government-issued photo ID, such as a driver's license or passport, as well as other verification of Olin common stock ownership. For a shareholder of record or participant in the CEOP, please bring your notice or the upper half of your proxy card (CEOP shares must be voted either online or by telephone no later than April 22, 2019 at 11:59 p.m. Central Daylight Time, or by mail if received no later than April 20, 2019). If you are a beneficial owner of Olin common stock, but do not hold your shares in your own name (i.e., your shares are held in street name), please bring the notice or voting instruction form you received from your bank, broker or other nominee. You may also bring your bank or brokerage account statement reflecting your ownership of Olin common stock as of February 26, 2019, the record date. 
Please note that cameras, sound or video recording equipment, cellular telephones, smartphones and other similar devices, as well as purses, briefcases, backpacks and packages, will not be allowed in the meeting room. No one will be admitted to the meeting once it begins. 
How can I obtain directions to be able to attend the annual meeting and vote in person? 
You may obtain directions to the Plaza in Clayton Office Tower in Clayton, MO, USA by calling 1-314-290-5039 or online at www.theplazainclayton.axisportal.com/directions.axis. 
VOTING 
Who can vote? 
All shareholders of record at the close of business on February 26, 2019, are entitled to vote at the annual meeting. 
How many votes can be cast by all shareholders? 
At the close of business on February 26, 2019, the record date for voting, we had 164,888,457 outstanding shares of common stock. Each shareholder on the record date may cast one vote for each full share owned. The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of such outstanding shares constitutes a quorum. If a share is present for any purpose at the meeting, it is deemed to be present for the transaction of all business. Abstentions and shares held in street name that are voted on any matter will be included in determining the number of votes present. Shares held in street name that are not voted on any matter at the meeting will not be included in determining whether a quorum is present. 
How do I vote if I am not the shareholder of record? 
If you are not the shareholder of record but hold shares through a custodian, broker or other agent, such agent may have special voting instructions that you should follow. Please see the materials sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee for information on how to vote your shares. 
How do I vote if I am the shareholder of record?

How are votes counted? 
If you specifically mark the proxy card (or vote online or by telephone) and indicate how you want your vote to be cast regarding any matter, your directions will be followed. If you sign and submit the proxy card but do not specifically mark it with your instructions as to how you want to vote, the proxy will be voted FOR the election of the directors named in this proxy statement in Item 1, and FOR each of Items 2 and 3 listed in the proxy. If you submit a proxy card marked "abstain" on any item, your shares will not be voted on that item so marked and your vote will not be included in determining the   number of votes cast on that matter. Shares held in street name that are not voted in the election of directors or on Items 2 or 3 will not be included in determining the number of votes cast on those matters. 
EQ Shareowner Services tabulates the shareholder votes and provides an independent inspector of election as part of its services as our registrar and transfer agent. 
Can I change my vote?

Proxies submitted by shareholders online or by telephone will be counted in the vote only if they are received no later than April 24, 2019 by 11:59 p.m. Central Daylight Time. Shares voted using a proxy card will be counted in the vote only if we receive your proxy card no later than April 24, 2019.

 ITEM 1—PROPOSAL FOR THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Who are the individuals nominated by the board to serve as directors? 
The board of directors is divided into three classes. Each class has a term of office for three years, and the term of each class ends in a different year. Donald Bogus will be retiring from his position as a director at the 2019 annual meeting. In addition, Ms. Streeter, who joined the board in 2018, resigned her position as a director in January 2019. Virginia law and Olin's Bylaws require that any director elected by the board of directors (rather than the shareholders) serve only until the earlier of the next election of directors by the shareholders and until his or her successor is elected or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. The board has nominated Messrs. Bunch, O'Connor, Sutton and Weideman as Class I directors with terms expiring in 2022 and Mr. Larrimore as a Class II director with his term expiring in 2020. Mr. Larrimore will move from a Class I director to a Class II director in view of his reaching mandatory retirement age as of the 2020 annual meeting and in order to help maintain, as much as possible, an even number of directors in each class. The board expects that all of the nominees will be able to serve as directors. If any nominee is unable to accept election, a proxy voting in favor of such nominee will be voted for the election of a substitute nominee selected by the board, unless the board reduces the number of directors. 
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR the election of Messrs. Bunch, O'Connor, Sutton and Weideman as Class I directors and Mr. Larrimore as a Class II director. 
How many votes are required to elect a director? 
A nominee will be elected as a director by a majority of the votes cast. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes FOR a nominee must exceed the number of votes AGAINST that nominee. Abstentions and shares held in street name that are not voted in the election of directors will not be included in determining the number of votes cast and will not affect the outcome of the vote in the election of directors. 
Business Experience of Nominees 
Set forth on the following pages are descriptions of the business experience of each director nominee, including a brief summary of the specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led our board to conclude that these individuals should serve as our directors.        CLASS I

 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
How Many Meetings Did Board Members Attend? 
During 2018, the board held nine meetings. As part of each regularly scheduled board meeting, the non-employee directors met in executive session. All directors attended over 95% of the 2018 meetings of the board and committees of the board on which they served. In addition, during their entire period of service, each director attended over 90% of the meetings of the board and committees of the board on which he or she served. All of our directors at the time of the 2018 annual meeting attended the meeting. We have a policy requiring directors to attend each annual meeting, absent serious extenuating circumstances. 
Which Board Members Are Independent? 
Our board has determined that all of its members, except Mr. Fischer, are independent, or were independent while serving on the board, in accordance with applicable New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards and applicable provisions of our Principles of Corporate Governance. In determining independence, the board confirms that a director has no relationship with Olin that violates the "bright line" independence standards under the NYSE listing standards. The board also reviews whether a director has any other material relationship with Olin, after consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. In assessing the materiality of a director's relationship to Olin, the board considers the issues from the director's standpoint and from the perspective of the persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation. The board reviews commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable and familial relationships. 
Our board of directors has adopted a bright line test for the types of de minimis transactions that do not warrant board consideration when making director independence determinations. This policy provides that the following transactions do not impair a director's independence, and are not considered by our board in its determination of director independence: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· our match of up to $5,000 in charitable contributions made by directors under our 50% matching contribution program, which is available to all employees; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· any transaction or series of transactions between Olin (or its subsidiaries) and a director (or an organization in which he/she serves as a director, partner,  shareholder or officer) for the purchase or sale of products or services that (i) involve less than $50,000 in the aggregate in any 12-month period and (ii) have the same pricing and other terms and  conditions as transactions with unrelated and similarly situated customers or suppliers.  
[END TABLE]
Except as provided below, during 2018, none of our current or former non-employee directors had any relationship or transaction other than those which are permitted under the bright line standards described above. 
In 2018, we sold an aggregate of approximately $108,000 of chlor alkali products to Celanese Corporation and we purchased an aggregate of approximately $611,000 of product from Celanese Corporation. One of our directors, Scott Sutton, served as chief operating officer of Celanese in 2018. Our board determined that Mr. Sutton had no material interest in these sales transactions and they did not impair Mr. Sutton's independence because the transactions were made on customary terms and conditions, and amounted to less than 0.01% of Celanese's total sales and 0.002% of Olin's total sales.  In 2018, we purchased approximately $2,932,000 of energy-related services from National Grid US and received approximately $598,000 in payments for our participation in National Grid's demand response program. In January 2019, one of our directors, Earl Shipp, became a member of the board of directors of National Grid plc and serves on such board's safety, environment and health committee, its nominations committee and its remuneration committee. Our board determined that Mr. Shipp had no material interest in these transactions and they did not impair Mr. Shipp's independence because the transactions were made on customary terms and conditions, and amounted to less than 0.002% of National Grid plc's total sales and 0.01% of Olin's total sales. 
Does Olin Have Corporate Governance Guidelines and a Code of Conduct? 
The board has adopted Principles of Corporate Governance and a Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct applies to our directors and all of our employees, including our chief executive officer (CEO), chief financial officer (CFO) and principal accounting officer/controller. We discuss certain provisions of these documents in more detail under the heading "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS." 
Each of our three major standing board committees (Audit, Compensation and Directors and Corporate Governance) acts under a written charter adopted by the board. The committee charters can be viewed on our website at www.olin.com/investors/leadership-governance/committees. The Principles of Corporate Governance and Code of Conduct can all be viewed on our website at www.olin.com/investors/leadership-governance/governance-documents. In addition, we will disclose on that website any amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of our Code of Conduct for our directors and executive officers, including our CEO, CFO, principal accounting officer/controller or other employees performing similar functions. 
Does Olin Prohibit Hedging and Pledging of Its Stock by Insiders? 
Under our insider trading policy, our directors and executive officers are prohibited from engaging in any: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· hedging or monetization transactions in our securities where the director or executive officer continues to own the underlying security without all the risks  or rewards of ownership; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· pledging of our securities whether as part of a hedging transaction or loan transaction.  
[END TABLE]
As of February 26, 2019, no shares of our common stock were pledged by any director or executive officer. 
Do Olin's Board and Committees Conduct Evaluations?

[END TABLE]
What Is Olin's Director Nomination Process? 
Our directors and corporate governance committee acts as our nominating committee. As a policy, the committee considers any director candidates suggested by shareholders if we receive the appropriate information in a timely manner. Our Principles of Corporate Governance provide that the board chair, CEO, lead director, other directors, employees and shareholders may recommend director nominees to the committee. The committee uses the same process to review and evaluate all potential director nominees, regardless of who recommends the candidate. The committee reviews and   evaluates each nominee and the committee chair, the board chair, CEO and lead director interview the potential new board candidates selected by the committee. The interview results, along with the committee's recommended nominees, are submitted to the full board. 
Our Principles of Corporate Governance describe criteria for new board members to include recognized achievement plus skills such as a special understanding or ability to contribute to some aspect of Olin's business. The committee is tasked with seeking board members with the personal qualities and experience that taken together will ensure a strong board of directors. Although we have no formal policy on diversity for board members, our Principles of Corporate Governance provide that racial, ethnic and gender diversity are important factors in assessing potential board members, in addition to particular qualifications and experience required to meet the needs of the board. Furthermore, as part of the committee's review of board composition, the board considers diversity of experience and background in an effort to ensure that the composition of our directors ensures a strong and effective board. Our Principles of Corporate Governance cite strength of character, an inquiring and independent mind, practical wisdom and mature judgment as among the principal qualities of an effective director. 
This year, we have five nominees standing for election or re-election. 
A shareholder can suggest a person for nomination as a director by providing the name and address of the candidate, and a detailed description of his or her experience and other qualifications for the position, in writing addressed to the board of directors in care of the Secretary, Olin Corporation, 190 Carondelet Plaza, Suite 1530, Clayton, MO 63105 USA. The notice may be sent at any time, but for a candidate to be considered by the committee as a nominee for an annual meeting, we must receive the written information at least 150 days before the anniversary of the date of the prior year's proxy statement. For example, for candidates to be considered for nomination by the committee at the 2020 annual meeting, we must receive the information from shareholders on or before October 11, 2019. 
In addition to shareholders proposing candidates for consideration by the committee, Olin's Bylaws allow shareholders to directly nominate individuals at the annual meeting for election to the board by delivering a written notice as described under the heading "MISCELLANEOUS—How can I directly nominate a director for election to the board at the 2020 annual meeting?" on page 7. Although a shareholder may directly nominate an individual for election as a director, the board is not required to include such nominee in the proxy statement. 
What Is the Board Leadership Structure? 
Our Principles of Corporate Governance state that our board may select either a combined CEO board chair coupled with a lead director or appoint a board chair who does not also serve as CEO. Currently, Mr. Fischer serves as our combined CEO and chairman of the board, and the board selected Mr. Weideman as our independent lead director. 
The board believes that this leadership structure is best for Olin at the current time, as it appropriately balances the need for the CEO to run the company on a day-to-day basis with significant involvement and authority vested in an outside independent board member—the lead director. Our lead director assumes many functions traditionally within the purview of a chairman of the board. Under our Principles of Corporate Governance, our lead director must be independent, and is responsible for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· advising on the board meeting schedule to ensure that the independent directors can perform their duties responsibly without interfering with company  operations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· approving agendas for board and committee meetings and information sent to the board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· advising on quality, quantity, and timeliness of the flow of information from management to independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· interviewing all potential new board candidates, and making recommendations on candidates;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· chairing all executive sessions of the board's independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· recommending membership and chairs of board committees;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· recommending to the board chair the retention of consultants who report directly to the board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· calling meetings of the independent directors; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· being available for direct communication if requested by major shareholders, as appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
How Does the Board Oversee Olin's Risk Management Process? 
Our board is responsible for oversight of Olin's risk assessment and management process. The board delegated to the compensation committee basic responsibility for oversight of management's compensation risk assessment, and that committee reports to the board on its review. Our board also delegated tasks related to risk process oversight to our audit committee, which reports the results of its review process to the board. The audit committee's process includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a review, at least annually, of our internal audit process, including the organizational structure and staff qualifications, as well as the scope and  methodology of the internal audit process; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a review, at least annually, of our enterprise risk management (ERM) program to ensure that an appropriate ERM process is in place, including discussion of  the major risk exposures identified by Olin, the key strategic plan assumptions considered during the assessment and steps implemented to monitor and mitigate such exposures on an ongoing basis.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to the reports from the audit and compensation committees, our board periodically discusses risk oversight, including as part of its annual detailed corporate strategy review. 
Brian J. Clucas, our Vice President, Global Internal Audit, reports directly to our audit committee and has direct and unrestricted access to that committee. Todd A. Slater, our Vice President and CFO, oversees our ERM process and fulfills the responsibilities of a chief risk officer. Mr. Slater reports to our CEO, but has direct access to our audit committee chair. Messrs. Slater and Clucas, individually or with other members of our management team, periodically meet in executive session with the audit committee.  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The audit committee's primary responsibility is to assist the board in its oversight of the integrity of Olin's financial reporting process and systems of internal control, to evaluate the independence and performance of Olin's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, and internal audit functions and to encourage private communication between the audit committee and KPMG and the internal auditors. 
The committee held six meetings during the year. During the second half of 2018, the audit committee also completed a self-assessment. 
In discharging its responsibility, the audit committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for fiscal year 2018 with management and KPMG, including the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard No.1301, Communications with Audit Committees. 
In addition, the audit committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding KPMG's communications with the audit committee concerning independence. The audit committee discussed with KPMG the issue of its independence from Olin and reviewed KPMG's reports on the firm's quality review procedures and findings, results of peer reviews and investigations and inquiries, including corrective actions taken. The audit committee also negotiated the hiring of KPMG for the 2018 audit and pre-approved all fees which SEC rules require the committee to approve to ensure that the work performed was permissible under applicable standards and would not impair KPMG's independence. 
Based on the audit committee's discussions with management and KPMG and the audit committee's review of KPMG's written report and the other materials discussed above, the audit committee recommended that the board of directors include the audited consolidated financial statements in Olin's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, to be filed with the SEC.

 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Our Principles of Corporate Governance and our Code of Conduct include policies and procedures requiring pre-approval of certain transactions involving our directors and employees and their family members and affiliated organizations if Olin is a direct or indirect participant. The policies define "family member" to mean a spouse, child, sibling, stepchild, parent, stepparent, mother-, father-, son-, daughter-, brother- or sister- in-law, or any other person living with the individual (except tenants and household employees). Affiliated organizations include those entities where the individual or family member serves as a director, executive officer or holder of 5% or more of the equity interests. 
Our Principles of Corporate Governance require the directors and corporate governance committee (or, if that committee determines it is appropriate, the board) to pre-approve the following transactions with directors, family members and affiliated organizations: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· charitable contributions of more than $10,000 in a fiscal year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· transactions involving more than $120,000 (individually or in the aggregate) in a fiscal year (other than purchases or sales of goods and services contracted  for by Olin business units in the normal course of business);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· transactions in excess of $120,000 in a fiscal year for consulting or personal services;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· transactions in excess of $120,000 in a fiscal year directly with (or involving direct compensation to) a director or family member;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· transactions involving more than $120,000 (individually or in the aggregate) in a fiscal year (other than purchases or sales of goods and services contracted  for by Olin business units in the normal course of business); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· transactions (even in the ordinary course of business) involving the greater of $1 million or 2% of consolidated gross revenues of either Olin or the  other party.  
[END TABLE]
Our Principles of Corporate Governance require our directors and corporate governance committee to pre-approve service by any senior executive (our CEO and other Section 16 officers) on the board of another public company or on the board of any private company that would represent a material commitment of time. In addition, our Code of Conduct and related Corporate Policy Statements require the approval of the board of directors before an officer may serve as a director or provide services to another organization (as an officer, employee, consultant, etc.). Any such service by other employees must be pre-approved by our CEO, if the potential for a conflict of interest exists. These provisions also prohibit any employee or family member from having any direct or indirect interest in, or any involvement with or obligation to, any business organization (including any non-profit entity to which Olin makes contributions) which does or seeks to do business with Olin, or any Olin competitor, without pre-approval from the employee's department head. 
In granting pre-approval, the directors and corporate governance committee, board members and management focus on the best interests of Olin. 
In addition to the pre-approval process described above, our Code of Conduct and related Corporate Policy Statements prohibit any director or employee from engaging in a transaction that might conflict with the best interests of Olin.  SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL 
OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC, and these persons must furnish us with copies of the forms they file. Officers, directors and 10% beneficial owners complied with Section 16(a) filing requirements in 2018. 
RESPONSIBLE CARE AND SUSTAINABILITY 
Throughout its 127-year history, Olin has been known as a responsible corporate citizen. We are committed to leveraging the principles of Responsible Care® within our operations globally to drive excellence in environmental, health, safety and security stewardship. We value our people, the communities in which we operate, our customers, and the environment. The Olin Sustainability Platform encompasses actions to manage energy and climate, ensure resource efficiency of our operations, measure and assess product sustainability, and engage our communities and employees on matters most relevant to Olin and our stakeholders. 
During 2018, the chemical division of Olin achieved third-party certification to the RC 14001:2015 standard, including the internationally recognized ISO 14001:2015 standard for environmental management systems. We also received ISO 50001 (energy) certification in Germany. Our product stewardship policy incorporates the American Chemistry Council's Product Safety Code in our chemicals business segments and ensures that our product safety performance is properly evaluated and continuously improved, and relevant elements made publicly available. We are committed to open and transparent reporting and regularly conduct audits to ensure compliance with the highest global standards. 
Olin was honored in 2018 to receive numerous recognitions and accolades from global agencies and industry associations for our achievements in energy efficiency, waste minimization, reuse and recycling, and safety and environmental stewardship. In 2018, we were awarded the American Association of Railroads' Grand Slam award for the third consecutive year. The award is recognition by at least four North American Class 1 Railroads for our efforts to reduce non-accidental environmental releases. 
Olin's board of directors has accountability for oversight of our environmental and safety performance, which it reviews no less than each quarter. The board also has responsibility for monitoring our response to important public policy issues, including sustainability, which is reviewed on a routine basis. Business ethics, diversity, and talent management are additional key subjects related to sustainability that are discussed by the board. Further, the compensation committee has structured our compensation program to balance financial results with Olin's achievement of annual goals relating to environmental impact, safety, sustainability, and ethical conduct. We also have engaged with our shareholders on sustainability matters. 
For information about how we manage our commitments to Responsible Care and sustainability, please visit the Corporate Responsibility page of our website at www.olin.com/corporate-responsibility.  EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

[END TABLE]
 At the 2018 annual meeting of our shareholders, we held an advisory vote on executive compensation. Approximately 97.5% of the shares voted were cast in support of our 2018 executive compensation and related disclosures. The committee viewed the results of this vote as general broad shareholder support for our executive compensation program. While we made no changes to our executive compensation program as a result of that vote, our committee continuously evaluates our executive compensation program and makes changes to respond to market trends and other relevant factors. 
Pay for Performance 
We understand that there are different ways to view "pay for performance." In the following sections, we highlight how the committee thinks about executive pay and Olin performance, and why we believe our executive compensation programs are appropriately aligned with results that benefit our investors. 
Compensation Program Construction 
Our executive compensation program is designed to align with the long-term interests of our shareholders, to reward employees for producing sustainable growth, and to attract and retain the world-class talent that will ensure we succeed. The committee strongly believes that these objectives will be fulfilled if executive compensation—pay opportunities and pay actually realized—is tied to Olin's results. The committee measures Olin performance in two primary ways for purposes of establishing executive compensation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· our financial results, particularly our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), Adjusted Cash Flow and  adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS) (see pages 39-40), and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· our return to shareholders over time relative to other companies.  
[END TABLE]
By tying our executives' pay to Olin's actual results, our compensation programs (i) align our executives' interests with those of our shareholders and (ii) induce our management team to achieve our most important goals. 
Our total direct compensation package comprises three elements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· annual cash incentive; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· long-term incentive (equity) compensation (LTI).  
[END TABLE]
 Each NEO has a target total compensation opportunity that is reviewed annually by the committee to ensure its alignment with Olin's pay-for-performance objectives. As the following chart shows, 85% of the target annual direct compensation of our current CEO and 74% of the target annual direct compensation for the other NEOs varies with our financial results and our stock price performance: 
NEO TARGET COMPENSATION 
2018 Results 
Olin generated a number of operational accomplishments that informed the committee's decision making as it related to executive compensation in 2018. Specifically, we generated increased EBITDA and EPS compared to 2017, achieved a record Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable rate corporate-wide, experienced for the second consecutive year a record year of safety in the Winchester Division, and achieved higher than expected productivity improvements. 
The Compensation Committee 
The committee is the body primarily responsible for overseeing compensation to our senior officers. Our committee consists of directors who are independent under the NYSE listing criteria. The committee establishes total compensation opportunities (and each of the individual elements) for the CEO, and approves compensation for the other executive officers, including the NEOs, based on recommendations by the CEO. 
To assist in performing its duties, the committee engages Exequity LLP (Exequity), an independent board and management advisory firm. In engaging Exequity, the committee considered a number of factors in assessing Exequity's independence, including the fact that Exequity performs no other work for Olin, that none of Exequity's consultants owns stock in Olin, that Exequity's consultants have no other business interests with any Olin officer or director, and the fees that Exequity receives   for services rendered to Olin rest below a maximum permissible level. In the past several years, the committee discussed its compensation philosophy with Exequity, but otherwise did not impose any specific limitations or constraints on, or otherwise direct, the manner in which Exequity performed its advisory services. 
As advisor to the committee, Exequity reviewed the total compensation strategy and pay levels for our NEOs, examined all aspects of our executive compensation programs to ensure their ongoing support of our business strategy, informed the committee of developing legal and regulatory considerations affecting executive compensation and benefit programs, and provided general advice to the committee on all compensation decisions pertaining to the CEO and to all senior executive compensation recommendations submitted by management. The committee routinely meets in executive session (without the CEO or other officers present). As appropriate, Exequity attends some of those executive sessions. In addition to the committee's retention of Exequity, Olin periodically retains one or more other compensation consulting firms to provide general services, such as actuarial services for pension plans. 
Benchmarking 
In designing and implementing our executive compensation programs, it has been the committee's practice to review compensation data from a peer group that is adjusted periodically in consultation with Exequity. We refer to this group as the "comparator group." For awards made in 2018, the comparator group was composed of the 27 chemical companies listed below, with median revenues of $3.9 billion:

The committee annually evaluates the comparator group and makes adjustments as appropriate. For 2019, Celanese Corporation, FMC Corporation, Huntsman Corporation, Platform Specialty Products Corporation, RPM International, Inc. and Westlake Chemicals Corporation were added to the 2018 comparator group, and American Air Liquide Inc., Ascend Performance Materials Operations LLC, Cabot Microelectronics Corporation, Hexion Inc., Lyondellbasell Industries Inc., Milliken & Company, NewMarket Corporation, Sabic Innovative Plastics US LLC and W. R. Grace & Co. were removed from the comparator group. We believe these modifications to the peer group better align Olin with the peer group median, industry, and corporate structure.  What We Pay and Why: Elements of Compensation 
We extend to our executives three elements of total direct compensation: base salary; annual cash incentive; and long-term equity awards, plus a limited number of benefits that commonly are available to senior management at other companies of similar stature. The chart below illustrates that 76% of the actual 2018 total direct compensation of our NEOs was tied to Olin performance.

 As a guideline, the committee intends that the base salaries, total cash compensation (salary and annual cash incentive), and total compensation opportunities (total cash compensation plus the grant date value of long-term incentive awards) extended to our NEOs as a group approximate the market median of the comparator group practices. The committee believes that managing total target pay to the market median for the comparator group allows us to attract, motivate, and retain the quality executive talent Olin needs. Pay levels for any individual NEO, however, may be below or above the market median of the comparator group for that executive's particular role. The chart below shows how our 2018 NEO compensation approximated the median compensation for the comparator group. 
NEO 2018 Target Compensation Against Market Median 
Our general practice for an executive who is new in his/her position is to establish compensation opportunities below the market, and to increase them to market level over several years, assuming performance warrants such increases. Other material increases in compensation generally relate to promotions or added responsibilities. 
Salary 
The committee normally adjusts NEO salaries annually to reflect merit, promotion or change in role and changes in market rates for the job. No increase in base salary is automatic or guaranteed. The frequency of adjustments, in fact, has been extended to 18 months or more when warranted by cash flow or other considerations, and on occasion we have frozen executive base salaries for extended periods of time. 
Annual Cash Incentive (Non-equity Incentive Program Compensation) 
In 2018, our NEOs participated in the same annual cash incentive program as other senior employees. The committee established a target award for each NEO (set forth in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table). Based on our results, the committee determined the actual cash award for each of the NEOs (which may not exceed the maximum award for that NEO set forth in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table), based on achievement of 2018 financial goals and non-financial strategic   objectives described below. For purposes of this analysis, financial objectives were weighted at 80% and non-financial objectives were weighted at 20% for NEOs with corporate-wide responsibilities (75% and 25% weighting to financial and non-financial objectives, respectively, for NEOs with divisional responsibilities). Prior to 2018, our NEOs participated in the Senior Management Incentive Compensation Plan, or SMICP. The SMICP was an incentive plan that had been approved by our shareholders, was intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code) and had the same performance target metrics as our annual cash incentive program for other senior employees. We no longer use the SMICP, given that changes to Section 162(m) of the Code eliminated the exemption for performance-based compensation from the $1 million cap on the deductibility of NEO compensation. 
The following table illustrates the portion of each NEO's cash incentive based on corporate and division financial targets and corporate and division non-financial objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Actual payouts of cash incentive awards are determined based on our achievement against our financial performance targets as well as against our non-financial goals, discussed below. 
NEOs with Corporate-Wide Responsibilities.    In 2018, for each of our NEOs with corporate-wide responsibilities (Messrs. Fischer, Slater and McIntosh), 80% of his cash incentive was based on financial targets and 20% on non-financial objectives. 
Financial Targets.    In 2018, our financial performance targets for NEOs with corporate-wide responsibilities (Messrs. Fischer, Slater and McIntosh) were based on Adjusted EBITDA (50%), Adjusted Cash Flow (15%) and Adjusted EPS (15%). Adjusted Cash Flow represents our after tax operating cash flows of the business, including interest paid and changes in working capital, reduced by capital expenditures, and excluding proceeds from insurance recoveries. For 2018, in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we used 2018 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) excluding the effect of the following special charges, gains and losses (which were reflected in our 2018 EBITDA): (i) environmental insurance recoveries of $111.0 million, reduced by associated legal costs of $21.5 million, (ii) $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge associated with an investment in non-consolidated affiliates, (iii) restructuring charges of $15.7 million, (iv) $1.7 million of loss on the sale of land, and (v) $1.0 million of acquisition-related integration costs. For 2018, in calculating Adjusted EPS, we used 2018 net income excluding the effect of the following special charges, gains and losses (which were reflected in our 2018 net income): (i) environmental insurance recoveries of $111.0 million, reduced by associated legal costs of $21.5 million, (ii) $21.5 million non-cash impairment charge associated with an investment in non-consolidated affiliates, (iii) restructuring charges of $15.7 million, (iv) $1.7 million of loss on the sale of land, (v) $1.0 million of acquisition-related integration costs, and (vi) $3.8 million tax benefit from the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017. 
For these NEOs, the portion of the cash incentive related to financial targets (80%) would be paid at the target award level (set forth in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table) if our Adjusted   EBITDA, Adjusted Cash Flow and Adjusted EPS equal the financial performance targets. If any of the three metrics fall above or below the target level, the committee adjusts the cash incentive, typically by a proportionate adjustment—that is, by dividing actual Adjusted EBITDA (Adjusted Cash Flow or Adjusted EPS) by the target Adjusted EBITDA (Adjusted Cash Flow or Adjusted EPS), and multiplying that percentage by 50% (or 15%, as applicable). Awards for NEOs are subject to a maximum award level of 200% of base salary. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Financial Performance Objectives           2018 Target       2018 Actual           Weighting        
   Adjusted EBITDA (in millions)        $ 1,091.5          $ 1,230.7            50%      
   Adjusted Cash Flow (in millions)        $  278.0          $  387.0            15%      
   Adjusted EPS        $  1.28          $  1.704            15%      
[END TABLE]
The portion of the actual awards for the NEOs related to Adjusted EBITDA compared to the 2018 financial target represented achievement of 56.4% of the financial objective, the Adjusted Cash Flow compared to the 2018 financial target represented achievement of 20.9% of the financial objective, and the Adjusted EPS compared to the 2018 financial target represented achievement of 19.9% of the financial objective. 
Non-Financial Objectives.    In 2018, safety and environmental, operational and strategic goals comprised 20% of the award opportunity for our NEOs. Safety and environmental objectives accounted for 5% of the award opportunity. Operational goals relating to cost reductions and synergies accounted for 10% of the award opportunity. Strategic goals relating to development of long-term strategic plans for each of the businesses accounted for 5% of the award opportunity. 
The table below illustrates the 2018 level of achievement for these non-financial objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Objective    2018     Performance      
 Operational goals    7%     
 Strategic goals    5% 
 Safety and environmental compliance    2% 
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the committee determined that these NEOs achieved a total of 14% out of a possible 20% of the non-financial objectives. 
NEOs with Divisional Responsibilities.    For each of Messrs. Dawson and Varilek, 25% of the cash incentive was based on corporate results and 75% on division results. Of the 75% component related to division objectives, 25% (or 18.75% of the total cash incentive) related to division non-financial objectives and the remaining 75% (or 56.25% of the total cash incentive) was based on Adjusted Division EBITDA and Adjusted Division Cash Flow. 
Financial Targets.    For Mr. Dawson, who had Epoxy division responsibility for 2018, his division financial targets and achievement against those targets are set forth in the following chart:

2019 Short Term Incentive Program.    For 2019, the committee has adopted a short term incentive program (STIP) that is very similar to the 2018 annual cash incentive award program. For 2019, 80% of the awards under the STIP for all officers (including the NEOs) will be based on financial targets and 20% on non-financial objectives, regardless of whether the officer has corporate-wide or divisional responsibilities. No payments will be made under the STIP for financial metrics if performance falls below 75% of the established target. If performance exceeds the financial target, the portion of the STIP payment based on financial performance will increase, but never beyond 200% of an individual's cash incentive target. 
The following table illustrates the portion of each NEO's cash incentive based on corporate and division financial targets and corporate and division non-financial objectives under the STIP:

[END TABLE]
All long-term incentive (equity) compensation plan participants, including NEOs, are assigned target award levels consistent with the competitive data analysis described above under the heading "Benchmarking." 
The target equity award levels for 2018 were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
             NEO    Target Award    
 John E. Fischer    $ 4,611,168   
 Todd A. Slater    $ 1,175,000

 John L. McIntosh    $ 1,000,000   
 James A. Varilek    $ 1,000,000   
[END TABLE]
These target awards are allocated equally between stock options and performance shares. The process the committee follows to determine the level of the actual stock option awards and the formula for actual performance share payouts is described below. 
Performance Shares.    Half the value of each participant's 2018 long-term incentive target award value was delivered in performance shares. The target number of performance shares awarded to each NEO was formulated by dividing half the participant's target award value by the fair market value of our common stock (the average of the high and low per share sales price of our common stock on the NYSE on the calculation date). The total number of performance shares that vest and will be paid to each NEO from awards made in 2018 will vary between 0 and 200% of his target number.  For 2018 awards, half of the target number of performance shares will be earned based on our relative shareholder return (TSR) over the three-year period ending December 31, 2020. The comparison of our TSR over that period will be made relative to the community of companies in the S&P 1000 Material Index, plus two selected direct competitors–Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Westlake Chemical Corporation. We refer to this group of companies as the Performance Share Comparison Group. The remaining half of the target number of performance shares will be earned based on our actual net income compared to the net income goal set by the committee for the same three-year period. The following charts identify the relationship between the target number of Performance Shares earned and performance generated:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
More than 100% but less than 140% of the Net Income Goal    100% of the target number of Net Income Performance Shares plus  a proportionate number of target Net Income Performance Shares determined using linear interpolation 
More than 60% but less than 100% of the Net Income Goal    50% of the target number of Net Income Performance Shares plus a  proportionate number of target Net Income Performance Shares determined using linear interpolation 
 Less than 60% of the Net Income Goal   0 
[END TABLE]
The payout relationships described in the preceding chart became effective with performance awards granted in 2017. These relationships represented a change from the performance-payout schedule that was in effect for Performance Shares granted in 2016 when the number of performance shares earned varied between 25% and 150% of the NEO's target number. The earned performance shares varied depending on our average annual return on capital for the relevant three-year period in relation to the average annual return on capital generated for that period by the Performance Share Comparison Group, as shown in the following chart: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Olin average annual return on capital   for three-year period compared to   Performance Share Comparison   Group:      Percentage of target number of             performance shares that vest:

 Quintile 4    125% 
 Quintile 3    100% 
 Quintile 2      50% 
 Quintile 1      25% 
[END TABLE]
Stock Options.    The remaining half of each participant's long-term incentive (equity) target award value is delivered in stock options. Stock options are granted annually from a committee-approved pool of option shares. Specifically, the pool of stock options available for issuance each year equals half the value of the overall long-term incentive award value, divided by the Black-Scholes value of options for our common stock (not to be lower than 20% of the then-current market price of our common stock).  We typically approve option awards at the first committee meeting each year. In 2018, the first committee meeting was January 25, 2018. At that meeting, the committee approved the granting of options effective on February 16, 2018, with an exercise price of $32.94 per share, the average of the high and low per share sales price of our common stock on the NYSE on February 16, 2018. When the first scheduled meeting occurs before or near the time we release our year-end earnings report, the committee has granted stock options: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· with a grant effective date approximately 10 days after the release of year-end earnings; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· with an exercise price equal to fair market value on the grant effective date.  
[END TABLE]
This practice ensures that the exercise price for stock options reflects all current information. Although we have no formal policy on granting options at a time when inside information may exist, the committee follows the procedure we describe above when necessary to ensure that option exercise prices reflect full disclosure of earnings information. We have not engaged in "back dating" of options, as our policies do not allow back dating. In addition, our equity plans do not permit option grants with an exercise price below the fair market value of our stock on the effective date of the option grant. 
The CEO also has authority to grant a very limited number of options at other times during the year (no more than 50,000 total shares or 5,000 shares per employee) but may not grant options to anyone who is an officer within the definition of the rules under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, or "back date" any options. Consistent with the terms of our equity plans, options granted by the CEO may not have an exercise price below the fair market value of our stock on the effective date of the option grant. 
Clawback Policy 
Each of our NEOs is subject to a clawback policy that applies to all of our executive officers. Amounts that we recover are not included in calculating that executive's benefits under our Supplemental CEOP, and our recovery of amounts under the policy does not constitute an event that triggers benefits under our severance agreements. In addition to the clawback policy, our equity plans provide that if a participant renders service to one of our competitors, or discloses confidential information without our consent, or violates other terms of the plan, the committee may terminate any unvested, unpaid or deferred awards held by the participant, or may require the participant to forfeit benefits received under the plan within the six months before the participant's action. 
Other Compensation 
We also offer a small number of other personal benefits to groups of employees, including our NEOs. We extend some benefits, such as a portion of health insurance premiums and certain retirement benefits, to all eligible employees. We tie the size and construction of these benefits to competitive practices in the market, a decision the committee believes enables us to attract and retain executives with the talents and skill sets we require. We provide other compensatory items, such as certain life insurance benefits and the retirement and change in control benefits described below, to our NEOs and other senior managers. 
Retirement Benefits.    We offer retirement benefits as part of the package to recruit and retain employees. Our retirement benefits also reflect an individual's contributions over his or her career with Olin, as those benefits are based on compensation. In general, we establish retirement benefits based on comparable programs offered by competitors. The committee believes that retirement plans like ours are commonly provided to executives at other companies, and offering these benefits helps us remain competitive for qualified senior-level executive talent. We periodically re-evaluate and update those plans to respond to changes in the market.  The following chart summarizes the benefits under our active retirement plans for salaried employees: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Plan Title     Participants/Purpose     Benefits 
[END TABLE]
The Supplemental CEOP is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan for most of the NEOs and a select group of other senior management employees. The committee believes that historically it was common for companies to offer these kinds of nonqualified retirement supplements to executives and offering these benefits has allowed us to remain competitive in the market for qualified senior-level executive talent. Because this plan is unfunded, participants receive benefits only if we have the financial resources to make the payments when due. 
Risk Assessment.    Management and the committee regularly evaluate the risks involved with our compensation programs. In January 2019, we conducted a comprehensive risk assessment after compiling an inventory of incentive plans and programs, and conducting an analysis of the risk associated with each. The assessment considered factors such as the plan metrics, number of plan participants, maximum payments, and risk mitigation factors. Exequity reviewed the risk assessment and advised the committee of its comfort with the level of risk inherent in Olin's compensation programs. Based on the committee's review of the risk assessment and Exequity's input, the committee concluded that it did not believe any of our compensation programs or policies create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on Olin. Based on this conclusion, we implemented no material changes to our compensation policies or practices after our risk assessment.  Change in Control Arrangements.    We historically provided change in control agreements to our senior management to ensure that our executives worked to secure the best outcome for shareholders in the event of a possible change in control, even if it meant that they lost their jobs as a result. In accordance with notice given on August 23, 2016, the agreements related to severance and change in control benefits with our NEOs and other senior executives terminated on January 26, 2019. We replaced those agreements with change in control and severance plans. Those plans, and the terminated agreements with our NEOs, are described in more detail under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" and "Executive Severance and Executive Change in Control Arrangements." 
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
All elements of compensation, including salaries, generate charges to earnings under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We generally do not adjust compensation based on accounting factors. 
The committee considers the deductibility of long-term and annual incentive awards in structuring our executive compensation program, to the extent practical. To hire and retain highly skilled executives and remain competitive, the committee also looks at other factors. 
Code Section 409A implemented tax rules applicable to nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements, and Olin has taken steps to comply with such rules to the extent applicable. 
As previously noted, Olin's clawback policies allow recovery of all or a portion of payments under the annual cash incentive program and performance share awards from executives who participate in the annual cash incentive or the Management Incentive Compensation Program. To recover compensation, our board or the committee must determine that the executive was grossly negligent or engaged in intentional misconduct that was a "significant contributing factor" to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  a restatement of our financial statements, or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (ii)  a significant increase in the value of that executive's incentive awards.  
[END TABLE]
Amounts recovered are not included in calculating that executive's benefits under our Supplemental CEOP, and do not trigger benefits under our severance agreements. In addition, our equity plans provide that if a participant renders service to a competitor, or discloses confidential information without our consent, or violates other terms of the plan, the committee may terminate any unvested, unpaid or deferred awards held by the participant, or may require the participant to forfeit benefits received under the plan within the six months before the participant's action. 
Our equity plans and severance arrangements with NEOs do not provide any "gross-up" for the amount of excise tax, if any, due on "excess parachute payments" as defined under Code Section 280G. These benefits are described in more detail under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Our stock ownership guidelines require executive officers and certain other senior managers to maintain specified ownership levels of our stock within five years after the guideline applies. Stringent stock ownership requirements mitigate any risk that options may cause management to focus on short-term stock price movement.  Our committee monitors compliance with the stock ownership guidelines annually. To determine "stock ownership" under the guidelines, we include, in addition to shares the individual owns outright, restricted stock and restricted stock units, shares and phantom shares held in the executive's CEOP and Supplemental CEOP accounts, and shares subject to vested stock options with an exercise price below the current market price. No unvested performance share awards are included in the determination of stock ownership.

(a)  All of the accrued benefits under these plans were included in the required payments made in 2015 to participants in connection with our October 2015  acquisition of the U.S. chlor alkali and vinyl, global chlorinated organics and global epoxy business (the Acquisition) of Dow (Required NQ Plan Payments).  
(b)  Mr. Slater also received his accrued benefits in connection with the Acquisition, but because he is not yet of retirement-eligible age, he is  entitled to the value of the early retirement allowance (offset by the value of the accrued benefit) at retirement ages below age 65. The value of his remaining early retirement allowance is $24,887.  
[END TABLE]
Changes in the present value of pension benefits are determined using the assumptions we use for financial reporting purposes and represent changes in assumptions and the fact that each NEO is one year older, rather than any change in the NEO's accrued pension benefit. For December 31, 2016, the single effective rate (previously described as the 'discount rate') was 4.1% for the Qualified Plan and 3.6% for the Supplemental and Senior Plans. For December 31, 2017, the single effective rate (previously described as the 'discount rate') was 3.6% for the Qualified Plan and 3.3% for the Supplemental and Senior Plans. For December 31, 2018, the single effective rate (previously described as the 'discount rate') was 4.2% for the Qualified Plan and 3.9% for the Supplemental and Senior Plans. For 2016, 2017, and 2018 we used the RP2014 Blue Collar Mortality Tables for Annuitants and Employees, with the Social Security Administration—2014 Intermediate Cost Projections Mortality Improvement Scale (projection starting in 2007). Please see the note entitled "Pension Plans and Retirement Benefits" in the notes to our audited financial statements included in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of these assumptions. The values shown in the table are due to the change of assumptions and the fact that each executive is one year older, as well as the Required NQ Plan Payments. It is not driven by any change in the retirement benefit itself, except for Messrs. Dawson and Varilek. The retirement benefits for Messrs. Dawson and Varilek reflect account balances based on a "pension equity plan" formula acquired from the Dow Employees' Pension Plan (DEPP), which are then credited with interest until their assumed retirement date. As required by recent federal regulations, effective May 31, 2016, the rate of this credited interest changed from 8% to 6% for the DEPP equity account balances. 
To determine the change in the present value of the pension benefits under these plans, for Mr. Slater, we used age 62, the first age at which unreduced pension benefits are payable under the Qualified Plan, the Supplemental Plan and the Senior Plan. For Messrs. Fischer and McIntosh, who are eligible for unreduced pension benefits under the Qualified Plan, we used actual age at December 31, 2018. For Messrs. Dawson and Varilek, we used age 65, which is the retirement age at which they can receive their most valuable benefit due to the specific interest crediting feature of their DEPP account balances. 
Generally,the Senior Plan provides a 50% benefit to the executive's surviving spouse (which we refer to as a "joint and survivorship benefit") without an actuarial reduction in payments during the executive's lifetime. An executive also can elect to have payments under the Qualified Plan and the Supplemental Plan extend for the remainder of his or her spouse's lifetime, but such an election results in an actuarial reduction to benefits paid under those plans. Benefits paid from the Senior Plan are increased by the amount of the actuarial reduction under the Qualified Plan and the Supplemental Plan for a 50% joint and survivorship benefit. However, the value of this benefit was included in the Required NQ Plan Payments. In accordance with the SEC regulations, the pension benefits in the Summary Compensation Table reflect benefits payable in the form of a single life annuity payable only during the life of the executive, and do not reflect any joint and survivorship benefit.

(a)  Messrs. Dawson and Varilek receive life insurance in an amount equal to their base salary. The other NEOs participate in the key executive life  insurance program, consisting of three types of benefits: active employee life insurance, retiree life insurance and survivor income benefits.

     scheduled committee meeting date in a calendar year (in 2018, January 25, 2018). In recent years, committee meetings have been held before (or shortly after) the time we issued our year-end earnings press release, and so the option awards became effective on a later date (February 16, 2018 for 2018 grants), approximately 10 days after our earnings release.

Stock Options 
Annually, we grant options to purchase shares of our common stock to a group of key employees, including our executive officers. We describe our stock option program in more detail under the heading "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS—Long-Term Incentive (Equity) Compensation—Stock Options." All options granted in 2018 were nonqualified options vesting in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. The options generally may be exercised until 10 years after the grant date (but the exercise period may end earlier based on the termination of the participant's employment). 
The committee grants options with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low prices on the grant effective date. All of our equity plans specifically prohibit repricing, and, except for certain anti-dilution adjustments, other adjustments to the exercise price. We discuss the timing of our option grants under the heading "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS—Long-Term Incentive (Equity) Compensation—Stock Options." Our plans and our policies do not permit any "back dating" of options. 
Performance Shares 
Each NEO and certain other key employees received a target number of performance shares in early 2018, which vest at the end of 2020. The total number of performance shares that vest may vary between 0 and 200% of the target number, with half of the performance shares based on TSR over a three-year period compared to the TSR of the companies in the Performance Share Comparison Group and the remaining half based on our net income performance compared to the net income goal set by the committee for the same three-year period. The chart included in the discussion of performance share awards above sets forth this relationship in more detail. Vested performance shares are paid approximately half in cash and half in stock. No dividends or dividend equivalents are paid on unvested performance shares.  Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End

(2)  The shares listed in column (d) above represent (i) performance shares paid in the summer of 2018 (vested based on our performance for the  three years ended December 31, 2017), under a performance award made in early 2015 to Messrs. Fischer, Slater and McIntosh, and (ii) for Mr. McIntosh, shares of performance-based restricted stock granted in 2015 and vested in 2018  based on achievement of at least $300 million in synergies in the businesses acquired in the Acquisition. The number of shares includes shares delivered in payment of income tax withholding amounts. Mr. McIntosh was awarded up to 75,000  Performance Based Restricted Stock Units ("Shares") in an award made in October 2015, which provided for vesting of a specified number of Shares based on the realization by Olin of synergies in connection with the business acquired by Olin  from The Dow Chemical Company, now known as DowDuPont Inc. In October 2018, the Committee certified the achievement of more than $300 million in synergies and authorized and approved the payment by Olin of 75,000 shares of Olin Common Stock  (less any such stock retained for taxes pursuant to the Award) to Mr. McIntosh.

(3)  Performance shares are paid approximately half in cash and half in stock. The cash portion of the performance shares payment was based on the fair  market value of the shares as of December 31, 2017 ($35.62), and dollar amounts listed in column (e) above for the stock portion of the payment of performance shares are based on the average of the high and low sales prices for our common  stock as of August 21, 2018, the date the shares were issued ($30.22). Of the total performance shares included in column (d) above, 25% vested automatically (25% of the target performance share award). The remaining performance shares  vested based on our average annual return on capital for the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, compared to that of the Performance Share Comparison Group. We describe our performance share program in more detail in our  "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS—What We Pay and Why: Elements of Compensation" and in the text following the table entitled "Grants of Plan-Based Awards."

(1)  The amounts in the DEPP for Messrs. Dawson and Varilek were rolled into the Qualified Plan at the time of the Acquisition and their benefit accruals  were frozen at that time. For the other NEOs, benefit accruals were frozen under all three plans effective December 31, 2007. Employment after that date continues to count toward meeting service and age requirements for vesting and early  retirement. Participation in the Qualified Plan generally began when the executive was hired. All of the participating NEOs have met the requirements for vesting. Messrs. Fischer and McIntosh have met the requirements for full retirement.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Amounts in this column assume that benefits are paid in the form of an annuity during the executive's lifetime. As discussed in more detail  below, a participant may elect instead to receive benefits over the life of the executive and his or her spouse. For the legacy DEPP benefits, transferred from Dow, the normal form of married participants is 50% joint & survivorship  benefit.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  As described in more detail below, all amounts under the Supplemental Plan and Senior Plan were paid out to the NEOs in connection with the  Acquisition. At the time of the Acquisition, Mr. Slater had not reached retirement age and so has a residual benefit under these plans. Information regarding the present value of Mr. Slater's residual benefits under these two plans as  of December 31, 2018 is set forth below.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Plan Name    Number of Years Credited Service (#)     Present Value of Accumulated Benefit ($)     Payments During Last Fiscal Year ($)

 Senior Plan        2.58       $  0       $ 0  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    These amounts were calculated using the assumptions set forth in the table above for the Qualified Plan. In addition, the Supplemental Plan and  Senior Plan use a 3.9% single effective rate (in lieu of a discount rate) and the RP2014 Blue Collar Mortality Tables for Annuitants and Employees with the Social Security Administration—2014 Intermediate Cost Projections Mortality Improvement  Scale (projection starting in 2007). Mr. Slater began participating in the Senior Plan when he became a Section 16(b) reporting officer and was selected by the committee and began participating in the Supplemental Plan when  Mr. Slater's compensation that was includible when determining benefits under qualified plans first exceeded the limit imposed by the Code.  
[END TABLE]
The executive may elect payment of benefits under any of the available payment forms under these plans, including payments for the executive's life (which we sometimes refer to as a "single life annuity") or payments continuing after the executive's death for the life of his or her spouse (which we refer to as a "joint and survivorship benefit"). Under the Qualified Plan and the Supplemental Plan,   benefit payments are reduced from the single life annuity based on actuarial calculations if the executive elects a different payment form. The Senior Plan generally provides a 50% joint and survivorship benefit without any actuarial reduction, and also provides the executive with an additional amount equal to the amount of the actuarial reduction of benefits payable from the Qualified Plan and the Supplemental Plan for a 50% joint and survivorship benefit election. 
The following chart shows the present value of accrued benefits for each of the NEOs who participate in these plans, assuming (i) the executive elected the 50% joint and survivorship benefit and (ii) for Mr. Slater, that he retired at age 62 (the first age at which unreduced pension benefits are payable under the plans), (iii) for Messrs. Fischer and McIntosh that they retired on December 31, 2018, as they are currently eligible for unreduced benefits, and (iv) for Messrs. Dawson and Varilek that they retired at age 65 (the retirement age at which they can receive their most valuable benefit due to the interest crediting feature of their DEPP account balances).

Freeze of Qualified Plan, Supplemental Plan and Senior Plan 
As part of our ongoing evaluation of benefit plans, in 2005, we amended the Qualified Plan to close participation, so that salaried employees hired on or after January 1, 2005, are not eligible for the Qualified Plan. Benefits accrued by most salaried participants in the Qualified Plan, Supplemental Plan and Senior Plan were "frozen" effective December 31, 2007, and benefits for former Dow employees were assumed by the Qualified Plan and frozen on October 5, 2015, but continue to accrue interest. Participants accrued benefits until December 31, 2007, based on applicable years of service and eligible compensation through that date. Service after December 31, 2007, will count toward meeting the eligibility requirements for commencing a pension benefit (including vesting and early retirement) under these plans, but not toward the calculation of the pension benefit amount. Compensation earned after 2007 will similarly not count toward the determination of the pension benefit amounts under these plans. 
As described above, all of the previously accrued benefits under these Olin plans were required to be paid as part of the Required NQ Plan Payments in connection with the Acquisition. Mr. Slater, who was not yet retirement-eligible at the time of the Acquisition, may become eligible upon early retirement for an early-retirement benefit (offset by the value of the accrued benefit paid as part of the Required NQ Plan Payments). In addition, in connection with the Acquisition, the Qualified Plan is now responsible for certain Dow-related frozen benefits described below for which the Qualified Plan received certain assets from the appropriate Dow pension plans. We describe the terms of our retirement plans in more detail in the narrative discussion below. 
Qualified Plan 
As part of our benefits program, we offered defined benefit retirement benefits to salaried employees hired before January 1, 2005, through our Qualified Plan. Benefits under the Qualified Plan are calculated based on the average cash compensation (salary and annual incentive) for the highest three years out of the last 10 years the individual was employed by Olin, through December 31, 2007. The law requires that in determining eligible compensation, the Qualified Plan ignore compensation in   excess of a legally-imposed cap (which for 2007, the last year of benefit accruals, was $225,000). An employee's benefit is generally 1.5% of his or her average compensation during the relevant period multiplied by the number of years of service, less a percentage of his or her primary Social Security benefit based on years of service (not to exceed 50% of such Social Security benefit). Participants who are at least age 55 with at least 10 years of service when they leave Olin may elect to receive a benefit immediately that is reduced by 4% for each year the participant is younger than age 62 at the time benefit payments begin. Participants who leave Olin before age 55 (with 10 or more years of service) may elect to receive an actuarially reduced benefit with payments beginning at age 55 or later. Participants who leave Olin before age 65 with at least five years of service (but less than 10 years of service) receive a vested retirement benefit beginning the month after their 65th birthday. Benefits from the Qualified Plan generally are paid as an annuity with the form of payment (e.g. joint and survivorship benefit, guaranteed period, etc.) selected by the participant, subject to any applicable actuarial reductions. 
In conjunction with the Acquisition, the Qualified Plan assumed responsibility for certain Dow-related frozen benefits. Specifically, nearly all frozen benefits transferred to the Qualified Plan are associated with two benefit formulae—Pension Equity and Cash Balance—eligibility for which is typically determined by the individual participant's hire date at Dow. The Pension Equity provides a frozen account balance that grows with interest until retirement (which can commence upon separation from Olin), at which time it is converted into a monthly pension benefit. The Cash Balance also provides a frozen account balance that grows with interest (at a different rate) until separation from Olin, at which point the participant can elect an immediate annuity, a deferred annuity or a lump sum. Messrs. Dawson and Varilek are participants of the Pension Equity arrangement. 
In lieu of benefits that had been provided under the Qualified Plan, at the time participation was frozen, the CEOP was amended to add a Defined Contribution Retirement Account to help ensure that our benefits program would remain competitive. Depending on the participant's age, we generally contribute 5% or 7.5% of eligible compensation to that Defined Contribution Retirement Account. 
Supplemental Plan 
The Supplemental Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan for management employees at specified compensation levels. The Code imposes limits on pension benefits payable from the Qualified Plan. Our Supplemental Plan restores these benefits to affected employees and provides benefits on certain compensation that has been excluded from eligible compensation under the Qualified Plan. The formula used to calculate pension benefits under the Supplemental Plan is the same as under the Qualified Plan, without the Code limitations on benefits and eligible compensation, reduced for the amount payable under the Qualified Plan. Early retirement benefits are payable at the later of termination or age 55 if a participant has at least 10 years of service. Such early retirement benefits use the same reduction factors as the Qualified Plan. 
As noted above, previously accrued benefits in the Supplemental Plan were required to be paid to participants as part of the Required NQ Plan Payments in connection with the Acquisition. 
Senior Plan 
The Senior Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan for select management employees. An employee who was a Section 16(b) reporting officer, and was selected by the committee prior to the date of the freeze, participates in the Senior Plan. Under the Senior Plan, pension benefits are based on average eligible compensation for the three highest years out of the last 10 years that he or she is employed by Olin through December 31, 2007. Compensation is not subject   to the Code and other limitations that apply under the Qualified Plan. Benefits generally equal 3% of the executive's average compensation multiplied by the number of years of participation in the Senior Plan, plus 1.5% of the executive's average compensation for years of service in the Qualified Plan and Supplemental Plan less years of service in the Senior Plan, reduced by the pension benefits accrued under the Qualified Plan and the Supplemental Plan. Benefits are further reduced by 50% of the employee's primary Social Security benefit. 
Early retirement benefits are payable on an immediate basis to a participant whose employment terminates at age 55 or later, regardless of years of service, but are reduced by 4% per year for each year they begin before age 62. The maximum benefit payable from the Senior Plan is 50% of the employee's average compensation reduced by amounts payable from the Qualified and Supplemental Plans, 50% of the employee's primary Social Security benefit, and certain other adjustments set forth in the plan documents, if applicable. The Senior Plan provides a joint and survivorship benefit to an executive's surviving spouse generally equal to 50% of the executive's benefits from the Senior Plan. In addition, the Senior Plan pension benefits are increased by the amount of the actuarial reduction to benefits under the Qualified and Supplemental Plans if the executive elects the 50% joint and survivorship option under those plans. 
The executive may elect any of the forms of payment available under the Senior Plan and Supplemental Plan, including a lump sum payment or the annuity form of payment. 
If a participant in the Senior Plan and Supplemental Plan is a specified employee as defined in Code Section 409A, benefits payable upon termination of employment may not be paid in the first six months after retirement, but the first six months of benefits will be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable thereafter. 
As noted above, previously accrued benefits in the Senior Plan were required to be paid to participants as part of the Required NQ Plan Payments in connection with the Acquisition. 
Health Insurance and Death Benefits 
In general, salaried employees who retire at age 55 or later with at least 10 years of service may elect to continue to be covered under our health plan until age 65 by paying at least the same premium as active salaried employees. When the average per capita cost for our health plan exceeds $10,000, as it did in 2015 and 2016, the retiree also must pay the amount by which our average per capita cost for the health plan exceeds $10,000. On the first day of the month in which they become 65, salaried retirees who retired after age 55 with 10 or more years of service are eligible for a Medicare supplemental health care plan. We contribute $20 per covered person per month toward the cost of that plan, but make no contributions if a retiree chooses to participate in another plan. Olin made the decision to discontinue providing retiree health insurance benefits for salaried employees hired after November 23, 2009, so Messrs. Dawson and Varilek are not eligible for this benefit. 
In general, salaried employees who retire from Olin under the Qualified Plan at age 55 or later with at least 10 years of service are eligible for a $5,000 death benefit from the Qualified Plan. In addition, full-time employees with job responsibilities at a specified level (based on Hay Points) may retain a percentage of their life insurance coverage when they retire, based on age at retirement, with Olin paying the premiums.

(2)  Amounts in this column are included in the amounts listed in column (i) of the Summary Compensation Table and represent company matching  contributions and, where applicable, company contributions to the participants' Supplemental CEOP Defined Contribution Retirement Accounts.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to our CEOP, discussed under the heading "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS—What We Pay and Why: Elements of Compensation—Retirement Benefits," our Supplemental CEOP provides deferral and company matching opportunities to employees eligible to participate in the CEOP whose contributions to the CEOP are limited under the Code because their base pay exceeds the Code's compensation limit ($275,000 for 2018). These employees can make pre-tax contributions to the Supplemental CEOP after their eligible compensation reaches the Code limit. For these purposes, eligible compensation generally includes base compensation but excludes incentive compensation. Employees who contribute to the Supplemental CEOP receive matching contribution credits from Olin at the same level Olin matches CEOP contributions. In addition, in connection with the pension plan freeze, Olin generally provides the same retirement contribution credits to the Supplemental CEOP as under the CEOP (5% or 7.5%, depending on the employee's age) on the amount of the excess eligible compensation. For these purposes, eligible compensation generally includes base compensation and short-term incentive compensation but excludes long-term incentive compensation. 
Employees elect to have their contributions to the Supplemental CEOP invested in phantom shares of Olin common stock or phantom units in an interest bearing fund. Dividends are credited to the phantom stock account based on the dividend rate paid on shares of our common stock. Interest is credited to the phantom interest bearing fund at a rate determined quarterly equal to (i) the Federal Reserve A1/P1 Composite rate for 90-day commercial paper at the end of the last quarter plus 10 basis points, or (ii) such other rate as our board or committee (or any delegate thereof) selects in advance from time to time. 
Distributions are paid in cash, in a lump sum or in annual installments for up to 15 years after retirement, at the employee's election. Our phantom shares of common stock are valued at the average daily closing prices of our common stock on the NYSE for the month before the distribution. Distributions from the interest bearing fund equal the dollar value of the participant's account (principal and interest). If a participant in the Supplemental CEOP is a specified employee as defined in Code Section 409A, benefit payments payable upon termination of employment generally may not be paid in the first six months after retirement.  Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
Agreements with our NEOs provide compensation in the event of a termination of employment or a change in control of Olin. The following tables show estimated compensation payable to each NEO who was employed on December 31, 2018, upon various triggering events (assuming the event occurred on December 31, 2018). Actual amounts can only be determined upon the triggering event. The table below reflects the terms of agreements with the NEOs which were in effect at the end of 2018, but terminated on January 26, 2019, and were replaced with new plans on January 27, 2019. The terms of the terminated agreements and the new plans are described below under "Executive Severance and Executive Change in Control Arrangements."

(1)  Amounts in the tables assume an annual base salary at the level in effect on December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Messrs. Fischer and McIntosh are eligible for normal retirement (age 62), so amounts in both the "Quit/Early Retirement" and in the  "Normal Retirement" columns represent amounts they would receive upon full retirement. Mr. Slater has met the vesting requirements, but is not yet early retirement age, so the amounts reported for him under the "Benefits and  Perquisites" section represent the present value of the benefits, assuming the benefits begin at age 65, except for 'Termination without Cause' and 'Change in Control', which assume benefits begin at age 55 (because he is  within 3 years of early retirement age). Messrs. Dawson and Varilek are each eligible to receive benefits based on his account balance at termination, so all amounts reflect immediate commencement of benefits.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  As of December 31, 2018, under agreements then in effect, upon termination without cause each NEO is eligible to receive a contribution to the  Supplemental CEOP Defined Contribution Retirement Account based on the amount of severance received. An executive whose employment terminates in connection with the sale of a business unit generally receives the benefits in this column, except that  the executive's stock options may be exercised for two years beyond the date of termination (rather than one year), unless the employee is eligible for retirement in which case the executive's stock options would be exercisable through the  term of the option.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  Olin generally may terminate an executive for "cause" if the executive (i) willfully fails to perform his or her duties;  (ii) engages in gross misconduct that significantly injures Olin financially; (iii) commits a felony or fraud in the course of his or her employment; or (iv) willfully breaches Olin's Code of Conduct.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  Amounts for Messrs. Fischer, Slater, Dawson and Varilek represent the amount they would receive on the "best net  after-tax" payment approach contemplated by their change in control agreements, that reduces payments and benefits to the executive if the reduction would result in the executive receiving higher payments  and benefits on a net after-tax basis. Without the reduction, the amounts for Messrs. Fischer, Slater, Dawson and Varilek would have increased by $1,800,435, $686,003, $290,699 and $238,116, respectively. A  portion of the amounts for Messrs. Fischer, Slater, Dawson and Varilek constitute "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code subject to a 20% excise tax payable by the officer. Benefits listed for the Senior Plan and  Supplemental Plan (collectively, the "defined benefit plans") and the Supplemental CEOP would be payable immediately upon a change in control (as defined under these plans). Because the NEOs are specified employees as defined in Code  Section 409A, however, benefits may not be paid in the first six months after retirement, but will be paid in a lump sum as soon as practicable thereafter. The benefits reported represent the present value of the benefits under the defined  benefit plans on December 31, 2018, and the market value of the phantom investments in the Supplemental CEOP account, plus a contribution to the Defined Contribution Retirement Account based on the amount of severance received. Footnote 8  describes the treatment of equity awards upon a change in control.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(6)  For the NEOs other than Messrs. Slater, Dawson and Varilek, severance payments for a termination without cause equal base salary plus a percentage  (calculated as the executive's target bonus for the prior fiscal year divided by the executive's salary in effect at termination) of base salary. Under our standard severance policy, they would have received severance upon termination  without cause in the respective amounts set forth above, based on years of service and base pay at the time of termination. Under the agreements, in the event of a change in control, (a) Messrs. Fischer and McIntosh would have received a pro-rated portion of the severance payments, based on the remaining number of days until the attainment of the age of 66, divided by 1,095 (three years), and (b) Messrs. Slater, Varilek and Dawson would have  received severance payments equal to two times the executive's base salary plus the higher of his target incentive award under the annual cash incentive program or his average annual cash incentive payment during the past three years. The  agreements related to change in control and severance in effect at year end are described under the heading "Executive Severance and Executive Change in Control Arrangements." In the event of retirement or termination without cause, all  NEOs, like all other employees also receive a prorated bonus (based on the portion of the year that the NEO was employed), paid at the time other bonuses are determined and paid.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(7)  We have assumed payouts at the level of 50% of the target unvested performance shares and performance shares vested at December 31, 2018, but  not yet paid. Under the performance share program, an executive whose employment terminates as the result of disability or retirement receives a pro rata share of unvested performance share awards (based on actual Olin performance for the full  performance period and the number of months worked in the performance cycle) payable in cash at the time it would otherwise be payable. In the event of an executive's death before performance shares have vested, his estate receives a pro rata  share of his target award in cash. An executive whose employment terminates for cause or without our consent does not receive any unvested performance awards. All unvested performance shares vest on a change in control and are paid in cash at the  target level. The committee determines the amount, if any, of unvested performance awards to be paid and the form of payment (cash or stock or a combination) for an executive whose employment terminates for any other reason. Upon the  executive's death, all unvested options vest automatically and his or her estate or heirs could exercise those options within the term of the option.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(8)  Amounts in this line represent a cash payout of all restricted stock, stock options and performance shares that were unvested at December 31,  2018. Under equity plans and severance agreements (a) all performance share awards would  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     have vested at target level and been paid upon a change in control (as defined for these awards), and (b) all restricted stock awards and options would have remained outstanding, and would  accelerate and vest upon a change in control only if the acquirer does not assume or replace those equity awards or there is a termination of employment without cause or a constructive termination within three years after the change in control.  Constructive termination occurs when the executive terminates his or her employment (after appropriate notice and an opportunity to cure) because (i) Olin requires the executive to relocate by more than fifty miles; (ii) Olin reduces or  fails to increase the executive's base salary on a basis consistent with the salary system for executive officers in place before the change in control; (iii) Olin fails to maintain executive's incentive compensation plans or health,  welfare and retirement plans on substantially the terms in effect prior to the change in control; or (iv) the executive is assigned duties inconsistent with the executive's position prior to the change in control, or Olin takes actions  that result in a diminution of the executive's responsibilities or a substantial reduction in resources to carry out his duties.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(9)  Unused vacation for the current year is paid to all salaried employees and is therefore not included in this table. Medical benefits are provided to  all salaried employees hired prior to November 23, 2009, who are eligible for early retirement. Messrs. Fischer and McIntosh are currently eligible for full retirement, so no amount is reported for medical benefits for either of them. Under our  severance policy, Messrs. Slater, Dawson and Varilek would be eligible for healthcare coverage while receiving severance payments in the event of a without cause termination. In the event of a change in control, Messrs. Slater, Dawson and Varilek  would be eligible for healthcare coverage for 24 months at an estimated cost of $33,000.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(10)  An executive may elect payment of benefits in any of the available payment forms under the defined benefit plans. Under the Supplemental Plan  (applicable only to Mr. Slater) and the Qualified Plan, benefit payments are reduced on an actuarial basis, if the executive elects a form of payment other than a lifetime annuity. The Senior Plan (applicable only to Mr. Slater) provides a  50% joint and survivorship benefit without an actuarial reduction. In addition, pension benefits paid from the Senior Plan are increased by the amount of the actuarial reduction for a 50% joint and survivorship benefit under the Qualified Plan and  the Supplemental Plan. The value of the 50% joint and survivorship benefit is reflected in the lump sum pension benefits in the table above with respect to the Senior Plan. The Qualified Plan and Supplemental Plan benefits above assume payment in  the form of a joint and survivorship benefit. The executive may also elect to receive benefits from the Senior Plan and the Supplemental Plan in the form of a lump sum. Any payment payable upon termination of employment is paid six months after  termination of employment to comply with Code limitations. The value of these benefits is determined using a discount rate that is equal to the rate for a zero coupon Treasury strip, with a maturity that approximates the executive's life  expectancy, determined approximately at the time the lump sum is due to be paid and the RP2014 Blue Collar Mortality Tables for Annuitants and Employees with the Social Security Administration—2014 Intermediate Cost Projections Mortality  Improvement Scale (projected from 2007). Except with respect to a change in control, the benefits reported for the Senior Plan and Supplemental Plan are based on these assumptions and also include six months of payments in recognition of the  deferral of the commencement of benefits required by Code Section 409A.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      In the event of a change in control (as defined under the Senior Plan and the Supplemental Plan), each executive participating in the relevant plan  receives a cash payment in an amount equal to the cost to purchase an annuity that pays benefits to the executive in an amount such that the annuity payments (together with the monthly payment to the executive from the Qualified Plan) provide the  executive with the monthly after-tax benefit he or she would have received under the plans. The amounts in the table represent this lump sum cash payment.  
[END TABLE]

      The benefit amounts reported in each of the columns above assume a 50% joint and survivorship benefit and use the discount rate applicable for the  situation described and the RP2014 Blue Collar Mortality Tables for Annuitants and Employees with the Social Security Administration—2014 Intermediate Cost Projections Mortality Improvement Scale (projected from 2007). If the participating  executive instead elects annual payments for his or her lifetime, he or she would receive an annual amount from each of the defined benefit pension plans as follows:

[END TABLE]
Payments Upon Death or Disability 
Upon the death of a former executive, unless the executive elects to receive the cash value of his or her life insurance at retirement, his or her estate receives life insurance benefits provided the former executive was at least age 55 when employment terminated. Messrs. Dawson and Varilek do not participate in this program, but the other NEOs have attained the age of 55, except Mr. Slater. The amount of life insurance is based on the executive's age and base salary at the time of termination of employment. Set forth below are the cash value amounts of this life insurance coverage for each of the NEOs as of December 31, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 NEO                                      Amount    
 John E. Fischer    $ 477,000   
 Todd A. Slater      —   
 Pat D. Dawson      —   
 John L. McIntosh    $  289,000   
 James A. Varilek      —   
[END TABLE]
If the employment of an NEO terminates in connection with a disability, he would receive disability benefits equal to 60% of base salary until the executive is no longer disabled or elects to take early retirement or reaches the age of 65 (except in the case of an employee who is over age 61 at the time the disability occurs). If the disability occurs after age 61, the maximum benefit duration extends from 12-60 months depending on the executive's age. All NEOs have elected the 60% level of coverage.  Executive Severance and Executive Change in Control Arrangements 
Executive Severance Plans.    We have adopted two Executive Severance Plans, both of which cover any officer of Olin who is subject to the reporting rules under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including all our NEOs. 
The Olin Corporation Severance Plan for Section 16(b) Officers (Severance Plan) and the Olin Corporation Change in Control Severance Plan for Section 16(b) Officers (CIC Severance Plan) were adopted on December 12, 2018, in each case effective January 27, 2019. We refer to the Severance Plan and CIC Severance Plan as the Executive Severance Plans. The Executive Severance Plans were intended to replace the Executive Agreements and CIC agreements described below, which terminated on January 26, 2019. 
The Severance Plan provides payments and benefits to the NEOs and other covered executives in the event of certain qualifying terminations of their employment (other than in connection with a change in control of Olin) and the CIC Severance Plan provides payments and benefits to the covered executives in the event of certain qualifying terminations of their employment following a change in control of Olin. In adopting the Executive Severance Plans, it was our intention to provide security to our senior executives in the event of a loss of employment generally consistent with the arrangements provided by our peer companies. 
Under the Severance Plan, if the executive's employment is terminated by Olin without "cause" (other than in connection with a change in control of Olin), the executive will receive, in lieu of severance benefits under any other Olin severance plans or programs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  an amount equal to the sum of (i) the executive's annual base salary and (ii) the executive's target annual cash incentive  opportunity for the year of termination, payable in twelve equal monthly installments;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  if the termination occurs in the last three quarters of the year, a pro-rated annual cash incentive payment  for the year of termination based on Olin's actual performance and payable at such time such incentive payments are payable to other employees of Olin;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  the continuation of medical, dental and life insurance benefits for the executive and his or her dependents for a period of twelve months at active  employee rates under the applicable Olin plans or programs; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (4)  outplacement services for a period of up to twelve months.  
[END TABLE]
Payments and benefits under the CIC Severance Plan are "double-trigger", which means they are paid only if (i) there is a change in control of Olin and (ii) the executive's employment is terminated by Olin without "cause" or the executive resigns for "good reason," in either case, upon or within two years following the change in control. If this occurs, the executive will receive, in lieu of severance benefits under any other Olin severance plans or programs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  an amount equal to two times (or three times in the case of Mr. Fischer) the sum of (i) the executive's annual base salary and  (ii) the executive's target annual cash incentive opportunity for the year of termination, payable in a lump sum;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  if the termination occurs in the last three quarters of the year, a pro-rated annual cash incentive payment  for the year of termination based on the executive's target annual cash incentive opportunity for the year of termination, payable in a lump sum;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  the continuation of medical, dental and life insurance benefits for the executive and his or her dependents for a period of twenty-four months (or thirty-six months in the case of Mr. Fischer) at active employee rates under the applicable Olin plans or programs; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (4)  outplacement services for a period of up to twelve months.  
[END TABLE]
Such severance payments and benefits under the Executive Severance Plans are not available if the executive's employment is terminated for "cause" by Olin, or terminates due to death or "disability". Except as provided under the CIC Severance Plan for resignations due to good reason, an executive is not eligible for severance payments and benefits due to voluntary termination of employment by the executive. 
The provisions of our equity plans similarly require a "double trigger" (change in control and termination without cause or for good reason within two years of the change in control) for early vesting of all equity awards, other than performance shares and awards the acquirer fails to assume or replace. Performance shares vest automatically upon a change in control with or without a termination of employment, and are paid at target levels. If the other equity awards (options and restricted stock awards) are not assumed by the acquirer or replaced with equivalent benefits, these equity awards also vest upon the change in control, with or without termination of employment. 
The Executive Severance Plans contain an extensive definition of "change in control", but generally a change in control occurs if: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  a person or entity acquires beneficial ownership (as defined in the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of our common stock unless (a) the acquiring  party is Olin, our subsidiaries or our benefit plans, an underwriter holding the shares temporarily for an offering, or a group that includes the executive who is a party to the CIC agreement or an entity that such executive controls, (b) the  percentage increase occurs solely because the total number of shares outstanding is reduced by Olin repurchasing its stock or (c) the acquisition is directly from Olin;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  a majority of our board members change (other than new members elected or nominated by at least 2/3 of the then-current board, unless such new member  became a director pursuant to an actual or threatened proxy contest or similar dispute);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  we (or any of our subsidiaries) sell all or substantially all assets, or merge or engage in a similar transaction, unless, immediately  following such transaction, (a) our shareholders own a majority of the voting interest of Olin or its successor (in approximately the same ratios as before the transaction) and (b) neither of the events described in items (1) or (2)  above has occurred for Olin or its successor; provided that a transaction that would otherwise constitute a change in control under this item (3) will not be considered a change in control if: (i) at least a majority of our board members  immediately before the transaction remain as board members after the transaction, (ii) at least 75% of our executive officers immediately before the transaction remain as executive officers after the transaction, and our board members at  the time of approval of the transaction determine in good faith that such executive officers are expected to remain as executive officers for a significant period after the transaction, and (iii) 2/3 of such board members determine that the  transaction shall not be deemed to be a change in control; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (4)  our shareholders approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of Olin.  
[END TABLE]
All payments and other benefits under the Executive Severance Plans are subject to the executive's execution and non-revocation of, and continued compliance with, a separation release agreement. The separation release agreement includes a general release of all claims against Olin and the executive's compliance with restrictive covenants provided under the Executive Severance Plans, including ongoing non-disparagement requirements with respect to Olin and certain non-competition   and non-solicitation covenants during the executive's severance period. The executive, regardless of the circumstances of the executive's termination of employment, would also be prohibited from disclosing our trade secrets and other confidential information. 
If payments and benefits under the CIC Severance Plan to an executive would constitute an "excess parachute payment" under Code Section 280G and subject the executive to golden parachute excise taxes under Code Section 4999, the CIC Severance Plan utilizes a "best net after-tax" payment approach which reduces the executive's payments and benefits to an amount that results in the greatest after-tax benefit for the executive, taking into account any such excise tax and any applicable federal, state and local taxes. The Executive Severance Plans and our equity plans do not provide for any excise tax gross-up benefit to any executive. 
Terminated CIC Agreements.    Until January 26, 2019, we had executive change in control agreements with the NEOs and four other executive officers (the CIC agreements). These agreements were used to determine the amounts set forth above in the table under the heading "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." The CIC agreements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· required a double trigger (change in control and termination or constructive termination) for early vesting of stock options and restricted stock awards,  unless the acquirer fails to assume or replace those awards;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· eliminated all gross-up for golden parachute excise taxes, substituting a "best net after-tax" payment approach that reduces payments and benefits to the executive if the reduction would result in the executive receiving higher payments and benefits on a net  after-tax basis;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· conditioned receipt of severance and other termination benefits on a release of claims by the executive;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· contained restrictive covenants that prohibit (i) solicitation and hiring of our employees, (ii) disclosure of certain information relating to our  customers and (iii) disparaging us or our business; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· included a provision to allow our board to determine that certain transactions, such as the Acquisition, would not constitute a change in control for purposes  of these agreements, a right our board exercised in connection with the Acquisition.  
[END TABLE]
The CIC agreements contained an extensive definition of "change in control" that generally tracked the definition in the Executive Severance Agreements. In connection with the Acquisition, which would otherwise have satisfied the definition of change in control, our board exercised its right to determine that the Acquisition was not a change in control for purposes of the CIC agreements and the equity plans. 
Under the CIC agreements, if, during the three years after a change in control (or in anticipation of a change in control) the executive's employment was terminated without cause or for good reason, as defined in the CIC agreements, the executive would receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a lump sum cash severance payment of three times (for Messrs. Fischer and McIntosh) or two times (for Mr. Slater and the six other executives),  (i) the executive's base salary plus (ii) the higher of the average annual cash incentive payment received by the executive for the last three calendar years or the executive's target annual cash incentive opportunity for the  year of termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· 36 months for Messrs. Fischer and McIntosh (24 months for Mr. Slater and the six other executives) of retirement plan contributions under our  defined contribution plans, based on the executive's severance payment;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· 36 months for Messrs. Fischer and McIntosh (24 months for Mr. Slater and the six other executives) of coverage under our medical, dental and  life insurance plans, followed by coverage pursuant to COBRA (and, if eligibility requirements are met, participation in our post-retirement medical and dental plans until age 65 on the same basis as similarly situated employees of Olin);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· if termination of employment occurred after the first calendar quarter of any year, the executive's pro-rated  annual cash incentive payment for the year of termination; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· 12 months of outplacement services.  
[END TABLE]
Payments under the first three items above were prorated if the executive was within 36 months (24 months for Mr. Slater and the six other executives) of any mandatory retirement age applicable to him or her, based on the remaining number of days until such age. 
The CIC agreements also provided that if any payments made to the executive would subject the executive to the excise tax under Code Section 4999, payments under the CIC agreements would be the amount that produced the greatest after-tax benefit to the executive, taking into account any such excise tax. 
Terminated Executive Agreements.    In addition to the CIC agreements, Messrs. Fischer and McIntosh and one other executive had executive severance agreements (Executive Agreements) that terminated on January 26, 2019. Those agreements provided that, if the executive's employment was terminated (in a non-change in control event) by Olin without cause, the executive would receive, in lieu of severance benefits under any other Olin severance plans or programs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  cash installment payments (which we refer to as the Executive Severance amount) equal to (a) twelve months salary plus (b) a percentage  (calculated as the executive's target bonus for the prior year divided by the executive's salary in effect at termination) of base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  12 months of retirement contributions to all Olin defined contribution plans based on the amount of the cash installment payments (the executive  would be treated as if he or she had remained employed for service purposes for 12 months after the termination);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  12 months of medical, dental and life insurance coverage for the executive and dependents; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (4)  the same outplacement services and prorated annual incentive compensation award provided under the CIC agreement.  
[END TABLE]
These payments were prorated if the executive was within 12 months of any mandatory retirement age, based on the remaining number of days until such age. 
In addition, the Executive Agreements provided that, if the executive becomes an employee of buyer or joint venture, the Executive Agreement would continue to apply to any termination from the new employment for 12 months. Payments by Olin would be reduced for any cash severance or similar benefits from such buyer or joint venture. 
Treatment of Equity Awards Under Plans 
Retirement.    When an employee retires: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· vested stock options may be exercised for the remaining option term;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· vested but unpaid performance shares will be paid as specified in the performance share program; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the retired employee receives a pro rata payout in cash of any unvested performance share award at such time it would otherwise be paid.   
[END TABLE]
The committee has discretion to waive vesting periods for restricted stock and restricted stock units. 
Change in Control.    As noted above, our various equity plans provide that options and restricted stock awards vest upon a change in control (as defined in the Executive Severance Plans) only if there is also a termination of employment or constructive termination, or the acquiring company fails to assume these awards or substitute equivalent awards. Outstanding performance shares vest and are paid upon a change in control. The plans do not include excise tax gross-up provisions. 
Pension Plans 
Qualified Plan.    The Qualified Plan provides that if, within three years after a change in control (as defined in the Qualified Plan), any corporate action is taken or filing made in contemplation of events such as a plan termination or merger or other transfer of assets or liabilities of the plan, and such event later takes place, plan benefits automatically increase to absorb any surplus plan assets. Under the Qualified Plan, a change in control occurs if: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a person or entity acquires control of 20% or more of our common stock;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a majority of our board members change in a two-year period (other than new members nominated by at least 2/3 of the  then-current board);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· all or substantially all of our business is sold through a merger or other transaction unless Olin is the surviving corporation or our shareholders own a  majority of the voting interest of the new company; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· our shareholders approve a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or the dissolution of Olin.  
[END TABLE]
Supplemental Plan and Senior Plan.    In the event of a change in control (defined in a manner compliant with Code Section 409A), we must pay a cash amount sufficient to purchase an annuity that provides the monthly after tax benefit the employee would have received under the Supplemental Plan and the Senior Plan. Those payments would be based on benefits accrued as of the change in control. Benefits were frozen at the end of 2007, although continued employment counts toward years of service for vesting and early retirement eligibility. As described above, as a result of the Acquisition, payments of amounts accrued through October 5, 2015, were made under these two plans in 2015.  PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE 
As required by applicable law and SEC regulation, we calculated a reasonable estimate of the ratio of the annual total compensation of John E. Fischer, our CEO, compared to that of our median employee in 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Based on the information described below, for  2018, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 67.13 to 1. 
[END TABLE]
We used the same median employee for the pay ratio in 2018 as in 2017. There was no significant change in our employee population or in the median employee's compensation arrangement or other material change that would significantly affect our pay ratio calculation. We identified our median employee for the 2017 pay ratio analysis using the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates described below. 
Employee Population and Compensation.    As of December 31, 2017, our global employee population consisted of 6,526 individuals working at Olin and its consolidated subsidiaries. This includes 5,536 U.S. employees. At the end of 2018, our global employee population consisted of 6,553 individuals, including 5,422 U.S. employees. 
Given the geographical distribution of our employee population, we use a variety of pay elements to structure the compensation arrangements of our employees. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Base salary and overtime pay—the fixed portion of compensation, paid without regard to financial or operational performance.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Annual cash bonus/variable compensation plans—in which approximately 70% of our full-time employees globally participate.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Other benefit programs, such as health insurance and retirement plan contributions, depending on the practices and laws of the country of employment, and for  certain employees, equity awards.  
[END TABLE]
Adjustment and Assumptions.    In determining the median employee, we applied the allowed "de minimis" exception to exclude 325 employees in the following countries: China (130); Italy (48); South Korea (36); Switzerland (33); Netherlands (23); Japan (11); United Arab Emirates (8); Hong Kong (6); Taiwan (5); Russia (4); Singapore (3); Thailand (4); India (2); Denmark (1); Poland (1); Turkey (1); South Africa (1); United Kingdom (1); and Mexico (1). If we excluded any employees from a country using this de minimis exception, all employees from that country were excluded. 
We selected gross earnings (unreduced by any pre-tax medical or other benefits in the U.S.) as the appropriate measure of compensation and applied the same measure for employees in non-U.S. countries. This approach allowed us to include all elements of compensation while simplifying the process of gathering the relevant information. It also allowed us to reasonably compare compensation for North American employees and that of employees in multiple international locations. We obtained the information for our non-North American-based employees from information maintained by a third party payroll processing provider in each country. 
We considered gross earnings for all of our employees (other than those non-U.S. employees excluded under the "de minimis" exemption described above), during the 12-month period ended December 31, 2018—our fiscal year. We did not make cost-of-living adjustments and did not annualize compensation of employees hired during 2018.  In calculating employee compensation of non-U.S. employees, we averaged the month-end exchange rates for each month in 2017 and applied this average exchange rate to the relevant foreign currencies to convert compensation to U.S. dollars. 
Median Employee.    Using the methodology described, we determined that the "median employee" for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017, was a full-time, salaried non-exempt lab technician in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls division, working in the U.S. As noted above, we used 2017 gross earnings to identify this employee as our median employee, which include the bonus for 2016 performance paid in 2017. 
As noted above, we are using the same median employee for the 2018 pay ratio calculation. 
For the 12-month period ended December 31, 2018, the median employee had gross earnings (wages, overtime pay and variable compensation) of approximately $86,315. We determined the annual total compensation of this "median employee" by calculating the elements of 2018 compensation in accordance with the requirements that apply to the Summary Compensation Table for our NEOs on page 48. This resulted in annual total compensation of $94,444. 
For the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column (column (j)) of our Summary Compensation Table on page 48. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
In 2018, our compensation package for non-employee directors consisted of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· an annual retainer of $80,000, of which at least $40,000 must be taken in shares of common stock;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· phantom stock units with an aggregate fair market value equal to $115,000, rounded to the nearest 100 shares which are credited to a deferred account and  not paid out until the director leaves the board (or an earlier change in control);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a fee of $2,500 per board meeting and committee meeting attended, or $1,250 for in-person board or committee meeting  attended telephonically;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a $30,000 annual fee for the Lead Director and an additional $2,500 for each meeting he attends with management to prepare for board/committee meetings;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a $10,000 annual fee for the chair of each of the compensation and directors and corporate governance committees, and a $15,000 annual fee for the audit  committee chair;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· reimbursement for expenses incurred in the performance of their duties as directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· participation in a charitable gift program, where we make a 50% matching contribution (up to $5,000 per year) for the director's gifts to charities that  meet the requirements of Code Section 501(c)(3); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· director liability insurance, personal excess liability coverage of $5 million per director, and coverage under our business travel accident insurance  policy while on Olin business.  
[END TABLE]
Fair market value for determining the number of shares included in all phantom stock and common stock awards described above is equal to the average of the high and low sale prices of our common stock on March 1 of the applicable year or the first day in March on which the NYSE is open for trading.  Each of Olin's non-employee directors participates in the Directors Plan, under which the stock and phantom stock amounts are paid. In addition to the phantom stock which must be deferred, a director may elect to defer other payments (cash and/or shares of our common stock). Amounts deferred in respect of common stock are credited as phantom shares of our common stock. 
The following table shows all cash and stock retainers, meeting fees and other compensation we paid to each of our non-employee directors during 2018. Each of the directors listed below, except for Ms. Streeter and Messrs. Rompala and Sutton, served for the entire year.

      Differences in the amounts shown above among directors for dividend equivalents reflect the number of shares held as deferred stock units. Messrs.  Benoist, Rompala and Shipp elected to receive their dividend equivalents in the form of additional deferred stock units, while the other directors elected to receive the dividend equivalent payments in cash (current or deferred). Does not include  perquisites and other personal benefits which did not exceed, in the aggregate, $10,000 for any director.  
[END TABLE]
The board of directors determines the total amounts of the annual retainer, meeting, lead director and board/committee chair fees, based on recommendations from the committee and input from Exequity. All stock-based compensation for our directors is governed by the Directors Plan. The annual stock grant, retainer stock grant and cash retainer are paid for the 12-month period running from May 1 to April 30, with payments made on March 1 or the first day in March on which the NYSE is open for trading. 
Under the Directors Plan, directors may choose to receive common stock instead of cash for any portion of their compensation. Directors may also elect to defer payments (cash or stock). We credit their deferred accounts with quarterly interest (on the cash portion) and with dividend equivalents (on the phantom stock portion). Phantom stock units are paid out in shares of our common stock or, at the director's election, in cash. We also pay the balance of any deferred account to the director if there is a change in control—generally if: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a person or group acquires 40% or more of our assets, 30% or more of our stock, or a majority of the market value or voting power of our stock, or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a majority of our board members are not endorsed by the directors in office at the time of election.  
[END TABLE]
We have stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors where each such director is expected to own shares of our common stock with a market value of at least five times the amount of the annual retainer, within five years after the director joins our board. Each non-employee director met these guidelines and is in compliance with these guidelines as of the date of this Proxy Statement.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The compensation committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and, based on the review and discussions, recommends that it be included in Olin's 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and Proxy Statement for the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders.

ITEM 2—PROPOSAL TO CONDUCT AN ADVISORY VOTE TO 
APPROVE THE COMPENSATION FOR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Following the advisory vote on the frequency of a shareholder vote on executive compensation at last year's annual meeting of shareholders, our board of directors decided to continue with the annual advisory vote by shareholders to approve the compensation for NEOs. 
You are being asked to cast an advisory vote on approval of the compensation of our NEOs at the annual meeting. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, is required under Section 14A of the Exchange Act. The proposal gives you the opportunity, on an advisory vote basis, to approve or not approve the compensation of the NEOs through the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Olin named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative disclosure, is hereby APPROVED." 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the board and it will not directly affect or otherwise limit any existing compensation or award arrangement of any of our NEOs. Our compensation committee does intend to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
Vote Required for Approval 
Approval of this proposal requires that more votes be cast FOR this proposal than are cast AGAINST this proposal. Abstentions and shares held in street name that are not voted on this proposal and broker non-votes will not be included in determining the number of votes cast on this proposal and will not have any effect on the result of the vote. 
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR approval of this resolution.  ITEM 3—PROPOSAL TO RATIFY APPOINTMENT OF 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
KPMG was our independent registered public accounting firm for 2018 and 2017. A summary of the KPMG fees by year follows:

(1)  Includes costs associated with the annual audit, including quarterly financial reviews, services required under Section 404 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act, statutory audits, comfort letters, attest services, consents and assistance with and review of filings with the SEC, including registration statements filed in both 2017 and 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Our audit committee has a policy that all audit services by any independent registered public accounting firm and all non-audit services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm are subject to pre-approval by the audit committee at each scheduled meeting. The policy includes specific procedures for approval of such services. Excerpts from this policy follow: 
Olin's audit committee is solely responsible for pre-approving all audit services by any independent registered public accounting firm and all non-audit services performed by Olin's independent registered public accounting firm. The process for such approval is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The annual budget for all such services will be submitted to the committee for approval in the first quarter of each year. The budget submission will include  details of actual expenditures for each audit and non-audit service for the prior year versus the prior year budget and estimated spending for services in the current year. The budget will also provide for  certain specific services that will be pre-approved within a limited dollar range per service. These pre-approved services are also subject to an annual spending cap.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· At each subsequent audit committee meeting, the budget will be updated for changes in estimated spending involving previously approved services. The budget  will also be updated to include any new services identified by operations management that need to be submitted for approval.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Any services not detailed in the budget or on the list of specific pre-approved services must be approved by the  committee. In the event that approval is needed for a service in advance of a regularly scheduled audit committee meeting, the Chair of the committee is authorized to approve the service and report such approval to the other committee members at the  next regularly scheduled committee meeting.  
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the audit committee pre-approved all audit and audit-related services.  Who has the audit committee selected as Olin's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019? 
Olin's audit committee is solely responsible for hiring and compensating Olin's independent registered public accounting firm. After considering KPMG's 2018 performance and the fees proposed for their preliminary audit plan for 2019, the committee has selected KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
Is a shareholder vote required to approve Olin's independent registered public accounting firm? 
Neither Virginia law nor Olin's Bylaws require Olin to submit this matter to the shareholders at the annual meeting. However, the board and audit committee chose to submit it to the shareholders to ascertain their views. 
Will I have an opportunity to hear from KPMG and ask them questions? 
We expect representatives of KPMG to be present at the annual meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so, and to respond to appropriate questions. 
Vote Required for Ratification 
To ratify the appointment of KPMG as Olin's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 the votes cast FOR this proposal must exceed the votes cast AGAINST this proposal. Abstentions and shares held in street name that are not voted on this proposal will not be included in determining the number of votes cast on this proposal and will not have any effect on the result of the vote. 
If the shareholders' ratification vote does not support the audit committee's decision to appoint KPMG as Olin's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019, the audit committee will take the vote into consideration in making next year's selection. 
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.
