DEAR STOCKHOLDERS,
As members of the Board of Directors, we sincerely thank you for your continued investment in HCP. We are committed to governing HCP in a prudent and transparent manner, with the goal of creating long-term value for you. Our responsibility is to proactively oversee HCP's business strategy, corporate governance and executive compensation, among other things, on your behalf. We are pleased to share with you the results of our efforts over the past year.
Completing Our Business Transformation Through our efforts over the last several years to optimize our portfolio and balance sheet, HCP is better positioned to create and capture value for the benefit of stockholders.
During 2018, we substantially completed our portfolio repositioning and operator transitions, leaving us with a high-quality and balanced portfolio designed to maximize long-term growth while reducing short-term volatility. Capital recycling and refinancing activities strengthened our balance sheet, which was recognized with our credit rating upgrades in late 2018 and early 2019. We are actively engaged in the real estate investment market, sourcing and executing on investments in our core segments that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns and strong growth profiles. Finally, we continue to pursue the incremental upside embedded in each of our property segments through development, redevelopment and complementary transaction activities that we expect to generate growth over the long-term.
We owe these successes to the extraordinary efforts of HCP's management team and employees, who committed to an aggressive transformation plan, worked tirelessly to execute our repositioning and rebalancing strategy, and are more prepared than ever to pursue growth and excellence. We are proud of how far we have come, and are excited about the opportunities ahead.
Comprehensive Board Refreshment This year, we reinforced our commitment to Board governance, Board refreshment and Board succession planning.
As a result of our 2018 Board self-evaluation, we comprehensively restructured and refreshed our Board during 2018. Brian G. Cartwright, former General Counsel of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, now serves as our independent Chairman of the Board. We appointed three new Board members this year: R. Kent Griffin, Jr., Lydia H. Kennard and Katherine M. Sandstrom. We selected Kent, Lydia and Kathy because of the specific skills and depth of experience they bring to our Board.
In order to ensure ongoing Board refreshment, we adopted a mandatory director retirement age of 75. In accordance with the new policy, Peter L. Rhein and Joseph P. Sullivan will be retiring from our Board at the 2019 annual meeting. Both have served HCP with integrity, passion and wisdom, and we are grateful for their service to the Company.

 Continued ESG Leadership Environmental, social and governance initiatives are a critical component of our corporate responsibility. We seek to undertake sustainability initiatives that increase stockholder value. This year we published our eighth consecutive annual Sustainability Report, which is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. In 2018, we received numerous awards for our sustainability efforts and were included in the North America Dow Jones Sustainability Index for a sixth consecutive year for achievements in energy efficiency. We also focused on our human capital management this year, with particular emphasis on the engagement, satisfaction, development and diversity of HCP's employees. Complementing our efforts to enrich the community within HCP, we also emphasized external community engagement by donating almost $500,000 to charitable organizations during 2018, sponsoring and participating in local community events such as the Walk to End Alzheimer's, and partnering with local charities such as the Ronald McDonald House to provide rooms for families experiencing the turmoil of a seriously ill child. Paying for Performance Refinements to our executive compensation program over the past several years created significant pay-for-performance alignment in 2018. Our short-term incentive plan, or STIP, payouts for 2018 reflect our overall strong operating performance and balance sheet metrics in 2018. Although payouts for our long-term incentive plan, or LTIP, awards in 2018 will not be measured until the end of 2020, our total stockholder return, or TSR, outperformed a majority of our selected LTIP peers during 2018, reflecting positive performance and growth. Because we continuously strive to improve our executive compensation program, 2019 refinements include eliminating tax gross up payments on executive perquisites and adding a one-year minimum post-vesting holding period for executive equity awards. Looking Ahead We continue to focus our operating and investment strategies on four components that we believe are key to generating sustainable stockholder returns: (i) maintaining a strong balance sheet; (ii) growing relationships with preferred operators and partners; (iii) continuing improvement of our portfolio quality and mix; and (iv) pursuing operational excellence. We are excited about HCP's future and believe we are well-positioned for long-term growth. We hope that you will attend our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders to hear first-hand about our performance and future plans. Thank you for your continued support.             2018 GOVERNANCE HIGHLIGHTS

COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM
In response to feedback from our stockholders through investor outreach and as a result of proactive internal efforts, we have established an executive compensation program consistent with evolving best practices. In 2018, we compensated our named executive officers ("NEOs") using the following three elements of pay:

PAY FOR PERFORMANCE ALIGNMENT
Our 2018 executive compensation awards reflect our commitment to aligning pay with performance. Only base salary is fixed. Short-term incentive awards remain at risk until year-end corporate and individual performance are assessed by the Compensation Committee. Long-term equity incentive awards based on relative TSR performance remain at risk until the end of the 3-year performance period, and long-term retentive awards with 3-year annual vesting are at risk and earned only upon achieving a minimum normalized FFO per share threshold in the year of grant. The below graphics illustrate the mix of 2018 fixed pay (base salary) and at-risk pay incentives (cash incentive compensation and grant date fair value of equity awards granted during the year), presented at the Target level of performance, for our CEO and our other NEOs. "Average All Other NEOs" excludes (i) Mr. McKee due to his mid-year separation, and (ii) one-time retentive equity awards to Messrs. Brinker and McHenry.

2018 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
PORTFOLIO TRANSFORMATION
Our strategic transformation during the past several years has been intentional and rapid. We have made tremendous progress improving the quality of our earnings stream, diversifying our tenant concentration and reducing leverage. In 2018, our leadership team substantially completed this repositioning process. We believe we now have one of the premier portfolios in the healthcare real estate sector. The chart below shows how far we have come since we embarked on our repositioning initiatives in 2016.
FFO as adjusted, net debt to adjusted EBITDA and cash NOI are non-GAAP financial measures. For definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see the section titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" in our Annual Report, as well as the document titled "4Q 2018 Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" available in the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.hcpi.com.

       PROPOSAL 1   
[END TABLE]
Based on the recommendations of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Governance Committee"), our Board has nominated the seven directors identified on the following pages for election at the Annual Meeting to serve until the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. All of the nominees are current directors of the Company. Each director nominee has agreed to be named in this proxy statement and to serve, if elected.
Peter L. Rhein and Joseph P. Sullivan will be retiring from our Board at the Annual Meeting in accordance with our mandatory retirement age policy adopted in 2018, as further described below under the heading "Board Evaluations and Refreshment—Mandatory Retirement Age Policy." Both provided invaluable contributions to HCP, and we thank them for their years of service as members of our Board. As a result of the foregoing, stockholders may vote only with respect to the seven director nominees named in this proxy statement.
We have no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected. However, if any nominee is unable or unwilling for good cause to serve, the proxy holders may vote their shares for a substitute nominee or for the balance of our Board, leaving a vacancy, unless our Board chooses to reduce the number of directors serving on our Board.
VOTING STANDARD
MAJORITY VOTING AND DIRECTOR RESIGNATION POLICY
Consistent with corporate governance best practices, our majority voting standard for director elections requires that a director nominee in an uncontested election receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her election at the Annual Meeting (that is, the number of votes cast FOR the nominee must exceed the number of votes cast AGAINST the nominee) to be elected to our Board. Our Board believes that the majority vote standard in uncontested elections strengthens the director nomination process and enhances director accountability.
We also have a director resignation policy in our Bylaws, which requires any nominee who fails to receive a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election to promptly submit his or her resignation. The Governance Committee would then consider the resignation and make a recommendation to our Board on whether to accept it or whether other action should be taken. Our Board would then act on the resignation, taking into account the Committee's recommendation, and would publicly disclose its decision, along with the rationale for such decision, within 90 days of certification of the election results. We believe this process provides critical accountability to stockholders.

PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
BOARD EFFECTIVENESS AND STRATEGIC EVOLUTION
Our Board believes that improving its effectiveness is an ongoing and integrated process that requires thoughtful planning, evaluation, recruitment and rotation. Our Board continues to evolve and adapt in order to drive the Company's strategic direction. This ongoing process includes:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1 DIRECTOR SELECTION   2  ONBOARDING AND EDUCATION   3  BOARD SELF- EVALUATION   4  DIRECTOR REFRESHMENT 
[END TABLE]
The Governance Committee considers a variety of factors when reviewing potential nominees for our Board, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
In addition to the criteria noted above, the Governance Committee considers diversity in gender, age, ethnicity, national origin, and professional and personal experience when reviewing potential director nominees, and strives to create diversity in perspective on our Board as a whole, when identifying and selecting nominees. On an annual basis, as part of our Board's self-evaluation, our Board assesses whether its diversity, which it views as a critical component to its effectiveness, is appropriate.          DIVERSITY  
[END TABLE]
The Governance Committee considers potential director nominees recommended by various sources, including Board members, stockholders and senior management. The Committee may also hire a search firm. The Governance Committee will consider director candidates properly recommended by stockholders in the same manner as recommendations received from other sources. For a description of the process for stockholders to recommend or nominate directors, see "Other Matters—2020 Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations."
The Chair of the Committee, or a member designated by the Chair, is responsible for overseeing the search and interview process. The Committee will provide progress updates to our Board and will meet to consider and recommend final director candidates to the entire Board. Our Board then determines, taking into account the recommendation of the Committee, which candidates to nominate or elect to fill a vacancy.
2018 DIRECTOR SEARCH
In 2018, the Governance Committee engaged two independent director search firms to assist in identifying and evaluating director candidates. These firms aided the Committee in establishing director nominee criteria, identifying and corresponding with potential director candidates, evaluating the candidates' credentials, and facilitating conversations with management and other members of our Board.
Table of Contents
PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
At the direction of the Committee, the search firms focused on candidates who demonstrate diversity in gender, age, ethnicity, national origin, or professional or personal experience. Ms. Kennard and Mr. Griffin were recommended by one of the search firms, as well as by members of our Board and senior management team. Ms. Sandstrom was recommended by a different search firm, as well as by our President and CEO. Following the evaluations facilitated by the independent search firms, the Committee recommended, and our Board appointed, Mses. Kennard and Sandstrom and Mr. Griffin as directors, increasing our Board's gender, age and racial diversity, as well as the diversity of our Board's skills and professional experience.
NOMINEE INDEPENDENCE CONSIDERATIONS
Our Board has determined that all non-employee director nominees are independent according to NYSE listing standards. For a director to be considered independent under NYSE rules, our Board must affirmatively determine that the director has no direct or indirect material relationship with us, with certain types of relationships automatically disqualifying the director as independent. Our Board annually evaluates the independence of each non-employee director by considering any matters that could affect the director's ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, including any transactions or relationships between the director, members of his or her family and organizations with which that director or family members have an affiliation, on the one hand, and us, our subsidiaries and management, on the other hand.
Based upon its most recent review, our Board affirmatively determined that each of Mses. Garvey, Kennard and Sandstrom and Messrs. Cartwright, Griffin and Henry is independent under the rules of the NYSE. We refer to these directors as the "Independent Directors." Our only non-independent director nominee is our President and CEO, Thomas Herzog. In addition, our Board determined that each of Messrs. Hoffmann, Rhein and Sullivan was independent under the rules of the NYSE during his service on our Board in 2018. Mr. McKee was not independent under the rules of the NYSE during his service on our Board in 2018 due to his employment as our Executive Chairman.
In making its director independence determinations, our Board considered Mr. Rhein's service as a non-employee director of Cohen & Steers, Inc., whose wholly-owned subsidiary, Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., manages mutual funds that in the aggregate owned approximately 1.86% of our common stock as of December 31, 2017, and affirmatively determined that Mr. Rhein was an independent director for the period he served as a director.
PROXY ACCESS
Our Board has implemented a proxy access provision in our Bylaws, which permits a stockholder or group of up to 25 stockholders, owning at least 3% of our shares continuously for three years, to nominate up to the greater of two directors or a number constituting up to 20% of our Board for inclusion in our proxy materials for an annual meeting of stockholders, subject to complying with the requirements contained in our Bylaws. For more information on using proxy access to nominate directors, see "Other Matters—2020 Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations."
[BEGIN TABLE]
  25 STOCKHOLDERS             3% OF OUR SHARES            3 YEARS            2 NOMINEES OR 20% OF OUR BOARD   
[END TABLE]
When a new director joins our Board, management and the existing Board members provide an orientation to familiarize the new director with the Company's business, policies and procedures. This orientation typically includes providing the new director with background material on the Company, its business plan and risk profile, as well as meetings between the new director and senior management. 
We also encourage directors to attend director education programs relating to board responsibilities, corporate governance and/or substantive matters relevant to the Company. We provide a list of upcoming educational programs and conferences to our directors every quarter and reimburse all fees, costs and expenses of attendance.

4  DIRECTOR REFRESHMENT 
  MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE POLICY 
[END TABLE]
As part of our Board's commitment to refreshment, the Board adopted a mandatory director retirement age of 75. Directors will not be nominated for election or appointed to the Board if they are or would be 75 years old or older at the time of their election or appointment. Additionally, directors are required to retire from the Board at the first annual meeting of stockholders following the director's 75th birthday. On the recommendation of the Governance Committee, the Board, by majority vote and on an annual basis, may waive the mandatory retirement age if the Board deems such waiver to be in the best interests of the Company.
As a result of the mandatory retirement age, Messrs. Rhein and Sullivan will be retiring from our Board at the Annual Meeting. We are grateful for the invaluable guidance and support they provided to our Company over many years.

BOARD ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
BOARD AND STOCKHOLDER MEETING ATTENDANCE
Our Board's primary responsibility is to oversee the long-term health and success of our business on behalf of stockholders. In order to effectively carry out that duty to stockholders, our Board commits a substantial amount of time and attention throughout the year to the most significant aspects of our business. Directors are expected to, and do, ask difficult questions of management.
Our policy is that directors should make every effort to attend all meetings of our Board and the annual meeting of stockholders, as well as all meetings of Board committees for which they are members. Our directors are committed to their responsibilities, as demonstrated by the average attendance of our director nominees at Board and committee meetings in 2018 of 97%. No director attended less than 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of our Board and the committees on which the director served in 2018, other than Michael D. McKee and James P. Hoffmann, who both resigned from the Board in 2018. All of our directors nominated for election at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders attended the meeting.

We focus on achieving goals that will benefit all of our stakeholders in each of the ESG dimensions of sustainability. Our environmental programs capture cost efficiencies and conserve natural resources, and our social initiatives focus on local philanthropic and volunteer activities. Our transparent governance initiatives incorporate sustainability as a critical component of achieving our business objectives and properly managing risks.
Operational eco-efficiency, including energy and resource efficiency, is essential for our properties, and we develop and redevelop properties with sustainability front of mind. At existing properties, we consistently implement environmental efficiency projects to upgrade, replace or retrofit inefficient equipment such as HVACs, chillers, lighting and reflective rooftops.

We use the ENERGY STAR benchmarking program to track facility performance, and those that operate among the top 25% of similar facilities earn certification from the Environmental Protection Agency for superior energy performance. ENERGY STAR certified buildings cost less to operate, use less energy, and can command higher rents and sale prices, among other benefits. As of December 31, 2018, we had received 244 ENERGY STAR certifications.
Additionally, we strive for green building accreditation when developing or acquiring a new property. The U.S. Green Building Council's LEED® green building program is the preeminent program for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of high-performance green buildings. We use the LEED framework to develop and operate highly-efficient and cost-saving green buildings. We currently own over 2.3 million square feet of LEED certified properties.
Our ESG initiatives have earned us many accolades, and we are committed to continuing our leadership in our industry. For additional information regarding our ESG initiatives, please view our Sustainability Report at www.hcpi.com/sustainability.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
In early 2018, our Board expanded its focus on the Company's human capital management, which our Board believes is vital to the Company's organizational health. Our Board is strongly committed to diversity and equal opportunity, with the tone set from the top. The Compensation Committee retains direct oversight over all human capital matters, including culture, diversity, inclusion, talent acquisition, retention, employee satisfaction and engagement.

BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN
Brian G. Cartwright serves as our Independent Chairman of the Board. Our Chairman actively manages our Board by:
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS
The Independent Directors hold regular executive sessions to provide an opportunity to discuss matters without Company management present. These executive sessions allow for candid conversations and promote the independence of our Board from management. Executive sessions often follow regularly scheduled Board and committee meetings, but are also sometimes held independently of regular Board and committee meetings. Any Independent Director may call an executive session.
COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD
Our Board has a standing Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Governance Committee, each of which has a written charter, available on our website at www.hcpi.com/charters. Our Board also established a standing Investment Committee to review HCP's financing requirements, plans and strategies and recommend to our Board any material changes to HCP's capital structure.
As a corporate governance best practice, the Governance Committee annually considers the composition of our standing Board committees to ensure an appropriate balance of workloads and a diversity of perspectives. The table below shows the current membership of the committees of our Board and the number of meetings held by each in 2018. Please see "Our Director Nominees" on page 3 for the anticipated composition of the committees of the Board following the Annual Meeting. Mr. Herzog does not and will not serve on any of the below committees. Mr. Cartwright does not currently serve on any of the below committees.

ANNUAL COMPENSATION
In consultation with FPL Associates, L.P., the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, the Committee annually reviews our director compensation program for continued alignment with comparable companies and sound governance practices.
Compensation paid to our Independent Directors for services in 2018 is described below. For compensation paid in 2018 to Michael D. McKee, our former Executive Chairman, and Thomas M. Herzog, our President and CEO, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." Messrs. McKee and Herzog received no separate compensation for their services as directors of the Company in 2018.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Independent Chairman: $95,000 
[END TABLE]
CASH COMPENSATION
In February 2018, in connection with the appointment of an Independent Chairman of the Board, the Compensation Committee established an annual cash retainer for the Chairman of $30,000, which mirrored the retainer previously paid to the Lead Independent Director. In May 2018, FPL Associates performed a benchmarking analysis of our director compensation program against our proxy peer companies identified on page 44. Based on this analysis, FPL Associates determined that the Chairman retainer of $30,000 was well below the median compensation of proxy peers. As a result, in consultation with FPL Associates, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved, an increase in the Independent Chairman retainer from $30,000 to $95,000 to better align with market practice and reflect the significant efforts of the Chairman. Additionally, the Board approved increasing the Governance Committee Chair retainer from $15,000 to $20,000, and the Governance Committee member retainer from $2,500 to $5,000.
In addition to the above, directors are paid an additional $1,500 per meeting fee for each Board or individual committee meeting that a director attends after that director has attended 10 meetings of our Board or that committee, as applicable, in a given calendar year (e.g., for each Audit Committee meeting after 10 Audit Committee meetings in one calendar year). All cash retainers are paid quarterly and prorated based on the number of days that a member serves in the applicable capacity. We also reimburse Independent Directors for director education and reasonable travel expenses in connection with their Board duties.
EQUITY COMPENSATION
The annual equity retainer is provided in restricted stock units ("RSUs") with a grant date fair value of $150,000, rounded up to the nearest whole share, to each Independent Director who is elected at the annual meeting of stockholders or is initially appointed as an Independent Director other than at the annual meeting. Each Independent Director was granted an annual equity award in the form of restricted stock units with a grant date fair market value of $150,003 on May 3, 2018, except Ms. Sandstrom, whose grant occurred on August 2, 2018 and had a grant date fair market value of $150,016. The RSUs cliff-vest in full on the earlier of the first anniversary of the grant date, the Company's next annual meeting of stockholders, or the termination of the Independent Director's service due to death, disability or a retirement from the Board at age 65 with at least five years of service or age 60 with 15 years of service. The awards are subject to forfeiture if the Independent Director's service terminates for any other reason.
The Compensation Committee believes that the 1-year cliff vesting promotes retention during the year in which the award is granted and provides for an earlier alignment of interests with stockholders when compared to a 3-year vesting period. Additionally, 1-year cliff vesting reflects our Board's view that shorter vesting periods encourage director independence and objectivity.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION—2018
2018 INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
The following table summarizes the compensation of the Independent Directors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
2019 INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR COMPENSATION CHANGES
In consultation with FPL Associates, the Compensation Committee recommended, and our Board approved, the following adjustments to the compensation of the Independent Directors for 2019 to better align to the median director compensation of our peers:
Our Board determined these adjustments are reasonable in light of director compensation practices of our proxy peer companies and in accordance with sound governance principles.
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PLANS
DIRECTOR STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
Independent Directors are required to accumulate and hold shares of HCP stock (including RSUs) equal in value to at least five times the amount of the annual cash retainer for Independent Directors. With respect to new Independent Directors, the guidelines are effective on the first May 15 that occurs more than five years after the director first becomes a member of our Board. Once subject to the guidelines, an Independent Director's level of stock ownership will be reviewed annually on May 15 for as long as the director remains in office. All of our Independent Directors for whom the guidelines had become effective as of May 15, 2018, satisfied our director stock ownership guidelines as of that date.
DIRECTOR DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN
We maintain a deferred compensation plan (the "Director Deferral Plan"), which permits our Independent Directors to elect to defer their annual retainers. Amounts deferred under the Director Deferral Plan generally are payable in cash as a lump sum, in monthly installments or a combination of both, as elected by the director, upon the termination of the director's service on our Board, the director's death or such earlier date as elected by the director. A director participating in the Director Deferral Plan may elect to have his or her deferred compensation credited to (i) an interest rate account wherein the deferrals accrue interest at a rate equal to the current prime rate minus 1%, or (ii) a stock credit account wherein the deferrals are treated as if invested in our common stock with the account increasing for dividends paid, and increasing or decreasing in value with changes in our stock price.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION—2018
NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR STOCK-FOR-FEES PROGRAM
Under the Non-Employee Director Stock-for-Fees Program, each of our Independent Directors may elect to receive all or a portion of their annual retainer and meeting fees in the form of shares of our common stock in lieu of payment in cash. The election will apply to the elected amount of such fees that would otherwise be paid in cash, commencing with the fiscal quarter after the election is made. Shares will be issued as soon as practicable after we pay an ordinary cash dividend to our stockholders following the date that cash director fees for the preceding quarter would otherwise be payable to the director. The number of shares issued will be determined by dividing the amount of the fees by the average closing price of our common stock for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the relevant dividend payment date.

ADVISORY RESOLUTION
In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the related rules of the SEC, stockholders are entitled to cast a nonbinding, advisory vote to approve the compensation of our NEOs (often referred to as "say-on-pay"). Accordingly, you are being asked to vote on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders APPROVE, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the NEOs, as disclosed in this proxy statement, which includes the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the accompanying tables, and the related narrative disclosure, pursuant to the SEC's executive compensation disclosure rules.
Our Board recommends that you vote FOR this resolution because it believes that our executive compensation program supports our compensation objectives and philosophies, including:
VOTING STANDARD
This proposal to approve the compensation paid to our NEOs requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal at the Annual Meeting. This proposal is advisory only and will not be binding on, overrule any decision by, or create or imply additional fiduciary duties for, HCP, our Board or the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by stockholders in their vote on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for NEOs.
Our current policy is to provide our stockholders with an opportunity to approve the compensation of our NEOs each year at the annual meeting of stockholders. It is expected that the next advisory vote on executive compensation will be held at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders.

DEAR HCP STOCKHOLDER,
As the members of the Compensation Committee, we are responsible for overseeing the design and implementation of competitive compensation programs that further the interests of stockholders and demonstrate strong pay-for-performance alignment. This responsibility includes listening to and considering your views on executive compensation.
The CD&A that follows describes what we pay, why we pay it and how we made our compensation decisions in 2018. Our compensation philosophy is to align the interests of our executives and stockholders through a transparent and rigorous compensation program.
KEY COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES
We incentivize our executives by offering a combination of performance-based and fixed compensation, with a significant portion in the form of equity awards. The value of these awards depends upon the value of our common stock, which we believe further aligns executives' interests with those of our stockholders. We believe this compensation philosophy also motivates our talented management team, promotes the execution of our business strategy in a manner that focuses on the creation of long-term stockholder value, encourages prudent risk management and enhances retention of our executive team in a competitive marketplace for talent. While individual goals and performance are considerations in compensation decisions, they are not the cornerstone of our program philosophy because we believe that executive compensation tied to Company objectives better drives long-term growth for stockholders.
We remain firm in our belief that our compensation programs provide compelling incentives for our executives, which in turn benefits our stockholders by driving our business strategies and goals. While short-term stock price performance may not correlate with our executives' efforts, we believe our stockholders' interests are best served over time by a balanced compensation program that takes a long-term, holistic view of our business strategy and emphasizes the drivers of long-term value creation.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
We reviewed and discussed the CD&A with management, as well as the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant and legal advisors. Based upon this review and discussion, we recommended to the Board that the CD&A be included in this proxy statement.

2018 COMPENSATION PROGRAM OVERVIEW
Consistent with our goals of aligning executive and stockholder interests and appropriately incentivizing our executives, the Compensation Committee has adopted a compensation program that incorporates a mix of fixed and at-risk pay incentives. In 2018, our compensation program consisted of the following key elements, as further detailed under "2018 NEO Compensation" below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVES We incentivize our management team with annual cash incentive bonuses based on the achievement of objective at-risk Company performance metrics to align compensation with strategic goals. Our performance metrics (normalized FFO per share, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax and depreciation and amortization)) are commonly used measures of REIT performance. A portion of the annual cash bonus is based on an assessment of individual performance in order to reward individual initiative, achievements and contributions and ensure that executives are driving execution of our business strategy.    LONG-TERM EQUITY OPPORTUNITIES We grant performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs") and service-based RSUs with a performance hurdle to our executives. PSUs are only earned by achieving the Company's 3-year TSR performance hurdles relative to constituents in the FTSE NAREIT Equity Healthcare Index and the S&P 500 REIT Index. This is a critical component of aligning executive compensation with stockholders' interests. RSUs encourage executive retention by vesting ratably over three years, subject to achieving a minimum normalized FFO per share threshold in the grant year.

Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
PAYING FOR PERFORMANCE
Our executive compensation program is designed to reward successful annual performance while encouraging long-term value creation for our stockholders. NEO short- and long-term incentive compensation is subject to rigorous, objective, at-risk performance hurdles across multiple metrics and performance periods, which the Compensation Committee intends to be an incentive to management to drive Company performance and encourage prudent risk management consistent with the Company's financial and strategic goals.
Our 2018 executive compensation program reflects strong alignment between pay and performance. As described under "Proxy Highlights—Company Highlights," we executed on our repositioning strategy in 2018, delivering strong results for our stockholders. We entered into transactions to further reduce our tenant concentration, made key acquisitions in desirable markets, and paid down a significant amount of long-term debt to help strengthen our balance sheet. We also assembled a new leadership team to help ensure our long-term growth, stability and success. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee took actions in 2018 to better align the compensation of our leadership team with the compensation of peer companies, focusing on healthcare REITs, the pool from which we recruit top talent.
Our strong 2018 financial results resulted in above-Target level payout of cash incentive awards under our 2018 short-term incentive plan ("2018 STIP"). While our 2018 TSR performance trended above the Target level of performance for our 2018 long-term incentive plan ("2018 LTIP") awards, our 3-year TSR performance lagged compared to our peers, which resulted in the forfeiture of TSR-based LTIP awards granted in 2016. This forfeiture demonstrates the rigor of our compensation program.

ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
2018 SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
Our NEOs are eligible to receive annual cash bonuses under the 2018 STIP based on the achievement of performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee for the performance period. The 2018 STIP performance metrics and their relative weightings are illustrated and described in the graphic below.
The 2018 STIP reflects revisions from the Company's 2017 STIP that the Compensation Committee deemed advisable in light of the Company's strategic focus on portfolio quality, a strong balance sheet, and organic growth complemented by acquisitions and developments. Considering these goals, together with feedback from our stockholders and input from FPL Associates, the Committee approved the following revisions to the 2018 STIP as compared to 2017:
[BEGIN TABLE]
■  Eliminated the same store cash NOI growth by segment metric due to expected portfolio adjustments in connection with our repositioning strategy, including our plans to sell a significant number of our senior housing assets, transition certain senior housing triple-net properties to our senior housing operating portfolio, and the uncertain timing of completing our announced non-core asset dispositions. 
■  Reallocated the 20% weighting from the eliminated metric to performance goals related to our strategic goals as follows: 15% to earnings (normalized FFO per share); and 5% to individual performance. 
[END TABLE]
2018 STIP AWARD OPPORTUNITIES
The Compensation Committee approved 2018 STIP award opportunities for the NEOs near the beginning of the performance period. As shown above, 60% of the STIP opportunity (the "Company Performance Award") was subject to the achievement of quantitative Company performance metrics tied to the achievement of strategic financial objectives for the 2018 performance period. The remaining 40% of the STIP opportunity (the "Individual Performance Award") was based on an assessment of individual performance, subject to the Committee's ability to reduce the awards. The following table reflects the 2018 STIP NEO award opportunities.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The Compensation Committee established the above award opportunities following a review of compensation data for peers with substantially similar roles and responsibilities prepared by FPL Associates (as described below under "Compensation Policies and Practices—Peer Company Comparison"). The award opportunities reflect the Committee's assessment of the applicable NEO's job position and responsibilities, experience, peer group data and individual performance, as further described under "2018 Compensation Decisions" below.
With respect to each of the performance metrics, reaching the Threshold, Target or High achievement level results in a payout of 50%, 100% or 150%, respectively, of the Target award opportunity. Payout amounts between Threshold and Target or Target and High are interpolated. No value is paid for metrics with outcomes below the Threshold achievement level.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ASSESSMENT AND DETERMINATION OF 2018 STIP RESULTS
Target performance hurdles for normalized FFO per share were set at the mid-point of our initial guidance for 2018. With respect to normalized FFO per share, our 2018 performance hurdles were lower than 2017 performance hurdles because our 2018 guidance accounted for management's strategic plans for 2018, including the significant dispositions that were expected to occur during the year, which led to a smaller projected asset base and lower normalized FFO for 2018. We do not publicly disclose guidance for net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA, so the Target performance hurdle was set in relation to our internally budgeted expectations.
The following table reflects the Threshold, Target and High achievement levels established by the Compensation Committee, as well as the relative weighting and outcome of each element of the Company Performance Award:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE-TARGET OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IN A COMPANY PERFORMANCE AWARD PAYOUTS ABOVE TARGET 
    Strong performance in our medical office, life-science and senior housing triple-net segments resulted in overall performance above Target for the Company Performance Award. 
    Payouts are purely formulaic, calculated in accordance with the hurdles established by the Compensation Committee in early 2018. 
    Each metric is paid out separately according to the achievement level—no value is paid for metrics with outcomes below Threshold. Payout amounts between Threshold, Target and High achievement levels are interpolated.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Individual Performance Awards Incentivize Individual Initiative and Achievement
The remaining 40% of the 2018 STIP award was based on an assessment of individual performance and subject to the Company achieving normalized FFO of at least $1.43 per share, which we exceeded. In making award determinations, the Compensation Committee took into consideration the NEO's individual contributions to our financial and operational performance in 2018, as well as their individual accomplishments and performance relative to their objectives for the year. The Committee has discretion to award between 0% and 150% of the NEO's Target individual performance award opportunity.
Below are the individual achievements of our NEOs during 2018 that formed the basis for the Compensation Committee's award determinations:

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OVERALL 2018 STIP RESULTS
The following table summarizes the actual annual incentive awards paid to the NEOs under the 2018 STIP in February 2019 for the 2018 performance period based on the foregoing results and determinations.
The Compensation Committee determined to award Messrs. Herzog, Brinker, Scott and McHenry the maximum level for the individual performance portion of the 2018 STIP award in recognition of each officer's contributions to the Company to execute on our repositioning strategy, strengthen the balance sheet and achieve strong financial results. The Committee determined to award Mr. Klaritch the Target level of the individual performance portion of his 2018 STIP award, recognizing his strong contributions to the Company while balancing his prior compensation adjustments made in connection with his promotion to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer in August 2017. In approving the terms of Mr. McKee's separation agreement and prorated 2018 STIP award, the Committee determined that he would not be eligible to receive any amount for the individual performance portion of the 2018 STIP because he would not meaningfully contribute to the Company's performance for the period.
LONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
All 2018 equity awards were granted in the form of RSUs and PSUs. We have not awarded stock options since 2014.
2018 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
Our NEOs received long-term equity incentive awards under the 2018 LTIP, which awards are subject to the achievement of performance metrics and vesting criteria established by the Compensation Committee near the beginning of the performance period. The 2018 LTIP performance metrics and vesting criteria are illustrated in the graphic below.
Table of Contents
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
60% of the 2018 LTIP award is subject to the Company's relative TSR ranking for the 3-year forward-looking performance period ending December 31, 2020 ("TSR-Based LTIP"), with 40% of the 2018 LTIP award measured against the FTSE NAREIT Equity Health Care Index (the "NAREIT Index") and 20% measured against the S&P 500 REIT Index (the "S&P Index"). The Compensation Committee selected a relative TSR performance metric as the basis for our performance-based LTIP awards because it allows stockholders to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to our peers, as selected by two independent, widely used REIT indexes. It also mitigates the impact of broad market trends that are not reflective of our actual performance.
The remaining 40% of the 2018 LTIP award vests in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. This portion of the 2018 LTIP was subject to a threshold normalized FFO per share hurdle of $1.43 for the 2018 performance year ("Retentive LTIP"). The Compensation Committee believes that the Retentive LTIP awards in the form of RSUs that vest over time independent of TSR promotes the retention of our talented management team, while still incentivizing a focus on long-term results because the ultimate value of the RSUs is tied to our stock price.
2018 LTIP AWARD OPPORTUNITIES
The Compensation Committee, in consultation with FPL Associates, approved target 2018 LTIP opportunities for the NEOs in February 2018, as set forth in the table below. The award opportunities were approved by the Committee based on its assessment of compensation data for peers with substantially similar roles and responsibilities provided by FPL Associates, each NEO's relative duties and responsibilities, and his impact on HCP's results. The table below reflects the target values of the 2018 LTIP awards approved by the Committee. These amounts were divided by the closing price per share on the grant date of the award to determine the number of shares subject to the award (or the target number of shares in the case of the TSR-Based LTIP awards). The amounts reflected in the Grants of Plan Based Awards during 2018 table differ from the amounts below with respect to retentive LTIP awards due to rounding to the nearest whole share, and with respect to the TSR-Based LTIP awards, due to calculating the grant date fair value based on a Monte Carlo valuation model in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Michael D. McKee was not a participant in the 2018 LTIP. Pursuant to the terms of the Severance Plan, under which he was a participant, his equity award remains outstanding subsequent to his termination and vests according to its original terms.
With respect to the TSR-Based LTIP awards, reaching the Threshold, Target or High achievement levels results in a payout of 50%, 100% or 200%, respectively, of the Target award opportunity. Payout amounts between Threshold and High are interpolated. No value is paid for metrics with outcomes below the Threshold achievement levels.
The Company exceeded the normalized FFO hurdle of at least $1.43 per share for the Retentive LTIP, and the first tranche of such awards vested for each of the NEOs in February 2019. The Compensation Committee will make a determination regarding achievement of the TSR-Based LTIP performance criteria following the end of the performance period on December 31, 2020. If the performance period had ended on December 31, 2018, the 2018 TSR-Based LTIP awards would have resulted in an above-Target payout.

2018 COMPENSATION DECISIONS
The Compensation Committee oversees the design and administration of our executive compensation programs and evaluates these programs against competitive practices, legal and regulatory developments and corporate governance trends. The Committee considers analysis and advice from FPL Associates when making compensation decisions. Additionally, our President and CEO provides input to the Committee with respect to compensation decisions for our other executive officers based on market conditions, Company performance, and individual performance.
In establishing 2018 executive compensation, the Compensation Committee recognized that the pay levels for certain of our executive officers was well below the median compensation of similarly situated executives within our compensation peer group. As such, the Committee approved increases in several compensation components for certain of our executive officers, as follows:

TRANSITION AND RETENTION AWARDS
Scott M. Brinker
In connection with his appointment as our Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, Scott M. Brinker was entitled to receive the following compensation, in addition to the base salary and 2018 STIP award as described above:
The Compensation Committee determined that this transition compensation was reasonable and appropriate in light of Mr. Brinker's qualifications and significant experience in the healthcare REIT industry, as well as his duties and responsibilities, the lost financial value he incurred in leaving his former position, and the Company's legal obligation to pay certain amounts under the settlement arrangement with his former employer. Additionally, the Committee believes that granting equity awards with longer-term vesting of six years encourages retention of new executives.
In 2019, Mr. Brinker's regular annual Target-level compensation will be $3,500,000, comprised of the following elements:
Troy E. McHenry
Mr. McHenry was granted a one-time retentive long-term RSU award with an aggregate grant date fair value of $1,000,099, which vests in equal installments over six years beginning on the second anniversary of the grant date, generally subject to Mr. McHenry's continued employment on the applicable vesting date. The Compensation Committee determined that this retention award was reasonable and appropriate in light of Mr. McHenry's continued contributions to the Company in executing on the legal aspects of our strategy and managing extensive legal matters requiring his long-term oversight, as well as his qualifications, duties and responsibilities.
2019 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM CHANGES
Based on prior strong stockholder support for our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee determined not to make any changes to our STIP or LTIP performance metrics or weighting for 2019. The Committee determined to make the following adjustments to our executive compensation program for 2019 to reflect our commitment to sound corporate governance practices:

COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT        We believe that any risks arising from our compensation program are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us for the reasons outlined below. Base salaries are fixed in amount and thus do not encourage inappropriate or excessive risk taking. Our executive incentive compensation balances quantitative and qualitative performance assessments. While our annual cash incentive plan focuses on annual goals, we cap awards under the plan and require a threshold level of Company performance. Only once a pre-determined threshold is met are our executives also eligible for a cash incentive award based on individual performance criteria. This individual performance award may only be reduced from the High achievement level (and not increased) by the Compensation Committee based on any factors it deems appropriate. The Committee believes that the STIP appropriately balances risk and the desire to focus executives on specific annual goals important to our success. A substantial portion of our executives' compensation is in the form of equity awards to further align executive and stockholder interests. The Compensation Committee believes that the LTIP awards do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking because the ultimate value of the awards is tied to our performance and stock price, and because the awards are subject to long-term vesting schedules based on forward-looking performance goals. Additionally, our stock ownership guidelines help ensure that executives have significant value tied to our performance. Furthermore, as discussed below, the executive officers are subject to a clawback policy, which permits us to recover incentive compensation received by such officers in the event the amount of the payment or award was determined based on the achievement of financial results that were subsequently the subject of an accounting restatement due to noncompliance with a financial reporting requirement under securities laws.

POLICY REGARDING EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS   In May 2016, our Board adopted the Severance Plan and amended our Executive Change in Control Severance Plan (the "CIC Plan") (as both are further described under "Potential Payments upon a Termination or Change in Control Severance Arrangements" below) to provide severance protections without the use of individual employment agreements with the Company's executives. Our severance plans, in lieu of contractual arrangements, provide standardized severance benefits for our executives. Our general policy against executive employment agreements also eliminates guaranteed base salaries and incentive levels, which allows the Company to focus on pay for performance and other factors that the Compensation Committee deems relevant in setting executive compensation, without contractual restrictions. 
COMPENSATION CONSULTANT   The Compensation Committee is authorized to retain independent counsel, compensation and benefits consultants, and other outside experts or advisors. Since November 2008, the Committee has retained FPL Associates as its outside independent compensation consultant. For 2018, FPL Associates advised the Committee with respect to trends in executive compensation, determination of pay programs, assessment of competitive pay levels and mix (e.g., proportion of fixed pay to incentive pay and proportion of annual cash pay to long-term incentive pay) and setting compensation levels. FPL Associates also reviewed comparable equity REITs for 2018 and assisted the Committee with obtaining and evaluating current executive compensation data for these companies. The Committee made its 2018 compensation decisions, including those with respect to the NEOs, after consulting with FPL Associates. FPL Associates reports directly to the Compensation Committee and works with management only as directed by the Committee. During 2018, FPL Associates did not perform work for HCP other than pursuant to its engagement by the Committee. The Committee has assessed the independence of FPL Associates and concluded that its engagement of FPL Associates does not raise any conflict of interest with HCP or any of its directors or executive officers.

COMPENSATION ASSESSMENT   In early 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed compensation data for executives at peer companies with positions comparable to those held by the NEOs. This data consisted of base salary, annual cash incentive award and equity award information, as well as total direct compensation paid by each of the peer companies as reflected in their proxy statements and related public filings. Although the Committee reviewed and discussed the compensation data provided by FPL Associates to help inform its decision making process, the Committee does not set or "benchmark" compensation levels at any specific point or percentile against the peer group data. As described above, the peer group data is only one point of information taken into account by the Committee in making compensation decisions. Except as otherwise discussed in our CD&A, with respect to the objective performance criteria that form the basis of our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee's executive compensation decisions for 2018 were subjective and the result of the Committee's business judgment, which is informed by the experiences of the members of the Committee, input and peer group data provided by FPL Associates, and the Committee's overall assessment of executive compensation trends.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
[BEGIN TABLE]
STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES            The Compensation Committee believes that ownership of HCP securities promotes our executives' focus on our long-term business objectives. Our stock ownership guidelines accordingly provide that executives at the level of executive vice president, senior managing director, or higher own minimum levels of common stock and unvested stock awards. All executives are required to achieve their mandatory holdings within five years of the adoption of the program or, as to newly hired or promoted executives, within five years of becoming subject to the guidelines. 
  All of our NEOs who are subject to the stock ownership guidelines currently satisfy the ownership requirements. 
CLAWBACK POLICY   Our Board has adopted a clawback policy that enables us to require reimbursement or cancellation of any portion of a cash or equity incentive award or other payment received by an executive officer in circumstances where the amount of the payment or award was determined based on the achievement of financial results that were subsequently the subject of an accounting restatement due to noncompliance with a financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. 
NO CHANGE-IN- CONTROL TAX GROSS-UPS   None of our NEOs are entitled to a tax gross-up payment in the event they are subject to excise taxes imposed under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 
TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION   Section 162(m) of the Code generally limits the deductibility of compensation paid to our current and former executive officers that exceeds $1 million during the tax year. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Jobs Act") made substantial changes to Section 162(m) of the Code. Pursuant to the Jobs Act, certain awards granted before November 2, 2017, that were based upon attaining pre-established performance measures that were set by the Compensation Committee under a plan approved by our stockholders, as well as amounts payable to former executives pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017, may qualify for an exception to the $1 million deductibility limit. As one of the factors in its consideration of compensation matters, the Compensation Committee notes this deductibility limitation. However, the Committee generally has the flexibility to take any compensation-related actions that it determines are in the Company's and its stockholders best interest, including designing and awarding compensation for our executive officers that is not fully deductible for tax purposes. In addition, we qualify as a REIT under the Code and are not subject to federal income taxes, meaning that the payment of compensation that is not deductible under Section 162(m) does not have a material adverse consequence to us as long as we qualify as a REIT under the Code. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any compensation will in fact be deductible.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES
DESCRIPTION OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS
2014 PLAN
All 2018 awards reported in the above table were granted under, and are subject to, the 2014 Plan, approved by our stockholders on May 1, 2014. The Compensation Committee administers the 2014 Plan and has the authority to interpret its provisions and make all required determinations thereunder.
NON-EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN AWARDS
Our NEOs' 2018 non-equity incentive awards reported in the above table are described under "2018 NEO Compensation—Annual Cash Incentive Compensation" in our CD&A.
EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS
The Grants of Plan-Based Awards During 2018 table above reflects the PSU and RSU awards granted to our eligible NEOs, as described under "2018 NEO Compensation—Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation" and "Transition and Retention Awards" in our CD&A. Each PSU and RSU represents a contractual right to receive one share of our common stock, subject to the applicable time-based and performance-based vesting requirements.
2018 3-Year LTIP PSUs The PSUs granted in respect of the 2018 3-Year LTIP cliff vest, if at all, subject to the achievement of performance criteria (based on forward-looking relative TSR) over a performance period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. If the employment of an NEO terminates due to death, disability or a qualified retirement or if HCP terminates the NEO without cause or the NEO terminates his or her employment for good reason, the PSUs will remain outstanding during the performance period and the eligible NEO will receive the number of units earned, if any, had the NEO remained employed with the Company until the end of the performance period. For each NEO, if there is a change in control of HCP during the performance period, the performance period for the PSUs will be shortened and performance will be determined based on such shortened period and the number of PSUs deemed to have vested based on such shortened period will accelerate and vest in connection with the change in control.
2018 Retentive LTIP RSUs RSUs granted in respect of the 2018 Retentive LTIP vest in equal installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date subject to a performance hurdle related to normalized FFO per share for the 2018 performance period of $1.43, which we exceeded. If the NEO's employment terminates due to death, disability or a qualified retirement or if HCP terminates the NEO without cause or the NEO terminates his or her employment for good reason, the RSUs will fully vest as of the severance date. In the event of a change in control of HCP, the RSUs will be treated in accordance with the CIC Plan.
Other 2018 RSUs In March 2018, Mr. Brinker received a one-time award of RSUs in connection with his commencement of employment. In October 2018, Mr. McHenry received a one-time retention award of RSUs. Both awards vest over six years, beginning on the second anniversary of the grant date, generally subject to the NEO's continued employment as of the applicable vesting date. The RSUs fully vest as of the severance date if the NEO's employment terminates due to death, disability or a qualified retirement or if HCP terminates his employment without cause or he terminates his employment for good reason. In the event of a change in control of HCP, the RSUs will be treated in accordance with the CIC Plan.
Other Terms Vested RSUs and PSUs are payable in an equal number of shares of our common stock. Payment will generally be made as the units vest. The NEO does not have the right to vote or dispose of the units, but does have the right to receive dividend equivalents in the form of cash payments based on the amount of dividends paid by HCP during the term of the award on a number of shares equal to the number of outstanding and unpaid units then subject to the award. Such payments are made concurrently with the related dividends paid to our stockholders. However, dividend equivalents that would otherwise be paid during the applicable performance period with respect to the 2018 3-Year LTIP PSUs will instead accrue and be paid at the end of the performance period based on the number of units actually earned if the related threshold performance requirement for the award is satisfied (and forfeited in whole if the related threshold performance goal is not satisfied). If a change in control of HCP occurs and outstanding equity awards are to be terminated in connection with the transaction and not assumed or continued by an acquiring entity, then the outstanding equity awards will fully vest in connection with such change in control.

The following section describes the benefits that may become payable to our NEOs in connection with a termination of their employment with HCP and/or a change in control of HCP. You should read this section in combination with "Description of Plan-Based Awards—Equity Incentive Awards" above, which describes the treatment of outstanding equity-based awards held by our NEOs upon a termination or change in control of HCP.
SEVERANCE PLANS
EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN
We provide competitive severance benefits to attract and retain key employees with outstanding talent and ability. The Compensation Committee determined that the adoption of the Severance Plan in lieu  of entering into individual employment agreements with our executives was consistent with compensation best practices. Severance benefits are appropriate in light of severance protections available to executives at our peer group companies and are an  important component of each executive's overall compensation as they help us to attract and retain our key executives who could have other job alternatives that may appear to them to be more attractive absent these protections. See "Compensation Policies and Practices—Policy Regarding Executive Employment Agreements" in our CD&A.
Table of Contents
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES
The Severance Plan is intended to provide severance benefits to employees who are selected by the Compensation Committee to participate, including each NEO, upon a termination of employment by us without "cause" (as defined in the Severance Plan) other than in circumstances in which the participant would receive benefits under the CIC Plan (described under "—Executive Change in Control Severance Plan" below), as set forth below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Cash Severance Installment Payments   ■Base salary, plus ■Target level annual cash incentive award for the year of termination
 Lump Sum of Estimated Cost of  Healthcare Coverage   Cash payment in lieu of COBRA premiums for two years 
 Annual Cash Incentive Award   Prorated annual incentive award, payable based on actual performance at time award would have been paid if NEO had not terminated employment 
 Service-Based Equity Awards  ■Stock options fully vested ■RSU awards continue to vest according to their terms for
 24 months, after which any remaining unvested portion will become fully vested
Performance-Based Equity Awards   Continue vesting in accordance with their terms with respect to the performance requirements (although such awards will become fully vested with respect to any time-based vesting requirement) 
[END TABLE]
An NEO's right to receive benefits under the Severance Plan is subject to his or her execution of a general release of claims against us, and his or her agreement to an indefinite confidentiality covenant and 12-month post-termination non-solicitation and non-competition restrictive covenants. Payments (or benefits payable) to an NEO under the Severance Plan will, to the extent applicable, either be reduced to avoid excise taxes under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code or be paid in full (with the NEO paying any such excise taxes), whichever option places the NEO in the best after-tax position.
EXECUTIVE CHANGE IN CONTROL SEVERANCE PLAN
All of our current officers are participants in the CIC Plan. Under the CIC Plan, if a change in control of HCP occurs during the term of the CIC Plan and a participant's employment with HCP is terminated by HCP without cause or by the participant for good reason within the two-year period following the change in control, the participant will generally be entitled to receive the following benefits:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Lump Sum Cash Severance Payment  ■Base salary, plus ■Target level annual cash incentive award for the year of termination
 Lump Sum of Estimated Cost of  Healthcare Coverage   Cash payment in lieu of COBRA premiums for two years (three years for CEO) 
 Annual Cash Incentive Award   Prorated target annual incentive award 
 Retirement Plan Benefits  ■Full vesting of any non-qualified retirement plan benefits ■Cash payment equal to unvested benefits under 401(k)
 Plan
 Service-Based Equity Awards   Full vesting; options remain exercisable for one year (two years for CEO) or upon earlier expiration 
 Performance-Based Equity Awards   Continue vesting in accordance with their terms with respect to the performance requirements, unless otherwise noted in agreement (although such awards will become fully vested with respect to any  time-based vesting requirement)

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES
For these purposes, the terms "cause," "good reason" and "change in control" are each defined in the CIC Plan.

SEVERANCE ARRANGEMENTS
Michael D. McKee
On March 1, 2018, Michael D. McKee's employment with the Company terminated. Mr. McKee was entitled to receive severance benefits pursuant to the Severance Plan, subject to the execution of a general release of claims against the Company. Accordingly, Mr. McKee was entitled to receive cash severance in the amount of $6,003,246 to be paid over 24 months following his separation date. Additionally, Mr. McKee was entitled to receive a prorated 2018 cash incentive bonus payment with respect to the company performance-based portion of his 2018 STIP opportunity, in the amount of $312,490, which was paid to him in February 2019.
Pursuant to the terms of the Severance Plan, as well as the contractual terms of the equity award agreements governing the awards, Mr. McKee's unvested equity awards vest as follows: (i) RSUs granted on May 9, 2016, will remain outstanding and continue to vest and be settled in accordance with the original vesting schedule; (ii) PSUs granted on February 13, 2017, will remain outstanding and may vest and be settled based on the Company's TSR performance during the performance period; and (iii) RSUs granted on February 13, 2017, vested in full upon his departure at a value of $379,125 based on a closing stock price of $21.93 on March 1, 2018, the date the vesting of the RSUs accelerated.
ESTIMATED SEVERANCE AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL BENEFITS
SEVERANCE BENEFITS
The following table presents our estimate of the amount of the benefits to which the NEOs would have been entitled had their employment terminated under the indicated circumstances pursuant to the terms of the Severance Plan on December 31, 2018. The chart assumes that the executive would not be entitled to receive the benefits provided under the CIC Plan in connection with such a termination of employment.
Table of Contents
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES
CHANGE-IN-CONTROL SEVERANCE BENEFITS
The following table presents our estimate of the benefits to which each of the NEOs would have been entitled had a change in control occurred on December 31, 2018 (and, as applicable, the executive's employment with HCP had terminated under the circumstances described above on such date before any excise-tax reduction under our CIC Plan described above).
PAY RATIO
The following pay ratio and supporting information compares the annual total compensation of our CEO and the annual total compensation of our employees other than our CEO, as required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year:
Based on the foregoing, the estimated ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee was approximately 55:1. To determine the pay ratio, we took the steps outlined below.
We determined that as of December 31, 2018, our employee population (excluding our CEO) consisted of 212 individuals, all of whom were located in the United States. This population consists of our full-time and temporary employees, as well as independent contractors for whom we establish compensation. We did not have any seasonal employees. We excluded independent contractors whose compensation is determined by an unaffiliated third party.
To identify the median employee, we computed each employee's annual compensation consisting of annual base salary as well as all cash bonuses and the grant date value of equity awards granted during the year, as applicable. For these purposes, we annualized the base salary and cash bonuses of employees who did not work for us for the entire year, other than temporary employees. We did not make any cost of living adjustments. Of the two employees straddling the median, we selected the employee with the lower annual compensation as our median employee.
Once we identified our median employee, we calculated that employee's annual total compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of the SEC's rules for calculating the "total" compensation of each of our NEOs for 2018 for purposes of the Summary Compensation Table above. With respect to our CEO, we used the amount reported as total compensation in the Summary Compensation table. Any adjustments, estimates and assumptions used to calculate our CEO's total annual compensation are described in the footnotes to the Summary Compensation Table.
This pay ratio is an estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.
Table of Contents
The following table sets forth, for each of the Company's equity compensation plans, the number of shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards, the weighted average exercise price of outstanding options and the number of shares remaining available for future award grants as of December 31, 2018.
Table of Contents
The following table sets forth certain information as of March 4, 2019 (unless otherwise indicated) regarding the beneficial ownership, as that term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, of shares of our common stock by: (i) each person known to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, (ii) each director and nominee for election as director; (iii) each of the NEOs and (iv) all current directors and executive officers as a group. This table is based on Company records and information supplied to us by our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders or included in a Schedule 13G, or an amendment thereto, filed with the SEC.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS, DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of our equity securities to file reports of initial ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our equity securities with the SEC. Based on a review of the reports furnished to us, as well as the written responses to annual directors' and officers' questionnaires, where applicable, we believe that during 2018 all reports they were required to file under Section 16(a) were timely filed.

AUDITOR EVALUATION AND APPOINTMENT
Our Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm that audits the Company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has appointed Deloitte to continue to serve as HCP's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. Deloitte has served as HCP's independent registered public accounting firm since March 3, 2010.
The Audit Committee annually reviews Deloitte's performance and independence in deciding whether to engage a different independent registered public accounting firm. In the course of these reviews, the Committee considers, among other things:
[BEGIN TABLE]
■  Deloitte's independence from the Company and management, including any factors that may impact Deloitte's objectivity 
■  Deloitte's qualifications and capability in handling all aspects of the Company's operations 
■  The desired balance of Deloitte's experience and fresh perspective occasioned by mandatory audit partner rotation 
■  The experience, qualifications and performance of our existing audit engagement team 
■  Any issues raised by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's ("PCAOB") most recent quality control review of Deloitte 
■  The quality and candor of Deloitte's communications with the Committee and management 
■  Deloitte's quality control procedures 
■  The quality and effectiveness of Deloitte's historical and recent audit plans and performance on our audit 
■  The advisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent public accounting firm 
[END TABLE]
Following this review, the Audit Committee believes that Deloitte's continued engagement as our independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company for the following reasons:
Enhanced audit quality. Through years of experience, Deloitte has gained significant institutional knowledge of our business and operations, accounting policies and practices, and internal control over financial reporting.
Effective audit plans and efficient fee structures. Deloitte's knowledge of our business and control framework enables it to design effective audit plans that cover key risk areas while capturing cost efficiencies in audit scope and internal control testing.
Maintaining continuity avoids disruption. Bringing on a new auditor, without reasonable cause, would require extensive education and a significant period of time for the new auditor to reach a comparable level of knowledge and familiarity with our business and control framework.
Thorough Committee oversight. The Audit Committee believes that any concerns with Deloitte's tenure are mitigated by the Audit Committee's oversight, which includes ongoing engagement with Deloitte and a comprehensive annual review process.
Robust pre-approval policies and limits on non-audit services. The Audit Committee must preapprove all audit and non-audit services performed by Deloitte, including the types of services to be provided and the estimated fees relating to those services.
Deloitte's strong internal independence procedures and regulatory framework. Deloitte conducts periodic internal quality reviews of its audit work and rotates lead partners every five years. Deloitte is also subject to PCAOB inspections, peer reviews, and PCAOB and SEC oversight.

AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT FEES
The following table shows information about the respective fees billed by Deloitte during or related to the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands).
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Audit fees include fees and out-of-pocket expenses billed for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, the review of interim consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and other SEC registration statement and consent services. 
(2)  Audit-related fees include fees for the separate audits of our consolidated subsidiaries. 
(3)  Tax compliance fees primarily involve the preparation or review of tax returns. 
(4)  Tax planning and tax advice fees encompass a diverse range of services, including tax advice related to acquisitions and investments, consultation regarding the impact of proposed actions/activities on REIT qualification, and consultation regarding the foreign, federal, state and local tax issues related to various transactions. 
[END TABLE]
POLICY ON PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND PERMITTED NON-AUDIT SERVICES
Pursuant to its charter and good corporate governance practices, the Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit and permitted non-audit services performed by Deloitte and all related fees. The Audit Committee has delegated its pre-approval authority to its Chair, provided that the Chair presents any pre-approvals related to audit and permitted non-audit services to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee considered whether the provision of proposed non-audit services by Deloitte to the Company was compatible with maintaining the audit firm's independence and concluded that Deloitte's independence was not compromised by the provision of such services and pre-approved all services provided by Deloitte in 2018 and 2017.
VOTING STANDARD
We are asking our stockholders to ratify the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Ratification requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on this proposal at the Annual Meeting.
Although ratification is not required by our organizational documents or otherwise, our Board is submitting the appointment of Deloitte to our stockholders as a matter of good corporate governance practices. If the appointment is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company.
A representative of Deloitte is expected to attend the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement and be available to respond to appropriate questions.

   Our Board unanimously recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee currently consists of four members: Messrs. Rhein (Chair) and Griffin and Mses. Garvey and Kennard. The Board has determined that all Audit Committee members are independent under applicable NYSE and SEC rules and, other than Ms. Kennard, all are financial experts.

The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. Management has the primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal financial controls, preparing the financial statements and the public reporting process. Deloitte, the Company's independent registered accounting firm for 2018, is responsible for expressing opinions on the conformity of the Company's audited consolidated financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and Deloitte the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, Deloitte's evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting significant accounting policies and practices and management judgments and estimates. The Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees" issued by the PCAOB.

In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte any relationships that may impact its objectivity and independence and satisfied itself as to Deloitte's independence.
Based on the Audit Committee's review of the audited consolidated financial statements and the review and discussions described in the foregoing paragraph, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, be included in the Annual Report, as filed with the SEC.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
HOW YOUR SHARES WILL BE VOTED
Your shares will be voted as you specify in your proxy or voting instructions. Although our Board does not know of any business to be considered at the Annual Meeting other than the three proposals described in this proxy statement, if any other business properly comes before the Annual Meeting, a stockholder's properly submitted proxy gives authority to the proxy holder to vote on those matters in his or her discretion. If you are a stockholder of record and properly submit a proxy but do not specify your voting choice on one or more of the items listed in the notice of meeting, your shares will be voted as recommended by our Board on those items.
