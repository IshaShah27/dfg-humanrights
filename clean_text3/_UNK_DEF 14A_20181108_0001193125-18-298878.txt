CYTODYN INC. 
PROXY STATEMENT 
2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of CytoDyn Inc., a Delaware corporation ("CytoDyn" or the "Company"), to be voted at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held on November 8, 2018 (the "Annual Meeting"), and any postponements or adjournments thereof. The proxy statement and accompanying form of proxy were first mailed to stockholders on or about October 15, 2018. 
VOTING, REVOCATION, AND SOLICITATION OF PROXIES 
Solicitation of Proxies. The enclosed proxy is solicited by and on behalf of the Board, with the cost of solicitation borne by the Company. Solicitation may also be made by directors and officers of the Company without additional compensation for such services. In addition to mailing proxy materials, the directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies in person, by telephone or otherwise. 
The Company has also retained Alliance Advisors LLC to assist it in the solicitation of proxies. Alliance Advisors LLC will solicit proxies on behalf of the Company from individuals, brokers, bank nominees and other institutional holders in the same manner described above. Alliance Advisors LLC will receive a fee of $7,500, plus approved and reasonable out of pocket expenses, for its services to the Company for the solicitation of the proxies. The Company has also agreed to indemnify Alliance Advisors LLC against certain claims. 
Voting. You may submit a proxy to have your shares of common stock voted at the Annual Meeting in one of three ways: (i) completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid envelope; (ii) calling toll-free at the telephone number indicated on the enclosed proxy card; or (iii) using the Internet in accordance with the instructions set forth on the enclosed proxy card. When a proxy is properly returned, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions specified in the spaces provided in the proxy. If no instructions are specified, the proxies will be counted for purposes of determining whether or not a quorum is present, and will be voted FOR the election of all nominees for director, as well as "FOR" Proposals 2, 3 and 4. If a stockholder of record attends the Annual Meeting, he or she may vote in person. If you hold shares through a broker or nominee (that is, in "street name"), please follow their directions on how to vote your shares. 
Banks and brokers acting as nominees are permitted to use discretionary voting authority to vote proxies for proposals that are deemed "routine" by the New York Stock Exchange, but are not permitted to use discretionary voting authority to vote proxies for proposals that are deemed "non-routine" by the New York Stock Exchange. The determination of which proposals are deemed "routine" versus "non-routine" may not be made by the New York Stock Exchange until after the date on which this proxy statement has been mailed to you. As such, it is important that you provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, if you wish to determine the voting of your shares. If the New York Stock Exchange determines such proposal to be "non-routine," failure to vote, or to instruct your broker how to vote any shares held for you in your broker's names will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal 2. 
A broker "non-vote" occurs when a proposal is deemed "non-routine" and a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not have discretionary voting authority with respect to the matter being considered and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. 
If you have additional questions, need assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares of common stock, or need additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact Alliance Advisors LLC.  Alliance Advisors LLC 
200 Broadacres Drive, 3rd Floor, Bloomfield, NJ 07003 
(833) 814-9456 
Revocation of Proxies. Proxies may be revoked by written notice delivered in person or mailed to the Secretary of the Company or by submitting a later-dated proxy prior to a vote being taken at the Annual Meeting. Attendance at the Annual Meeting alone may not be sufficient to revoke a previously submitted proxy. If you hold shares through a broker or nominee (that is, in "street name"), please follow their directions on how to revoke previously submitted instructions relating to your shares. 
OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES AND QUORUM 
Stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 12, 2018, are entitled to one vote at the Annual Meeting for each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Common Stock"), of the Company then held by each stockholder. As of that date, the Company had 248,400,949 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. The presence, in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote constitutes a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will be considered present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the Annual Meeting. 
VOTES REQUIRED 
Pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the Company's Bylaws, the seven nominees for election as directors at the Annual Meeting who receive the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected, provided that a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. Pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Proposal 2 must be approved by a majority of the outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote on the proposal. Proposals 3 and 4 will be approved if a quorum exists and the votes cast favoring the proposal exceed the votes cast opposing the Proposal. 
SUMMARY TERM SHEET 
The following is only a summary of certain material information contained in this document. You should carefully review this entire document along with the exhibits attached hereto to understand the proposals fully. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Time and Place of Annual Meeting (See cover page, Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders):  Thursday, November 8, 2018 at 9:30 a.m., Pacific Time, at the Hilton Portland Downtown, 921 S.W. 6th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97204.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Record Date (See page 2): You can vote at the Annual Meeting if you owned Common Stock of CytoDyn Inc. at  the close of business on September 12, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposals to be Voted on (See Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders): Matters to be presented for  action at the meeting include (i) the election of directors, (ii) a proposal to increase the total number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 450,000,000 shares to 600,000,000 shares, (iv) ratification of the selection of  the Company's auditors and (v) a non-binding advisory vote to approve executive compensation as described in this proxy statement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reasons for the Increase in Authorized Shares (See page 29): The primary reasons for the increase in  authorized shares of Common Stock are to have sufficient shares available for possible future financings, acquisition transactions, joint ventures and other general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares of Common Stock to ProstaGene,  LLC ("ProstaGene") in connection with the Company's acquisition of certain ProstaGene assets, in each case as further described in this proxy statement under Proposal 2.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Effect of Approving the Increase in Authorized Shares (See pages 30): If the increase in authorized shares  of Common Stock is approved, the authorized shares of the Company will be increased from 450,000,000 shares to 600,000,000 shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Effect of Not Approving the Increase in Authorized Shares (See page 30): If the increase in authorized  shares proposal fails to obtain the vote required for approval, the number of shares authorized for issuance by the Company will remain at 450,000,000 shares of Common Stock. If this occurs, the Company may be limited in its ability to issue shares  of its Common Stock to complete future financings, acquisition transactions, joint ventures and other general corporate purposes.  
[END TABLE]
Further, as described in this proxy statement under Proposal 2, if the increase in authorized shares proposal fails to obtain the vote required for approval, the Company would become obligated to issue shares of convertible preferred stock in lieu of Common Stock as consideration in the ProstaGene transaction. The shares of preferred stock would contain a redemption right for cash, commencing on June 30, 2019, based upon the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the trading day before the closing of the ProstaGene transaction. Assuming a redemption price equal to the closing price of $0.54 on October 11, 2018, the potential dollar amount for such a redemption obligation would be approximately $14.6 million, increasing or decreasing by $270,000 for each $0.01 increase or decrease in such stock price prior to the trading day before the closing of the ProstaGene transaction. The Company may not be able to finance such a redemption obligation at the time when it comes due. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other Proposals: At the Annual Meeting you will also be asked to consider proposals to elect directors,  ratify the selection of the Company's auditors and approve, on an advisory basis, executive compensation.  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote Required (See page 2): Pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the  Company's Bylaws, the seven nominees for election as directors at the Annual Meeting who receive the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected, provided that a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. Pursuant to the General  Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Proposal 2 must be approved by a majority of the outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote on the proposal, and Proposals 3 and 4 will be approved if a quorum exists and the votes cast  favoring the Proposal exceed the votes cast opposing the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• How to Vote Your Shares (See page 1): Complete, date and sign the enclosed proxy card and mail it in the  enclosed return envelope, or submit your proxy by telephone or the Internet as instructed on the enclosed proxy card, as soon as possible, so that your shares may be represented at the Annual Meeting.

(833) 814-9456  PROPOSAL 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The directors will be elected at the Annual Meeting to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are elected and qualify. The Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws authorize the Board to set the number of directors of the Company. The number of directors is currently seven. During periods between annual stockholder meetings, vacancies on the Board, including vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of positions, may be filled by the Board for a term ending with the next annual meeting of stockholders and when a successor is duly elected and qualifies. 
Denis R. Burger, Ph.D. and A. Bruce Montgomery, M.D. resigned as members of the Company's Board, effective on July 11, 2018. To fill one of the vacancies created by these resignations, Michal A. Klump was appointed to the Board, effective August 11, 2018. Mr. Klump's term ends on the date of the Annual Meeting and he will stand for re-election at the Annual Meeting. Effective August 22, 2018, the Board took action to reduce the size of the Board from eight directors to seven directors, thereby eliminating the other vacancy created by these resignations.

The seven nominees for election as directors at the Annual Meeting who receive the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected, provided that a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders are not permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors. Votes may be cast for or withheld from the directors as a group, or from any individual nominee. Shares that are not represented at the Annual Meeting, shares that are withheld and broker non-votes, if applicable, will have no effect on the outcome of the election. 
The Board recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" each of the nominees named below to serve as a director. If for some unforeseen reason a nominee should become unavailable for election, the proxy may be voted for the election of such substitute nominee as may be designated by the Board. 
The following table sets forth information with respect to each person nominated for election as a director, including their current principal occupation or employment and age as of September 12, 2018.

MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
The Board held 16 meetings in fiscal year 2018. During fiscal year 2018, each current director attended at least 75 percent of the total number of the meetings of the Board and the meetings held by each committee of the Board on which he served during his tenure on such committee or the Board. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board believes that the Board leadership structure, which reflects the separation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions, serves the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Board believes that the manner in which it oversees risk management at the Company has not affected its leadership structure. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Company's management is responsible for identifying, assessing and managing the material risks facing the Company. The Board generally oversees risk management practices and processes and, either as a whole or through the Audit Committee and other board committees, periodically discusses with management strategic and financial risks associated with the Company's operations, their potential impact on the Company, and the steps taken to manage these risks.  While the Board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight, the Board's committees assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk. In particular, the Audit Committee focuses on financial and enterprise risk and discusses with management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the Company's policies and practices with respect to risk and particular areas of risk exposure. The Nominating and Governance Committee oversees recruitment of potential director nominees and succession planning for the Company's executive positions. The Compensation Committee monitors the Company's incentive compensation programs to assure that management is not encouraged to take actions involving excessive risk. 
Code of Ethics 
The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics as well as a Code of Business Conduct and an Insider Trading Policy. Copies of these governing documents, as well as the committee charters described below, are available on the Company's website at www.cytodyn.com. 
Director Independence 
In determining director independence, the Company uses the definition of independence in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the "NASDAQ Rules"). The Board has determined that Mr. Dockery, Mr. Gould, Dr. Kelly, Mr. Naydenov, and Mr. Klump are independent under the NASDAQ Rules in that each is not, and has not been, an executive officer or employee and does not otherwise have a relationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with his exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. 
The Company is not a "listed issuer" as that term is used in Regulation S-K Item 407 adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee Charter was adopted by the Board and became effective on November 2, 2011, and was subsequently updated on February 21, 2017. The primary role of the Audit Committee is to oversee the financial reporting and disclosure process. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the work done by the Company's independent auditors and reviewing and discussing with management and the independent auditors the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's financial reporting process, the annual audited financial statements, and the results of the annual audit. The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing and approving in advance all contemplated related-party transactions such as those described under "Related Person Transactions" below. The Audit Committee held five meetings during fiscal year 2018 to review the Company's financial statements with the auditors following the end of each fiscal quarter prior to their inclusion in reports filed with the SEC. During fiscal year 2018, the members of the Audit Committee were Mr. Gould (chair), Mr. Dockery, Dr. Kelly and Dr. Montgomery. Mr. Gould is a "financial expert" as defined in Regulation S-K Item 407(d)(5)(ii) adopted by the SEC. During fiscal year 2018, Mr. Gould, Mr. Dockery, Dr. Kelly and Dr. Montgomery also met the additional independence and experience requirements of the SEC applicable specifically to members of the Audit Committee. 
Dr. Montgomery resigned from the Audit Committee at the same time he resigned from the Board. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee Charter was adopted by the Board in October 2012 and was updated on May 29, 2014, February 21, 2017, and May 17, 2018. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the Company's overall compensation philosophy and determines base salaries and other forms of compensation to be paid to executive officers, including decisions as to cash incentive compensation, grants of options and other stock-based awards. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for making recommendations to the Board with respect to new compensation plans, including incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans. The Compensation Committee held four meetings during fiscal year 2018. During fiscal year 2018, the members of the Compensation Committee were Dr. Montgomery (chair), Mr. Dockery, Mr. Gould, Dr. Kelly and Mr. Naydenov.  Dr. Montgomery resigned from the Compensation Committee at the same time he resigned from the Board. 
Nominating and Governance Committee 
The Company's Nominating and Governance Committee Charter was adopted by the Board on October 26, 2012, and was subsequently updated on February 21, 2017 and February 19, 2018. The Nominating and Governance Committee identifies individuals qualified to become members of the Board, makes recommendations to the Board with regard to the size and composition of the Board and committees thereof, and evaluates the Board and its members. The Nominating and Governance Committee also assists the Board in developing succession and continuity plans for principal officer positions. The Nominating and Governance Committee held three meetings during fiscal year 2018. During fiscal year 2018, the members of the Nominating and Governance Committee were Mr. Dockery (chair), Mr. Gould, Dr. Kelly, Dr. Montgomery, and Mr. Naydenov. 
Dr. Montgomery resigned from the Nominating and Governance Committee at the same time he resigned from the Board. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee does not have any specific, minimum qualifications for director candidates. In evaluating potential director nominees, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider among other factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• demonstration of ethical behavior;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• positions of leadership that demonstrate the ability to exercise sound judgment in a wide variety of matters;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the candidate's ability to commit sufficient time to the position;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the candidate's understanding of the Company's business and operations; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the need to satisfy independence requirements relating to Board composition.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Governance Committee relies on annual evaluations of the Board in determining whether to recommend nomination of current directors for re-election. The Nominating and Governance Committee has not hired a third-party search firm to date, but has the authority to do so if it deems such action to be appropriate. It has a policy in place for considering diversity in identifying nominees for director.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Preliminary Note 
Pursuant to applicable SEC regulations, the information presented in this section relates to the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, and the one additional most highly compensated "executive officer" (as this term is defined in the regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The Company believes that in fiscal year 2018, three individuals met these criteria, as follows (these individuals are referred to throughout this Compensation Discussion and Analysis as "named executive officers"): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nader Z. Pourhassan, Ph.D., the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Michael D. Mulholland, the Company's Chief Financial Officer; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Anthony D. Caracciolo, the Company's Chairman of the Board.  
[END TABLE]
As disclosed elsewhere in this proxy statement, effective July 11, 2018, Mr. Caracciolo resigned as Executive Chairman of the Company, which was is an executive officer position, and continues to serve as a Board member and the non-executive Chairman of the Board. 
Introduction 
In this section, the Company presents the principles underlying its named executive officer compensation decisions and the most important factors that the Company believes are relevant to an analysis of these decisions. The goal is to provide qualitative information regarding the manner and context in which compensation is awarded to and earned by the named executive officers and to place in perspective the numerical and other quantitative data presented in the tables and other information that follow this section. 
The Company has designed the compensation of its named executive officers in order to attract, as needed, individuals with the skills necessary for the Company to achieve its business plan, to reward those individuals fairly over time, and to retain those individuals who perform at or above expectations.  The Company's named executive officers' annual cash and stock compensation consists of several components, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annual incentive compensation paid upon satisfaction of certain performance objectives; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• grants of incentive stock options, where the incentive stock options vest over a period of time or pursuant to  the attainment of set performance goals and unvested stock options are forfeited to the Company should the executive officer's employment be terminated, provided that certain grants of incentive stock options provide for accelerated vesting  under certain circumstances.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews the compensation, both cash and stock, of the named executive officers on an annual basis, while taking into account changes in compensation during previous years. 
Some of these components, such as base salary, are generally fixed and do not vary based on the Company's financial and other performance; some components, such as annual cash incentive compensation, are in part dependent upon the achievement of certain individual performance and corporate performance objectives jointly agreed upon by the Company's management and the Compensation Committee; and some components, such as incentive stock option awards, have a value that is dependent upon the Company's stock price at the time of award and going forward. 
The Company compensates its named executive officers in these different ways in order to achieve different goals. Cash compensation, for example, provides the named executive officers with a guaranteed minimum base salary. The Company fixes the base salary of each named executive officer at a level that the Company believes enables it to hire and retain individuals in a competitive environment and rewards successful individual performance and a successful level of contribution to the Company's overall business goals. The Company also takes into account the base salaries paid by similarly-situated companies and the base salaries of other private and public companies, with which the Company believes it competes for talent. However, the Company does not formally benchmark base salaries paid to the named executive officers against the executive compensation of any other particular company or competitive peer group of companies. 
Annual incentive bonus compensation is generally linked to the achievement of short-term operational, strategic or financial objectives, and is intended to reward the named executive officers for their performance in reaching goals that are agreed in advance between management and the Compensation Committee. The Company designs the cash incentive bonuses for each named executive officer to focus the named executive officer on achieving key objectives within a fiscal year, as described in more detail below. The Company has and may continue in the future to make such bonus payments in cash and stock awards. 
Grants of incentive stock options are intended to link the named executive officers' longer-term compensation with the performance of the Company which has a strong correlation to the value of the Company's stock, which is consistent with enhancing stockholder value. This encourages the named executive officers to remain with the Company, to act in ways intended to maximize stockholder value, and to reduce or eliminate the value of their incentive stock options if the Company stock fails to perform. These grants are intended to produce significant value for each named executive officer, if the Company achieves its goals and if the named executive officer remains with the Company, provided that certain grants of incentive stock options provide for accelerated vesting under certain circumstances. 
The Company views the three components of named executive officer compensation as related, but distinct. Although the Compensation Committee does review total compensation, the Company does not believe that compensation derived from one component of compensation should negate or reduce compensation from other components. The Company determines the appropriate level for each compensation component based in part, but not exclusively, on its view of internal equity and consistency, individual performance and other information the Company deems relevant. Except as described below, the Compensation Committee has not adopted any formal or informal policies or guidelines for allocating compensation between long-term and currently paid-out compensation, between cash and non-cash compensation, or among different forms of compensation. This is due to the small size of the named executive officer team and the need to tailor each named executive officer's award to attract and retain that named executive officer.  In addition, the Company provides the named executive officers with benefits that are generally available to the Company's salaried employees. 
The Compensation Committee performs an annual review of the Company's named executive officers' cash compensation and incentive stock option holdings to determine whether they provide competitive compensation for the services they perform, as well as adequate incentives and motivation to the named executive officers and whether they adequately compensate the named executive officers relative to comparable officers in other companies. The Compensation Committee's most recent review occurred in May 2018. 
For compensation decisions, including decisions regarding the grant of equity compensation relating to named executive officers, the Compensation Committee typically considers the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board. 
The Company accounts for the equity compensation expense for its employees under the rules of ASC 718, which requires the Company to estimate and record an expense for each award of equity compensation over the service period of the award. Accounting rules also require the Company to record cash compensation as an expense at the time the obligation is accrued. The Company structures cash incentive bonus compensation so that it is taxable to Company employees at the time it is paid to them. It is not anticipated that the deduction of any compensation paid to any named executive officer will be limited by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Compensation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Risk Management 
In fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company's compensation policies and practices and concluded that the mix and design of these policies and practices are not reasonably likely to encourage the Company's employees to take excessive risks, and that the Company's compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In connection with its evaluation, the Compensation Committee considered, among other things, the structure, philosophy and design characteristics of the Company's primary incentive compensation plans and programs in light of the Company's risk management and governance procedures, as well as other factors that may calibrate or balance potential risk-taking incentives. In particular, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company's compensation programs for certain design features that have been identified by experts as having the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking, including long term incentive compensation value that is driven entirely by increases in stock price, and low compensation levels exacerbated by performance-driven awards not paying out; including both annual bonus and long term incentive compensation, and noted that these are not substantial factors in the Company's executives' compensation packages. 
Equity Compensation 
At the May 2018 meetings of the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee analyzed the current incentive stock option holdings of the Company's named executive officers and others, and determined that the level of equity stake of the named executive officers was at market for companies of similar size and experience as a public company. 
The Company does not have any program, plan or obligation that requires the Company to grant equity compensation to any named executive officer on specified dates. The authority to make equity grants to named executive officers rests with the Company's Compensation Committee, although, as noted above, the Compensation Committee does consider the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer in setting the compensation of the other named executive officers. 
Annual Incentive Bonuses 
Annual cash incentive bonuses for the named executive officers are established as part of their respective individual employment agreements. Each of these employment agreements provides that the named executive officer is eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus in an amount determined in the discretion of the Board, with a maximum bonus amount specified for each named executive officer in their respective employment agreements.  The actual amount of each bonus is based upon the Compensation Committee's subjective determination of each executive officer's performance and contribution towards satisfying predetermined individual performance and corporate objectives. The corporate objectives are established in the discretion of the Compensation Committee on a yearly basis. Based on the Company's status as a non-revenue generating biotechnology company, examples of the individual performance and corporate objectives used by the Compensation Committee in its determination of whether to award an annual incentive bonus include, among others, trial enrollment and timelines with the FDA, financing, timely SEC filing and reporting, management, leadership and maintaining stockholder relationships. 
Each named executive officer's level of achievement of the individual performance and corporate performance objectives are determined by the Compensation Committee with the input of each named executive officer. The annual bonuses paid to the Company's named executive officers, if such is awarded, are payable in cash, or, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, 50% in cash and 50% in unrestricted shares of Common Stock, subject to the availability of shares under the 2012 Equity Compensation Plan, as amended. The maximum cash incentive bonus amount for each of the Company's named executive officers is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name of Named Executive Officer     Title     Minimum Bonus     Maximum Bonus 
 Name of Named Executive Officer     Title     Minimum Bonus     Maximum Bonus 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  Resigned as Executive Chairman as of July 11, 2018  
[END TABLE]
In addition to the Annual Incentive Bonus, the Chief Executive Officer is also eligible to receive a supplemental bonus. Whether the Chief Executive Officer is awarded a supplemental bonus, and the amount of any such supplemental bonus, is in the sole discretion of the Board. When determining whether or not to grant a supplemental bonus for a fiscal year, the Board may, but is not be required to, consider any unanticipated achievement of corporate objectives for such fiscal year.
The Company's named executive officers were eligible to receive annual incentive bonuses for services during fiscal year 2018. The maximum target bonus amounts were based on the named executive officer's base salary and were set by the named executive officer's employment agreement, as follows: Dr. Pourhassan, 100% of base salary, or $433,888, and Mr. Mulholland, 50% of base salary, or $173,813. Mr. Caracciolo was not eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus for fiscal year 2018. 
Upon the Compensation Committee's review of the Company's and each named executive officer's performance against the predetermined individual corporate objectives during fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee determined to award Dr. Pourhassan $216,944, and to award Mr. Mulholland $147,741. No annual incentive bonus was paid to Mr. Caracciolo for fiscal year 2018. 
An executive must remain employed by the Company through the date of the Committee's determination of performance to be eligible to receive annual incentive payouts. The cash component of the incentive compensation will be paid upon the improved liquidity of the Company. 
The actual value of such incentive payouts are shown in the "Bonus" column in the Summary Compensation Table below. 
Benefits 
Employees, including executive officers, may participate in the Company's 401(k) defined contribution plan. The Company makes a safe harbor contribution of 3% to all eligible employees, which vests immediately. Eligible participants may make an election to defer up to the annual allowable amount per Section 402(g) in effect at the beginning of each taxable year. One executive contributed to the 401(k) defined contribution plan in 2018.  Perquisites 
The Company's use of perquisites as an element of compensation is very limited and is largely based on historical practices and policies of our company. The Company does not view perquisites as a significant element of the Company's comprehensive compensation structure, and while the Company believes that they can be used in conjunction with base salary to attract, motivate and retain individuals in a competitive environment, the Company is careful to review them periodically and to keep them at the lowest level possible consistent with industry practice. 
Effect of Stockholder Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
Of the 76,703,357 shares that voted (this number excludes the 1,614,021 shares that abstained from voting and 30,606,699 broker non-votes) on the advisory vote on executive compensation at the 2017 Annual Meeting, approximately 79% of the shares that voted approved of the Company's executive compensation policies and decisions. The Company has considered the results of this vote. From 2017 to 2018, the total amount of compensation paid to the Company's executive officers increased by approximately 3.6%. The Compensation Committee and entire Board intend to continue careful review of the compensation programs and policies to assure that the compensation remains consistent with the Company's philosophy and objectives as stated above and reflective of the Company's financial performance.

 Additional Compensation Information 
Employment Agreements 
On January 6, 2015, the Company entered into employment agreements with Dr. Pourhassan and Mr. Mulholland (together, the "Employment Agreements"). The Employment Agreements provide for indefinite terms of employment, until terminated by either party pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreements. 
The Employment Agreements provide for (i) an annual base salary of $325,000 for Dr. Pourhassan and $250,000 for Mr. Mulholland, (ii) a target annual bonus payable in cash or, at the discretion of the Board, 50% in cash and in 50% in Common Stock, for Dr. Pourhassan equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of base salary and fifty percent (50%) for Mr. Mulholland, subject to achievement of certain performance objectives, and (iii) an annual supplemental bonus for Dr. Pourhassan, subject to the sole discretion of the Board, in an amount to be determined by the Board. 
Payments upon Termination of Employment or Change of Control 
In the event the Company terminates either Dr. Pourhassan's or Mr. Mulholland's employment without cause, as defined in the Employment Agreements, and subject to execution of a release of claims, the Employment Agreements provide for (i) payments equal to the sum of twelve months of base salary (except that such amount shall not be payable if, as of the effective time of Dr. Pourhassan's or Mr. Mulholland's termination, as applicable, the Board determines either that the Company has less than $4.0 million in cash-on-hand, or that the net worth of the Company, defined as the total assets of the Company less the total liabilities of the Company, is less than $5.0 million), and (ii) all stock options and other awards that Dr. Pourhassan or Mr. Mulholland may have shall vest and (if applicable) become immediately exercisable. 
In the event the Company terminates Dr. Pourhassan's or Mr. Mulholland's employment without cause, or Dr. Pourhassan or Mr. Mulholland resigns for good reason, as defined in the Employment Agreements, within twelve months following a change in control, as defined in the Employment Agreements, and subject to execution of a release of claims, the Employment Agreements provide for (i) payments equal to the sum of eighteen months of base salary (in lieu of, and not in addition to, the twelve months' base salary that may be payable upon a termination without cause not within twelve months following a change in control), and (ii) all stock options and other awards that Dr. Pourhassan or Mr. Mulholland may have shall vest and (if applicable) become immediately exercisable. 
Employee stock options granted after December 1, 2012, vest in full automatically when a change in control occurs; employee stock options granted before December 1, 2012, will vest in full if the Compensation Committee so decides on or before the date a change in control occurs. 
The following table shows potential pay-outs under the Employment Agreements as of May 31, 2018, assuming that employment was terminated following a change in control of the Company, either by the Company for reasons other than cause, death or disability, or by the executive for good reason, and that termination occurred on that date. The table shows the value of issued and outstanding stock options that were not vested as of May 31, 2018, but would become exercisable in full upon a change in control of the Company, whether or not the executive's employment is terminated.

 Pay Ratio Disclosure 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of the SEC's Regulation S-K, the Company is providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of its employees and the annual total compensation of the CEO. For the year ended May 31, 2018, the last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual total compensation of the CEO was $966,561.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median of the annual total compensation of all employees, based on our median employee identified under the  methodology described below, was $339,058.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The resulting ratio of the CEO's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our median  employee was approximately 3 to 1.  
[END TABLE]
The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate, calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K and based on the Company's internal records. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratios reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio stated above. 
The Company completed the following steps to identify the median of the annual total compensation of its employees and to determine the annual total compensation of its median employee and its CEO: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• On May 31, 2018, the date the Company used to determine its ratio calculation, the Company's employee  population consisted of seven full time equivalents ("FTE"), all of whom are located in the United States. Six of the FTE's are salaried employees and one is an hourly administrative staff.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To find the median of the annual total compensation of the individuals, other than the CEO, in the Company's  employee population as described above, the Company used wages from its payroll records as reported on the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018. In making this determination, the Company  annualized the compensation of the hourly staff who was employed at May 31, 2018, but who did not work as an employee of the Company for the entire fiscal year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• After identifying the median employee, the Company added together all of the elements of that employee's  compensation for fiscal year 2018 in accordance with the requirements applicable to calculating annual total compensation for the purpose of the Summary Compensation Table above.  
[END TABLE]
For the annual total compensation of the Company's CEO, the Company used the amount reported for the CEO in the "Total" column for 2018 in the Summary Compensation Table above.  RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
Review of Related Person Transactions 
The Audit Committee has the primary responsibility for monitoring, reviewing and approving transactions with related parties. A "related person" is any person who is or was an executive officer of the Company, director or is a holder of more than 5% of the Company's common stock, or their immediate family members or any entity owned or controlled by any of the foregoing persons. 
The Board has adopted a policy providing that the Audit Committee will review and approve or ratify transactions in excess of $120,000 of value in which the Company participates and in which a director, executive officer or beneficial holder of more than 5% of any class of the Company's voting securities has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Under this policy, the Audit Committee is to obtain all information it believes to be relevant to review and approve or ratify these transactions. 
After consideration of the relevant information, the Audit Committee is to approve only those related party transactions that the Audit Committee believes are on their terms, taken as a whole, no less favorable to the Company than could be obtained in an arms-length transaction with an unrelated third party and that the Audit Committee determines are not inconsistent with the Company's best interests. In particular, the Company's policy with respect to related party transactions requires the Audit Committee to consider the benefits to the Company, the impact on a director's independence in the event the related person is a director, an immediate family member of a director or an entity in which a director has a position or relationship, the availability of other sources for comparable products or services, the terms of the transaction and the terms available to unrelated third-parties or to employees generally. 
Participation in Investor Offerings 
Between May 31, 2017 and July 28, 2017, in connection with a private offering to third-party investors, the Company issued to a trust for which Mr. Caracciolo is trustee, to Mr. Naydenov, and to Alpha Venture Capital Partners, L.P., an investment entity of which Mr. Dockery is a director and principal, respectively, $1,000,000, $100,000 and $50,000 in aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible promissory notes (the "Convertible Notes").

The offering terms for the limited liability company were identical to those for all other investors in the offering and are summarized in the Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 8, 2017. 
On January 31, 2018, in connection with a private offering to investors in the Convertible Notes described above, the Company issued, for a price of $0.50 per share and related warrants, (i) to the trust for which Mr. Caracciolo is trustee, 2,093,972 shares of common stock and a warrant covering 1,333,334 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.75, (ii) to Mr. Naydenov, 207,248 shares of common stock and a warrant covering 133,334 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.75, and (iii) to Alpha Venture Capital Partners, L.P., 103,586 shares of common stock and a warrant covering 66,667 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.75 per share. The common stock and warrants were issued in full satisfaction of the Company's cash payment obligations relating to the Convertible Notes, which had matured on the same date. The offering terms for the trust, Mr. Naydenov and Alpha Venture Capital Partners, L.P. were identical to those for all other investors in the offering and are summarized in the Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 31, 2018.

 PROPOSAL 2 
PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE COMPANY'S AUTHORIZED CAPITAL TO 600,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK 
The Board believes it is in the best interest of the Company to increase the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance by 150,000,000 shares of Common Stock, bringing the total number of shares of Common Stock authorized from 450,000,000 shares to 600,000,000 shares. These shares do not offer any preemptive rights. The text of the proposed certificate of amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation is attached hereto as Exhibit A. This proposal to increase the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance, if approved at the Annual Meeting, will become effective and the Company's number of shares of authorized Common Stock will be increased to 600,000,000 shares upon the filing of the certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the certificate of amendment, which is attached to this proxy statement as Exhibit A and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Reasons for the Increase 
The Board believes that it is desirable to have sufficient authorized shares of Common Stock available for future financings to raise the capital needed to operate its business, and for possible additional future acquisition transactions, joint ventures and other general corporate purposes. The Board believes that having such authorized shares of Common Stock available for issuance in the future will give the Company greater flexibility and may allow such shares to be issued without the expense and delay of an additional special stockholders' meeting. Although such issuance of additional shares with respect to future financings and acquisitions would dilute existing stockholders, management believes that such transactions would increase the overall value of the Company to its stockholders. There are certain advantages and disadvantages of an increase in authorized Common Stock. The advantages include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The ability to raise additional capital by issuing capital stock under the type of transactions described above,  or other financing transactions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To have shares of Common Stock available to finance the Company's ongoing operating capital requirements to  advance the Company's lead product candidate, PRO 140, towards regulatory approval, and to pursue other potential business expansion opportunities, if any.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To allow the Company to issue shares of Common Stock as consideration in the ProstaGene transaction, in lieu of  shares of Series C Preferred Stock, which would become redeemable for cash commencing on June 30, 2019, as described under the heading "ProstaGene Acquisition" below.  
[END TABLE]
The disadvantages include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stockholders will experience further dilution of their ownership.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stockholders do not have any preemptive or similar rights to subscribe for or purchase any additional shares of  Common Stock that may be issued in the future, and therefore, future issuances of Common Stock may, depending on the circumstances, have a dilutive effect on the earnings per share, voting power and other interests of existing stockholders of the  Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The additional shares of Common Stock for which authorization is sought in this proposal would be part of the  existing class of Common Stock and, if and when issued, would have the same rights and privileges as the shares of Common Stock presently outstanding. The Company intends to use the proceeds from any future capital raises for working capital and  general corporate purposes. Other than as disclosed under the heading "ProstaGene Acquisition" below, the Company has no arrangements, agreements, or understandings in place at the present time, for the issuance or use of the additional  shares of Common Stock to be authorized by the proposed Certificate of Amendment. However, the Company has recently conducted certain private offerings of common stock and warrants, and the Company will continue to require additional capital in the  near future to fund its operations. As a result, it is foreseeable that the Company will seek to issue such additional shares of Common Stock in connection with any such capital raising activities. The Board does not intend to issue any Common Stock  or securities convertible into Common Stock except on terms that the Board deems to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The issuance of authorized but unissued stock could be used to deter a potential takeover of the Company that may  otherwise be beneficial to stockholders by diluting the shares held by a potential suitor or issuing shares to a stockholder that will vote in accordance with the Board's desires. A takeover may be beneficial to independent stockholders  because, among other reasons, a potential suitor may offer such stockholders a premium for their shares of stock compared to the then-existing market price. The Company does not have any plans or proposals to adopt provisions or enter into  agreements that may have material anti-takeover consequences.  
[END TABLE]
Although an increase in the authorized shares of Common Stock could, under certain circumstances, have an anti-takeover effect, this proposal to adopt the amendment is not in response to any effort, of which the Company is aware, to accumulate Common Stock or obtain control of the Company. Nor is it part of a plan by management to recommend a series of similar amendments to the Board and stockholders. Other than as disclosed under the heading "ProstaGene Acquisition" below, the Company has no arrangements, agreements, or understandings in place at the present time to enter into any merger, consolidation, acquisition or similar business transaction. 
If the Company's stockholders do not approve the increase in authorized shares of Common Stock, then the Company will be limited in its ability to use shares of Common Stock for financing, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes. As of October 11, 2018, the Company only had 20,007,001 shares of Common Stock authorized and unreserved for issuance, which would be available for such purposes. 
ProstaGene Acquisition 
On August 27, 2018, the Company entered into a Transaction Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits attached thereto, the "Acquisition Agreement") with ProstaGene, LLC ("ProstaGene") and Dr. Richard G. Pestell ("Dr. Pestell" and, together with ProstaGene, the "Sellers"), the founder and a principal equity holder of ProstaGene, pursuant to which the Company agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions stated therein, to purchase from the Sellers substantially all of the assets and rights, and to assume certain obligations and liabilities, associated with ProstaGene's business (the "ProstaGene Acquisition"). The closing of the ProstaGene Acquisition is anticipated to occur in or around November 2018. 
Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, in order to achieve certain tax efficiencies, prior to consummating the ProstaGene Acquisition, the Company will reorganize into a holding company pursuant to Section 251(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. As part of the holding company reorganization, the holding company will become the successor to the Company for all purposes, including under applicable securities laws. As a result, for purposes of the following description, all references to the Company and its Common Stock shall refer, as the case may be, either to CytoDyn Inc. and its Common Stock, before the holding company reorganization, or to the holding company and its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, following the holding company reorganization. Stockholder approval of the holding company reorganization is not required. 
As consideration for the ProstaGene Acquisition, under the Acquisition Agreement, the Company is obligated to issue to ProstaGene for distribution to its equity holders either (i) an aggregate of 27,000,000 shares of Common Stock or (ii) an aggregate of 270,000 shares of Series C preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Series C Preferred Stock"). The Series C Preferred Stock would automatically convert into an aggregate of 27,000,000 shares of Common Stock upon stockholder approval of an increase in the authorized shares of Common Stock. Whether Common Stock or Series C Preferred Stock is issued therefore depends on whether the stockholders of the Company have previously approved an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to sufficiently increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, as specified in this proposal. 
If stockholders do not approve the increase in authorized shares of Common Stock pursuant to this proposal, then the Company will issue Series C Preferred Stock Consideration at the closing of the ProstaGene Acquisition. As specified in the Acquisition Agreement, the Series C Preferred Stock would be required to contain a redemption right for cash, commencing on June 30, 2019, based upon the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the trading day before the closing of the ProstaGene Acquisition. Assuming a redemption price equal to the closing price of $0.61 on September 6, 2018, the potential dollar amount for such a redemption obligation would be approximately $16.5 million, increasing or decreasing by $270,000 for each $0.01 increase or decrease in such stock price prior to the trading day before the closing of the ProstaGene Acquisition. 
The Company may not be able to finance such a redemption obligation at the time when it comes due, which could materially and adversely impact the Company's ability to operate its business. In extreme cases, the Company could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection, discontinue its operations or liquidate its assets. Even if the Company were able to finance such redemption obligation, redeeming the Series C Preferred Stock for cash would not permit such cash to be spent on other activities, including clinical trials, contract manufacturing organization or other activities that could materially delay the timeframe to submission of a biological license application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
For these reasons, the Board believes that any use of funds to pay for such redemption obligation would not be in the best interests of the Company's stockholders, and the Board recommends that stockholders vote for this proposal.  If stockholders do not approve the increase in the authorized shares of Common Stock authorized by this Proposal 2, then the Company will issue NewCo Series C Preferred Stock at the closing of the ProstaGene Acquisition. As specified in the form of certificate of designation attached as Exhibit B to the Acquisition Agreement, the NewCo Series C Preferred Stock would contain a redemption right for cash, commencing on June 30, 2019, based upon the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the trading day before the closing of the ProstaGene Acquisition. Assuming a redemption price equal to the closing stock price for the Common Stock on October 11, 2018, the potential dollar amount for any such a redemption obligation would be approximately $14.6 million, increasing or decreasing by $270,000 for each $0.01 increase or decrease in such stock price prior to the trading day before the closing of the ProstaGene Acquisition. 
The Company may not be able to finance such redemption obligation at the time when it comes due, which could materially and adversely impact the Company's ability to operate its business. In extreme cases, the Company could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection, discontinue its operations or liquidate its assets. Even if the Company were able to finance such redemption obligation, redeeming such shares of NewCo Series C Preferred Stock for cash would not permit such cash to be spent on other activities, including clinical trials, contract manufacturing organization or other activities that could materially delay the timeframe to submission of a biological license application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For these reasons, the Board believes that any such use of funds would not be in the best interests of the Company's stockholders. 
Preferred Stock 
Whether or not the Company's stockholders approve the increase in authorized shares of Common Stock pursuant to this proposal, the Company will still have 4,600,000 (or 4,330,000, after giving effect to the potential issuance of preferred stock in the ProstaGene transaction) undesignated shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, available for issuance in one or more series. The Board has the authority, within the limitations and restrictions prescribed by law and without stockholder approval, to provide by resolution for the issuance of shares of preferred stock, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference and the number of shares constituting any series of the designation of such series, by delivering an appropriate certificate of amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to the Delaware Secretary of State pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of the Common Stock, impeding or delaying a possible takeover and adversely affecting the voting and other rights of the holders of the Company's Common Stock. 
Approval Required 
Pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, this proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company entitled to vote on the proposal. Shares that are not represented at the Annual Meeting and abstentions and, if this proposal is deemed to be "non-routine" as described above under "Voting, Revocation and Solicitation of Proxies," broker non-votes with respect to this proposal will have the same practical effect as a vote against this proposal. 
The Board recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to increase the Company's authorized capital to 600,000,000 shares of Common Stock.  PROPOSAL 3 
RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has selected Warren Averett, LLC ("Warren Averett") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to examine the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2019. Although the selection of independent auditors is not required to be submitted to a stockholder vote by the Company's governance documents or applicable law, the Board has decided to ask the stockholders to ratify the selection. If the stockholders do not approve the selection of Warren Averett, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection. 
Provided that a quorum is present, this proposal will be approved if the number of shares voted in favor of the proposal exceeds the number of shares voted against. Shares that are not represented at the Annual Meeting, and abstentions and broker non-votes, if applicable, with respect to this proposal, will have no effect on the outcome of the voting on this proposal. 
The Board recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" ratification of the selection of Warren Averett, LLC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019.  PROPOSAL 4 
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") included a provision that requires public companies to hold an advisory stockholder vote to approve or disapprove the compensation of their named executive officers. The Dodd-Frank Act also included a provision providing stockholders of a public company the opportunity to vote, on an advisory basis, on how frequently they would like the company to hold an advisory vote on the compensation of executive officers. At the 2013 annual meeting, the Company's stockholders approved the Board's recommendation that an advisory vote on executive compensation be conducted annually. Accordingly, the Company is conducting an advisory vote to approve the compensation of the Company's executive officers again this year. 
A detailed description of the compensation paid to executive officers is included in this proxy statement under the heading "Executive Compensation" in accordance with the SEC's rules. 
The Company's philosophy is that executive compensation should align with stockholders' interests, without encouraging excessive and unnecessary risk. During fiscal year 2018, the main components of executive compensation, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement, included (i) base salary, (ii) bonus based on the Compensation Committee's assessment of each executive officer's performance in achieving corporate and individual goals, and (iii) employee stock options. This vote is intended to consider the overall compensation of executive officers and the policies and practices described in this proxy statement. 
This vote is advisory and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee, or the Board. The Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of stockholders and will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
The Board recommends that stockholders vote, on an advisory basis, "FOR" the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K adopted by the SEC, including the executive compensation tables and accompanying footnotes and narrative discussion, is hereby approved." 
The above-referenced disclosures appear under the heading "Executive Compensation" in this proxy statement. 
Provided that a quorum is present, this proposal will be approved if the number of shares voted in favor of the proposal exceeds the number of shares voted against. Shares that are not represented at the Annual Meeting, and abstentions and broker non-votes, if applicable, with respect to this proposal, will have no effect on the outcome of the voting on this proposal.
