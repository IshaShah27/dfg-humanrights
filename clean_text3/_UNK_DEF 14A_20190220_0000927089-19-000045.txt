[BEGIN TABLE]
 ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS  
[END TABLE]
General.  This                       proxy statement is furnished to holders of common stock of Prudential Bancorp, Inc., referred to as the "Company" or "Prudential Bancorp," the parent holding company of Prudential Bank, referred to as "Prudential Bank" or the "Bank."  Our                   Board of Directors is soliciting proxies to be used at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held at the administrative offices of Prudential Bank, located at 3993 Huntingdon Pike, Suite 300, Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, on                   Wednesday, February 20, 2019 at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Time, and any adjournment thereof, for the purposes set forth in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders. This proxy statement is first being mailed to shareholders on or                   about January 18, 2019.
Important                         Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Shareholder Meeting to Be Held on February 20, 2019.  This proxy statement and our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K are available through our website at                   www.psbanker.com under the "Investor Relations" Quick Link.
What is the purpose of the annual meeting?
At our annual meeting, shareholders will act upon the matters outlined in the attached notice of meeting                   consisting of the proposals to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● elect one director for a three-year term expiring in 2022;  
● adopt a non-binding resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers;  
● consider an advisory vote on the frequency of the presentation of future non-binding resolutions on the compensation of our named executive officers; and  
● ratify the appointment of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Who is entitled to vote?
Only our shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date for the annual meeting,                   December 31, 2018, are entitled to vote at the meeting. On the record date, we had 8,892,964 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and no other class of equity securities outstanding.  For each issued and outstanding share of                   common stock you own on the record date, you will be entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted on at the meeting, in person or by proxy.
How do I submit my proxy?
After you have carefully read this proxy statement, indicate on your proxy form how you want your shares to                   be voted.  Then sign, date and mail your proxy form in the enclosed prepaid return envelope as soon as possible.  You may also vote over the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on your proxy card or voting instruction                   form. This will enable your shares to be represented and voted at the annual meeting. If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, could my broker automatically vote my shares?
Your broker may not vote on the election of directors and proposals one and two if you do not furnish               instructions for each of such proposals.  You should use the voting instruction form or broker card provided by the institution that holds your shares to instruct your broker to vote your shares or else your shares will be considered "broker               non-votes."
Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers or nominees as to which voting instructions have not been received               from the beneficial owners or the persons entitled to vote those shares and the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power under rules applicable to broker-dealers. Under these rules, proposal one, the election of directors,               proposal two, the non-binding proposal to approve the compensation of our named executive officers and proposal three, the advisory vote on the frequency of non-binding proposals to approve the compensation of our named executive officers are               not items on which brokerage firms may vote in their discretion on behalf of their clients if such clients have not furnished voting instructions.
Your broker may vote in his or her discretion on the ratification of the appointment of our independent               registered public accounting firm if you do not furnish instructions.
Can I attend the meeting and vote my shares in person?
All shareholders are invited to attend the annual meeting.  Shareholders of record can vote in person at the               annual meeting.  If your shares are held in "street name," then you are not the shareholder of record and you must ask your broker or other nominee about how you can vote at the annual meeting.
Can I change my vote after I return my proxy card?
Yes.  If you are a shareholder of record, there are three ways you can change your vote or revoke your proxy               after you have sent in your proxy card.
[BEGIN TABLE]
● First, you may complete and submit a new proxy card or vote over the Internet or by telephone before the annual meeting.  Any earlier                            proxies will be revoked automatically.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Second, you may send a written notice to our Corporate Secretary, Ms. Sharon M. Slater, Prudential Bancorp, Inc., 1834 West Oregon                            Avenue, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19145, in advance of the annual meeting stating that you would like to revoke your proxy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Third, you may attend the annual meeting and vote in person.  Any earlier proxy will be revoked.  However, attending the annual meeting                            without voting in person will not revoke your proxy.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in street name and you have instructed a broker or other nominee to vote your shares,               you must follow directions you receive from your broker or other nominee on how to change your vote.
What constitutes a quorum?
The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of votes that all shareholders               are entitled to cast on a particular matter will constitute a quorum.  Proxies received but marked as abstentions and broker non-votes will be included in the calculation of the number of votes considered to be present at the meeting. What are the Board of Directors' recommendations?
The recommendations of the Board of Directors are set forth under the description of each proposal in this                   proxy statement.  In summary, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the one nominee for director described herein, FOR the non-binding resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, FOR EVERY THREE YEARS on the advisory vote on the                   frequency of the non-binding resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers and FOR ratification of the appointment of                   S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.
The proxy solicited hereby, if properly signed and returned to us and not revoked prior to its use, will be                   voted in accordance with your instructions.  If no contrary instructions are given, each proxy signed and received will be voted in the manner recommended by the Board of Directors and, upon the transaction of such other business as may                   properly come before the meeting, in accordance with the best judgment of the persons appointed as proxies. Proxies solicited hereby may be exercised only at the annual meeting and any adjournment of the annual meeting and will not be                   used for any other meeting.
What vote is required to approve each item?
The election of directors will be determined by a plurality of the votes cast at the annual meeting.  The                   one nominee for director receiving the most "For" votes will be the director for a three-year term expiring in 2022, and until his successor is elected and qualified.  The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shareholders                   entitled to vote at the annual meeting is required for approval of the proposal to ratify the appointment of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 and to                   approve the non-binding resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers.  The frequency of the advisory vote on the non-binding resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers receiving the                   greatest number of votes (either every three years, every two years or every year) will be the frequency that shareholders approve.  Under the provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, abstentions and broker non-votes do                   not constitute votes cast and will not affect the vote required for the proposals to ratify the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and the non-binding resolution approving the compensation of our named                   executive officers.

Election of Directors (Proposal One)
Our Articles of Incorporation provide that the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes as                   nearly equal in number as possible.  The directors are elected by our shareholders for staggered terms and until their successors are elected and qualified.  Generally, one class is elected annually. At this annual meeting, you will be                   asked to elect one director for a three-year term expiring in 2022 and until his successor is elected and qualified.
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has recommended the re-election of Mr. A.J. Fanelli as a                   director.  No director is related to any other director or executive officer by blood, marriage or adoption.  Shareholders are not permitted to use cumulative voting for the election of directors.  Our Board of Directors has determined                   that Messrs. Fanelli, Hosier, Miller and Mulcahy are independent directors as defined in the Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards.
Unless otherwise directed, each proxy signed and returned by a shareholder will be voted for the election                   of the nominee for director listed below.  If the person named as a nominee should be unable or unwilling to stand for election at the time of the annual meeting, the proxies will nominate and vote for a replacement nominee or nominees                   recommended by our Board of Directors.  At this time, the Board of Directors knows of no reason why the nominee may not be able to serve as a director if elected. The following tables present information concerning our nominees for director and our continuing directors, all of whom               also serve as directors of Prudential Bank.  Ages are reflected as of September 30, 2018.

**        Chairman
Audit Committee.                The Audit Committee reviews with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the systems of internal control, reviews the annual financial statements, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K, and monitors Prudential               Bancorp's adherence in accounting and financial reporting to generally accepted accounting principles.  The Audit Committee is comprised of four directors, each of whom is an independent director as defined in the Nasdaq Stock Market listing               standards and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Fanelli meets the definition of Audit Committee financial expert, as such term is defined in the rules of the               Securities and Exchange Commission.  In addition, each of the other members of the Audit Committee has had significant involvement in financial matters. The Audit Committee met five times in fiscal 2018.     Compensation Committee. It is the                 responsibility of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to, among other things, oversee Prudential Bancorp's compensation and incentive arrangements for management. No member of the Compensation Committee is a current or former officer or employee of Prudential Bancorp, Prudential Bank or any subsidiary and all members are independent as defined in                 the Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards. Each of the members is independent as defined in the Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards.  The Compensation Committee held five meetings in fiscal 2018 to consider management compensation                 matters.
Nominating and                   Corporate Governance Committee.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews and makes nominations for the Board of Directors, which are then sent to the full Board of Directors for their ratification.  Each of the                 members is independent as defined in the Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met once in                 fiscal 2017 to select nominees for the 2018 Annual Meeting and once so far in fiscal 2019 to select the nominees to be presented at this annual meeting.
Board Leadership Structure
Mr. Pollack serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Bruce E. Miller serves as Chairman of                 the Board.  The board of directors has determined that the separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board and President enhances board independence and oversight.  Further, the separation of the Chairman of the Board permits the                 President and Chief Executive Officer to better focus on his responsibilities on managing the daily operations of the Company, enhancing shareholder value and expanding and strengthening our franchise while allowing the Chairman to lead the                 board of directors in its fundamental role of providing independent oversight and advice to management.  The Chairman also serves as a liaison between the Board of Directors and executive management. Mr. Miller is an independent director                 under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Board's Role in Risk Oversight
Risk is inherent with every business, particularly financial institutions. We face a number of risks,                 including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, strategic risk and reputational risk.  Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks that Prudential Bancorp faces, while the Board of                 Directors, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management.  In its risk oversight role, the Board of Directors ensures that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management                 are adequate and functioning as designed.
One of our current senior executive officers, Mr. Pollack, serves on our Board of Directors.  Other members                 of our senior management regularly attend meetings of the Board of Directors and are available to address any questions or concerns raised by the Board of Directors on risk management or other matters.  Prudential Bank has established an                 Asset-Liability Committee, a Loan Quality Committee, a Management Loan Committee and an Investment Committee composed of members of senior management.  The independent directors work together to provide strong, independent oversight of                 Prudential Bancorp's management and affairs.
Directors' Attendance at Annual Meetings
Directors are expected to attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders absent a valid reason for not doing so.                 All of our directors attended the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held in February 2018. Directors' Compensation
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the compensation paid to our non-employee                   directors during fiscal year 2018.

Board fees are subject to periodic adjustment by the Board of Directors. For                   fiscal 2019, the special meeting fees will remain the same as for fiscal 2018.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
Determinations regarding compensation of our President and Chief Executive Officer, our senior management                   and our employees are reviewed and approved by Prudential Bancorp's Compensation Committee.  Messrs. Fanelli, Hosier, who is the Committee's Chairman, Miller and Mulcahy, currently serve as members of the Compensation Committee.
No person who served as a member of the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2018 was a current or former                   officer or employee of Prudential Bancorp or Prudential Bank or engaged in certain transactions with Prudential Bancorp or Prudential Bank required to be disclosed by regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Additionally, there were no Compensation Committee "interlocks" during fiscal 2018, which generally means that no executive officer of Prudential                   Bancorp served as a director or member of the compensation committee of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director or member of Prudential Bancorp's Compensation Committee.
Director Nominations
Recommendations for nominations of persons to serve as directors of Prudential Bancorp are made by the                   Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors and are approved by the entire Board.  The Board of Directors adopted a written charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee which is available on our                   website at www.psbanker.com.

(1)  Represents discretionary bonuses earned in each fiscal year reflected and which were paid, with respect to fiscal years 2018 and 2017, prior to the end of                              fiscal year. Bonuses were discretionarily determined based on Company performance as well as individual performance.  
(2)  Reflects the grant date fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for awards of restricted stock and stock options that were granted during fiscal year                              2018 and fiscal year 2017. The valuation of the restricted stock awards granted in fiscal year 2018 is based on a grant date fair value of $18.46 per share. The assumptions used in valuing the stock option awards granted in                              fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017 are set forth in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018.  
(3)  Includes for fiscal 2018 an automobile allowance ($9,750) and club dues ($16,000) for Mr. Pollack. Also includes the amount of the matching contribution under                              the Bank's 401(k) plan for fiscal 2018 for each of the named executive officers.  
(4)  Includes the fair market value on December 31, 2016 of the 2,796 shares allocated for plan year 2016 to the employees stock ownership plan ("ESOP") account of                              Mr. Migliorino based on a value of $17.12 per share on December 30, 2016 (last trading day of 2016). As of such date, Messrs. Gallagher and Pollack were not participants in the ESOP. The ESOP was terminated effective December                              31, 2016.  
(5)  Mr. Gallagher was appointed Senior Vice President and Chief Lending Officer effective January 1, 2017. Consequently, Mr. Gallagher's salary data for fiscal                              2017 only reflects nine months of salary.

Narrative to Summary Compensation Table
Base salaries as well as bonuses, if any, for our named executive officers (as well as all other executive                 officers) are determined and approved by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee, in its role as the administrator of the Company's stock benefit plans, also determines whether to award equity incentive awards and if so, the                 amount and form of such awards (stock options and/or restricted share awards). In accordance with the Committee's practices and procedures, the Committee annually reviews executive officers' compensation in order to address appropriate                 adjustments, if any, to such persons' base compensation as well as to consider awarding bonuses to such officers.  Consistent with the methodology adopted in connection with the annual compensation reviews conducted in fiscal years 2016 and                 2017, the analysis of potential bonuses consists of an assessment by the Compensation Committee both of the Company's overall financial performance over the past year or more, as appropriate, as well as the performance of the individual                 officer under consideration.  With respect to executive officers, especially the named executive officers, the Committee determined that individual performance and its effect on the Company's performance is still the most relevant factor to                 be considered in determining both salary adjustments and bonus awards.  Consistent with the revised methodology the Committee initially adopted in August 2016, the Committee reaffirmed its determination that years of service is not                 considered a relevant factor for purposes of analyzing potential adjustments to the compensation of executive officers' salaries and bonuses. In addition, in connection with its deliberations,  the Committee considered a number of factors                 including the salary adjustments effected in fiscal years 2016 and  2017 and the level of bonuses awarded in such years, in particular with respect to bonuses, the level of bonuses awarded in fiscal 2017.  The Committee also analyzed the                 appropriateness of the level of current salaries of the Company's executive officers, especially when reviewed in light of peer group data. As a result of the foregoing considerations, modest adjustments to each of the named executive officer's salary in the range of 2% to 3%                 were deemed appropriate in light of both such officers' performances over the past year and the role they played in the Company's significantly improved operational performance.  Furthermore, in keeping with the Committee's philosophy to                 maintain flexibility with regard to compensation and to reward exceptional performance, the Committee determined to recognize and reward the various executive officers' roles in the Company's materially improved performance through the use                 of bonuses rather than significant upward adjustments of salaries.  Consequently, the Compensation Committee established salaries for fiscal 2019 for Messrs. Pollack, Migliorino and Gallagher of $400,000, $290,000 and $164,000,                 respectively, which amounted to increases of 3% for each of such officers.  In addition, discretionary bonuses amounting to $200,000, $130,000 and $20,000 were awarded to Messrs. Pollack, Migliorino and Gallagher, respectively, based on                 Prudential Bancorp's materially improved performance during fiscal 2018 and the individual officer's roles in producing such improved performance.
During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee granted equity awards to the named executive officers as                   well as to other officers. During fiscal 2017, the Committee had determined to only address cash compensation (salaries and bonuses), postponing considering potential equity grants to senior management until at least the Company's fiscal                   2017 operating results were available since the amounts and composition of such awards are very much related to the Company's performance.  Furthermore, a number of the senior officers, including Mr. Pollack, had not served for the entire                   2016 fiscal year and thus the Committee wanted to have the benefit of the results of fiscal 2017 operating performance as part of its review of the potential for equity grants to such persons.  Since the grant of equity awards in February                   2015 shortly after receipt of shareholder approval of the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan ("2014 SIP"), equity awards had subsequently been used on a case-specific basis generally to reflect either the recent hiring of an executive officer or                   in connection with the promotion of an executive officer. However, in light of the Company's significant improvement in profitability during fiscal 2016 and 2017, which continued in fiscal 2018, which improvement reflected the efforts of                   senior management, in particular, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, the Committee, determined in March 2018 to award grants of equity to Messrs. Pollack, Migliorino and                   Gallagher. Accordingly, stock options, incentive stock options to the extent possible, covering 80,000, 45,000 and 30,000 shares were awarded to Messrs. Pollack, Migliorino and Gallagher, respectively. In addition, restricted stock awards                   in the amounts of 12,500, 7,500 and 3,000 shares were also awarded to Messrs. Pollack, Migliorino and Gallagher, respectively. All of such awards, both options and restricted stock awards, vest pro rata at the rate of 20% per year                   commencing in March 2019.
At the annual meeting of stockholders of Prudential Bancorp held on February 11, 2013, the stockholders                   recommended, on an advisory basis, that future advisory votes on executive compensation should be held every three years. Consistent with the stockholder recommendation, the Board of Directors of the Company determined that it will hold                   an advisory vote on executive compensation every three years. The next advisory vote on the compensation of the named executive officers is being presented at this annual meeting as described in this proxy statement. Prudential Bancorp is                   required to hold stockholder advisory votes on the frequency interval every six years.  As a consequence, at this annual meeting stockholders are being asked to consider the frequency of such advisory votes on executive compensation. Compensation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Risk Management
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed the Company's policies and practices               applicable to employees, including the Company's benefit plans, arrangements and agreements, and does not believe that they are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The Committee does not believe that the               Company's policies and practices encourage officers or employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks or behavior focused on short-term results rather than the creation of long-term value.

Employment and Change in Control Agreements
Employment Agreements.  Prudential Bank and Prudential Bancorp entered into an amended and restated employment agreement in December 2016 with Mr.                 Pollack as well as an employment agreement with Mr. Migliorino. The amended and restated agreement with Mr. Pollack increased the term of the agreement and the severance benefits (as discussed below) as well as his compensation in view of                 the Compensation Committee's determination that his performance and value to the Company warranted such enhanced provisions. The employment agreement with Mr. Migliorino superseded the change in control agreement he had previously entered                 into with the Bank in November 2015 and reflected the Compensation Committee's determination that his continued employment was critical to the Bank's and Company's ongoing performance.     The employment agreements have a term of three years, with respect to Mr. Pollack, and two years, with respect to Mr. Migliorino with the initial terms expiring, if the agreements are not extended, on December 31,                   2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The term is extended annually for one year on each December 31st starting December 31, 2017 unless either the Company and the Bank or the executive gives notice at least 30 days prior                   to the annual anniversary date that the agreement shall not be extended. The Compensation Committee determined in October 2018 to extend the terms of the executives' employment agreements for an additional year. The agreements are                   automatically extended for one year upon a change in control. The terms of the employment agreements provide for an initial annual base salary, which is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Each of                   the employment agreements is terminable with or without cause by the Company or the Bank. The executives have no right to compensation or other benefits pursuant to the employment agreements for any period after voluntary termination by                   the executive without good reason, as defined in the agreements and which includes, among other things, a material change in the officer's position, salary or entities without the officer's consent, or termination by the Bank for cause,                   disability, retirement or death.
In the event that the executive terminates his employment because of failure to comply with any material                   provision of the employment agreement by the Company or the Bank or the employment agreement is terminated by the Company or the Bank other than for cause, disability, retirement or death, Messrs. Pollack and Migliorino will be entitled                   to (i) the payment of two times (Mr. Pollack) and one times (Mr. Migliorino), respectively, the executive's respective average annual cash compensation (salary and cash bonuses) based upon the five calendar years preceding the date of                   termination as cash severance, (ii) the maintenance until the earlier to occur of the passage of two years and one year, respectively, from the date of termination or until the executive's full time employment with another employer (which                   provides substantially similar benefits), of the executive's continued participation in all group insurance, life insurance, health, dental and accident insurance and disability insurance plans at no cost to the officer and (iii) a lump                   sum cash payment equal to the projected cost of providing the executive with benefits for two years, or one year in the case of Mr. Migliorino, pursuant to other employee benefit plans (excluding retirement plans and stock compensation                   plans) in which the executive was entitled to participate. In the event the executive's continued participation in any group insurance plan is barred or would trigger the payment of an excise tax under Section 4980D of the Code, or if any                   such group insurance plan is discontinued, then the Company or the Bank shall either (1) provide substantially similar benefits under an alternative plan or (2) pay a lump sum cash amount to the executive equal to the projected cost of                   providing continued coverage to the executive until the two-year, or one-year in the case of Mr. Migliorino, anniversary of the executive's date of termination.
In the event that the executive's employment is terminated in connection with a change in control, as                   defined in the employment agreements, for other than cause, disability, retirement or death or the executive terminates his employment as a result of certain adverse actions which are taken with respect to the executive's employment                   (i.e., good reason) following a change in control, as defined, the executive will be entitled to a cash severance payment equal to three times (Mr. Pollack), or two times (Mr. Migliorino) their respective average annual cash compensation,                   the maintenance, as described above, of the group insurance plans for three years (Mr. Pollack) or two years (Mr. Migliorino), respectively, or until the executive's full-time employment with another employer that provides similar                   benefits plus the aforementioned lump sum cash payment for the projected cost of providing the other employee benefits as noted above until the third anniversary (Mr. Pollack) or second anniversary (Mr. Migliorino) of the executive's                   termination.
The employment agreements with respect to Pollack and Migliorino previously provided that in the event any                   of the payments to be made thereunder or otherwise upon termination of employment are deemed to constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, then such payments and benefits received thereunder shall be                   reduced by the minimum amount necessary to result in no portion of the payments and benefits being non-deductible by the Company or the Bank for federal income tax purposes. In November 2017, the Company, and the Bank entered into                   amendments to each of the employment agreements with Messrs. Pollack and Migliorino addressing the applicability of Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code. The agreements were revised to provide that if the payments that were otherwise                   payable to Mr. Pollack or Mr. Migliorino, as applicable, in connection with a termination after the occurrence of a change in control would trigger the imposition of an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, such amounts would be                   required to be reduced only if doing so would result in a greater tax amount to be retained by Mr. Pollack or Mr. Migliorino, as applicable.     Change in Control Agreement.  The Bank entered into a change in control severance agreement in March 2018 with Mr. Gallagher. The change in control agreement is intended to assist the Bank                 (and indirectly the Company) in maintaining a stable and competent management base. The change in control severance agreement has an initial term                 ending December 31, 2019 if the term of the agreement is not extended. The term is extended annually for one year on each December 31st starting December 31, 2019 unless either the Bank or the executive gives notice at least 30                 days prior to the annual anniversary date that the agreement shall not be extended. The agreement automatically extends for one year upon a change in control. The Bank has entered into substantially identical change in control severance                 agreements with three other officers including Mr. Rothkopf, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Mr. Gallagher's agreement provides that in the event of an involuntary termination of employment without                 cause and other than for retirement, death or disability following a change in control (including a termination by the executive for "good reason," which includes a material change in the executive's position, salary or duties without his                 consent), the executive will be entitled to (i) the payment of one times his average annual cash compensation (salary and cash bonuses) based upon the five calendar years preceding the date of termination as cash severance, (ii) the                 maintenance until the earlier to occur of the passage of one year from the date of termination or until his full time employment with another employer (which provides substantially similar benefits) of the executive's continued                 participation in all group insurance, life insurance, health, dental and accident insurance and disability insurance plans at no cost to the officer and (iii) a lump sum cash payment equal to the projected cost of providing him with                 benefits for one year pursuant to other employee benefit plans (excluding retirement plans and stock compensation plans) in which he was entitled to participate. In the event Mr. Gallagher's continued participation in any group insurance                 plan is barred or would trigger the payment of an excise tax under Section 4980D of the Code, or if any such group insurance plan is discontinued, then the Bank shall either (1) provide substantially similar benefits under an alternative                 plan or (2) pay a lump sum cash amount to him equal to the projected cost of providing continued coverage to him until the one-year anniversary of his date of termination.
The change in control severance agreement provides that in the event any of the payments to be made                 thereunder or otherwise upon termination of employment are deemed to constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, then such payments and benefits received thereunder shall be reduced by the minimum amount                 necessary to result in no portion of the payments and benefits being non-deductible by the Bank for federal income tax purposes.
Benefit Plans
Retirement Plan.  Prudential Bank participates in the Financial Institutions Retirement Fund, a multiple employer defined benefit plan intended to satisfy the tax-qualification requirements                   of Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.  In November 2015, the retirement plan was frozen such that no new participants can be added and existing participants will receive no further benefit service credit, compensation credit or                   other accrued benefit increases except for additional service credits which may affect a participant's vesting or early vesting retirement eligibility or as otherwise required by law to maintain the tax-qualified status of such plan.     The retirement plan provides for a monthly benefit upon a participant's retirement at or after the age of 65, or if later, the fifth anniversary of the participant's initial participation in the retirement plan                 (i.e., the participant's "normal retirement date").  A participant may also receive a benefit on his early retirement date, which is the date on which he attains age 45 and is partially or fully vested under the terms of the retirement                 plan.  Benefits received prior to a participant's normal retirement date are reduced by certain factors set forth in the retirement plan.  The retirement plan provides a benefit of 1.50% of a participant's highest 5-year average earnings,                 multiplied by the participant's years of benefit service. Earnings are defined as base salary, subject to an annual Internal Revenue Service limit of $265,000 on earnings for 2015.  Annual benefits provided under the retirement plan also                 are subject to Internal Revenue Service limits, which vary by age and benefit payment type. Participants become fully vested in their benefits under the retirement plan upon the completion of five years of vesting service as well as upon                 the attainment of normal retirement age (age 65).
No named executive officer is a participant in the retirement plan.
401(k) and Profit                   Sharing Plan. The Bank also provides its employees, including the named executive officers, with tax-qualified retirement benefits through the Prudential Savings Bank Employees Savings and Profit Sharing Plan and Trust (the                 "401(k) Plan"). The Company previously provided additional benefits through two additional tax-qualified retirement plans: the ESOP and the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan for Financial Institutions (the "Defined Benefit Plan"). The                 determination was made to terminate the ESOP effective December 31, 2016. In addition, the Defined Benefit Plan was frozen during November 2015. Such actions were taken as part of the Company's efforts to effect significant cost savings                 while still providing a competitive compensation structure. All employees who meet the age and service requirements participate in the 401(k) Plan, on a non-discriminatory basis. The Bank did not provide a 401(k) match to employee                 contributions for the past several years due to the existence of the benefits provided by the ESOP. However, as a result of the termination of the ESOP, the Bank initiated a 401(k) match commencing in January 2018.
Endorsement Split                   Dollar Agreements.  The Bank has purchased insurance policies on the lives of certain of its executive officers                 named in the Summary Compensation Table as well as other officers, and has entered into Endorsement Split Dollar Agreements with each of those officers.  The policies are owned by the Bank.  Under the agreements with the named executive                 officers, upon an officer's death while he or she remains employed by the Bank, the officer's beneficiary will receive two times the officer's salary as of the date of death.  Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, the Bank has elected                 generally to not extend such benefits after a termination of employment. Such amounts will be funded from the receipt of the death benefits under the insurance policies on such officer's life in excess of the cash surrender value.  The Bank                 will receive the full cash surrender value, which is expected to reimburse the Bank in full for its life insurance investment as well as the remainder, if any, in excess of the net proceeds after payments to the officer's beneficiaries                 pursuant to the Endorsement Split Dollar Agreements.
The Endorsement Split Dollar Agreements may be terminated at any time by the Bank or the officer or by the                 Bank upon the officer's termination of service to Prudential Bank.  Upon termination, the Bank may surrender the policy and collect the cash surrender value.
Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
The long-term incentive compensation portion of the Company's compensation program consists of grants of                 stock options and restricted stock awards under the Company's 2008 SOP, the 2008 RRP and the 2014 SIP (the 2008 SOP, 2008 RRP and the 2014 SIP are collectively referred to as the "Equity Plans"). Under the Equity Plans, the Compensation                 Committee has discretion in determining grants of stock options and restricted stock awards to executive officers, including the timing, amounts and types of awards. The level of an individual's grants typically has been based in large on                 the officer's position within the organization, his or her individual performance and length of service.     The exercisability of options and the vesting of restricted stock awards generally depend upon the executive officer continuing to render services to the Company. In addition, although not granted to date, the                   Company's 2008 RRP and 2014 SIP provide that stock awards may be made based upon specified performance goals. All options granted under the Company's stock option plans must have an exercise price at least equal to the market value of the                   common stock on the date of grant. Options may be exercised only for a limited period of time after the optionee's departure from the Company in most cases. Under the terms of the Equity Plans, the grants cannot vest more rapidly than 20%                   per year except in certain specified circumstances, such as the death or disability of the award holder or in the event of a change in control (as defined in the Equity Plans) of the Company. To date, all the awards have been granted with                   five-year vesting schedules.
Under the Company's 2014 SIP and the 2008 RRP, the Compensation Committee is also authorized to grant share                   awards, which are a right to receive a distribution of shares of common stock. Shares of common stock granted pursuant to a share award are in the form of restricted stock which vests upon such terms and conditions as established by the                   Committee. For specific information regarding equity compensation awarded the named executive officers, see "-Equity Compensation Plans."
Related Party Transactions
In accordance with applicable federal laws and regulations, Prudential Bank offers mortgage loans to its                   directors, officers and employees as well as members of their immediate families for the financing of their primary residences and certain other loans. These loans are made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time                   for comparable loans with persons not related to Prudential Bank except that Prudential Bank provides for a reduced interest rate of one hundred basis points to all employees, officers and directors for a first mortgage on their primary                   residence and waives the origination fees, other than appraisal and document review fees. Other than as described below, it is the belief of management that these loans neither involve more than the normal risk of collectability nor                   present other unfavorable features.
The table below lists the outstanding loans made by Prudential Bank to related persons, where the amount                   involved exceeds $120,000 and the interest rate was reduced and loan origination fee was waived.

Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms furnished to us, or written representations from our                 officers and directors, we believe that during, and with respect to, the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, our officers and directors complied in all respects with the reporting requirements promulgated under Section 16(a) of the                 Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with the exception of Mr. Mulcahy who was late in reporting one transaction on Form 4.

PROPOSAL TO ADOPT A NON-BINDING RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (PROPOSAL TWO)
PROPOSAL TO ADOPT A NON-BINDING RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (PROPOSAL TWO)
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank                 Act"), the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission were amended to require that not less frequently than once every three years, a proxy statement for an annual meeting of shareholders for which the proxy solicitation rules of                 the Securities and Exchange Commission require compensation disclosure must also include a separate resolution subject to shareholder vote to approve the compensation of the company's named executive officers disclosed in the proxy                 statement.
The executive officers named in the summary compensation table and deemed to be "named executive officers"                 are Messrs. Pollack, Migliorino and Gallagher.  Reference is made to the summary compensation table and disclosures set forth under "Management Compensation" in this proxy statement.
The proposal gives shareholders the ability to vote on the compensation of our named executive officers                 through the following resolution:
"Resolved, that the shareholders approve the compensation of the named executive officers                 as disclosed in this proxy statement."
The shareholder vote on this proposal is not binding on Prudential Bancorp or the Board of Directors and                 cannot be construed as overruling any decision made by the Board of Directors or creating or implying any additional fiduciary duty of the Board of Directors.  However, the Board of Directors of Prudential Bancorp will review the voting                 results on the non-binding resolution and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation.
Our Board of Directors believes that our executive compensation for fiscal year 2018 continued to achieve the                 objectives of our executive compensation philosophy and programs.
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote "FOR" the non-binding resolution to                 approve the compensation of our named executive officers.

ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF THE NON-BINDING RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (PROPOSAL THREE)
ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF THE NON-BINDING RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (PROPOSAL THREE)
[END TABLE]
Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act also amended the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission to                   require that not less frequently than once every six years, a proxy statement for an annual meeting of shareholders for which the proxy solicitation rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission require compensation disclosure must also                   include a separate proposal subject to shareholder vote to determine whether the shareholder vote to approve the compensation of the named executive officers will occur every one, two or three years.
          Accordingly, we are seeking a shareholder vote regarding whether the non-binding resolution to approve the                   compensation of our named executive officers should occur every three years, every two years or every year.
The Board of Directors asks that you support a frequency of every three years for future non-binding                   resolutions on compensation of our named executive officers.  Setting an advisory vote every three years will be the most effective timeframe for Prudential Bancorp to respond to shareholder feedback and provide us with sufficient time to                   engage with shareholders to understand and respond to the vote results. At our 2013 annual meeting, when we were last required to hold this frequency vote, our stockholders expressed a preference to hold the say-on-pay vote every three                   years, which we have done.
The advisory vote on this proposal is not binding on Prudential Bancorp or the Board of Directors and                   cannot be construed as overruling any decision made by the Board of Directors.  However, the Board of Directors of Prudential Bancorp will review the results on the advisory vote and take them into consideration when making future                   decisions regarding the frequency of submitting to shareholders the non-binding resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers.
The Board of Directors recommends an advisory vote for a frequency of "THREE YEARS" for                   future non-binding resolutions to approve the compensation of our named executive officers.

RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (PROPOSAL FOUR)
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (PROPOSAL FOUR)
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Prudential Bancorp has appointed S.R. Snodgrass, P.C., an                   independent registered public accounting firm, to perform the audit of our financial statements for the year ending September 30, 2019, and further directed that the appointment of S.R. Snodgrass as our auditors be submitted for                   ratification by the shareholders at the annual meeting.
We have been advised by S.R. Snodgrass that neither that firm nor any of its associates has any                   relationship with Prudential Bancorp or its subsidiaries other than the usual relationship that exists between an independent registered public accounting firm and its clients.  S.R. Snodgrass will have one or more representatives at the                   annual meeting who will have an opportunity to make a statement, if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
In determining whether to appoint S.R. Snodgrass as our independent registered public accounting firm, the                   Audit Committee considered whether the provision of services, other than auditing services, by S.R. Snodgrass is compatible with maintaining its independence.  In addition to performing auditing services, our independent registered public                   accounting firm reviewed our public filings.  The Audit Committee believes that S.R. Snodgrass's performance of these other services is compatible with maintaining the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. Audit Fees
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees paid by us to S.R. Snodgrass for professional services in                   connection with the audit of Prudential Bancorp's consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2018 and 2017 and the fees paid by us to S.R. Snodgrass for audit-related services, tax services and all other services during fiscal 2018 and                   2017.

The Audit Committee selects our independent registered public accounting firm and pre-approves all audit                   services to be provided by it to Prudential Bancorp.  The Audit Committee also reviews and pre-approves all audit-related and non-audit related services rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with the                   Audit Committee's Charter.  In its review of these services and related fees and terms, the Audit Committee considers, among other things, the possible effect of the performance of such services on the independence of our independent                   registered public accounting firm.  The Audit Committee pre-approves certain audit-related services and certain non-audit related tax services which are specifically described by the Audit Committee on an annual basis and separately                   approves other individual engagements as necessary. The Chairman of the Audit Committee has been delegated the authority to approve non-audit related services in lieu of the full Audit Committee.  On a quarterly basis, the Chairman of the                   Audit Committee presents any previously approved engagements to the full Audit Committee.
Each new engagement of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. was approved in advance by the Audit Committee or its Chairman,                   and none of those engagements made use of the de minimis exception to pre-approval contained in the Securities and Exchange Commission's                   rules.
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.
