COMPLETION OF OUR SUCCESSION PLAN 
One of the Company's most important strategic objectives has been the orderly succession of Mr. McGraw as our chief executive officer.  The succession was completed as of May 1, 2018, when Mr. McGraw transitioned to the position of executive chairman, and C. Mitchell Waycaster assumed the position of our chief executive officer, and our chief financial officer, Kevin D. Chapman, fully assumed the position as our chief operating officer. 2018 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND RELATIONSHIP TO COMPENSATION
Maintaining the Link Between Pay and Performance. Like his predecessor, Mr. Waycaster has continued to drive increases in shareholder value.  As the tables below indicate, in 2018 our diluted earnings per share again increased compared to the prior year. Total shareholder return decreased from 2017 to 2018, but we believe this decline is attributable to the decline in the market price of our common stock over the course of 2018, similar to the decline in financial institution stock prices generally during 2018. The compensation paid to our chief executive officer has remained relatively stable, with the amount of compensation we paid to Mr. Waycaster during 2018 somewhat below that paid to his predecessor, Mr. McGraw, in 2017.
During the same period, in addition to our diluted EPS growth, our return on assets and return on equity have also increased, as demonstrated in the table below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Year Ended December 31, 
  2018   2017   2016   2015   2014 
Diluted EPS (GAAP) $2.79   $1.96   $2.17   $1.88   $1.88 
Diluted EPS, with exclusions (non-GAAP)(1)(2) $3.00   $2.42   $2.31   $2.11   $1.89 
Return on Average Assets (GAAP) 1.32%   0.97%   1.08%   0.99%   1.02% 
Return on Average Tangible Assets, with exclusions (non-GAAP)(1)(2) 1.58%   1.32%   1.28%   1.23%   1.16% 
Return on Average Shareholders' Equity (GAAP) 8.64%   6.68%   8.15%   7.76%   8.61% 
Return on Average Tangible Shareholders' Equity, with exclusions (non-GAAP)(1)(2) 17.14%   14.48%   16.23%   16.10%   16.37% 
(1) Exclusions include charges with respect to which we are unable to accurately predict when these charges will be incurred or, when incurred, the amount of the charge.  For 2018, these charges were merger and conversion expenses on an after-tax basis. 
(2) Diluted EPS, with exclusions, return on average tangible assets, with exclusions, and return on average tangible shareholders' equity, with exclusions, are non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate ongoing operating results and to assess ongoing profitability.  For a reconciliation of these measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, please see (a) with respect to 2016, 2017 and 2018, as to diluted EPS, the "Results of Operations-Net Income" section and, as to return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible shareholders' equity, the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section, each in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and (b) with respect to 2014 and 2015, as to diluted EPS, the "Results of Operations-Net Income" section and, as to return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible shareholders' equity, the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section, each in Item 7, Management's Discussion and

 Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Additional 2018 Results. In 2018, the Company also completed certain strategic objectives and achieved favorable operational and financial results:
[BEGIN TABLE]
a We recorded our highest level of annual earnings in 2018, with net income of $146.9 million, marking our sixth consecutive year of record net income.  Our diluted EPS of $2.79 represented an $0.83 improvement over 2017.  Our 2017 diluted EPS was impacted by our writedown of our net deferred tax assets stemming from changes in tax rates effected by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.  However, even excluding the $0.31 reduction to diluted EPS as a result of the deferred tax asset writedown, our 2018 diluted EPS grew approximately 23% from 2017. 
a We completed our acquisition of Brand Group Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiary The Brand Banking Company (which we refer to collectively as "Brand" in this proxy statement) on September 1, 2018.  By acquiring Brand, we added 13 locations throughout the greater Atlanta area, one of our strategic growth markets.  Also, as of the acquisition date (and prior to purchase accounting adjustments), we acquired $2.0 billion in assets, including $1.6 billion in loans, and $1.7 billion in deposits. 
a We increased our annual dividend twice in 2018.  The annual dividend now stands at $0.84 per share, an approximately 10% increase from 2017. 
a In 2018, in addition to the new locations added in the Brand merger, we expanded our geographic footprint in Tennessee and Georgia through new branch openings, and we also added market leaders and producers throughout our footprint, which, together with production from our existing locations, contributed to our non-purchased loan growth of over 14% from 2017.  
a Our asset quality metrics continued to remain strong in 2018.  Total non-purchased non-performing assets remained flat from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 even as our total assets increased.  Net loan charge-offs were 0.05% of average loans for 2018 compared to 0.06% of average loans for 2017.  As a percentage of total assets, all credit metrics, including nonperforming assets, loans 30-89 days past due and our internal watch list were at or near historical lows at the end of 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
[END TABLE]
GOVERNING DOCUMENTS AND PRACTICES
Code of Ethics. We expect our directors, officers and employees to act and make decisions that are in our best interests, and we discourage situations which present a conflict between our interests and their own personal interests.  Under our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our "Code of Ethics," our directors, officers and employees may not engage in any business or conduct, or enter into any contract or arrangement, that would give rise to an actual or potential conflict of interest without the prior approval of our board or other appropriate supervisor.  We require our directors, officers and employees to annually certify that they have read and understand their obligations under the Code of Ethics.  A copy of our Code of Ethics is available at www.renasant.com by clicking on "Corporate Overview" under the "Investor Relations" tab, then clicking on "Governance Documents" and then "Code of Ethics."
Committee Charters. The board of directors has five standing committees: an executive committee, an audit committee, a compensation committee, an enterprise risk management committee, or "ERM committee," and a nominating and corporate governance committee, or "nominating committee."  Each committee is governed by a written charter, copies of which are available at www.renasant.com, by clicking on "Corporate Overview" under the "Investor Relations" tab, then on "Governance Documents" and then selecting the desired charter.
Insider Trading Policy.  The board of directors has adopted a policy designed to prevent insider trading of our securities.  Our insider trading policy generally prohibits our directors, officers and employees, their immediate family members and entities that they control from purchasing or selling our securities while in possession of material nonpublic information and from disclosing material nonpublic information to third parties.  An additional restriction applies to our directors, senior executive officers and certain other individuals, such as senior accounting staff: these individuals may trade in our securities only during a "trading window" (and provided that he or she is not otherwise in possession of material nonpublic information).  The trading window opens two trading days after our quarterly earnings release and closes early in the last month of each quarter.  Annually our directors, officers and employees must certify that they have reviewed our insider trading policy and understand their obligations under the policy.
In 2018, the board approved updates to our insider trading policy.  The board added a "pre-clearance" requirement, applicable to those individuals who may trade only during a trading window, whom we refer to as "covered persons."  Under this requirement, a covered person may not trade in our securities, even during an open trading window, unless a committee made up of our chief operating officer, our chief accounting officer and our governance counsel approves the transaction.  This pre-clearance requirement enhances our efforts to prevent insider trading by giving us the opportunity to evaluate a proposed trade in advance and independently decide whether the covered person possesses material nonpublic information even though the trading window is open.  The insider trading policy was also updated to clarify that a significant cybersecurity incident or disruption to our information technology infrastructure constitutes a "material" event that precludes trading in our securities until appropriate disclosures have been made.
Review and Approval of Related Person Transactions. The board of directors is responsible for reviewing and approving or ratifying all material transactions between us or our subsidiaries and any of our directors or executive officers, their immediate family members and businesses with which they are associated (we refer to these persons and entities as "related persons").  The board reviews transactions involving related persons to ensure that the terms of any such transaction are substantially the same as the terms that would be expected if the transaction were with a person or entity that is not related to us or the Bank.  To identify related person transactions, each year we require our directors and executive officers to complete Director and Officer Questionnaires.  These questionnaires require our directors and executive officers to list all related persons and any transactions with us in which a related person has an interest.  In addition, we review loan and deposit balances as well as accounts payable to our vendors to identify relationships with related persons.  When the board reviews and approves or ratifies related person transactions, the director or executive officer associated with the matter is not present while discussions and deliberations are held and, if the transaction involves a director, this director must abstain from voting on the matter.  The types of transactions that must be reviewed and approved or ratified include extensions of credit, real property leases and other business relationships.
Other than our Code of Ethics, our related person transaction policy is not in writing.  However, we have adopted written policies to comply with regulatory requirements and restrictions applicable to us, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (which govern certain transactions by the Bank with its affiliates) and the Federal Reserve's Regulation O (which governs loans by the Bank to its executive officers, directors and principal shareholders). BOARD GOVERNANCE
Retirement Policy.  Our Amended and Restated Bylaws, which we refer to as our "Bylaws," include a written retirement policy applicable to our board of directors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director may not stand for election after reaching age 72; and  
• Any director who attains age 72 during his or her elected term may serve only until the next regular meeting of our shareholders. 
[END TABLE]
The board may waive the requirement and permit a director to stand for reelection after he or she reaches the age of 72, or the board may waive the requirement that a director who has attained 72 resign at the next regular meeting of shareholders.  To be effective, a waiver must be approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then in office, excluding the director to whom the waiver vote applies. Mr. McGraw is age 72.  At its January 2019 meeting, our board unanimously voted to nominate Mr. McGraw for election as a Class 2 director.  Accordingly, assuming Mr. McGraw is elected at the annual meeting, he may serve as a director until the 2020 annual meeting (rather than the 2022 annual meeting, as is the case for our other Class 2 director nominees), subject to his receipt of a waiver from the board allowing him to serve an additional year.
A waiver applies only until the next regular meeting of our shareholders, when the board may again waive the requirement that a director who has attained age 72 resign from the board.  In no event may a director receive more than three waivers, with the result that all of our directors must cease to serve as of the regular meeting of shareholders that follows the attainment of age 75.
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines. Our board has adopted stock ownership guidelines that require our non-employee directors to own a substantial number of shares of Renasant common stock. The board believes that ownership of our stock achieves two important goals: (1) it demonstrates to our shareholders and the investing public the directors' commitment to and belief in the long-term value of our stock and (2) it enhances the alignment of our directors' financial interests with those of our shareholders.
The stock ownership guidelines were most recently updated in February 2019.  Under the current guidelines, within five years of becoming a director, each non-employee director must own stock with a value equal to at least three times the annual cash retainer.  In addition, within the first year of his or her election or appointment to the board, a director must own at least 500 shares of common stock, regardless of value.  Shares that a director has pledged do not count toward his or her required minimum ownership levels.
Based on an annual cash retainer of $40,000 (the retainer for 2019), the guidelines require directors with at least five years of service to own Renasant common stock with a value of at least $120,000.  Using our stock price as of March 4, 2019, all of our directors own at least $192,130 of our common stock, except for Sean M. Suggs and Connie L. Engel, who joined the board in May and September 2018, respectively.  Mr. Suggs and Ms. Engel both own at least 500 shares of our stock.
Board, Committee and Director Performance Assessments. As part of its effort to ensure that the Company has a high-functioning board with the collective knowledge, experience and skills necessary to guide a financial institution such as Renasant, our nominating committee annually conducts a board assessment that has been developed and is administered by an independent third party.  As part of the assessment, each director is asked to provide, on an anonymous basis, his or her opinions on various topics, including: (1) the interaction between the board and management, (2) the organization of the board, (3) the conduct of board and committee meetings, (4) each director's fulfillment of his or her responsibilities as a director and (5) director compensation.  After analyzing the results, the nominating committee makes recommendations to improve the operations of the board and to address any deficiencies that have been identified during the assessment process.
In addition to the assessment of the entire board, the nominating committee facilitates a peer assessment of each director whose term in office is expiring at the next annual meeting.  For this assessment, the nominating committee asks each director to assess the individual contribution to the board and participation in board and committee meetings and other board activities, among other things, of each director whose term in office is expiring.  The committee uses this information as one tool in determining whether a director whose term is expiring should be nominated for reelection.
Finally, most committees of the board annually perform a self-assessment.  These committee self-assessments are designed to elicit input from committee members regarding the efficiency of the committee's operations and ways that the committee can better fulfill its particular obligations. We expect the committees that do not already conduct annual  self-assessments to have an assessment process in place before the end of 2019.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Structure. There are currently 15 members of our board of directors, divided into three classes:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Class 1 Class 2 Class 3 
Donald Clark, Jr. John M. Creekmore Marshall H. Dickerson 
Albert J. Dale, III Jill V. Deer R. Rick Hart 
John T. Foy Neal A. Holland, Jr. Richard L. Heyer, Jr. 
C. Mitchell Waycaster E. Robinson McGraw J. Niles McNeel(1) 
Connie L. Engel Sean M. Suggs Michael D. Shmerling 
(1) Mr. McNeel will retire effective as of the annual meeting, as required pursuant to our retirement policy. 
[END TABLE]
The current term of office for our Class 1 directors expires at the 2021 annual meeting; the current term of office for our Class 2 directors expires at the 2019 annual meeting; and the current term of office for our Class 3 directors expires at the 2020 annual meeting.
After our annual meeting and assuming that all of our nominees are elected, the board will have 14 members, which the board has determined is an appropriate number to fulfill its responsibilities in light of our current and anticipated size and nature of operations.  The board will remain divided into three classes, with five Class 1 directors, five Class 2 directors and four Class 3 directors.
Meetings. Our board held 13 meetings in 2018.  All directors attended at least 75% of the total number of board meetings and the meetings of the committees on which they served.  The members of the board who are "independent directors" under the Listing Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC, or Nasdaq, met in executive session six times during 2018.  We do not have a policy requiring director attendance at our annual meeting.  All of our current directors attended the 2018 annual meeting, and we expect our entire board to attend this year's annual meeting.
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
Our executive chairman serves as chairman of the board, and the board has appointed a lead director.
Chairman. E. Robinson McGraw, our executive chairman, serves as chairman of the board of the Company and the board of the Bank. We have retained Mr. McGraw as chairman of the board following his transition from our chief executive officer to our executive chairman because we believe this structure continues to enhance the board's operations.  Mr. McGraw serves as an effective bridge between our non-employee directors and management.  As executive chairman, Mr. McGraw remains significantly involved, with Mr. Waycaster and the rest of Renasant's senior executive management, in developing Renasant's strategic plan and implementing the steps needed to achieve the goals set forth in the strategic plan.  In addition, Mr. McGraw is able to provide critical insight on the current state of our overall operations, future prospects and the risks faced by the Company and the Bank.  With such a deep knowledge of the Company and the Bank, Mr. McGraw is ideally suited to leading the board's discussions.
Lead Director. John M. Creekmore serves as "lead director" of our board of directors and is a member of the board's executive committee.  The members of the board who meet the definition of "independent director" under the Nasdaq Listing Rules select our lead director; no lead director is required if the chairman qualifies as an "independent director." 
The lead director serves as an independent counterbalance to the chairman of the board and essentially as a co-equal. Mr. Creekmore has been a director since 1997, predating Mr. McGraw's (and Mr. Waycaster's) service on the board, which we believe adds weight to his independent voice on the board.  The duties of the lead director are described in our Bylaws and include the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With the chairman, scheduling and setting the agenda for board meetings; 
• Scheduling, setting the agenda for, and chairing all executive sessions of the "independent directors" of the board; 
• Determining the appropriate materials to be sent to directors for all meetings; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Acting as a liaison between the board and the chief executive officer and our other executive officers; 
• Assisting the compensation committee in evaluating the chief executive officer's performance; 
• Assisting the nominating and corporate governance committee in its annual assessment of the board's committee structure and each committee's performance; and 
• Overseeing the board's communications with our shareholders. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, the lead director may call the board into executive session (that is, a meeting of only those directors who are "independent directors") to discuss matters outside the presence of the chairman and other non-independent directors.  The lead director is also expected to familiarize himself with the Company, the Bank and the banking industry in general.  He also is expected to keep abreast of developments in the principles of good corporate governance.

We update our corporate website, www.renasant.com, to reflect any changes in the membership of these committees.  You can find this information by clicking on "Corporate Overview" under the "Investor Relations" tab, then clicking on "Committee Charting."
ROLE OF THE BOARD IN RISK OVERSIGHT
Our full board of directors is ultimately responsible for the oversight and management of our risk management and mitigation functions.  To identify and mitigate risk, the board primarily acts through a committee structure, as detailed below.  At least annually the full board receives presentations from management on the processes and procedures that we have implemented to identify and mitigate various risks facing the Company.  These presentations assist our directors not only in performing their risk-oversight responsibilities on various committees but also reviewing on an informed basis the work of committees on which they do not serve.  In 2018, among other topics, our chief risk officer detailed our enterprise risk management program, our chief credit officer outlined our credit underwriting and administration program and our chief technology officer gave a presentation on our current cybersecurity infrastructure and the planned enhancements thereto.
The board's ERM committee is primarily responsible for identifying enterprise-wide risks (including cyber-security risks), assessing how each risk might affect other risks and facilitating the Company's operations within risk tolerance levels that are established by management and reviewed by the board. The committee oversees and assists management in the risk assessment process and the implementation of comprehensive risk management processes and procedures, it validates risk tolerance levels suggested by management, and it reviews and adopts policies, procedures and controls  that are intended to mitigate risk.
The ERM committee generally addresses enterprise-wide risk.  Other standing committees, working with management committees that report to these committees, are used to identify and mitigate more specific risks, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The audit committee, which focuses on financial reporting and operational risk. This committee meets regularly with management, our independent registered public accountants and our internal auditors to discuss the integrity of our financial reporting processes and internal controls and the steps taken to monitor and control related risks. In addition, at almost every meeting the committee receives a management presentation designed to give the committee a better understanding of our operations and how the subject of the presentation impacts our overall operational risk.  More information about the audit committee can be found above under the heading "Board Committees" and below in the "Report of the Audit Committee" and "Independent Registered Public Accountants" sections. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The compensation committee, which evaluates risks associated with our executive compensation programs.  The compensation committee is assisted by the incentive compensation committee, which is comprised of senior management and reports directly to the compensation committee.  The incentive compensation committee reviews our cash and equity incentive compensation arrangements (for both executive and non-executive employees) to ensure that these arrangements appropriately balance risks and financial rewards in a manner that does not encourage or expose the Bank or the Company to imprudent risks, whether financial, credit, regulatory or otherwise.  The steps we have taken to address risks associated with our executive compensation program are described in the CD&A section below.  Other risk mitigation practices apply to specific groups of employees.  For example, our lenders may be eligible for incentives based on their loan production.  This creates a risk that a lender may try to make riskier loans to boost his or her incentive.  We have addressed this risk by, among other things, requiring that a lender satisfy loan quality thresholds consistent with our overall goals for loan portfolio performance as a condition to his or her eligibility to receive an incentive payment.  As another example, mortgage originators are compensated on a commission basis, based on the volume of loans originated.  This creates a risk that employees may focus on higher income, non-minority areas, exposing us to criticism from a fair lending perspective, among other things.  We have addressed this risk by imposing goals for low income and minority lending.  On an ongoing basis, the incentive compensation committee monitors our incentive compensation arrangements to determine whether additional risk mitigants are necessary.  The CD&A section provides more information about the activities of the compensation committee. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The loan committee, which is primarily responsible for credit and other risks arising in connection with our lending activities and overseeing management committees that also address these risks.  The loan committee's work is supplemented by a number of management committees that report to it on various aspects of our lending activities, such as loss management. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The investment committee, which monitors our interest rate and liquidity risk.  The committee has two primary goals with respect to risk oversight: (1) to structure our asset-liability composition in a way that maximizes our net interest income while minimizing the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on interest income and capital; and (2) to ensure that we have adequate sources of short and long-term liquidity both under the current interest rate environment and under various hypothetical interest rate scenarios.  The asset/liability committee, a management committee reporting to the investment committee, monitors our interest rate sensitivity and makes decisions relating to that process. 
[END TABLE]
At each board meeting, each committee chair provides a report to the full board of directors on the committee's specific risk oversight and mitigation responsibilities. To the extent that any risk reported to the full board needs to be addressed outside the presence of management, the board may call an executive session to discuss the issue.
In addition to our full board of directors and committee structure, Mr. Waycaster, as chief executive officer, oversees management's role in the implementation of our risk management processes by ensuring access to adequate and timely reports and information, access to our employees and the prompt implementation of recommendations by our committees.  Mr. Creekmore, as our lead director, is able to lead an independent review of the risk assessments developed by management and reported to the committees.  Finally, we have a chief risk officer who leads management's assessment of the risks we face, the determination of our risk tolerance levels and the implementation of effective risk management processes and procedures. DIRECTOR SELECTION
The nominating committee evaluates and recommends potential new directors based upon the needs of the board and the Company.  The committee's objective is to craft a board composed of individuals with a broad mix of backgrounds and experiences and possessing, as a whole, the knowledge, skills and experience necessary to guide a publicly-traded financial institution like Renasant in the prevailing business environment.
Although there is no formal policy, the board and nominating committee, as well as our management, believe that board membership should reflect diversity in its broadest sense.  The nominating committee considers a candidate's gender, ethnicity, experience, education, geographic location and difference of viewpoint when evaluating his or her qualifications for election to the board. 
In addition to the eligibility requirements included in our Bylaws, the following qualifications and qualities, among others, are evaluated by the nominating committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Independence" within the meaning of the Nasdaq Listing Rules and SEC rules and regulations; 
• Experience in banking or in marketing, finance, legal, accounting or other professional disciplines; 
• Diversity of background and other characteristics that are reflective of our shareholders; 
• Familiarity with and participation in the local communities in which we do business; 
• Prominence and a highly-respected reputation in his or her profession; 
• A proven record of honest and ethical conduct, personal integrity and independent judgment;  
• Ability to represent the interests of our shareholders; and 
• Ability to devote time to fulfill the responsibilities of a director and to enhance their knowledge of our industry. 
[END TABLE]
Usually, nominees for election to the board are proposed by the current members of the board or executive management.  For example, Mr. Suggs, who joined the board in May 2018, was recommended by Messrs. McGraw and Waycaster.  As to Ms. Engel, as part of our merger agreement with Brand, we agreed to appoint one Brand director to our board upon completion of the merger.  After reviewing the qualifications of the members of Brand's board and interviewing certain candidates, the nominating committee recommended the appointment of Ms. Engel to our board upon completion of the merger.  The nominating committee will also consider candidates that shareholders and others recommend, and the committee uses the same criteria in assessing shareholder-recommended candidates as it does for candidates proposed by the committee or another board member.  More information about the process for shareholder recommendations may be found below under the heading "Shareholder Communications" in the paragraph titled "Process for Shareholder Recommendations."
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
The board has determined that each of our directors (including Mr. McNeel, whose service on the board will cease after the annual meeting) is an "independent director" as defined under Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, with the exception of Messrs. McGraw, Hart and Waycaster who are not independent directors because they are Renasant employees.  In addition, the board previously determined that Hollis C. Cheek and Fred F. Sharpe, whose terms as directors ended as of the 2018 annual meeting, were independent directors under Rule 5605(a)(2) while they served on our board.  When determining each director's status as an "independent director," the board evaluated the following relationships involving Renasant or the Bank:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Transactions involving a director, members of his or her immediate family and business with which they are associated and the Company or the Bank (more information about these transactions may be found below under the headings "Indebtedness of Directors and Executive Officers" and "Other Related Person Transactions"). 
• The Bank employs the sons of three of our directors: (1) Mr. Creekmore's son works as a portfolio manager in the Bank's corporate banking department; (2) Dr. Heyer's son is employed as an investment officer in the Bank's wealth management division; and (3) Mr. Holland's son is a trainee in the Bank's wealth management division.  None of these employees is considered an "executive officer" of the Company, nor did any of them receive compensation for 2018 at a level that would cause his employment to constitute a "related person" transaction under applicable SEC regulations. The compensation paid to each employee was consistent with the  
[END TABLE]
 compensation paid to similarly-situated employees of the Bank.
INDEBTEDNESS OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Certain of our directors and executive officers, members of their immediate families and businesses with which they are associated are customers of the Bank and have entered into loan transactions with the Bank.  These transactions were made in the ordinary course of the Bank's business, were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the Company or the Bank, and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.  The Bank's board of directors approved all such loans in accordance with the Federal Reserve's Regulation O and other bank regulatory requirements.
OTHER RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
In addition to the loan transactions described above, we have deposit and other financial services-related relationships in the ordinary course of the Bank's business with our directors and executive officers, members of their immediate families and businesses with which they are associated, and we expect to engage in similar transactions with these persons in the future.  All certificates of deposit and depository relationships with these persons were made in the ordinary course of the Bank's business and involved substantially the same terms, including interest rates, as those prevailing at the time for comparable depository relationships with persons not related to the Company or the Bank.
In addition, in 2018 we entered into transactions in which Bartow Morgan, Jr., our chief commercial banking officer, has a direct or indirect material interest, or we became a party to transactions in which Mr. Morgan has a material interest as a result of the completion of the Brand acquisition on September 1, 2018.  Our related person transactions involving Mr. Morgan are described below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Brand was party to real estate leases with entities owned by a trust of which Mr. Morgan is a trustee and an approximate 25% beneficiary (taking into account the interest of Mr. Morgan and his children) (together with his siblings) (this trust is referred to as the "Morgan Family Trust"), under which Brand leased from the entities owned by the Morgan Family Trust real estate on which a Brand branch was located.  Upon the completion of the Brand acquisition, Renasant assumed these leases.  The following table sets forth (1) the location of each of these branches; (2) the lease payments made in 2018; and (3) the payments due over the remaining terms of each of the leases, which expire at various times between 2022 and 2025 (amounts in the columns below include, to the extent known, triple net charges):

(1) Amounts in parenthesis represent the portion of the lease payments paid after September 1, 2018, the date on which we completed the Brand acquisition.  The balance was paid by Brand prior to September 1, 2018. 
[END TABLE]
On account of his understanding of the markets in which the above-listed branches operate, Mr. Morgan will likely play a role in determining whether the Bank should continue to maintain a branch in the market generally.  He will not, however, participate in discussions as to whether to renew any expiring lease or find another location  for the branch within the market.  If management elects to renew an expiring lease, Mr. Morgan will not participate in the negotiations regarding the rent or the other terms and conditions of the lease renewal, which will ultimately be subject to final approval by our board.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Brand Properties, LLC and Brand Real Estate Services, Inc., both of which are owned by the Morgan Family Trust, provided property management services for the above-listed branch locations and our Dacula, Georgia  branch location to Brand, prior to September 1, 2018, and to us, after the completion of the Brand acquisition.  In 2018, these entities were paid $33,358 in the aggregate for property management services, and we expect to pay an aggregate of approximately $139,000 to these entities over the remaining terms of the above leases for such services (these entities do not provide property management services with respect to any of our other locations). Additionally, Brand had contracted with Brand Properties, LLC to develop and construct its Dacula branch, which construction was completed in the summer of 2018.  Brand Properties was paid an aggregate of $2,252,152 under this contract, of which $464,439 was paid after September 1, 2018. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Brand maintained "split-dollar" insurance arrangements for the benefit of life insurance trusts established by Mr. Morgan and certain of his siblings, which we assumed upon the completion of the Brand acquisition.  Under these arrangements, the trusts (whose beneficiaries were parties related to Mr. Morgan or his siblings) acquired and owned life insurance policies on the lives of Mr. Morgan and the siblings, and Brand was contractually obligated to pay the premiums.  Upon the insured's death or the earlier termination of the split dollar arrangements, each trust is obligated to repay to Brand (and now to us) the aggregate amount of the premium payments  made on behalf of the trust or, under some of the arrangements, the cash surrender value of policy, if greater than the aggregate premiums paid.  We intend to terminate these split-dollar insurance arrangements in a manner that avoids loss to the Company.  In 2018, premium payments in the aggregate amount of $335,362 were made by Brand (prior to September 1, 2018) and Renasant (after the completion of the Brand acquisition), and we have made premium payments in the aggregate amount of $158,662 in the first two months of 2019. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Upon the completion of our acquisition of Brand, GardenBrand, LLC, previously a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Brand Banking Company, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank.  GardenBrand, LLC is party to a purchase and sale agreement with two entities owned by the Morgan Family Trust.  Under this agreement, GardenBrand, LLC has agreed to sell a vacant lot in Atlanta, Georgia, to one of the entities owned by the Morgan Family Trust in exchange for the real estate, owned by the other entity owned by the Morgan Family Trust, on which the Bank's branch in Suwanee, Georgia, is located and cash.  The purchase and sale agreement was entered into in 2015; in November 2018 we agreed to extend the deadline for closing the transaction for six months.  As a condition of the extension, $150,000 in earnest money was irrevocably released to us.  Our executive committee reviewed and approved the terms of the proposed extension before we amended the purchase sale and agreement to provide for the extension. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Brand owned warrants to purchase the common stock of a "fintech" company, and the Bank acquired these warrants upon the completion of the Brand acquisition.  Our management decided to sell these warrants, which Mr. Morgan offered to purchase for their book value, which was $603,009.  To evaluate Mr. Morgan's offer, the board directed management to ascertain whether (1) there were any other parties interested in acquiring the warrants and (2) the Bank would be likely to obtain a better price than the price offered by Mr. Morgan.  Management contacted investment bankers with knowledge of the industry in which this fintech company operates and was advised that, due to the speculative nature of the warrants and the fintech company's operating results to date, the Bank was unlikely to find any other buyer for the warrants at all, much less a buyer willing to pay more than book value for the warrants.  After receiving this advice, the board approved the sale of the warrants for $603,009 to an entity of which Mr. Morgan is a 50% owner.  The sale was completed in December 2018.

Each year, our independent compensation consultant, Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC, or "Pearl Meyer," provides the compensation committee with information about peer group compensation practices and recommendations for our non-employee director compensation for the upcoming fiscal year.  The compensation committee then recommends  to our full board the non-employee director compensation for the upcoming year.  At its December meeting, the board reviews the committee's recommendations and ordinarily ratifies the recommended compensation.  Any modifications are implemented after our annual meeting.
Compensation for our non-employee directors is generally set at a level that is at or near the median of the compensation paid to directors in our compensation peer group using information obtained from Pearl Meyer about the practices of companies in the group.  More information about our compensation peer group can be found in the "Features and Objectives of Our 2018 Compensation Program" section of the CD&A section below under the heading "Peer Groups."  As a matter of policy, each of our non-employee directors receives an annual stock award with the same value.  Annual cash retainers are the same, with the exception of our lead director and the chairs of our audit, executive, compensation, nominating and loan committees. Meeting fees are the same for committee members, but chairs may receive an additional amount. We do not pay special or strategic compensation (such as for the completion of a merger), make "one-time" payments, provide tax gross ups, negotiate additional fees or payments for individual directors or "benchmark" compensation to our compensation peer group.
The table below includes information about all of the compensation that was paid to our non-employee directors for services they rendered during our fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

(1) Effective as of the 2018 annual meeting, Messrs. Booth and Brooks retired from our board, and Messrs. Potts, Cheek, and Sharpe ceased to serve on our board.  The table above includes compensation paid for service on our board during 2018.  Messrs. Potts, Cheek and Sharpe continued to serve on the Bank's board of directors and were compensated; therefore, the table does not include compensation for service on the Bank's board. 
[END TABLE]
Compensation reported in the table above represents both cash payments and the value of other forms of payments and benefits as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Column B - Fees Earned or Paid in Cash. Amounts in this column reflect the retainers and meeting fees we paid to our non-employee directors, which may be voluntarily deferred under our Deferred Stock Unit Plan or Directors' Deferred Fee Plan, which are described below. 
• We paid the following retainers, prorated in the form of equal monthly payments:  
• All directors received a retainer the amount of $35,000; 
• Our lead director received an additional retainer in the amount of $12,000; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The chair of the audit committee received an additional retainer in the amount of $6,000; and 
• The chairs of the executive, compensation, nominating and loan committees each received an additional retainer in the amount of $3,000. 
• We also paid the following meeting fees: 
• Chairs who do not receive an additional retainer receive $750 for each meeting chaired; and  
• Members receive $500 for each meeting they attend. 
• Each of our non-employee directors who serves on one of our state bank boards was paid a $500 fee quarterly or when the board meets, a $125 fee in each month during which a meeting was not held, and a $200 fee for attendance at state bank board committee meetings. 
• Column C - Stock Awards. On April 24, 2018, each director, with the exception of Mr. Suggs and Ms. Engel, received a time-based restricted stock award of 1,010 shares of our common stock that will vest at the 2019 annual meeting.  Mr. Suggs and Ms. Engel, who were appointed to our board in May 2018 and September 2018, respectively, received prorated time-based restricted stock awards that also will vest at the 2019 annual meeting. Column C reports the aggregate fair value of these awards, determined as of the date of award, calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, "Stock Compensation."  Dividends payable on restricted stock awards are not included in our fair value determination.  Please refer to Note 14, "Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation Plans," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for details regarding the assumptions used to derive the fair value of our restricted stock. 
• Column D - Changes in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings. Amounts in this column report above-market earnings on amounts deferred under the Directors' Deferred Fee Plan.  Interest earned on deferred amounts is considered above-market only if the interest rate exceeded 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate, with compounding, as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service.  With the exception of Mr. Potts, who is a participant in a legacy pension plan, our non-employee directors do not participate in a pension plan or similar arrangement.  The legacy plan in which Mr. Potts is a participant ceased to accrue benefits in 2008.  Column D does not include the change in the actuarial present value of his accumulated benefit in this plan which was $(68,263) as of December 31, 2018. 
• Column E - All Other Compensation. Cash dividends paid on restricted stock awards are included in this column.  The remaining amounts in this column reflect the value of other benefits we provide to our non-employee directors, which consist of the following: 
• Non-employee directors and their eligible dependents may elect to enroll in our medical and dental plans and pay full premiums for the coverage.  Based on historical practice, we deduct a portion of the premiums from the cash payments we make to our electing directors, and a portion of the premiums are treated as imputed income that is applied to the cost of the premiums and reported as taxable income.  Amounts in Column E represent the portion of the premium that we treat as imputed income. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We provide term life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance coverage to each director with a face amount of $10,000, at a cost of $25. 
[END TABLE]
The Bank maintains two types of deferred compensation plans in which our non-employee directors may participate: the Deferred Stock Unit Plan, the "DSU Plan", and the Director's Deferred Fee Plan.  Under the DSU Plan, deferred amounts are credited to a bookkeeping account that is deemed invested in units representing shares of our common stock and credited with dividend equivalent units when we pay cash dividends.  Units are allocated based on a quarterly average market price.  Under the Directors' Deferred Fee Plan, deferred retainer and fees are notionally invested in investment alternatives substantially similar to those offered under our 401(k) plan or in the Moody's Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds, which was 3.94% in 2018.  Benefits under either plan are payable when a director ceases to serve as a member of our board and may be paid in a lump sum or installments.  Under the DSU Plan, benefits are paid in the form of shares of our common stock; under the Deferred Fee Plan, benefits are paid in cash.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[END TABLE]
The named executive officers, or "named executives," whose compensation is administered by the compensation committee and determined under our executive compensation program are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Named Executive  Title 
E. Robinson McGraw Executive Chairman 
C. Mitchell Waycaster President and Chief Executive Officer 
Kevin D. Chapman Chief Financial and Operating Officer 
R. Rick Hart  Executive Vice President 
J. Scott Cochran Executive Vice President  
Bartow Morgan, Jr. Executive Vice President 
[END TABLE]
Mr. Morgan began his employment with Renasant as of September 1, 2018, when we completed our acquisition of Brand.  His compensation for 2018 was determined under the terms of an employment agreement with Renasant that we negotiated with him as part of the Brand acquisition.  The compensation committee reviewed Mr. Morgan's employment agreement, including his compensation, before the Brand acquisition was completed and his employment agreement was signed.   We do not consider Mr. Morgan's compensation to be part of our executive compensation program for 2018, and we have not described Mr. Morgan's compensation in this CD&A.  Mr. Morgan's compensation in 2018 is described below under the heading "Compensation Tables."
SAY-ON-PAY
At our 2018 annual meeting, approximately 33.7 million votes (or about 95.6% of all votes cast) were cast in favor of our non-binding resolution approving the compensation paid to our named executive officers during 2017.  The compensation committee considered this vote to be an endorsement of our compensation program, including our balance between cash and equity and between performance and non-performance-based compensation.  At our 2019 annual meeting, shareholders are being asked to adopt a non-binding resolution approving the compensation paid to our named executive officers in 2018, as discussed in more detail below in the "Proposals" section under the heading "Proposal 3 - Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation."
CHANGES TO OUR PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES
Effective in 2018, we substantially modified our performance-based incentives, whether payable in cash or Renasant stock.  Our changes are intended to strengthen the financial alignment of our executives and shareholders by increasing the number and type of measures we use to evaluate and reward the performance of our executives, by measuring our performance against the performance of our peer group, and by measuring performance that is sustained over a longer term.  More specifically:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Modification of Annual Cash Incentives 
  Change: The compensation committee added return on average tangible common equity, ROTCE, relative to a performance peer group (discussed below) as a performance measure; earnings per share, EPS, and net revenue per share, NRPS, each measured on an absolute basis, were retained as performance metrics. 
  Purpose: ROTCE measures how effectively we have deployed our capital; it is intended to measure the profitable use of capital as we grow.  ROTCE complements our historical measures, EPS and NRPS, since the historical measures do not always correlate to increases in equity.  Using a performance peer group permits us to compare our returns to those of companies with similar characteristics. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Modification of Equity Incentives 
  Changes:• The performance cycle was increased from one year to three years. 
• ROTCE, return on average tangible assets, or ROTA, and total shareholder return, or TSR, replaced performance metrics used in previous years. 
• Performance is measured relative to the performance of a peer group. 
  Purposes:• A longer performance cycle is designed to focus on and reward longer term performance and more closely align our practices with those of our peers. 
• The new measures broaden the measures we use to determine success and are more consistent with the longer cycle. 
Performance Peer Group 
  Change:   A "performance peer group" was identified and used to determine relative performance. 
  Purposes:• Relative performance permits us to directly compare our performance to those of our peers and more closely align our practices with those of our peers 
• Relative performance mitigates against compensation fluctuations based on our absolute performance, such as aquisitions. 
[END TABLE]
FEATURES AND OBJECTIVES OF OUR 2018 COMPENSATION PROGRAM
Compensation Opportunities. The following table summarizes the fixed and variable compensation opportunities that we provided in 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Fixed Compensation      
  Features   Objectives 
Base Salary Determined annually, based on analysis of individual performance,  internal pay equity, and peer group practices   To provide a source of stable or fixed income based on skills and competencies 
Variable Compensation     
  Features   Objectives 
Cash Awards Annual cash payments under our Performance Based Rewards Plan, "PBRP," based on attainment of performance measures at threshold, target or superior levels• To reward short-term Company-wide performance 
Performance-Based Equity Awards Payouts based on three performance measures at threshold, target or superior levels• To reward long-term Company-wide performance 
• To align the financial interests of our NEOs with our shareholders by increasing stock ownership 
Time-Based Equity Awards Fixed service period• To serve as a retention device 
• To align the financial interests of our named executives with our shareholders by increasing stock ownership 
[END TABLE]
Amounts of Fixed and Variable Compensation. In 2018, our executive compensation program continued to focus on the alignment of the financial interests of our executives with those of our shareholders, by tying a significant amount of each executive's compensation to the short- and long-term performance of the Company. For our chief executive officer, the committee limits fixed compensation or base salary to not more than 35% of total compensation, with the remainder delivered in the form of variable compensation (compensation that is tied to the performance of the Company  or the value of our stock); for our executives other than the chief executive officer, the committee limits fixed compensation to not more than 50% of total compensation, with the remainder delivered as variable compensation.
The charts below illustrate the 2018 total compensation mix (fixed and variable) for Mr. Waycaster and the average for our other named executives, excluding Mr. Morgan, assuming target levels of performance.
n Fixed - Base Salary n Variable - Time-based Equity n Variable - Performance-based Equity n Variable - Performance-based Cash
Employment Agreements. We have entered into employment agreements with each of our named executives.  The agreements are primarily intended to promote retention, impose standard covenants that protect our property and business and ensure that the compensation for each of our named executives remains relatively consistent.  More information about the terms of our currently effective employment agreements can be found below in the "Compensation Tables" section under the heading "Payments and Rights on Termination and Change in Control."
We amended our employment agreements with Messrs. McGraw and Hart, to reflect Mr. McGraw's transition to our Executive Chairman and Mr. Hart's transition to the Chairman of our Middle Tennessee division.  In consideration of these transitions, Messrs. McGraw and Hart each agreed to base salary reductions and to the modification or reduction of certain other benefits.  These modifications and reductions are described more fully below under the heading "Compensation Decisions Made for 2018" and in the "Compensation Tables" section under the heading "Payments and Rights on Termination and Change in Control."
Peer Groups. For 2018, we used a "compensation peer group" to evaluate whether our total compensation remains competitive and is generally "in line" with other opportunities that may be available to our executive team, and for the first time we used a "performance peer group" to evaluate relative performance for our incentive payouts, as explained above under the heading "Changes to Our Performance Incentives."  In each case, the committee was advised by our independent compensation consultant, Pearl Meyer.
Our compensation peer group consists of financial institutions that are located in the south and southeast regions and that service communities similar in size to those we service.  We use these parameters to avoid a bias towards higher compensation levels that predominate in financial centers and larger metropolitan areas.  The compensation committee approved the compensation peer group in the fall of 2017, when it began the process of determining 2018 compensation levels.  The 20 institutions selected had the following characteristics when the compensation peer group was determined:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Characteristics   Range   Median Renasant Characteristics 
Total assets   $5.0 billion - $23.1 billion   $10.9 billion $10.0 billion 
Market value of stock   $0.7 billion - $5.6 billion   $2.1 billion $2.0 billion 
Net income   $50 million - $344 million   $111 million $96.0 million 
[END TABLE]
 Pearl Meyer did not recommend any changes to the compensation peer group from the 2017 group, and the compensation committee concurred in this recommendation.  The financial institutions included in our compensation peer group for 2018 were:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Ameris Bancorp Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc. 
BancFirst Corporation Republic Bancorp, Inc. 
BancorpSouth Bank (formerly, BancorpSouth, Inc.) ServisFirst Bankshares, Inc. 
Bank OZK (formerly, Bank of the Ozarks, Inc.) Simmons First National Corporation 
Capital Bank Financial Corp. South State Corporation 
FCB Financial Holdings, Inc. Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. 
First Financial Bankshares, Inc. Trustmark Corporation 
Home BancShares, Inc. (Conway, AR) United Bankshares, Inc. 
Iberiabank Corporation United Community Banks, Inc. 
Old National Bancorp WesBanco, Inc. 
[END TABLE]
Our performance peer group consists of more than 35 institutions, representing all U.S. publicly-traded financial institutions with assets between $10 billion and $20 billion.  Because this peer group has no regional limitation and its members are selected solely on asset size, we can more accurately measure our performance against institutions possessing similar characteristics; these criteria also mitigate against the positive bias that would be created using some of the smaller institutions included in our compensation peer group. 
Each of these peer groups may be adjusted in the future to reflect any changes to our characteristics (asset size, geographic footprint, etc.) to ensure that each peer group continues to be an effective tool to assist the committee in formulating a compensation package for our executives that fulfills the objectives of our compensation program.
Benefits and Perquisites. Our executive compensation program focuses on the delivery of appropriate levels of direct compensation, with the view that each of our named executives should be provided with basic perquisites and benefits and the opportunity to voluntarily save for retirement and other financial needs on a tax-deferred basis.  Consistent with this focus, during 2018 our named executives had access to the following benefits and perquisites:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Insurance-type benefits that are generally available to all employees of the Company, including health care coverage and life and disability benefits, with some additional life insurance coverage for all officers of the Company. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A broad-based 401(k) plan, including Company matching and profit-sharing contributions. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Two voluntary executive savings plans, our Deferred Stock Unit Plan, or the DSU Plan, and our Executive Deferred Income Plan, or the Deferred Income Plan.  Amounts deferred under the DSU Plan are notionally invested in our common stock; amounts deferred under the Deferred Income Plan may be notionally invested in investment options similar to those available under our 401(k) plan.  With the exception of a contribution for the benefit of Mr. McGraw in 2018, we do not contribute to these arrangements. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Dues for memberships in professional and civic organizations, country club dues and car allowances. 
[END TABLE]
More information about our benefit plans, including legacy arrangements under which benefits no longer accrue, can be found in the "Compensation Tables" section under the headings "Pension and SERP Benefits" and "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation."  Additional information about the types and value of the perquisites provided to our named executives, including our contribution for Mr. McGraw, can be found in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in the column "All Other Compensation."
RISK MITIGATION PRACTICES AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE PROCESS
Risk Management and Compensation Governance. The committee has adopted a number of policies and practices that are intended to strengthen the relationship between shareholder value and pay, avoid unsafe and unsound practices, mitigate risk, reduce the use of discretion and eliminate the potential for unintended windfalls.  Below is a summary of some of these policies and practices. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Our Polices and Practices 
  Clawback Policies We have two clawback policies that apply to all performance-based compensation.  For awards made under our LTIP, if we are required to restate our financial results, performance-based restricted stock awards, including vested awards, will be subject to reduction, forfeiture or recovery if the number of shares of common stock awarded would have been smaller based on the restated results.  The LTIP policy permits recovery from our named executives whether or not they engaged in the conduct that materially contributes to the restatement.  We maintain a separate clawback policy that applies to performance-based compensation awarded under either the PBRP and the LTIP.  This policy applies to a named executive if his intentional or unlawful conduct materially contributed to a financial restatement, and its application may be waived in the discretion of the committee. 
  Stock Ownership Guidelines We have implemented stock ownership guidelines applicable to our executive officers.  Under the updated guidelines, our executive officers are required to beneficially own common stock having a fair market value not less than: 
      Chief Executive Officer 300% of base salary   
      Other Named Executive Officers 200% of base salary   
      All Other Executive Officers 100% of base salary   
    All shares directly or indirectly owned by an executive, including shares owned by immediate family members and shares held in our 401(k) plan, and stock units credited under the DSU Plan, are counted toward an executive's stock ownership.  Time-based restricted stock awards are also counted.  Shares that an executive has pledged do not count toward the satisfaction of an executive's minimum ownership requirements, nor do restricted stock awards that are subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions. 
    As of January 1, 2019 the stock ownership of each of our named executives substantially exceeded the share ownership amounts set forth in the guidelines: 
      Executive Common Stock                    Beneficially Owned                              (% of Base Salary)   
      Mr. McGraw 1,018%   
      Mr. Waycaster 444%   
      Mr. Chapman 461%   
      Mr. Hart 512%   
      Mr. Cochran 483%   
      Mr. Morgan 2,115%   
    Information about the stock ownership of our directors and named executives can be found in the "Stock Ownership" section below under the heading "Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock by Directors and Executive Officers." 
  Holding Period for LTIP Awards As a condition of awards under our LTIP, our senior executive officers must hold "net shares" for a period of two years after vesting.  This holding period is waived in the event of death or disability or upon the occurrence of a change in control.  "Net shares" are shares delivered after vesting and the withholding for the payment of taxes. 
  Double Trigger for Change in Control Benefits All equity incentives awarded under our LTIP and our change in control agreements include a double-trigger feature.  If a change in control of the Company occurs, an executive's employment also must be terminated within two years of such change in order to accelerate vesting or trigger the payment of a benefit. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Practices That We Prohibit or Discourage 
  Anti-Hedging; Pledging We have implemented a hedging and pledging policy under which our named executives (and our directors, officers and certain other employees) cannot enter into a transaction that has the effect of hedging the economic risks associated with the ownership of our common stock.  Although the policy does not completely prohibit pledging of our common stock, we discourage the practice, and any stock that an executive pledges cannot be used to satisfy our stock ownership guidelines. 
  Limits on the Use of Discretion We limit the compensation committee's use of discretion with respect to outstanding equity awards: 
• Discretionary vesting of equity awards is not permitted under the LTIP.  
• In determining the amount of performance-based compensation that has been earned, the committee may use only "negative discretion" to reduce the amount of an award that it believes is excessive or does not accurately represent our performance. 
• We do not consider individual or subjective performance when determining bonuses or stock awards for our named executives. 
  No Gross Ups The committee does not enter into agreements or approve payments that will, directly or indirectly, result in tax gross ups for change in control payments.  Mr. McGraw's and Mr. Hart's employment agreements previously had a tax gross-up provision and a "best net" provision, respectively.  These provisions were eliminated effective May 1, 2018. 
  Timing of Equity Awards Equity awards are made at meetings of our committee and board that are scheduled well in advance, without regard to whether we have recently announced, or intend to announce, material information to the public.  We do this to avoid the inference that we have "timed" an award or manipulated the market.  Awards may be made effective when ratified by our full board or may be effective prospectively, on a specified date. 
[END TABLE]
Compensation Consultant. For 2018, the committee retained Pearl Meyer to serve as its executive compensation adviser.  The charter of the compensation committee requires the committee to consider whether its advisers are independent based on the factors set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and the committee has determined that Pearl Meyer was independent in 2018.  Pearl Meyer works at the direction of the committee, and the decision to retain Pearl Meyer was at the sole discretion of the committee.
In connection with the committee's 2018 compensation decisions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In the fall of 2017, Pearl Meyer recommended that no change be made to the financial institutions included in our compensation peer group and provided a review and analysis of the compensation levels and programs of companies within the peer group.

[END TABLE]
No additional services were provided by Pearl Meyer to the committee or the Company. Information furnished by Pearl Meyer is one factor the committee uses when it makes decisions about compensation; other factors are described elsewhere in this CD&A.
Tax Considerations. Prior to 2018, compensation paid to our named executives in excess of $1 million was nondeductible, unless structured as "performance-based" compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. We considered performance-based restricted stock awards under our LTIP as  "performance-based" under Section 162(m), and we excluded the value of the awards from the determination of the $1 million limit.  The performance-based exception to the $1 million limit was repealed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effective as of January 1, 2018.   The compensation committee did not significantly modify its practices in 2018 in response to the law change, believing that our compensation program should be broadly structured to address Company's objectives,   rather than to address the tax treatment of any individual item of compensation.
Management Involvement In Compensation Decisions. Our chief executive officer is expected to regularly evaluate and recommend base salary adjustments for our executive officers, other than himself.  In addition, he will, with the assistance of management, regularly provide data and analysis about Company and individual performance for use by the committee in determining base salary adjustments and potential payouts for our executives.  Finally, the chief executive officer is expected to monitor our perquisites and benefits to ensure that they remain competitive and consistent with the goals of our compensation program.  Mr. McGraw, our chief executive officer until May 1, 2018, fulfilled all of these responsibilities with respect to 2018 compensation.  Although our named executives frequently attend meetings at the request of the compensation committee, during 2018 a portion of each of the committee's meetings was in executive session without management present.  During these sessions the committee made its individual compensation decisions.
Meetings and Decision-Making Process. For the purposes of setting fiscal year 2018 compensation and determining payouts under the PBRP and the LTIP for the 2018 fiscal year, our compensation committee met three times in 2017, once in 2018 and once in 2019 (there were additional meetings in 2018 on other matters).  The following table illustrates the decision-making process used to set and determine compensation for the 2018 fiscal year:

COMPENSATION DECISIONS MADE FOR 2018
Base Salary Adjustments. Base salary adjustments for each executive are dependent upon individual performance, current title or responsibilities, additional responsibilities assumed, peer group evaluation and progress towards achieving our strategic goals.  The committee recommended the following adjustments to base salary, effective as of January 1, 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
2018 BASE SALARY ADJUSTMENTS 
    Base Salary (2018)  Base Salary (2017)% Change 
    Base Salary (2018)  Base Salary (2017)% Change 
Mr. McGraw   $ 840,000   (1)  $ 800,000     5.0% 
Mr. Waycaster   630,000     510,000     23.5% 
Mr. Chapman   475,000     425,000     11.8% 
Mr. Hart   508,000   (2)  508,000     —% 
Mr. Cochran   400,000     375,000     6.7% 
[END TABLE]
Annual Cash Awards. Annual cash awards are made under our Performance Based Rewards Plan, which we call the PBRP.  Payments to our named executives, other than Mr. Hart, are based entirely on Company-wide performance, because our named executives possess the ability to directly influence corporate-level results.  Payments to Mr. Hart also consider regional performance, since he has primary responsibility for one of our banking regions.
Awards for 2018 were based on three Company-wide performance measures: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Diluted earnings per share, or EPS, measured on an absolute basis; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Net revenue per share, or NRPS, measured on an absolute basis; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Return on average tangible common equity, or ROTCE, measured relative to our performance peer group.  
[END TABLE]
The committee selected EPS and NRPS as measures because it believes that EPS and revenue growth are directly correlated to the delivery of shareholder value, that the measures are appropriate given the annual cycle of the incentive and that absolute performance more accurately measures the delivery of value in the economic and interest rate environment existing in 2018.  ROTCE was added because this measure indicates how profitably we used our capital as we grew during 2018; it is measured on a relative basis so that the committee can compare our returns to those of financial institutions with similar characteristics.
For Mr. Hart, regional performance was based on five performance measures: growth in net revenue; the ratio of noninterest expense to average assets; the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans; the ratio of loans 30-89 days past due to average loans; and the ratio of nonperforming loans to average loans.  The committee believes that these metrics accurately indicate the performance of the region Mr. Hart oversees.
Payouts under the PBRP are based upon the attainment of threshold, target or superior performance.  Target performance levels for Company-wide measures are first derived from our budget, as approved by the board.  The budgeted results are also compared with estimates obtained from investment analysts who regularly follow our performance, which provides assurance that targeted levels represent substantial goals. Target performance levels for Mr. Hart's regional measures are derived from the budget for the applicable region.  For Company-wide and regional  measures, threshold performance is set at approximately 5% below target, and superior performance is set at approximately 5% above target. 
The committee believes that diluted earnings per share is more indicative of overall performance and the delivery of shareholder value than either net revenue per share or ROTCE, and it weighted that measure most heavily.  The table below indicates the weighting given to each measure and the specific threshold, target and superior performance levels designated by the committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
2018 COMPANY-WIDE PERFORMANCE MEASURES 
Performance Measure Weight Threshold  Performance Target  Performance Superior  Performance 
    Per share 
Diluted earnings per share (EPS) 50% $ 2.75   $ 2.89   $ 3.03   
Net revenue per share (NRPS) 20% 9.99   10.52   11.05   
    Peer Percentile 
Return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) 30% 25th   50th   75th   
[END TABLE]
Potential payouts for threshold, target and superior performance are expressed as a percentage of each executive's base salary; there are no payouts for performance below threshold. With the exception of Mr. Waycaster, whose potential payouts were increased to reflect that he would begin to serve as our chief executive officer in May 2018, and Mr. Chapman, whose potential payouts were increased to reflect his additional role as our chief operating officer, potential payouts were the same in 2018 and 2017.

Mr. Waycaster 40% 80% 160% 
Mr. Chapman 30% 60% 120% 
Other named executives 25% 50% 100% 
[END TABLE]
The committee certified that for 2018 our EPS, after excluding unusual or infrequently-occurring items as required under the PBRP, was $2.97, our NRPS was $10.41, and our ROTCE fell within the 69th percentile among the performance peer group. Our EPS performance was between the target and superior performance levels, our NRPS performance was between the threshold and target performance levels, and our ROTCE performance was between the target and superior performance levels.  These outcomes resulted in the following payouts:

Equity Awards. For 2018, our named executives received variable compensation in the form of restricted stock awards under our LTIP.  Each executive received performance-based and time-based awards, as follows: (1) a time-based award; (2) a performance-based award with a three-year performance cycle; and (3) a performance-based "transition" award with a one-year performance cycle. Time- and performance-based awards generally cover a substantially equal number of shares, reflecting the committee's view that strategic compensation goals and performance-based compensation are equally important. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Time-Based Awards.  Time-based awards serve as a retention device and as variable compensation that further ties the financial interests of our executives to the performance of the Company and our stock.  The service or retention period for our time-based awards is generally three years, but for Messrs. McGraw and Hart a one-year period was considered more appropriate given their change in status in 2018.  The table below describes the time-based awards made to our named executive officers for 2018. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2018 Time-Based Awards

Mr. Hart(1) 2,933   January 1, 2018 January 1, 2019 
Mr. Cochran 4,000   January 1, 2018 January 1, 2021 
(1) Awards for Messrs. McGraw and Hart were determined with reference to awards made to them in 2017, reduced to generally correspond to the 40% base salary reductions that occurred on May 1, 2018 and September 1, 2018, respectively. 
• Performance-Based Awards With Three-Year Performance Cycle.  For 2018, we increased the performance cycle applicable to our performance-based awards from one year to three years, permitting us to evaluate and reward longer-term performance.  These awards will vest, if at all, on December 31, 2020.  Payouts will be determined using three new Company-wide performance measures: (1) ROTCE, (2) return on average tangible assets, or ROTA, and (3) total shareholder return, or TSR, all measured relative to our performance peer group. 
[END TABLE]
The committee's use of ROTCE as a performance measure is discussed above under the "Annual Cash Awards" heading.  ROTA was used as a performance measure because it indicates how effective our executives are in generating profits from our tangible assets.  TSR, which measures the internal rate of return of all cash flows to shareholders over a specified period, was used because it measures the creation of long-term value for our shareholders.  By comparing ROTCE, ROTA and TSR to a performance peer group, our executives are rewarded only if our performance meets or exceeds the performance of our peers in these areas, regardless of whether these measures improve in an absolute sense.
The committee believes that ROTCE and ROTA equally measure overall performance, and so it weighted these measures equally.  TSR was given a lesser weighting because this measure may be impacted by macroeconomic factors that are outside the control of our executives.  The table below indicates the weighting given to each measure and the specific threshold, target and superior performance levels designated by the committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
2018 PERFORMANCE MEASURES - THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE CYCLE

(1) Awards for Messrs. McGraw and Hart were determined with reference to awards made to them in 2017, reduced to correspond to the 40% reduction in their base salaries that occurred during 2018. 
• Transition Awards.  To provide an orderly transition to our new three-year performance cycle, the committee also made performance-based awards with a one-year performance cycle.  These "transition" awards use the following performance measures: ROTCE and ROTA, measured relative to our performance peer group, and EPS, measured on an absolute basis. 
[END TABLE]
For the same reasons described above with respect to awards subject to our three-year performance cycle, the committee weighted ROTCE and ROTA equally.  EPS, which was given a lesser weighting, was used instead of TSR because the committee determined that, over a one-year period, EPS was a better measure of the growth of shareholder value.  The table below indicates the weighting given to each measure and the specific threshold, target and superior performance levels designated by the committee.

The committee certified that our ROTCE for 2018 fell within the 69th percentile among the performance peer group, our 2018 ROTA fell within the 67th percentile among the performance peer group, and our EPS, after excluding unusual or infrequently-occurring events as required under the LTIP, was $2.97. For each of ROTCE, ROTA and EPS, our performance was between the target and superior performance levels.  These outcomes resulted in the following payouts, in shares (the total dollar value of these payouts is listed in the Summary Compensation Table below in the "Stock Awards" column):

(2) Mr. Cochran became a named executive in 2017.  SEC rules permit us to omit compensation information for years prior to the individual becoming a named executive officer. 
(3) Mr. Morgan became a named executive officer in 2018 in connection with our acquisition of Brand.   As part of the acquisition, Mr. Morgan and Brand negotiated and entered into an agreement providing for the termination and disposition of certain benefits and perquisites provided to him by Brand, including the payout of designated amounts.  We agreed to make the payments if not completed by Brand prior to the acquisition.  Because these payments relate to services performed by Mr. Morgan for Brand, they are not reflected in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table above or described elsewhere in this proxy statement. Details about these payments may be found in the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the Brand acquisition that we filed with the SEC on June 27, 2018. 
• Column C - Salary - Amounts included in this column represent base salary earned by our named executives in 2018, 2017 and 2016, some of which may have been voluntarily deferred under our 401(k) plan or our two non-qualified deferred compensation plans, the Deferred Income Plan and the DSU Plan. 
• Column D - Bonus - Amounts in this column report cash bonuses paid on a discretionary basis.  Discretionary bonuses were not a component of our compensation program during 2018, 2017 or 2016.  Mr. Morgan received a prorated bonus for his service after our acquisition of Brand.  We consider this a discretionary bonus because it was not made using the performance measures applicable during 2018 under our PBRP. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Columns E and F - Stock Awards; Option Awards - Amounts in these columns represent the value of non-cash compensation granted or awarded under our LTIP, which may be performance-based or time-based.  Performance-based awards may or may not be earned by any executive, depending upon the achievement of performance objectives.  Options were not a component of our compensation during 2018, 2017 or 2016. 
• Column G - Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation - Amounts in this column represent cash bonuses paid under our PBRP based upon the achievement of performance measures.  Some of these amounts may have been voluntarily deferred under our 401(k) plan, Deferred Income Plan or DSU Plan. 
• Column H - Changes in Pension Value and Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Earnings - Amounts in this column represent (1) changes in the actuarial value of benefits accrued under our tax-qualified pension plan and Mr. Hart's non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans, or SERPs, and (2) any above-market earnings credited under our Deferred Income Plan. 
• Column I - All Other Compensation - Amounts in this column represent the value of other compensation we pay or provide to our named executives, such as car allowances and membership dues. 
[END TABLE]
Restricted Stock Awards. Amounts reported in the Column E, labeled "Stock Awards," represent the value of restricted stock awarded under our LTIP, including performance and time-based awards.  The dollar amounts reflect the aggregate fair value of the awards, determined as of the date of award, calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, "Stock Compensation," referred to as "Topic 718."  Dividends payable on restricted stock awards are not included in our fair value determination.  For performance-based awards, amounts included in this column reflect the probable outcome of the performance conditions determined as of the date of award, which we consider to be the target award, consistent with our estimate of the aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the applicable service period as of the award date under Topic 718.  As permitted under the guidance in Topic 718, the Company has elected to account for forfeitures in compensation cost when they occur.  The fair value of the performance awards on the award date, assuming that superior performance was achieved, rather than target performance as reported in the table, was $1,226,700, $920,025, $613,350, $327,120, and $490,680 for Messrs. McGraw, Waycaster, Chapman, Hart and Cochran, respectively.  Mr. Morgan was not eligible to receive a restricted stock award in 2018.  Please refer to Note 14, "Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation Plans," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for details regarding the assumptions we used to determine the fair value of our restricted stock awards.
The number of target shares that corresponds to the value of our performance-based restricted awards included in Column E above is also listed in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table that follows.  Further information about why LTIP awards are made, the relationship of LTIP awards to other compensation components, the differences between performance and time-based awards and among performance-based awards, the specific performance measures designated by the compensation committee over the applicable performance cycle, and potential shares receivable for threshold, target and superior performance can be found in the CD&A, under the heading "Compensation Decisions Made in 2018," in the paragraph labeled "Equity Awards."  The Option Exercises and Vested Restricted Stock table below sets forth the actual number of shares of restricted stock received upon vesting at the end of 2018.
Cash Bonuses. The amounts listed in Column G, labeled "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation," reflect annual cash bonuses earned and paid under the PBRP, all of which are subject to the attainment of performance measures.  More information about why annual cash bonuses are made, the relationship of annual cash bonuses to other compensation components, the specific performance goals designated by the compensation committee, and potential amounts payable for threshold, target and superior performance can be found in the CD&A, under the heading "Compensation Decisions Made in 2018," in the paragraph labeled "Annual Cash Awards."  A prorated bonus was paid to Mr. Morgan for services he rendered in 2018 after our acquisition of Brand.  Because his bonus was not determined using the performance measures applicable under the PBRP, we consider Mr. Morgan's bonus to be a discretionary bonus and included the amount in Column D.
Changes in Pension Value and Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Earnings. Amounts reported in Column H, labeled "Changes in Pension Value and Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Earnings," reflect above-market earnings on deferrals credited to our Deferred Income Plan and the year-over-year change in the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits under our pension plan and Mr. Hart's SERPs.  Earnings are considered "above-market" only if the credited interest rate exceeded 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate, with compounding, as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service.  For 2018, the aggregate amount in Column H is made up as follows:

[END TABLE]
All Other Compensation. In addition to the amounts described above, we provide or pay certain additional amounts for the benefit of our named executives, the value of which is included in Column I, labeled "All Other Compensation." These amounts include contributions to our 401(k) plan, group term life and disability insurance premiums, dividends on restricted stock awards, automobile allowances, dues for memberships in professional and civic organizations and country club dues.  Mr. McGraw, our chief executive officer, also receives a contribution to our Deferred Income Plan and a tax gross-up based on the value of his automobile allowance, both of which are contractual payments.  The "Insurance Premiums" column below reflects a $2,537,238 payment we made to Mr. Morgan under the terms of the agreement entered into by Mr. Morgan and Brand as a part of the Brand acquisition.  The payment represents aggregate premium payments on individual policies of life insurance owned by Mr. Morgan due for periods after our acquisition of Brand.  The premium payment obligation was part of Mr. Morgan's employment agreement with Brand; we decided to settle the obligation since we do not provide or support individual life insurance policies as an executive benefit.

The Bank maintains a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, called the Renasant Bank Amended and Restated Pension Plan, under which no participants have been added, no additional benefits have been earned and no additional service has been credited since December 31, 1996.  Of our named executives, only Mr. McGraw and Mr. Waycaster participated in and have accrued benefits under the pension plan.  Years of credited service included in Column C in the table above reflect service determined as of December 31, 1996; the accumulated benefits included in Column D in the table above reflect the present value, at December 31, 2018, of benefits earned as of December 31, 1996.  The benefits of Mr. McGraw and Mr. Waycaster have fully vested, and they have satisfied the age and service conditions necessary for normal or early retirement, as defined in the pension plan.
In connection with our acquisition of Capital in July 2007, we assumed two SERPs for the benefit of Mr. Hart.  Mr. Hart has earned and is fully vested in the maximum benefit payable from the SERPs, which is an aggregate annual payment of $155,000, subject to a contractual cost of living adjustment in the amount of 3% each year.  Benefits are payable annually for the 15-year period following the termination of Mr. Hart's employment for any reason, except that he will forfeit his benefits if he is involuntarily terminated by us for cause.  Mr. Hart's transition to chairman of our Middle Tennessee division is not considered a termination of employment under his SERPs.
Information about the valuation methods and assumptions we used to determine the accumulated benefits included under the pension plan and the SERPs reflected in Column D in the table above may be found in Note 14, "Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation Plans," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

• The ratio of Mr. Waycaster's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our median employee was 42.0 to 1 (we refer to this ratio as the "CEO pay ratio"). 
[END TABLE]
We had two principal executive officers in 2018 - Mr. McGraw and Mr. Waycaster.  In such event, to calculate the CEO pay ratio, SEC rules permit us to use the compensation paid to the individual serving as principal executive officer on the same date that is selected to identify our median employee, which was December 31, 2018 (as discussed below).  When this method is used, SEC rules require that we annualize the principal executive officer's compensation.  Mr. Waycaster's compensation did not increase when he assumed the chief executive officer position, so his actual compensation for 2018 is the same as his annualized compensation.
Identifying our Median Employee. As explained above, our median employee is the individual whose compensation is greater than one-half of our employees and less than one-half, excluding Mr. Waycaster. SEC rules require a company to identify its median employee only once every three years unless there is a material change to the company's employee population or compensation arrangements.  We acquired Brand on September 1, 2018, which we concluded resulted in a material change in our employee population for 2018, and we identified a new median employee for  purposes of this year's CEO pay ratio calculations.
To identify the specific individual whom we have considered our median employee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We first determined our employees as of December 31, 2018.  Full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees, and employees who joined us when we completed the Brand acquisition on September 1, 2018, were included, but independent contractors, leased employees and similar workers were not.  On December 31, 2018, our total employee population was 2,432, and the number of independent contractors, leased employees and similar workers was not material. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We then "ordered" our employees based on a consistently-applied, representative measure of compensation we selected, which was total cash compensation paid to each employee. We adjusted these amounts by annualizing the compensation for full-time and part-time individuals who were employed on December 31, 2018 but did not work the entire year, including former Brand employees who joined us when we completed the acquisition.  No full-time equivalent adjustments were made for part-time individuals, and we did not annualize the compensation of any temporary or seasonal employees. 
[END TABLE]
Calculation of the CEO Pay Ratio. The CEO pay ratio compares the annual total compensation of Mr. Waycaster to the annual total compensation of our median employee.  For this comparison, we are required to calculate Mr. Waycaster's "annual total compensation" as the amount we reported in the "Total" column of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table above, which we elected to increase by the value of the insurance premiums we paid for coverage under our medical and dental plans in the amount of $6,539.
We calculated the annual total compensation of our median employee "as if" the amount would be reported in the "Total" column of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, also increased by the value of the insurance premiums we paid for coverage under medical and dental plans in the amount of $7,488. This amount is different (greater) than the amount of our median employee's total cash compensation because it includes some non-cash items, such as the value of our contributions to the 401(k) plan.  We calculated the annual total compensation of our median employee on this basis because it permits us to more accurately compare the total compensation received by this employee to the total compensation of Mr. Waycaster.
PAYMENTS AND RIGHTS ON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
General. Our named executives may receive compensation in the event of termination of employment.  The compensation is payable under the terms of the employment agreements we have entered into with each of our named executives and under individual awards made under the LTIP.  The amount, nature and availability of compensation generally depends upon the circumstances of termination, which may include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Termination by the Company for cause; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Retirement or other voluntary termination; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Death or disability; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Termination by the Company without cause or a named executive's constructive termination; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Termination in connection with a change in control; or 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The expiration of an employment agreement. 
[END TABLE]
More information about the compensation our named executives may receive in each of these circumstances is below.  The amount of compensation included in the tables below is based on the stated assumptions; it is important to note that the actual compensation received by an executive will be contingent upon a number of factors that are presently indeterminable, such as the date of termination, the circumstances giving rise to termination, base salary at the time of termination, the performance of the Company in the year of termination, the specific terms of any employment agreement in effect at the time of termination, and the specific terms of any individual grant or award made under our PBRP and LTIP.  The descriptions below are based on our agreements in effect as of December 31, 2018, which may be different at the time of an executive's termination. Employment Agreements. The Company entered into employment agreements with Messrs. McGraw and Hart, effective as of January 1, 2008 and July 1, 2007, respectively, and each of these agreements was amended in 2018 to reflect our succession plans. These amendments reduced base salary and resulted in corresponding reductions in certain benefits and other amounts. Effective as of January 1, 2016, the Company entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Waycaster, Chapman and Cochran, which were amended, effective January 1, 2018, to increase the amount payable in the event of a change in control or qualifying separation.  We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Morgan, effective as of September 1, 2018, in connection with our acquisition of Brand. More information about these agreements is provided below.
Unconditional Payments. Regardless of the circumstances of his termination, each of our named executives will receive certain unconditional payments, including (1) earned base salary, (2) any cash bonus for a fiscal year proceeding the year in which the termination occurs that has not been paid and (3) vested account balances maintained in our 401(k) plan, pension plan and non-qualified deferred compensation plans.  More information about these plans may be found in the CD&A and in the descriptions following the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.  We have not otherwise described or quantified these amounts below.
Restrictive Covenants. As consideration for the payments that are described below, each of our named executives has agreed to certain restrictive covenants limiting their activities after separation from employment, generally as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each executive may not solicit our customers and depositors or our employees for two years following his separation for any reason, except for Mr. Hart, whose covenant has a one-year duration. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each executive is subject to a non-competition restriction that begins at the time of his separation.  The duration of the restriction is two years for Mr. McGraw and one year for Mr. Hart.  The duration of the restriction for Messrs. Waycaster, Chapman, Cochran and Morgan is two years for separation following a change in control and one year following other types of separation. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each executive must protect our confidential information and trade secrets indefinitely. 
[END TABLE]
Termination by the Company for Cause. Under the employment agreements with our named executives, no benefits or payments vest or become payable if we terminate the executive for cause, except for the unconditional payments described above or as may be required by law.  Certain vested benefits may be forfeited in the event of our termination of employment for cause, including vested options and Mr. Hart's SERPs.  Generally, "cause" includes an executive's: (1) commission of willful misconduct materially injurious to us, including the improper disclosure of our confidential information; (2) indictment for a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude; (3) willful failure to perform the duties of his position with us; (4) breach of an applicable code of conduct, code of ethics or similar rules adopted by us; (5) a material violation of applicable securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; or (6) the willful breach of his employment agreement that is not cured after notice.
Retirement or Other Voluntary Termination. A named executive is considered "retired" when he voluntarily separates from employment without cause on or after age 55 and after completing at least ten years of service with Renasant.  As of December 31, 2018, Mr. McGraw, Mr. Waycaster, Mr. Hart and Mr. Cochran had attained age 55 and could retire.  Except as provided below and the unconditional payments described above, we do not provide our executives with any specific retirement payments or benefits:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For eligible employees employed by the Company as of December 31, 2004, including their eligible dependents, we provide access to retiree medical benefits until age 65, and we pay a portion of the premium; only Mr. Waycaster is covered under the plan.  If Mr. Waycaster had retired as of December 31, 2018, he would receive contributions towards retiree coverage in an approximate amount of $7,375, representing contributions for Mr. Waycaster and his spouse. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If a named executive retires during our fiscal year, he will receive his annual cash bonus under the PBRP, to the extent that applicable performance measures are achieved during the fiscal year in which his retirement occurs, prorated to reflect his period of service before retirement. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If a named executive retires during our fiscal year, he will receive his performance-based restricted stock award at the end of the applicable performance cycle, to the extent that applicable performance measures are achieved during the cycle, subject to proration to reflect his period of service before retirement. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Time-based restricted stock awards will be prorated based on actual service prior to retirement and vest. 
[END TABLE]
If a named executive voluntarily terminates his employment before retirement, he receives no specific payments or benefits, other than the unconditional payments described above and benefits that may be required by law.
Death or Disability. If a named executive dies or becomes disabled while employed by us, he will receive the unconditional payments described above and one or more of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For all of our officers, including our named executives, we provide life insurance protection in an amount equal to 250% of each officer's base salary, subject to medical underwriting if the amount of the coverage exceeds $600,000. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each of our named executives, other than Mr. McGraw, will receive a cash bonus under the PBRP, to the extent that performance measures are achieved during the applicable performance cycle in which his death or disability occurs, prorated to reflect the period of service before death or disability.  Mr. McGraw will receive the amount of his target bonus, prorated to reflect his period of service. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For our named executives, other than Mr. McGraw, each executive's performance-based restricted stock award will vest at the end of the applicable performance cycle to the extent that the performance measures are acheived, subject to proration for service rendered before death or disability.  Mr. McGraw will receive his target award at the time of his death or disability, prorated to reflect his period of service during the applicable performance cycle. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each executive's time-based restricted stock award will be prorated for service rendered before his death or disability and vest. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Messrs. McGraw and Waycaster, who participate in our Deferred Income Plan, will receive a preretirement death benefit in the event either should die while employed by us. 
[END TABLE]
Involuntary Termination Without Cause or Constructive Termination. Under our employment agreement with Mr. McGraw, if he is involuntarily terminated by us without cause or in the event of his constructive termination, he will receive the unconditional payments described above and:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• He will receive a cash payment equal to two times his annualized base salary and the amount of his target bonus; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• His performance-based restricted stock awards, which will vest at target; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• His time-based restricted stock award, which will vest and be prorated based upon his period of service; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will pay premiums for the period of continuation coverage available to him and his eligible dependents under Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code, commonly referred to as "COBRA." 
[END TABLE]
Under our employment agreements with Messrs. Waycaster, Chapman, Hart, Cochran and Morgan, if any of them is involuntarily terminated by us without cause or in the event of a constructive termination, he will receive the unconditional payments described above and:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A cash payment equal to his annualized base salary for the remainder of the current term of the agreement, but not less than 12 months; Mr. Hart will receive his annualized base salary; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• His target bonus prorated to reflect service during the performance cycle prior to his termination; Mr. Hart's target bonus is not subject to proration; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• His performance-based restricted stock awards, which will be determined at the end of the performance cycle and prorated to reflect his service prior to his termination; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• His time-based restricted stock award, which will be prorated to reflect his service prior to his termination and vest; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• COBRA continuation coverage premiums for the executive and his eligible dependents for a maximum period  
[END TABLE]
 of 18 months.
The employment agreement for each of our named executives includes substantially the same definition of "constructive termination": (1) a material reduction in the executive's base salary or his authority, duties or responsibilities; (2) our material breach of the terms of the agreement; (3) an attempt to require the executive to engage in an illegal act (or to illegally fail to act); or (4) the relocation of the executive more than 30 miles from where he currently works (50 miles for Mr. Morgan).  Upon the occurrence of an event constituting a constructive termination, the executive must promptly provide notice to us, and we must be provided a reasonable opportunity to "cure" the constructive termination event.  If we fail to reasonably cure the event, the executive must promptly separate from employment thereafter.
Change in Control. All change in control payments under our employment agreements are contingent on a "double trigger," which requires both the consummation of a change in control and a subsequent termination of employment during the 24-month period following the change in control.  The termination of employment must be by us without cause or a constructive termination initiated by an executive.  The term "change in control" generally refers to: (1) the acquisition by an unrelated person of not less than 50% of our common stock; (2) the sale of all or substantially all of our assets; (3) a merger in which we are not the surviving entity; or (4) a change in a majority of the members of our board of directors that occurs within a specified period.  Our employment agreements provide for the following cash payments in the event of a change in control:
[BEGIN TABLE]
CASH PAYMENTS CHANGE IN CONTROL PROVISIONS  
CASH PAYMENTS CHANGE IN CONTROL PROVISIONS  
  Mr. McGraw Mr. Waycaster Mr. Chapman Mr. Hart Mr. Cochran Mr. Morgan 
Cash Payment 2.99 X the aggregate of (1) base salary and (2) average bonus paid during the two years preceding change in control 2.99 X the aggregate of (1) base salary and (2) average bonus paid during the two years preceding change in control 2.5 X the aggregate of (1) base salary and (2) average bonus paid during the two years preceding change in control 2.99 X the aggregate of (1) base salary and (2) average bonus paid during the two years preceding change in control 2.5 X the aggregate of (1) base salary and (2) average bonus paid during the two years preceding change in control 2.5 X the aggregate of (1) base salary and (2) average bonus paid during the two years preceding change in control 
Premium Payments During COBRA continuation period Maximum of 18 months for each executive and his eligible dependents   
Tax Gross Up None; all payments subject to cutback 
[END TABLE]
In addition to the cash payments described above, our LTIP provides with respect to restricted stock awards that: (1) performance measures will be deemed satisfied at the target level and (2) all awards will vest as scheduled, with accelerated vesting applicable only in the event of involuntary termination without cause or a constructive termination, either occurring within the 24-month period following a change in control.
Expiration of Employment Agreement. The employment agreements with each of our named executives will expire when either party gives timely notice to the other that the agreement will not be renewed.  As described below, agreements with our named executives may provide for the payment of compensation in the event of expiration.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If Mr. McGraw's employment agreement expires and his employment ceases, he will receive his target bonus for the year of expiration, and restricted stock awards will vest and be awarded in amounts determined as if he had retired. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If before January 1, 2021, we provide notice of non-renewal to any of Messrs. Chapman, Waycaster or Cochran and his employment then ceases, he will receive the compensation and benefits due in the event of a constructive termination, as described above.  If we provide notice of non-renewal after January 1, 2021, or if either of Messrs. Chapman, Waycaster or Cochran provides notice of non-renewal at any time, no additional amount is due under the agreement.  Mr. Morgan's employment agreement has a similar provision, except that the date after which our notice of non-renewal no longer entitles him to compensation is August 31, 2023. 
[END TABLE]
 Potential Payments at Termination or Change in Control. The following tables set forth the value of post-employment payments that are not generally available to all employees or to all officers, determined as of December 31, 2018.  The tables do not include the value of unconditional payments, including the value of Mr. Hart's SERPs, under which the maximum benefit was vested as of December 31, 2018, and account balances in our non-qualified deferred compensation plans, which are also vested.  We have included amounts payable under our employment agreements and LTIP awards for death, disability, termination without cause/constructive termination, termination in connection with a change in control and payments due on the expiration of an agreement. Unless otherwise noted, amounts included in the tables below are based on the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For payouts under the PBRP, we have included the actual payout for 2018, regardless of the reason for the payout. 
• For one-year time-based restricted stock awards, we have included the full value of the award, regardless of the reason for payout.  For three-year time based restricted stock awards, we have included the value of a prorated award, except in the event of a change in control.  In the event of a change in control, we have assumed that the double trigger was satisfied as of December 31, 2018, and we have included the full value of three-year time based awards. 
• For one-year performance-based restricted stock awards, we have included the actual payout determined at the end of the performance cycle, December 31, 2018, except that we have included the target payout in the event of a change in control.  For three-year performance-based restricted stock awards, we have assumed a payout at target and prorated the award, except in the event of a change in control.  In the event of a change in control, we have assumed that the double trigger was satisfied as of December 31, 2018; payouts are reported at target. 
• The value of our stock on December 31, 2018 was $30.18 per share.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
[END TABLE]
The information provided in this section shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC or subject to its proxy regulations or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act.  The information provided in this section shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
The audit committee oversees our financial reporting process on behalf of the board of directors.  Management has the primary responsibility for the preparation, consistency and fair presentation of the financial statements, the accounting and financial reporting process, the systems of internal control, and the procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws and regulations.  Management is also responsible for its assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.  Our independent registered public accountants are responsible for performing an audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB, to obtain reasonable assurance that our consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement and expressing an opinion on the conformity of the financial statements of the Company with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  The internal auditors are responsible to the audit committee and the board of directors for testing the integrity of the financial accounting and reporting control systems and such other matters as the audit committee and the board of directors determine.
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the audit committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and management's assessment of the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.  The discussion addressed the quality, and not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.
The committee reviewed and discussed with the independent registered public accountants their judgments as to the quality of our accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the committee under generally accepted auditing standards including, without limitation, the matters required to be discussed by the statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1, AU §380), as adopted by the PCAOB in Rule 3200T (now codified as Auditing Standards No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees).  In addition, the committee received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accountants required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accountants' communications with the audit committee concerning independence, discussed with the independent registered public accountants their independence from management and the Company, and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with such independence.
The committee discussed with our internal auditors and independent registered public accountants the overall scope and plans for their respective audits.  The committee met with the internal auditors and independent registered public accountants, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of our internal controls, and the overall quality of our financial reporting.  The committee held 18 meetings during 2018.
In reliance upon the reviews and discussions referred to above, the audit committee recommended to the board of directors (and the board has approved) that the audited financial statements and the report on management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 
[END TABLE]
The audit committee has appointed HORNE LLP to serve as our independent registered public accountants for the 2019 fiscal year.  A representative of HORNE LLP is expected to attend the annual meeting.  If present, the representative will have the opportunity to make a statement and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.  HORNE LLP has served as our independent registered public accountants and audited our financial statements since 2005.
Fees related to services performed for us by HORNE LLP with respect to fiscal years 2018 and 2017 are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2018   2017 
Audit Fees(1) $814,900   $786,000 
Audit-related Fees(2) 36,100   35,050 
Tax Fees —   — 
All Other Fees —   — 
Total $851,000   $821,050 
(1) Audit fees included fees and expenses associated with the audit of our annual financial statements, the reviews of the financial statements in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and regulatory and statutory filings. 
(2) Audit-related fees primarily included fees and expenses associated with the audits of the financial statements of certain employee benefit plans and other required procedures. 
[END TABLE]
In accordance with the procedures set forth in its charter, the audit committee pre-approves all auditing services and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms of those services) to be performed for us by our independent registered public accountants prior to their engagement with respect to such services, subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services permitted by the Exchange Act, which are approved by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit.  For fiscal years 2018 and 2017, none of the fees listed under Audit-related Fees were covered by the de minimis exception.  The chairman of the audit committee has been delegated the authority by the committee to pre-approve the engagement of the independent registered public accountants when the entire committee is unable to do so.  The chairman must report all such pre-approvals to the entire audit committee at the next committee meeting.

VOTING YOUR SHARES 
[END TABLE]
RECORD DATE; SHARES OUTSTANDING
The board of directors has fixed the close of business on Friday, February 22, 2019, as the record date for our annual meeting.  Only shareholders of record on that date are entitled to receive notice of and vote at the annual meeting. As of the record date (February 22, 2019), our only outstanding class of securities was common stock, $5.00 par value per share.  On that date, 150,000,000 shares were authorized, of which 58,569,904 shares were outstanding and were held by approximately 13,889 shareholders.
VOTING
Each share is entitled to one vote on each matter considered at the meeting.  A shareholder may vote by proxy, whether or not he or she attends the annual meeting.  Shareholders may vote by proxy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Using the internet, at www.envisionreports.com/RNST.   To vote via the internet, you will need the control number that is included on your proxy card or in the Notice. 
• Using a toll free telephone number, at 1-800-652-VOTE (8683).  You will need the control number that is included on your proxy card or in the Notice. 
• By completing and mailing your proxy card to the address included on the card, if you received a paper copy of the proxy statement and proxy card. 
[END TABLE]
A shareholder may also vote in person by ballot at the meeting only if you are a record holder or you obtain a broker representation letter from your bank, broker or other record holder and you bring proof of your identity to the meeting.
If you would like to attend the annual meeting in person and need driving directions, please contact Kevin D. Chapman, our Chief Financial Officer, by e-mail to KChapman@renasant.com or by phone at (662) 680-1450.
QUORUM
A "quorum" must be present to hold our annual meeting.  The presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the annual meeting is a quorum.  Once shares are represented for any purpose at the annual meeting, they are considered present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment, unless a new record date is set for the adjourned meeting.
HOW VOTES ARE COUNTED 
Proxies. The shares voted by proxy will be voted as instructed at the annual meeting, including any adjournments or postponements of the meeting.  If a signed proxy card is returned with no voting instructions, the proxy holders will exercise their discretionary authority to vote the shares represented by the proxy as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of nominee Connie L. Engel as a Class 1 director; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of nominees John M. Creekmore, Jill V. Deer, Neal A. Holland, Jr., E. Robinson McGraw and Sean M. Suggs as Class 2 directors; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the adoption of the non-binding advisory resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of HORNE LLP as our independent registered public accountants for 2019. 
[END TABLE]
Street Name. For shares held in a broker's name (sometimes called "street name" or "nominee name"), you must provide voting instructions to your broker.  If you do not provide voting instructions, the shares will not be voted on any matter for which the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote (these are generally non-routine matters).  A vote that is not cast because instructions are not provided is called a "broker non-vote."  We will treat broker non-votes as shares present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, but we will not consider broker non-votes present for purposes of calculating the vote on a particular matter, nor will we count them as a vote FOR or AGAINST  a matter or as an abstention on the matter.  The ratification of our appointment of our independent registered public accountants is generally considered a routine matter for broker voting purposes, but neither the election of directors nor the adoption of the non-binding advisory resolution approving our executive compensation is considered routine.
Abstention. Under Mississippi law, an abstention by a shareholder either present in person at the annual meeting or represented by proxy is not a vote "cast" and is not counted "for" or "against" the matter subject to the abstention.
REQUIRED VOTE FOR EACH PROPOSAL
Directors are elected by plurality vote. Candidates in each class up for election who receive the highest number of votes cast, up to the number of directors to be elected in that class, are elected.  For all other proposals, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast is required for approval or ratification.
The board has adopted a "majority voting" policy that applies in an uncontested election of directors.  Under this policy, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of "withhold" votes from his or her election than votes "for" election, although still elected as a director, must promptly tender his or her resignation.  The board will then determine whether to accept the resignation, and the board's decision will be publicly disclosed.  This policy does not apply in contested elections.  More information about our majority voting policy is set forth below in the "Proposals" section under the heading "Proposal 1 - Election of One Class 1 Director."
SHARES HELD BY RENASANT 401(K) PLAN
On the record date, the Renasant 401(k) plan held an aggregate of 805,068 shares, or 1.37%, of our common stock.  If an account in the Renasant 401(k) plan is invested in common stock, those shares are voted by the owner of the account providing instructions to the plan's trustee, Renasant Bank, who acts as the proxy and votes the shares.  If voting instructions are not timely furnished, the trustee votes in a manner that "mirrors" how shares for which it has received instructions are voted.
SOLICITATION AND REVOCATION OF PROXIES 
Solicitation. Our board of directors is soliciting your proxy.  Our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies by telephone, mail, facsimile, via the internet or by overnight delivery service.  The Company bears the cost of proxy solicitation; individuals who are directors, officers and employees do not receive separate compensation for their services.  We have also engaged our transfer agent, Computershare Inc., to assist in our solicitation of proxies; we do not pay additional compensation to Computershare Inc. for this service.  We also reimburse banks, brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of our common stock for reasonable expenses incurred to forward proxy materials to our beneficial owners.
Revocation. A proxy may be revoked at any time before it is voted.  To revoke a proxy:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide written notice to our Secretary before the annual meeting; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide a subsequent proxy either by telephone or on the internet; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deliver a signed proxy card dated later than a previous proxy; or 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Appear in person and vote at the annual meeting, if you are the record owner of our stock or you obtain a broker representation letter from your bank, broker or other record holder of our common stock. 
[END TABLE]
Written notice of the revocation of a proxy should be delivered to the following address:
Renasant Corporation
Attn: Secretary
209 Troy Street
Tupelo, Mississippi 38804-4827
Any change to voting instructions previously provided to the trustee of our 401(k) plan must be received at least one business day before the meeting to be given effect.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
PROPOSALS 
[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL 1 - ELECTION OF ONE CLASS 1 DIRECTOR
Effective as of the completion of our acquisition of Brand, the size of the board was increased by one, and Connie L. Engel was appointed as a Class 1 director to fill this vacancy.  Under our bylaws, the term of a director appointed to fill a vacancy ends as of the next annual meeting of shareholders. The board has nominated Connie L. Engel for election as a Class 1 director for a two-year term, or until the 2021 annual meeting, so that her term of office coincides with the term of office of our other Class 1 directors.
Class 1 Director. Biographical information about Connie L. Engel may be found in the section "Board Members and Compensation" under the heading "Members of the Board of Directors."  If for any reason Ms. Engel is not available as a candidate for director, an event that the board of directors does not anticipate, the proxy holders will vote, in their discretion, for another candidate nominated by the board.
Required Vote; Majority Voting Policy. Directors are elected by a plurality vote; the nominees in each class who receive the highest number of votes cast, up to the number of directors to be elected in that class, are elected.
The board has adopted a "majority voting" policy.  Under this policy, which applies only in an uncontested election of directors, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of "withhold" votes for his or her election than votes "for" such election, although still elected to the board, must promptly tender to the board his or her resignation as a director.  This resignation will become effective upon acceptance by the board.  If any resignation is tendered under these circumstances, our nominating committee must consider the resignation and make a recommendation to the board as to whether to accept or reject the director's resignation.  No later than 90 days after the shareholders meeting that resulted in a director being required to submit his or her resignation, the board must consider the recommendation of the nominating committee and act on such resignation.  
Both the committee's recommendation and the board's decision with respect to a tendered resignation may include a range of alternatives, including acceptance of the resignation, rejection of it or rejection of it coupled with a commitment to address and cure the reasons believed to underlie the "withhold" votes. All relevant factors may be considered by the nominating committee and the board in evaluating whether to accept or reject a director's resignation.  These factors may include the reasons given by shareholders for the "withhold" vote, if known, and the impact on our compliance with SEC and Nasdaq rules and regulations if the director were to no longer serve on the board and the committees on which he or she serves.  The director at issue may not participate in the committee's and the board's deliberations.  The board's decision will be disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K furnished to the SEC promptly after the board arrives at a decision regarding whether to accept or reject the director's resignation (with the reason(s) for rejecting the resignation, if applicable).

[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL 2 - ELECTION OF FIVE CLASS 2 DIRECTORS
The board has nominated John M. Creekmore, Jill V. Deer, Neal A. Holland, Jr., E. Robinson McGraw and Sean M. Suggs for election as Class 2 directors. The five Class 2 directors to be elected at our annual meeting will serve a three-year term, or until the 2022 annual meeting, subject, in the case of Mr. McGraw, to his receipt of a waiver from our board of the requirement under our retirement policy that he resign from the board as of our 2020 annual meeting because he has reached age 72.  
Class 2 Directors. Biographical information about each nominee for election may be found in the section "Board Members and Compensation" under the heading "Members of the Board of Directors."  If for any reason a nominee is not available as a candidate for director, an event that the board of directors does not anticipate, the proxy holders will vote, in their discretion, for another candidate nominated by the board.
Required Vote; Majority Voting Policy. The information regarding the required vote for the election of directors and our majority voting policy in "Proposal 1 - Election of One Class 1 Director" immediately above applies to this proposal as well.

[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL 3 - ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Advisory Vote. Our board is seeking advisory shareholder approval of the compensation we pay to our named executive officers.  This vote, called "say-on-pay," is required by the Dodd-Frank Act and by Section 14A of the Exchange Act.  We hold say-on-pay votes annually.  For 2018, we are asking our shareholders to vote on the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Renasant Corporation hereby approve the compensation paid to the named executive officers of Renasant Corporation as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the executive compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (which disclosures include the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and any related narrative).
Our compensation program is based on a design that rewards the attainment of performance measures that align the interests of our executives and shareholders and that provides competitive fixed compensation intended to enhance employee retention and achieve strategic goals.  The relationship of our compensation program to the creation of shareholder value is illustrated above in the "Proxy Summary" section.  The specific decisions made by our compensation committee for 2018 are summarized in detail in the CD&A and in compensation tables and related disclosures that follow the CD&A.  We urge our shareholders to review these sections before deciding how to vote on this proposal.
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding, but our board and compensation committee will review the results as they continue to evaluate and modify our compensation program.
Required Vote. The affirmative vote by a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting is required for the approval of the above resolution.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast for or against the proposal.
[BEGIN TABLE]
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE NON-BINDING ADVISORY RESOLUTION APPROVING THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. 
[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL 4 - RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF HORNE LLP AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS FOR 2019
Ratification. We are asking our shareholders to ratify the audit committee's selection of HORNE LLP as our independent registered public accountants for 2019.  Although current law, rules and regulations, as well as the charter of the audit committee, require the audit committee to engage, retain and supervise our independent registered public accountants, we view the selection of the independent registered public accountants as an important matter of shareholder concern and thus are submitting the selection of HORNE LLP for shareholder ratification as a matter of good corporate practice.
Required Vote. The affirmative vote by a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting is required for the ratification of the appointment of HORNE LLP as our independent registered public accountants for 2019.  If our shareholders fail to ratify this appointment, the audit committee will reconsider whether to retain HORNE LLP and may retain that firm or another firm without resubmitting the matter to our shareholders.  Even if the appointment is ratified, the audit committee may, in its discretion, direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accountant at any time during the year if it determines that such change would be in our best interests and in the best interests of our shareholders.

OTHER MATTERS

 SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC and Nasdaq reports of ownership of our securities and changes in their ownership on Forms 3, 4 and 5.  Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.
Based solely upon a review of the reports on Forms 3 and 4 and amendments thereto furnished to us in 2018 and Forms 5 and amendments thereto furnished to us with respect to 2018, or written representations from reporting persons that no Form 5 filing was required, we believe that in 2018 our executive officers, directors and greater than 10% owners timely filed all reports they were required to file under Section 16(a), except that one report on Form 4, covering one transaction, filed by Mr. McGraw was filed late, and the Form 3 filed by Mr. Morgan in September 2018 contained errors which were corrected by the filing of an amended Form 3 in January 2019.
