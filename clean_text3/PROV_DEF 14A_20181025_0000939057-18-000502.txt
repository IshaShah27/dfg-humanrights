[END TABLE]
We also will transact any other business that may properly come before the annual meeting.  As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we are not aware of any other business to be presented for consideration at the annual meeting other than the matters described in this Proxy Statement.
Who Is Entitled to Vote?
We have fixed the close of business on October 11, 2018 as the record date for shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at our annual meeting.  Only holders of record of Provident's common stock on that date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the annual meeting.  You are entitled to one vote for each share of Provident common stock you own.  On October 11, 2018, there were 7,503,360 shares of Provident common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the annual meeting.
How Do I Vote at the Annual Meeting?
Proxies are solicited to provide all shareholders on the voting record date an opportunity to vote on matters scheduled for the annual meeting and described in these materials.  This answer provides voting instructions for shareholders of record.  You are a shareholder of record if your shares of Provident common stock are held in your name.  If you are a beneficial owner of Provident common stock held by a broker, bank or other nominee, please see the instructions below, under "What if My Shares Are Held in Street Name?"
Shares of Provident common stock can only be voted if the shareholder is present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting.  To ensure your representation at the annual meeting, we recommend you vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the annual meeting.  You can always change your vote at the meeting if you are a shareholder of record.
Voting instructions are included on your proxy card.  Shares of Provident common stock represented by properly executed proxies will be voted by the individuals named on the proxy card in accordance with the shareholder's instructions.  Where properly executed proxies are returned to us with no specific instruction as how to vote at the annual meeting, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares FOR the election of each of our director nominees, FOR advisory approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement and FOR the ratification of the appointment of the independent auditor.  If any other matters are properly presented at the annual meeting for action, the persons named in the enclosed proxy and acting thereunder will have the discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their best judgment.  We do not currently expect that any other matters will be properly presented for action at the annual meeting.
You may receive more than one proxy card depending on how your shares are held.  For example, you may hold some of your shares individually, some jointly with your spouse and some in trust for your children.  In this case, you will receive three separate proxy cards to vote.
What if My Shares Are Held in Street Name?
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name by a broker, your broker, as the record holder of the shares, is required to vote the shares in accordance with your instructions.  If your common stock is held in street name, you will receive instructions from your broker that you must follow in order to have your shares voted.  Your broker may allow you to deliver your voting instructions via the telephone or the Internet.  Please see the instruction form that accompanies this Proxy Statement.  If you do not give instructions to your broker, your broker may nevertheless vote the shares with respect to discretionary items, but will not be permitted to vote your shares with respect to non-discretionary items, pursuant to current industry practice.  In the case of non-discretionary items, shares not voted are treated as "broker non-votes."  The proposal to elect directors and the advisory vote on executive compensation are considered non-discretionary items; therefore, you must provide instructions to your broker in order to have your shares voted on these proposals.
If your shares are held in street name, you will need proof of ownership to be admitted to the annual meeting.  A recent brokerage statement or letter from the record holder of your shares are examples of proof of ownership.  If you want to vote your shares of common stock held in street name in person at the annual meeting, you will have to get a written proxy in your name from the broker, bank or other nominee who holds your shares.
How Will My Shares of Common Stock Held in the Employee Stock Ownership Plan Be Voted?
We maintain an employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") for the benefit of our employees.  Each ESOP participant may instruct the ESOP trustee how to vote the shares of Provident common stock allocated to his or her account under the ESOP by completing the proxy card, which represents a voting instruction to the trustees.  If an ESOP participant properly executes the proxy card, the ESOP trustee will vote the participant's shares in accordance with the participant's instructions.  Unallocated shares of Provident common stock held by the ESOP and allocated shares for which no voting instructions are received will be voted by the trustee in the same proportion as shares for which the trustee has received voting instructions.
How Many Shares Must Be Present to Hold the Meeting?
A quorum must be present at the meeting for any business to be conducted.  The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the shares of Provident common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting  as of the record date will constitute a quorum.  Proxies received but marked as abstentions or broker non-votes will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the meeting.
What if a Quorum Is Not Present at the Meeting?
If a quorum is not present at the scheduled time of the meeting, a majority of the shareholders present or represented by proxy may adjourn the meeting until a quorum is present.  The time and place of the adjourned meeting will be announced at the time the adjournment is taken, and no other notice will be given unless the meeting is adjourned for 30 days or more.  An adjournment will have no effect on the business that may be conducted at the meeting.
Vote Required to Approve Proposal 1: Election of Directors
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting by holders of Provident common stock.  Accordingly, the two nominees for election as directors who receive the highest number of votes actually cast will be elected.  Pursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation, shareholders are not permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors.  Votes may be cast for or withheld from each nominee.  Votes that are withheld and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the election because the two nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected.  Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the election of each of its director nominees.
Vote Required to Approve Proposal 2: Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation
The advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting by holders of Provident common stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes do not constitute votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the approval of the proposal.  Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the adoption of an advisory resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.
Vote Required to Approve Proposal 3: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditor
Ratification of the appointment of the independent auditor requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting by holders of Provident common stock.  Abstentions and broker non-votes do not constitute votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the approval of the proposal.  Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Provident's independent auditor for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
May I Revoke My Proxy?
You may revoke your proxy before it is voted by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• submitting a new proxy with a later date;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• notifying the Secretary of Provident in writing before the annual meeting that you have revoked your proxy; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• voting in person at the annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If you plan to attend the annual meeting and wish to vote in person, we will give you a ballot at the annual meeting.  However, if your shares are held in street name, you must bring a validly executed proxy from the nominee indicating that you have the right to vote your shares.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT  
The following table sets forth, as of October 11, 2018, the voting record date, information regarding share ownership of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• those persons or entities (or groups of affiliated persons or entities) known by management to beneficially own more than five percent of Provident's common stock;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each director and director nominee of Provident;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each executive officer of Provident or Provident Savings Bank named in the Summary Compensation Table appearing under "Executive Compensation" below (known as "named executive officers"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all current directors and executive officers of Provident and Provident Savings Bank as a group.  
[END TABLE]
Persons and groups who beneficially own in excess of five percent of Provident's common stock are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and provide a copy to us, reports disclosing their ownership pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  To our knowledge, no other person or entity, other than those set forth below, beneficially owned more than five percent of the outstanding shares of Provident's common stock as of the close of business on the voting record date.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.  In accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act, a person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of any shares of common stock if  he or she has voting and/or investment power with respect to those shares.  Therefore, the table below includes shares owned by spouses, other immediate family members in trust, shares held in retirement accounts or funds for the benefit of the named individuals, and other forms of ownership, over which shares the persons named in the table may possess voting and/or investment power.  In addition, in computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to outstanding options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days after the voting record date are included in the number of shares beneficially owned by the person and are deemed outstanding for the purpose of calculating the person's percentage ownership.  These shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

  PROPOSAL 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  
Our Board of Directors consists of seven members and is divided into three classes.  Approximately one-third of the directors are elected annually to serve for a three-year period or until their respective successors are elected and qualified.  The table below sets forth information regarding each director of Provident and each nominee for director.  The Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors selects nominees for election as directors.  Each of our nominees currently serve as directors of Provident and Provident Savings Bank.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS' MEETINGS, BOARD COMMITTEES
AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS
Board of Directors
The Boards of Directors of Provident and Provident Savings Bank conduct their business through board and committee meetings.  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Provident Board of Directors held 11 meetings and the Bank Board of Directors held 11 meetings.  No director attended fewer than 75% of the total meetings of the boards and committees on which that person served during this period.
Committees and Committee Charters
Provident's Board of Directors has a standing Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  The Boards of Directors of Provident and Provident Savings Bank have a joint Audit Committee and Personnel/Compensation Committee.  All of these committees have adopted written charters, copies of which are available on our website at www.myprovident.com.
Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee, which currently consists of Directors Barr (Chairman), Carpenter and Guthrie, is responsible for reviewing the adequacy of our system of internal accounting controls, approving the services provided by our independent outside auditor and meeting with the auditor to discuss the results of the annual audit and any related matters.  The Audit Committee has a charter which specifies its obligations and the Committee believes it has fulfilled its responsibilities under the charter.  Each member of the Audit Committee is "independent," in accordance with the requirements for companies listed on Nasdaq.  The Audit Committee members do not have any relationship with us that may interfere with the exercise of their independence from management and Provident.  None of the Audit Committee members are current officers or employees of Provident or its affiliates.  Mr. Barr meets the definition of "audit committee financial expert," as defined by the SEC.  The Audit Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which currently consists of Directors Thomas (Chairman), Barr, Bennett, Carpenter, Guthrie and Taylor, selects the nominees for election as directors.  The Committee also assists the Board in identifying individuals to become Board members and in developing and implementing corporation governance policies.  Each member of the Committee is "independent," in accordance with the requirements for companies listed on Nasdaq.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met once during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
Only those nominations made by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or properly presented by shareholders will be voted upon at the annual meeting of shareholders.  In its deliberations for selecting candidates for nominees as director, the Committee considers the candidate's knowledge of the banking business; involvement in local community, business and civic affairs; record of accomplishment in his or her chosen field; depth and breadth of experience at an executive, policy-making level; personal and professional ethics, integrity and values; absence of real and perceived conflicts of interest; ability and willingness to devote sufficient time to become knowledgeable about Provident and to effectively carry out the duties and responsibilities of service; ability to attend all or almost all Board meetings in person; ability to develop a good working relationship with other Board members; ability to contribute to the Board's working relationship with senior management; and whether the candidate would provide for adequate representation of Provident Savings Bank's market area.  Any nominee for director made by the Committee must be highly qualified with regard to some or all these attributes.  Finally, viewpoint, skill, education, values, race, gender, national origin and culture are considered to provide for diversity on our Board of Directors.  These diversity factors are considered when the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Board are seeking to fill a vacancy or new seat on the Board.
In searching for qualified director candidates to fill vacancies on the Board, the Committee solicits its current Board of Directors for names of potentially qualified candidates.  Additionally, the Committee may request that members of the Board of Directors pursue their own business contacts for the names of potentially qualified candidates.  The Committee would then consider the potential pool of director candidates, select the candidate the Committee believes  best meets the then-current needs of the Board, and conduct a thorough investigation of the proposed candidate's background to ensure there is no past history that would cause the candidate not to be qualified to serve as a director of Provident.  Although the Committee's charter does not specifically provide for the consideration of shareholder nominees for directors, the Committee will consider director candidates recommended by our shareholders in accordance with Provident's Certificate of Incorporation.  Because the Certificate of Incorporation provides a process for shareholder nominations, the Committee does not feel it is necessary to provide for shareholder nominations of directors in a charter.  If a shareholder submits a proposed nominee, the Committee will consider the proposed nominee, along with any other proposed nominees recommended by members of our Board of Directors, in the same manner in which the Committee will evaluate its nominees for director.  For a description of the proper procedure for shareholder nominations, see "Shareholder Proposals" in this Proxy Statement.
Personnel/Compensation Committee.  The Personnel/Compensation Committee, currently consisting of Directors Taylor (Chairman), Bennett and Thomas, is responsible for establishing and implementing all compensation policies of Provident, Provident Savings Bank and its subsidiaries and may delegate lower level policies and procedures to the Human Resource Department. The Committee is also responsible for evaluating the performance of the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank and approving an appropriate compensation level.  The Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of all senior officers of the Bank and recommends to the Committee individual compensation levels for approval by the Committee.  The Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
Leadership Structure
The positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are held by the same person.  The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of Provident not to have a policy regarding the separation of these roles, allowing the Board greater flexibility to establish a leadership structure that fits the needs of Provident at any particular point in time.  The current structure makes the best use of the Chief Executive Officer's extensive knowledge of our industry and of Provident, recognizes that he is best situated to lead discussions on important matters affecting the business of Provident and creates a firm link between the Board and management fostering effective communication.  Additionally, Director Taylor serves as the lead independent director.  In this capacity, he serves as liaison between independent directors and the full board in discussing issues from the executive sessions of independent directors, ensuring the flow of information and working in unison with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  He is charged with leading the Board's independent directors to engagement and consensus, making sure that independent consensus is heard and implemented regarding substantive business matters or governance issues.
Board Involvement in Risk Management Process
We believe that effective risk management is of primary importance to the success of Provident.  We have a comprehensive risk management process that monitors, evaluates and manages the risks we assume in conducting our activities.  Our Board's oversight of the risk management process is conducted through:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the responsibilities of the Board's standing committees;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Board-approved policies and procedures that limit the risk exposure of certain business activities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• periodic reports from management to ensure compliance with and evaluate the effectiveness of risk limits and controls;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• employees who oversee day-to-day risk management duties, including the Risk Administrator who reports directly to the Audit Committee, and Compliance Officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• selecting, evaluating, and retaining competent senior management; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approval of long and short-term business objectives and goals contained in the Board approved business plan.  
[END TABLE]
 Directors keep themselves informed of the activities and condition of Provident and of the risk environment in which it operates by regularly attending Board and assigned Committee meetings, and by review of meeting materials, auditor's findings and recommendations, and regulatory communications.  Directors stay abreast of general industry trends and statutory and regulatory developments by periodic briefings by senior management, counsel, auditors or other consultants, and by more formal director education.
Corporate Governance
We are committed to establishing and maintaining high standards of corporate governance.  The Board of Directors is cognizant of its responsibility to comply with the provisions contained in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules and regulations of the SEC adopted thereunder, and the rules of Nasdaq with respect to corporate governance.  The Board and its committees will continue to evaluate and improve our corporate governance principles and policies as necessary and as required.
Director Independence.  Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.  In accordance with Nasdaq requirements, at least a majority of our directors must be independent directors.  The Board has determined that six of our seven directors are independent, as defined by Nasdaq.  Directors Barr, Bennett, Carpenter, Guthrie, Taylor and Thomas are all independent. Only Craig Blunden, who is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is not independent.
Code of Ethics.  On June 30, 1995, the Board of Directors initially adopted and approved a Code of Ethics.  Subsequently, the Code of Ethics has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors each year, with the Board most recently having reviewed and approved the Code of Ethics on June 27, 2018.  The Code is applicable to our employees, as well as the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller and senior management, and requires individuals to maintain the highest standards of professional conduct.  A copy of the Code of Ethics is available on our website at www.myprovident.com.
Shareholder Communication with the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors maintains a process for shareholders to communicate with the Board.  Shareholders wishing to communicate with the Board of Directors may do so by mailing a letter marked "Confidential" to the Board of Directors, Provident Financial Holdings, Inc., 3756 Central Avenue, Riverside, California 92506.  Any communication must state the number of shares beneficially owned by the shareholder initiating the communication.
Annual Meeting Attendance by Directors.  We do not have a policy regarding Board member attendance at the annual meetings of shareholders.  All members of the Board of Directors attended the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders.
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.  During the year ended June 30, 2018, neither Provident nor Provident Savings Bank participated in any transactions, or proposed transactions, in which the amount involved exceeded $120,000 and in which any related person had a direct or indirect material interest.  DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION

  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Personnel/Compensation Committee.  The Personnel/Compensation Committee of the Provident and Provident Savings Bank Boards of Directors is responsible for establishing and implementing all compensation policies of Provident, Provident Savings Bank and its subsidiaries.  The Committee is also responsible for evaluating the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and approving an appropriate compensation level.  The Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of all senior officers and recommends to the Committee individual compensation levels for approval by the Committee.
Objectives and Overview of the Compensation Program.  The Personnel/Compensation Committee believes that a compensation program for executive officers should take into account management skills, long-term performance results and shareholder returns.  The principles underlying our compensation policies are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to attract and retain key executives who are highly qualified and are vital to the long-term success of Provident and its subsidiaries;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to provide levels of compensation competitive with those offered throughout the banking industry;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to align the interests of executives with shareholders by having a significant portion of total compensation based on meeting defined performance measures;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to motivate executives to enhance long-term shareholder value by helping them build their own ownership in Provident; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to integrate the compensation program with the Bank's long-term strategic planning and management process.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee considers a variety of subjective and objective factors in determining the compensation package for individual executives including: (1) the performance of Provident and Provident Savings Bank on a consolidated basis with emphasis on annual performance factors and long-term objectives; (2) the responsibilities assigned to each executive; and (3) the performance of each executive of assigned responsibilities as measured by the progress of Provident and Provident Savings Bank during the year.
Compensation Consultant.  The Personnel/Compensation Committee has the authority to retain compensation advisers, although it has not done so in recent years.
Compensation Program Elements.  The Personnel/Compensation Committee focuses primarily on the following three components in forming the total compensation package for our executive officers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annual incentive compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• long-term equity-based compensation.  
[END TABLE]
The current compensation program involves a combination of salary, at-risk incentives to reward short-term performance, and stock option and restricted stock awards to reward long-term performance.  The Personnel/Compensation Committee monitors the allocation of compensation between long-term and currently paid items on an ongoing basis, with the goal of ensuring that the allocation is competitive in the banking industry.
Base Salary.  Base salary is intended to reward the executive's ongoing performance and is based on the executive's level of responsibility, individual ability, experience, and past and potential performance.  The salary levels of our executive officers are designed to be competitive with those of executives at similarly-sized banking institutions in our geographic area which have similar operations and performance.  Individual annual performance is reviewed by the Personnel/Compensation Committee or the Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, to determine annual salary adjustments.  An executive may receive a material increase in salary upon taking on materially larger duties and responsibilities.  Compensation information is obtained by reviewing proxy statements and various compensation surveys including the S&P Global Market Intelligence Compensation data, the California Bankers Association Survey and the Employers Group Survey.  From these sources, the Personnel/Compensation Committee and the Chief Executive Officer create a compensation framework and set executive officer compensation based on the range of base salaries and bonuses paid, and equity awards granted, by peer companies.
Annual Incentive Compensation.  Incentive compensation is intended to reward short-term performance goals, keeping compensation aligned with goals that typically improve shareholder returns.  The annual incentive plan is based on Provident's annual performance compared to the business plan and individual performance requirements.  Each year, management prepares and the Board of Directors approves a one-year and three-year business plan, which establish strategic goals and objectives for Provident and each division of Provident.  Each executive is responsible for his or her specific goals and the objectives outlined in the business plan, which is monitored through the use of individual action plans.  Executives are graded each year on their successful completion of the action plans.
The annual incentive plan is designed to provide for a baseline bonus up to 50% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer, up to 50% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer, up to 25% of salary for senior officers, up to 12% of salary for certain managers (other than department managers) and up to 8% of salary for certain department managers.  Actual bonuses may exceed the baseline if Provident performs better than the business plan and/or the individual employee performs better than the individual performance requirements.  The business plan outlines a number of performance goals such as net income, return on assets, return on equity, efficiency ratio and diluted earnings per share, among others.  Individual performance requirements are project related and consistent with the duties and responsibilities  of the particular employee.  The Personnel/Compensation Committee may use its discretion to modify a particular award or an individual's performance requirements, although it has not typically done so.
For the year ended June 30, 2018, the named executive officers had the following performance goals, with the exception of Robert "Scott" Ritter, whose incentive plan is discussed below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Threshold     Target     Maximum    Fiscal 2018  Actual
     Threshold     Target     Maximum    Fiscal 2018  Actual
 Net income     $8,207,000     $10,258,000     $15,388,000     $2,131,000  
 Return on average assets     0.63%     0.79%     1.19%     0.18%  
 Return on average equity     6.48%     8.10%     12.15%     1.73%  
 Efficiency ratio     78.98%     75.16%     67.06%     91.42%  
 Diluted earnings per share     $1.08     $1.34     $2.02     $0.28  
[END TABLE]
Under the annual incentive plan, bonuses are calculated as a percentage of base salary or, for Mr. Ritter, a percentage of the pre-tax income of Provident Bank Mortgage.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, participation levels for the named executive officers expressed as a percentage of base salary at July 1, 2017 at each performance level were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Threshold (%)    Target (%)    Maximum (%)  
   Threshold (%)    Target (%)    Maximum (%)  
 Craig G. Blunden   20.0     50.0       93.8  
 Donavon P. Ternes   20.0     50.0       93.8  
 Robert "Scott" Ritter (1)   10.9     --     156.3  
 David S. Weiant   10.0     25.0       46.9  
 Gwendolyn L. Wertz   10.0     25.0       46.9  
 (1)            The fiscal 2018 business plan did not forecast sufficient pre-tax income for Provident Bank Mortgage to establish a target bonus for Mr. Ritter.  
[END TABLE]
We do not have a policy regarding the adjustment of previously paid bonuses, however, the Personnel/Compensation Committee does not certify annual bonuses until our independent auditor has completed its initial review of our year end financial statements and earnings release.
Equity-based Compensation.  Equity-based compensation is intended to attract and retain qualified personnel and nonemployee directors, to provide these persons with a proprietary interest in Provident as an incentive to contribute to our success and to reward personnel for outstanding performance.  Equity-based compensation functions as a long-term incentive because awards are generally made with a multiple-year vesting schedule.  Awards are made either in the form of stock options or restricted stock.  Currently, we have in place the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, each of which was approved by our shareholders at the time of adoption.  Awards remain available for grant under the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan. The equity-based plans are administered and interpreted by the Personnel/Compensation Committee of the Provident Savings Bank Board of Directors.  Under the plans, the Committee determines which officers and key employees will receive awards, the number of shares subject to each option or shares of restricted stock awarded, and the vesting of the awards.  The per share exercise price of an option will equal at least 100% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date the option is granted.  Awards are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors.  In addition, newly hired employees may receive awards at the time of their employment.  In determining whether to make option or restricted stock awards, the Personnel/Compensation Committee may take into account historical awards and then-current competitive conditions.
Provident also considers the results of the annual shareholder vote on executive compensation in determining compensation policies and practices.  At last year's annual meeting of shareholders, the executive compensation resolution was approved by over 98% of the shares present for purposes of voting on executive compensation.  The Personnel/Compensation Committee believes that the affirmative vote of the shareholders demonstrates that existing policies and practices are reasonable for a bank of its size with its business plan in the current economic and competitive environment.
Personnel/Compensation Committee Report

William E. Thomas
This report shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such acts.
Compensation Policies and Risk
The Personnel/Compensation Committee strives to develop compensation policies and practices that discourage excessive risk-taking, that focus our executives and employees on creating long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, and that provide appropriate levels of realized compensation over time.  The Personnel/Compensation Committee believes that our compensation policies and practices should provide a blend of cash and equity, and short-term and longer-term incentives.  In addition, the Personnel/Compensation Committee, with the assistance of the Chief Executive Officer, establishes goals and objectives that require a combination of individual, business unit and company-wide performance measures consistent with effective controls and sound risk management.  The Personnel/Compensation Committee reports periodically to the Board of Directors, seeks Board approval of certain significant compensation policies and practices, and monitors changing market conditions that may influence the competitive landscape for attracting and retaining qualified executive management.

Provident Savings Bank has entered into post-retirement compensation agreements with Messrs. Blunden and Ternes.  The agreements provide that if the executive terminates employment with the Bank after attaining age 62, the Bank will provide the executive with a monthly benefit for life equal to 50% of his final average monthly salary.  The agreement also provides for early retirement benefits and payments in the event of the executive's death or disability.  These payments are described below under "Potential Payments Upon Termination."
Potential Payments Upon Termination
We have entered into agreements with the named executive officers that provide for potential payments upon disability, termination, retirement and death.  In addition, our equity plans also provide for potential payments upon termination.

___________
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Monthly benefit to the executive or his spouse for life.  
[END TABLE]
 Employment Agreement.  Mr. Blunden's employment agreement provides for potential payments in the event of his disability, death or termination.  If Mr. Blunden becomes entitled to benefits under the terms of the then-current disability plan, if any, of Provident Savings Bank or becomes otherwise unable to fulfill his duties under his employment agreement, he shall be entitled to receive such group and other disability benefits as are then provided by the Bank for executive employees.  In the event of his disability, the employment agreement will not be suspended, except that payments of salary and bonus will be discontinued for as long as Mr. Blunden is disabled.
In the event of Mr. Blunden's death or disability while employed under the employment agreement and prior to any termination of employment, the Bank shall pay to his estate, or such person as he may have previously designated, the salary which was not previously paid to him and which he would have earned if he had continued to be employed under the agreement through the last day of the calendar month in which he died or become disabled, together with the benefits provided under the employment agreement through that date.
In the event of Mr. Blunden's death or disability, or in the event of his normal retirement, the Bank shall continue to provide the following benefits to him or his estate, as applicable: (1) the Bank shall continue in force, without cost to Mr. Blunden, those life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance coverages being provided by the Bank to Mr. Blunden and his spouse and his eligible dependents as of the date of such termination, subject to reduction after his 65th birthday; (2) the Bank shall continue to provide to Mr. Blunden and his eligible dependents life and medical insurance coverage equivalent in benefits, duration and terms to that provided to him and such persons as of the date of such termination; and (3) the Bank shall continue to reimburse Mr. Blunden for the expenses outlined in Section 4(c) of his employment agreement, which includes club dues.
The employment agreement also provides for benefits in the event of Mr. Blunden's involuntary termination.  If Mr. Blunden's employment is terminated for any reason other than cause, death, permanent disability, retirement or change in control, or Mr. Blunden terminates his own employment because of a material diminution of or interference with his duties, responsibilities or benefits, he is entitled to payment and benefits.  Specifically, the Bank must make a lump sum payment equal to the discounted present value of the aggregate future base salary payments Mr. Blunden would have received over the then remaining term of the agreement.
If Mr. Blunden's employment is terminated within 12 months following a change in control of Provident, or he terminates his own employment within 12 months following a change in control for any of the reasons listed in the previous paragraph, the Bank must pay him a lump sum equal to 299% of his base amount (as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code) and must provide during the remaining term of the employment agreement substantially the same group life insurance, hospitalization, medical, dental, prescription drug and other health benefits, and long-term disability insurance (if any) for the benefit of Mr. Blunden and his dependents and beneficiaries who would have been eligible for such benefits if he had not suffered involuntary termination.  However, if the value of the lump sum and benefits described in the preceding sentence exceeds the amount that could be paid without violating Section 280G (pertaining to golden parachute payments), taking into account other payments due Mr. Blunden in connection with a change in control, then the value of such lump sum and benefits may be reduced so that Section 280G is not violated.
Severance Agreements.  We extended the existing change in control severance agreements with Mr. Ternes, Mr. Ritter, Mr. Weiant and Ms. Wertz effective as of March 1, 2018.  The agreements have a term of one year, which may be extended for an additional year on the anniversary of the effective date of the agreement by the Board of Directors.  If the employment of the executive is involuntarily terminated, other than for cause, within 12 months following a change in control of Provident or Provident Savings Bank, or the executive terminates his or her own employment within 12 months following a change in control because of any demotion, loss of title, office or significant authority, reduction in the executive's annual compensation or benefits, or relocation of the executive's principal place of employment more than 35 miles from the pre-change in control location, the executive would be entitled to payment and benefits. The agreements provide that the Bank must pay a lump sum payment equal to two times the executive's then current base salary and a lump sum payment equal to two times the largest annual bonus paid to the executive during the two years prior to termination of employment. The Bank or its successor also would be obligated to continue the executive's life, medical, dental and disability coverage for a two-year period following termination of employment. Mr. Ritter's agreement provides for the same change of control and other benefits as for the other named executive officers  and provides that his bonus will be two times the largest bonus paid to an executive (other than Mr. Ritter or the Chief Executive Officer of Provident) who is a party to a severance agreement.
Post-Retirement Compensation Agreement. Provident Savings Bank entered into a post-retirement compensation agreement with Mr. Blunden, which was amended on December 15, 2005, and a new post-retirement compensation agreement with Mr. Ternes as of July 7, 2009.  The agreements provide that if Mr. Blunden and Mr. Ternes terminate employment with the Bank after having attained age 62, or on account of death, disability or involuntary termination, the Bank will pay the executive a lump sum amount equal in value to a stream of payments, payable over the executive's life, the annual amount of which is 50% of the executive's final average monthly salary (reduced in the case of disability by amounts received by the executive from any long-term disability policies maintained by the Bank).  If the executive terminates employment prior to attaining age 62, then a reduced lump sum benefit will be provided, payable when the executive attains age 62.  This is only applicable to Mr. Ternes as Mr. Blunden has already turned 62.  For purposes of the agreements, "final average monthly salary" is defined as the average of the executive's highest paid 36 months of employment with the Bank determined by reference to the average gross amount of his basic monthly salary (before tax withholding and other payroll deductions), excluding bonus or incentive awards, director fees, if any, and accelerated payments of future salary.  The value of this lump sum benefit is calculated using National Association of Insurance Commissioners standard mortality tables as of such date, and a discount rate equal to the lesser of the then-current prime rate or the Eleventh District cost of funds.
Equity Plans.  Our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan and 2010 Equity Incentive Plan provide for accelerated vesting of awards in the event of a change in control.  If a change in control occurs prior to the vesting of an award, the vesting date will be accelerated to the effective date of the change in control.  The 2013 Stock Option Plan provides for accelerated vesting of awards in the event of a change in control and involuntary termination of the award recipient within 12 months of the change in control.  The 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan also provide that if an award recipient's employment terminates due to death or disability prior to the vesting of an award, the vesting date will be accelerated to the date of termination of service.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
The members of the Personnel/Compensation Committee are Directors Taylor, Bennett and Thomas.  No members of the Committee were officers or employees of Provident or any of its subsidiaries during the year ended June 30, 2018, nor were they formerly Provident officers or had any relationships otherwise requiring disclosure.
Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio
In August 2015 pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), the SEC adopted Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the median employee's annual total compensation.  For 2018, this information is as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Blunden, Chief Executive Officer, annual total compensation:   $522,465  
• Median employee annual total compensation:   $  63,736  
• Ratio of Chief Executive Officer to median employee compensation:          8.20 
[END TABLE]
In determining the median employee, we used a listing of all full-time, prime-time and part-time employees, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, as of June 30, 2018.  To identify our median employee, we used the annual total compensation for each employee, calculated in the same manner as annual total compensation in the Summary Compensation Table above, paid in the period from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018 as our consistently applied compensation measure.
As a result of the flexibility permitted by Item 402(u), the method we used to determine our median employee may differ from the methods used by our peers, so the ratios may not be comparable. PROPOSAL 2 – ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  
Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act"), we are required to include in this Proxy Statement and present at the meeting a non-binding shareholder resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.  This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives shareholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the compensation of Provident's executives as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.  The proposal will be presented at the annual meeting in the form of the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the compensation of Provident's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and related material in Provident's Proxy Statement for the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.
This vote will not be binding on our Board of Directors or Personnel/Compensation Committee and may not be construed as overruling a decision by the Board or create or imply any additional fiduciary duty on the Board.  It will also not affect any compensation paid or awarded to any executive.  The Personnel/Compensation Committee and the Board may, however, take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.
The purpose of our compensation policies is to attract and retain key executives who are highly qualified and vital to our long-term success, while aligning the interests of executives with shareholders.  As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Personnel/Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors believes that the executive compensation for 2018 is reasonable and appropriate and is justified by Provident's performance in a highly competitive environment. In considering how to vote on this proposal, the Board requests that you consider the following factors:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Bank must offer competitive compensation packages to attract and retain well-qualified executives who are critical to Provident's long-term success.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The compensation program entails a balanced approach that considers the short-term and long-term interests of shareholders and safe and sound banking practices.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The compensation program does not encourage excessive and unnecessary risks that would threaten the value of Provident.  
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.
 AUDIT COMMITTEE MATTERS  
Audit Committee Charter.  The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a charter approved by our Board of Directors.  The Audit Committee reports to the Board of Directors and is responsible for overseeing and monitoring financial accounting and reporting, the system of internal controls established by management and our audit process.  The charter sets out the responsibilities, authority and specific duties of the Audit Committee.  The charter specifies, among other things, the structure and membership requirements of the Audit Committee, as well as the relationship of the Audit Committee to the independent auditor, the internal audit department and management.
Report of the Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee reports as follows with respect to Provident's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee has completed its review and discussion of the 2018 audited financial statements with management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, as amended;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee has received written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditor required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent auditor the independent auditor's independence; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee has, based on its review and discussions with management of the 2018 audited financial statements and discussions with the independent auditor, recommended to the Board of Directors that Provident's audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2018 be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
[END TABLE]
The foregoing report is provided by the following directors, who constitute the Audit Committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Committee:  Joseph P. Barr, Chairman  
   Judy A. Carpenter  
   Debbi H. Guthrie  
[END TABLE]
This report shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such acts.
 SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE  
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of any registered class of Provident's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC.  Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.  Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms we have received and written representations provided to us by the above-referenced persons, we believe that, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, all filing requirements applicable to our reporting officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders were properly and timely complied with.
 PROPOSAL 3 – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR  
Deloitte & Touche LLP served as our independent auditor for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.  The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP as independent auditor for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, subject to approval by shareholders.  A representative of Deloitte & Touche LLP will be present at the annual meeting to respond to shareholders' questions and will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she so desires.

The Audit Committee will establish general guidelines for the permissible scope and nature of any permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditor in connection with its annual review of its charter.  Pre-approval may be granted by action of the full Audit Committee or by delegated authority to one or more members of the Committee.  If this authority is delegated, all approved non-audit services will be presented to the Audit Committee at its next meeting.  In considering non-audit services, the Audit Committee or its delegate will consider various factors, including but not limited to, whether it would be beneficial to have the service provided by the independent auditor and whether the service could compromise the independence of the independent auditor.
The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as independent auditor of Provident for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
