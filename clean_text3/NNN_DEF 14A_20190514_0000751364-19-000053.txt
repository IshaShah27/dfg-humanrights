  PROXY STATEMENT  
[END TABLE]
General.  This Proxy Statement is furnished by the Board of Directors of National Retail Properties, Inc. (the "Company") in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of proxies to be voted at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held on May 14, 2019, and at any adjournment thereof, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying notice of such meeting.  All stockholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2019 (the "Record Date"), will be entitled to vote.  It is anticipated that this Proxy Statement and the enclosed Proxy will be mailed to stockholders on or about April 2, 2019.  The Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") will also be available on the Internet at www.nnnreit.com/proxyvote.
When we use the words "we," "us," "our" or "Company," we are referring to National Retail Properties, Inc.
Voting/Revocation of Proxy.  If you complete and properly sign and mail the accompanying proxy card, it will be voted as you direct.  If you are a registered stockholder and attend the meeting, you may deliver your completed proxy card in person.  "Street name" stockholders who wish to vote at the meeting will need to obtain a proxy from the institution that holds their shares.
If you are a registered stockholder, you may vote by telephone (1-800-690-6903), or electronically through the Internet (http://www.proxyvote.com), by following the instructions included with your proxy card.  If your shares are held in "street name," please check your proxy card or contact your broker or nominee to determine whether you will be able to vote by telephone or electronically.
Any proxy, if received in time, properly signed and not revoked, will be voted at such meeting in accordance with the directions of the stockholder.  If no directions are specified, the proxy will be voted FOR each of Proposals I, II, and III contained herein.  Any stockholder giving a proxy has the power to revoke it at any time before it is exercised.  A proxy may be revoked (1) by delivery of a written statement to the Secretary of the Company stating that the proxy is revoked, (2) by presentation at the annual meeting of a subsequent proxy executed by the person executing the prior proxy, or (3) by attendance at the annual meeting and voting in person.
Vote Required for Approval; Quorum.  The nominees for director who receive a majority of the votes cast will be elected.  If you indicate "withhold authority to vote" for a particular nominee by entering the number of any nominee (as designated on the proxy card) below the pertinent instruction on the proxy card, your vote will not count either for or against the nominee.  As of the Record Date, 161,978,308 shares of the common stock of the Company (the "Common Stock") were outstanding, of which 161,496,779 shares entitled the holder thereof to one vote on each of the matters to be voted upon at the annual meeting.  As of the Record Date, our executive officers and directors had the power to vote approximately 0.33% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock.  Our executive officers and directors have advised us that they intend to vote their shares of Common Stock FOR each of Proposals I, II, and III contained herein.
Votes cast in person or by proxy at the annual meeting will be tabulated and a determination will be made as to whether or not a quorum is present.  We will treat abstentions as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum, but as unvoted for purposes of determining the approval of any matter submitted to the stockholders.  If a broker submits a proxy indicating that it does not have discretionary authority as to certain shares to vote on a particular matter (broker non-votes), those shares will not be considered as present and entitled to vote with respect to such matter.  Broker non-votes with respect to the election of directors will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on that proposal.
YOUR VOTE AT THE ANNUAL MEETING IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US.
Solicitation of Proxies.  Solicitation of proxies will be primarily by mail.  However, our directors and officers may also solicit proxies by telephone or telegram or in person.  All of the expenses of soliciting proxies, including preparing, assembling, printing and mailing the materials used in the solicitation of proxies, will be paid by us.  Arrangements may be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward soliciting materials, at our expense, to the beneficial owners of shares held of record by such persons.

Corporate Governance
General.  We are currently managed by a nine-member Board of Directors that consists of Mses. Beall  and Holden, and Messrs. Cosler, DeFosset, Fick, Fritsch, Habicht, Susser, and Whitehurst, with Mr. DeFosset serving as Chairman of the Board.  Robert C. Legler retired as a member and Chairman of the Board of Directors effective December 20, 2018.
The Board of Directors has adopted a set of corporate governance guidelines, which, along with the written charters for the Board committees described below, provide the framework for the Board's governance of the Company.  Our corporate governance guidelines are available on our website at http://www.nnnreit.com.
Independence and Composition.  Our corporate governance guidelines and the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, which we refer to as the NYSE listing standards, each require that a majority of the Board of Directors are "independent" directors, as that term is defined in the NYSE listing standards.
The Board of Directors has determined that Ms. Beall, Ms. Holden and Messrs. Cosler, DeFosset, Fick, Fritsch, and Susser, representing a majority of the Board of Directors, qualify as independent directors (the "Independent Directors") as that term is defined in the NYSE listing standards.  The Board of Directors made its determination based on information furnished by all directors regarding their relationships with us and our affiliates and research conducted by management.  In addition, the Board of Directors consulted with our external legal counsel to ensure that the Board's determination would be consistent with all relevant securities laws and regulations as well as the NYSE listing standards.
Leadership Structure.  In connection with Mr. Macnab's retirement in 2017, the Board of Directors elected to split the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.  Effective as of April 28, 2017, Julian E. Whitehurst assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Legler served as Chairman of the Board until his retirement.  Mr. DeFosset serves as Chairman of the Board since his election on December, 20, 2018.  In his role as Chairman of the Board, Mr. DeFosset presides over all meetings of the stockholders and directors, and reviews and approves Board meeting schedules, agendas, and information provided to the Board.  In addition, Mr. DeFosset presides as chairman when the Board meets in executive session and he serves as the interface between the Board and the Chief Executive Officer in communicating matters discussed during the executive session. Risk Oversight.  Our management is responsible for managing the day-to-day risks associated with our business.  The Board of Directors, however, is elected to provide effective oversight of our affairs for the benefit of our stockholders, and among its primary responsibilities, in accordance with our corporate governance guidelines, is overseeing management in the competent and ethical operation of the Company, reviewing and approving our business plans and corporate strategies, and adopting and evaluating policies of corporate and ethical conduct and governance.  Implicit in these duties is risk oversight, the primary responsibility of which has been delegated to the Board's Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee reviews with management annually, or more frequently as the Audit Committee deems necessary, our significant risks or exposures and discusses guidelines and policies to govern this process and assesses steps that management has taken to minimize such risks to the Company.
While the primary responsibility has been delegated to the Audit Committee, the Governance and Nominating Committee and the Compensation Committee consider risks within their area of responsibility.  Further, each director may consult with management at any time and is encouraged to discuss with management any questions such director may have.
With respect to risks related to compensation matters, our management, together with the Compensation Committee, reviewed our compensation policies and practices for our employees in order to determine whether they are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  We believe that our compensation policies and practices do not promote unreasonable risk-taking behavior and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect based on the following factors:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Compensation Committee consists solely of independent non-employee directors, and the Compensation Committee has engaged an independent, external compensation consultant to assist with creating the executive compensation program; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Compensation Committee maintains the right, in its sole discretion, to modify the compensation policies and practices at any time; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Compensation Committee has elected to use awards of restricted stock instead of other equity awards, such as stock options, because, as a REIT, which pays a large portion of its annual earnings to stockholders in the form of dividends, the Compensation Committee believes that restricted stock provides a better incentive and alignment of interest than stock options; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• restricted stock grants are intended to provide our named executive officers with a significant interest in the long-term performance of our stock; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture upon certain employment termination events; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• performance-contingent restricted stock grants tied to our three-year total shareholder returns relative to a broad REIT peer group further focus our executive officers on long-term shareholder value creation; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• bonus awards to our executive officers are reduced if balance sheet leverage exceeds levels previously approved by the Compensation Committee; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we have adopted a stock ownership policy for our executive officers and members of our Board which requires all directors and executive officers to own meaningful levels of Company stock; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we have adopted an insider trading policy which prohibits, among other things, trading of Company securities on a short-term basis, buying puts or calls on Company securities, short sales of Company securities, and certain other activities.  We have also adopted an anti-hedging policy for directors and executive officers which prohibits all hedging activities, including, buying, selling or trading in options or other derivative securities based on Company securities; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we have adopted a pledging limitation policy for our directors and executive officers which restricts directors and executive officers from pledging shares of the Company and holding of shares of the Company in margin accounts (no directors or  executive officers have pledged any shares); 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we have adopted a clawback policy for our executive officers which allows the Board to recover certain incentive compensation if the Company has a material restatement of financial results, as a result of such restatement the incentive compensation would not have been earned, and the executive officer engaged in fraud or other intentional misconduct; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• none of our employees are paid commission compensation; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• bonus and incentive awards to our employees eligible for bonus awards are capped; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we base executive compensation on several critical success factors. 
[END TABLE]
Given these factors, we believe we have mitigated potential short-term excessive risk-taking and aligned compensation with increasing long-term shareholder value.
Meetings and Attendance.  The Board of Directors met five times in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  Each of the nominees serving on the Board of Directors in 2018 attended (i) not less than 80% of the Board of Director meetings (including 100% of the Board's regular quarterly meetings), and (ii) 100% of the committee meetings held during the period that the nominee served on the committees of the Board of Directors.  Our corporate governance guidelines provide that it is the responsibility of individual directors to make themselves available to attend scheduled and special Board meetings on a consistent basis.  In addition to the five Board of Directors meetings, all of our directors were in attendance for the 2018 annual meeting of the Company's stockholders.  In addition, non-management members of the Board of Directors met in executive session five times in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  These sessions were presided over by Mr. Legler in his capacity as Chairman.
Interested Party Communications.  The Board of Directors has adopted a process whereby stockholders and other interested parties can send communications to our directors.  Anyone wishing to communicate directly with one or more directors may do so in writing addressed to the director or directors, c/o National Retail Properties, Inc., 450 South Orange Avenue, Suite 900, Orlando, Florida 32801, attention: Secretary of the Company.  All correspondence will be reviewed by the Secretary of the Company and forwarded directly to the addressee so long as, in the Secretary's discretion, such correspondence is reasonably related to protecting or promoting legitimate interests of interested parties or the reliability of the financial markets.
Audit Committee 
General.  The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee, which is governed by a written charter, a copy of which is available on our website at http://www.nnnreit.com.  Among the duties, powers and responsibilities of the Audit Committee as provided in its charter, the Audit Committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• has sole power and authority concerning the engagement and fees of independent registered public accounting firms; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviews with the independent registered public accounting firm the plans and results of the audit engagement; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• pre-approves all audit services and permitted non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviews the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviews accounting, auditing and financial reporting matters with our independent registered public accounting firm and management. 
[END TABLE]
 Independence and Composition.  The composition of the Audit Committee is subject to the independence and other requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder (the "Exchange Act"), and the NYSE listing standards.
The Board of Directors, upon the unanimous recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee, has determined that all current members of the Audit Committee are "independent," as that term is defined in the NYSE listing standards and as required by the Exchange Act, and meet all audit committee composition requirements of the Exchange Act and the NYSE listing standards, and that each of Ms. Beall, Ms. Holden and Messrs. Cosler, Fick, and Susser qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined in the Exchange Act.
Meetings.  The Audit Committee met eight times in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  The  Audit Committee consisted of Ms. Beall and Messrs. Cosler, Fick, and Fritsch, with Mr. Fick serving as Chairman.
Governance and Nominating Committee 
General.  The Board of Directors has established a Governance and Nominating Committee, which is governed by a written charter, a copy of which is available on our website at http://www.nnnreit.com.  As provided in the Governance and Nominating Committee charter, the Governance and Nominating Committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• identifies and recommends to the Board of Directors individuals to stand for election and re-election to the Board of Directors at our annual meeting of stockholders and to fill vacancies that may arise from time to time; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• develops and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors for the creation and ongoing review and revision of a set of effective corporate governance principles that promote our competent and ethical operation and a policy governing ethical business conduct of our employees and Directors; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• makes recommendations to the Board of Directors as to the structure and membership of committees of the Board of Directors. 
[END TABLE]
Selection of Director Nominees.  Our corporate governance guidelines provide that the Governance and Nominating Committee will endeavor to identify individuals to serve on the Board of Directors who have expertise that is useful to us and complimentary to the background, skills and experience of other Board members.  The Governance and Nominating Committee's assessment of the composition of the Board of Directors includes (a) skills - business and management experience, real estate experience, accounting experience, finance and capital markets experience, and an understanding of corporate governance regulations and public policy matters, (b) character - ethical and moral standards, leadership abilities, sound business judgment, independence and innovative thought, and (c) composition - diversity, age and public company experience.  The Governance and Nominating Committee measures its composition by taking into account the entirety of the Board and the criteria listed above rather than having any representational directors.  While we do not have a formal policy on diversity, the Governance and Nominating Committee assesses its effectiveness in accounting for diversity, along with the other factors taken into account to identify director nominees, when it annually evaluates the performance of the Board and each director and periodically reviews the Company's corporate governance guidelines.  The principal qualification for a director is the ability to act in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.  Each of the candidates for director named in this proxy statement have been recommended by the Governance and Nominating Committee and approved by the Board of Directors for inclusion on the attached proxy card.
The Governance and Nominating Committee also considers director nominees recommended by stockholders.  See the section of this proxy statement entitled "PROPOSALS FOR NEXT ANNUAL MEETING" for a description of how stockholders desiring to make nominations for directors and/or to bring a proper subject before a meeting should do so.  The Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates director candidates recommended by stockholders in the same manner as it evaluates director candidates recommended by our directors, management or employees.
Independence and Composition.  The NYSE listing standards require that the Governance and Nominating Committee consist solely of independent directors.  The Board of Directors, upon the unanimous recommendation of  the Governance and Nominating Committee, has determined that all current members of the Governance and Nominating Committee are "independent" as that term is defined in the NYSE listing standards.
Meetings.  The Governance and Nominating Committee met four times in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  The Governance and Nominating Committee consisted of Ms. Beall and Messrs. DeFosset, Fritsch, and Susser, with Mr. Fritsch serving as Chairman.
Compensation Committee 
General.  The Board of Directors has established a Compensation Committee, which is governed by a written charter, a copy of which is available on our website at http://www.nnnreit.com.
Processes and Procedures for Executive and Director Compensation Determinations
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Role of Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee is responsible for discharging the responsibilities of the Board of Directors with respect to approving and evaluating compensation plans, policies and programs for our executive officers and directors and approving all awards to any executive officer, director or associate under our equity incentive plans.  The Compensation Committee also serves as the administrator of our 2017 Performance Incentive Plan, and our 2007 Performance Incentive Plan. 
• Role of Management in Compensation Determinations.  The Compensation Committee considers the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer when determining the base salary and incentive performance compensation levels of the other executive officers.  Similarly, the Compensation Committee also considers the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer when setting specific Company and individual incentive performance targets.  In addition, officers may be invited to attend committee meetings.  Management generally does not have a role in the setting of director compensation. 
• Role of Compensation Consultants.  The Compensation Committee has the authority, in its sole discretion, to engage compensation consultants as needed or desired to assist the Compensation Committee in researching and evaluating executive officer and director compensation programs.  Since 2012, the Compensation Committee has retained Pearl Meyer & Partners, an independent compensation consulting firm ("Pearl Meyer"), to assist the Compensation Committee in reviewing and evaluating the Company's executive and non-employee director compensation programs.  The use of independent third-party consultants provides additional assurance that our executive compensation programs are reasonable, consistent with Company objectives, and competitive with executive compensation for companies in our peer group.  Pearl Meyer reports directly to the Compensation Committee, provides no other services to the Company, and regularly participates in committee meetings.  The Compensation Committee assessed the independence of Pearl Meyer pursuant to the applicable SEC rules and concluded no conflict of interest exists that would prevent Pearl Meyer from serving as an independent advisor to the Committee. 
• Delegation of Authority by the Committee.  The Committee may delegate its authority to make and administer awards under our equity incentive plans to another committee of the Board of Directors or, except for awards to individuals subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, to one or more of our officers.  On an annual basis, the Committee typically authorizes a limited number of shares of restricted stock to be awarded by our Chief Executive Officer to such of our non-executive associates as he determines, in consultation with our other executive officers. 
[END TABLE]
Our executive compensation programs and philosophy are described in greater detail under the section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."
Independence and Composition.  The NYSE listing standards require that the Compensation Committee consist solely of independent directors.  The Board of Directors, upon the unanimous recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee, has determined that all current members of the Compensation Committee are "independent" as that term is defined in the NYSE listing standards. Meetings.  The Compensation Committee met four times in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  The Compensation Committee consisted of Messrs. Cosler, DeFosset, Fick, and Susser, with Mr. DeFosset serving as Chairman.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
No member of the Compensation Committee is or was previously an officer or employee of the Company, and no executive officer of the Company serves on the board of directors of any company at which any member of the Compensation Committee is employed.
Director Compensation
The following table shows the compensation paid to our non-employee directors during fiscal year 2018.

(1)  The awards shown in column (c) represent stock awards as a result of an annual election to receive stock in lieu of cash made to directors of the Company.  The amounts represent the grant date fair value with respect to the fiscal year in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. 
(2)  The cash fees and stock awards earned by Mr. Legler ($260,000), as well as the stock awards earned by Mr. Fick ($126,000), Mr. Cosler ($228,250), and Mr. Susser ($98,750), are deferred into shares of our common stock under our Deferred Fee Plan, which is described in greater detail below. 
[END TABLE]
The Company only compensates non-employee directors for services provided as directors of the Company.  Following a study by Pearl Meyer which found that total compensation levels for our directors were below the 50th percentile (or "median") of industry peers (as identified in "Executive Compensation-Compensation Discussion and Analysis-Benchmarking"), effective July 1, 2017, board compensation was set at $200,000 per year, payable in quarterly increments.  Non-employee directors may elect to receive up to $80,000 of their annual board compensation in the form of cash, with the remainder paid in shares of the Company's Common Stock.  Additionally, the Non-Employee Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, the Chairman of the Compensation Committee, and the Chairman of the Governance and Nominating Committee receive $50,000, $25,000, $20,000 and $15,000, respectively.  Additionally, each non-chair member of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Governance and Nominating Committee receives $10,000, $8,000, and $6,000, respectively.  The Committee retainers are payable in cash or stock at the election of each director.  In 2017 the Company inadvertently failed to pay the increased fee levels to the non-employee directors discussed above, that became effective July 1, 2017.  The Company increased fees to the non-employee directors paid in 2018 by $111,375 to compensate for that oversight.
Pursuant to our corporate governance guidelines, each of our non-employee directors is required to own our Common Stock equivalent to three times the annual total board compensation within five years of becoming a board member.  The Compensation Committee reviews progress toward meeting these ownership requirements annually, and each of the nominees that have served on the Board of Directors for the requisite number of years exceeds the ownership requirements. A Deferred Fee Plan was established by the Company for the benefit of its directors and their beneficiaries.  A director may elect to defer all or part of his or her director's fees to be earned in any calendar year by filing a deferred fee agreement with the Company no later than December 15 of the previous year.  A director has the option to have deferred fees paid in cash, in shares of Common Stock or in a combination of cash and Common Stock.  If the director elects to have the deferred fees paid in stock, the number of shares allocated to the director's stock account is determined based on the market value of the Common Stock on the trading day preceding the date the deferred director's fees were earned.  A director is entitled to receive the vested portion of the amounts credited to his or her deferred fee account on the time specified in such director's fee agreement.
The following table sets forth fees deferred into shares of Common Stock, as well as dividends earned on the deferred shares by directors under the Deferred Fee Plan.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Executive Summary
We design our executive compensation program to attract and retain talented and experienced executive officers and to reinforce key business objectives in support of long-term value creation.  Our Compensation Committee (for purposes of this discussion, the "Committee") seeks to provide compensation that is not only competitive relative to our peer group, but also structured so as to align our executives' short-term and long-term interests with the interests of our stockholders.  Accordingly, the Committee seeks to incentivize our executive officers and emphasize pay-for-performance by basing a significant portion of compensation on achievement of critical success factors.  The primary elements of our total compensation program for our named executive officers ("NEOs") include base salary, annual cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives.  We have designed a compensation program that makes a substantial percentage of executive pay variable, subject to increase and decrease based on actual versus planned corporate performance and total shareholder returns relative to our peers.  In addition, executive officers are subject to market competitive stock ownership guidelines which further aligns executive interests with shareholders.
Executive Compensation Program.  In 2018, the Committee approved annual incentive awards and long-term incentive awards.  Annual incentives are based on both (i) the achievement of certain increased core funds from operations ("FFO") per share goals, excluding any impairments, charges for retirement severance, and debt prepayments (85% weighting), and (ii) a subjective assessment of contributions toward corporate strategic objectives and achievement of individual performance goals (15% weighting).  Annual incentives are subject to downward adjustment if our debt leverage ratio exceeds a cap established by the Board.  For 2018, the Committee approved long-term incentive compensation through grants of the following: (i) service-based restricted stock vesting ratably over four years, and (ii) performance-based restricted stock awards, the vesting of which is tied to the three-year relative total shareholder return of the Company compared to a broad group of REIT companies as of December 31, 2020.
Restricted Stock.  Restricted stock grants are intended to provide our NEOs with a significant interest in the long-term performance of our stock.  The Committee has elected to use awards of restricted stock instead of other equity awards, such as stock options, because, as a REIT, which pays a large portion of its annual earnings to stockholders in the form of dividends, we believe that restricted stock provides a better incentive and alignment of interest than stock options.  The Committee has determined that our desired compensation objectives are better achieved by awarding restricted stock.  The Company did not issue any stock options to its executive officers in 2018, and there are no outstanding stock options.  Consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, 60% of the target long-term incentive award opportunity for our NEOs in 2018 was provided in the form of performance-contingent restricted stock grants.

2018 Compensation Highlights.  The following are some of the highlights related to the 2018 compensation of our executive officers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Committee approved base salary increases averaging 6.5% and ranging from 2.9% to 10.7%, to bring all NEOs' base salaries in line with peer group 50th percentile (or "median") base salaries; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Committee approved annual cash incentive award opportunities for NEOs, based on position, with potential awards ranging from 50% to 75% for "threshold" performance, 100% to 150% for "target" performance, and 150% to 225% for "maximum" performance, expressed as a percentage of each executive's base salary, with any earned awards, subject to downward adjustment of up to 20% of the funded award levels if our leverage (ratio of total liabilities to gross book assets) exceeded the 57.5% cap established by the board for 2018; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Based on our core FFO (excluding impairments, charges for retirement severance, and debt prepayments) per share results, which were between the target and maximum performance goals, the Committee approved payment of annual cash incentive compensation for 2018 at 114.3% of target awards for the corporate performance component (weighted at 85% for the total award opportunity), ranging from 97.1% to 145.7% of each executive officer's base salary; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Based on the Committee's subjective individual performance assessment of the CEO and the Committee's review of the CEO's assessment of the other NEOs, the Committee approved payment of annual cash incentive compensation for 2018 at award levels ranging from target to maximum awards for this component (representing 15% of the total award opportunity), with award levels ranging from 18.8% to 25.9% of each executive officer's base salary; 
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
2018 Say-on-Pay Voting Results
In 2018, we submitted our executive compensation program to an advisory vote of our shareholders (also known as "Say-on-Pay").  Approximately 92.6% of voting shareholders at the 2018 annual meeting approved our executive compensation program.  The Committee considered such strong shareholder support as an endorsement of the Company's executive compensation program and policies and the Committee intends to continue the pay-for-performance program that is currently in place while increasing the emphasis on and number of metrics for performance share grants in 2019.  The Committee values the opinions of our stockholders and will continue to consider those opinions when making future executive compensation decisions.
Objectives of Compensation Program
We believe our success is largely attributable to the talent and dedication of our employees (whom we refer to as associates) and to the management and leadership efforts of our executive officers.  Our goal is to establish a compensation program that will attract and retain talented corporate officers, motivate them to perform to their fullest potential, and align their long-term interests with the interests of our stockholders.
What Our Compensation Program is Designed to Reward and Other Policies
We believe that the most effective compensation program is one that is designed to reward the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals, and which aligns executives' interests with those of the stockholders by rewarding performance that meets or exceeds established goals, with the ultimate objective of improving stockholder value.  Our Committee evaluates both performance and compensation to ensure that we maintain our ability to attract and retain superior executive officers and that compensation provided to our executive officers is appropriately aligned with performance and remains competitive relative to the compensation paid to similarly situated executives of our peer companies.  In making compensation decisions, the Committee considers the compensation practices and financial performance of REIT and other industry participants and from time to time receives assessments and advice regarding compensation practices from third party compensation consultants.  In evaluating performance, the Committee considers quantitative and qualitative improvement in factors such as FFO per share based metrics, capital structure, absolute and relative stockholder returns, individual performance, and contribution to corporate goals and objectives.  Additionally, the Committee takes into account our general performance, the executive officer's past performance, the executive officer's anticipated performance and contribution to our achievement of our long-term goals, and the position, level and scope of the executive officer's responsibility. We believe that our compensation program for executive officers, which includes the use of performance-based and service-based restricted stock awards, results in a significant alignment of interest between these individuals and our stockholders.  Under our corporate governance guidelines, within five years of becoming a Covered Person, as defined by the Committee, executive officers are required to own our Common Stock (including restricted stock) equal to a minimum of five times the annual base salary for CEO and three times their annual base salary for all other Covered Persons.  The Committee reviews progress toward meeting these guidelines annually and each Covered Person exceeds the stock ownership guidelines.  In addition, equity grants to NEOs do not include  tax gross-up provisions, and the Committee does not intend to provide tax gross-ups on any future restricted stock grants to executive officers.  Additionally, we have adopted a clawback policy for our executive officers which allows the Board to recover certain incentive compensation if the Company has a material restatement of financial results, as a result of such restatement the incentive compensation would not have been earned, and the executive officer engaged in fraud or other intentional misconduct.  Finally, we have also adopted an anti-hedging policy for directors and executive officers which prohibits all hedging activities, including, buying, selling or trading in options or other derivative securities based on Company securities.
Accounting and Tax Considerations
We have selected compensation elements that help us achieve the objectives of our compensation program and not because of preferential financial accounting or tax treatment.  However, when awarding compensation, the Committee is mindful of the accounting impact of the compensation expense of each compensation element.  In addition, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), places a limit of $1 million per year on the amount of compensation paid to certain of our executive officers that the Company may deduct from our federal income tax return for any single taxable year.  There is an exception to the $1 million limitation for performance-based compensation meeting certain requirements, although this exception is severely limited beginning in 2018, as described below.  The material terms of the 2017 Performance Incentive Plan and the 2007 Performance Incentive Plan were previously approved by shareholders in 2017 and 2012, respectively, for purposes of Section 162(m), which allowed us to grant certain annual and long-term incentive awards that are designed to meet the definition of performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code ("Section 162(m)") in order to qualify for the performance-based exception to the $1 million deduction limit.  However, to maintain flexibility in compensating executive officers in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals in the best interest of the Company, the Committee did not previously limit executive compensation to amounts deductible under Section 162(m) if the Committee determined that doing so is in the best interests of the Company.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, substantially modifies Section 162(m) and, among other things, eliminates the performance-based exception to the $1 million deduction limit effective as of January 1, 2018.  As a result, beginning in 2018, compensation paid to certain executive officers in excess of $1 million will generally be non-deductible, whether or not it is performance-based.  In addition, beginning in 2018, the executive officers subject to Section 162(m) (the "Covered Employees") will include any individual who served as the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") or Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") at any time during the taxable year and the three other most highly compensated officers (other than the CEO and CFO) for the taxable year, and once an individual becomes a Covered Employee for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016, that individual will remain a Covered Employee for all future years, including following any termination of employment.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes a transition rule under which the changes to Section 162(m) described above will not apply to compensation payable pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017, and is not materially modified after that date.  To the extent applicable to our existing contracts and awards, the Committee may avail itself of this transition rule.  However, because of uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of the transition rule, no assurances can be given at this time that our existing contracts and awards, even if in place on November 2, 2017, will meet the requirements of the transition rule.  Moreover, to maintain flexibility in compensating executive officers in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals in the best interest of the Company, the Committee does not limit its actions with respect to executive compensation to preserve deductibility under Section 162(m) if the Committee determines that doing so is in the best interests of the Company.

3 Market Cap, Enterprise Value, and Total Shareholder Return (TSR) current as of 12/31/2018.
The Peer Group consists of 13 publicly-traded REITs, most of which have investment credit ratings, operating across a variety of property sectors, with a primary focus on the retail sector, recognizing that the Company competes  with REITs across all property sectors for capital and executive talent.  Relative to the Peer Group, the Company's total assets, equity market capitalization and enterprise value as of December 21, 2018 are between the Peer Group 50th and 75th percentiles.  In determining 2018 pay opportunities for executive officers, the Committee considered the compensation of our NEOs as compared to the compensation of NEOs of companies in our Peer Group.  Pearl Meyer provided the Committee with a detailed analysis of the compensation of our executive officers as compared to the executive officers of companies in our Peer Group, with the overall objective of providing target total pay opportunities comparable to those provided by industry peers, and actual pay that is directionally aligned with performance relative to peers.  For the past one, three, and five years ending December 31, 2018, our total return to shareholders was above the 75% percentile total return of the Peer Group.
We believe that our compensation, benchmarked against our Peer Group, provides an appropriate mix of fixed and variable pay, balances short-term operational performance with long-term shareholder value creation, and encourages executive recruitment and retention.  The Committee compared base salary and total compensation for our executive officers against the Peer Group, generally focusing on targeting aggregate total pay opportunities at or near 50th percentile market values. Compared with the Peer Group, 2018 target total direct compensation (sum of base salary plus target annual cash incentive plus target long-term incentives) was within a competitive range (defined as +/- 15%) of the Peer Group 50th percentile values for each of our NEOs and was equal to 95% of the 50th percentile in the aggregate. 
2018 Executive Compensation Components and How They Relate to Our Objectives
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, base salary, annual cash incentives, cash bonus, and long-term equity-based incentives were the principal components of compensation for the NEOs.  Executives also receive certain benefits and other perquisites.  We believe that these compensation components provide an appropriate mix of fixed and variable pay, balance short-term operational performance with long-term shareholder value, and encourages executive recruitment and retention.  The target aggregate total direct compensation mix for our NEOs was 22% base salary, 27% short term incentive (STI or bonus) and 51% long-term incentive (LTI) compensation which is comparable with the Peer Group 50th percentile target compensation mix.  
The differences in the target amounts and mix of compensation awarded to the NEOs are primarily a result of comparing each executive's compensation against corresponding market values for industry peers and giving consideration to differences in position and responsibilities among the Company's NEOs.  The responsibilities for each named executive officer are as follows: (i) Mr. Whitehurst, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for developing, defining, implementing and executing the Company's corporate strategy, policies, mission, philosophy, goals and objectives; (ii) Mr. Habicht, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary, is responsible for overseeing all capital, financial reporting, tax, information technology and corporate communication matters of the Company and assisting the corporate secretary with his duties; (iii) Mr. Tessitore, our General Counsel and Secretary, is responsible for overseeing all legal matters for the Company, human resources, and various risk management functions; (iv) Mr. Bayer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for overseeing the leasing, asset management, due diligence and underwriting groups of the Company; and  (v) Mr. Horn, our Executive Vice President and Chief Acquisition Officer, is responsible for leading our acquisition department.  Our Committee believes that the different levels of compensation provided to the NEOs are commensurate to the responsibilities of each executive.
Base Salary
The Committee sets and adjusts the base salaries of our NEOs based on the qualifications, experience, scope of responsibilities and past performance of each executive, the practices of and salaries awarded by our Peer Group, and other factors deemed appropriate by the Committee.  The Committee approved 2018 base salary increases for our NEOs  ranging from 2.9% to 10.7% (6.5% average).  After these increases, 2018 base salaries for NEOs were comparable with median levels for the Peer Group, ranging from 88% to 106% of median levels (97% of median levels in the aggregate). 
Annual Incentive Compensation
Cash Incentive Bonus.  We believe that a significant portion of the total compensation of the NEOs should be provided in the form of incentive compensation.  For 2018, the Committee approved annual cash incentive bonus opportunities based upon per share profitability tempered with potential reductions in bonus amounts if balance sheet leverage rose above 50% (85% weighting) and subjective assessment of each NEOs contributions toward corporate objectives, as well as  of individual performance (15% weighting).  Profitability was based on core FFO per share, excluding impairments, charges for retirement severance and debt prepayment, and ranged from $2.59 per share for "threshold" performance to $2.63 per share for "target" level performance to $2.70 per share for "maximum" performance.  Each NEO's bonus opportunity for threshold, target and maximum performance is set forth in the table below.  Straight line interpolation is used to determine awards for results in between performance levels.  The Committee reserved the right, in its sole discretion, to review and further modify the executive compensation program.  The following tables represent the 2018 Annual cash incentive Bonus opportunity and actual awards expressed.

Executive officers receiving a cash incentive bonus may elect to have such bonus paid in cash or in stock of the Company.  If a NEO elects to have the cash incentive bonus paid in stock, the NEO is entitled to receive restricted stock in an amount equal to 125% of the cash incentive bonus, vesting on the third anniversary from grant date based on continued service.
Based on our actual 2018 core FFO per share results of $2.65 per share (excluding impairments and charges for retirement severance and debt prepayment), the Committee approved annual cash incentive bonus awards for NEOs equal to 114.3% of target, with payouts for this component ranging from 115.9% to 168.2% of base salary.  For the strategic / individual performance component, our NEOs were evaluated based on their contributions towards a series of shared corporate strategic objectives as well as individual performance goals related to their respective functions.  Award determinations were based on subjective assessments by the Committee (along with input from the President & Chief Executive Officer for his direct reports) of performance relative to pre-established corporate and individual objectives.  Corporate strategic objectives for 2018 were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Core FFO per share of at least $2.63 per share 
• Acquisitions of $640 million at prudent risk-adjusted yields 
• General & Administrative (G&A) expense (excluding acquisition transaction expenses) at or below $35 million 
• Leverage ratio (total liabilities divided by gross book assets) below 50% 
• 5-year total shareholder return (TSR) in the top half of all equity REITs  
[END TABLE]
Each of these strategic objectives were met or exceeded in 2018.  Our Core FFO was $2.65 per share, acquisitions totaled $715.6 million, G&A expense was $34.2 million, and our leverage ratio was 34.6%.  Our 5-year annualized  TSR as of December 31, 2018 of 14.8% was well above the NAREIT All Equity REIT Index annualized return of 8.32%. 
Our NEOs also generally met or exceeded individual performance objectives tied to their respective functions.  Mr. Whitehurst continued to refine and communicate the strategic plan during a challenging economic environment.  He was also actively involved with staff development and succession planning, while also enhancing Board and investor relations.  Mr. Habicht successfully executed various debt and equity issuances generating net proceeds to the Company of $1,027.4 million with very favorable terms.  He also led efforts to enhance our accounting systems and financial disclosures and was active with staff development and shareholder relations.  Mr. Bayer led disposition and leasing efforts, including the sale of 61 properties generating proceeds of $147.6 million with gains to the Company of $65.1 million.  Mr. Tessitore led the legal department, developing internal staff and managing relationships with external counsel, and advised the Board of Directors on various risk management and corporate governance issues.  He also assumed additional responsibilities, including oversight of the human resources and various other administrative functions.  Mr. Horn led our efforts to acquire a total of 265 properties at an initial cash yield of 6.8%.  He also continued to develop staff, attend meetings with customers and institutional investors, and expand relationships with investment bankers.  Based on these accomplishments, the Committee approved awards for the strategic / individual objectives component ranging from 18.8% to 25.9% of salary. The Committee determined that these payments were consistent with the strong performance of the executive management team.  All cash incentive awards are reflected in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table below.
Long-Term Incentive Compensation
For 2018, the Committee approved long-term incentive compensation opportunities for executive officers, provided through a 60/40 weighted mix of performance-based restricted stock and service-based restricted stock.  Additionally, the EVP and Chief Acquisition Officer (Mr. Horn) received a supplemental services- based restricted stock grant, valued at 70% of base salary, to further enhance retention.  Total target award opportunities for NEOs ranged from 160% to 315% of base salary, varying by position, as set forth in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2018 Target Long-Term Incentive Award Opportunity  (as% of Salary) 
Position Performance Restricted Shares (60%) Service Restricted Shares (40%) Total Target Award 
President & Chief Executive Officer 189% 126% 315% 
EVP, CFO, Assistant Secretary, & Treasurer 120% 80% 200% 
EVP & Chief Investment Officer 96% 64% 160% 
EVP & General Counsel 96% 64% 160% 
EVP & Chief Acquisition Officer 96% 134% 230% 
[END TABLE]
 Service-based restricted stock vests annually over a four-year period to enhance retention and promote long-term equity ownership.  Performance-based restricted stock vests, if at all, at the end of three years on January 1, 2021.  Vesting for performance-based restricted stock is tied to our total shareholder return relative to other companies in the NAREIT All Equity REIT Index for the three-year period ending December 31, 2020.  The Committee chose this comparator group to allow for performance assessments within our applicable industry group, recognizing that we compete with REITs across various property sectors for investor capital.  Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") includes stock price appreciation plus dividends over the three-year period, with calculations for the Company and comparators based on ten-day average closing stock prices leading up to the start and end of the measurement period.  Performance levels and corresponding award funding levels for 2018 performance-based restricted stock grants are summarized in the following table.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Performance Level 3-Year Relative TSR Positioning% of Target Award Funded 
Below Threshold Below 33rd Percentile 0% 
Threshold 33rd Percentile 50% 
Target 50th Percentile 100% 
Superior 75th Percentile or Above 200% 
[END TABLE]
For performance-based restricted share grants, 50% of the corresponding target award opportunity is earned for threshold performance, 100% for target performance, and 200% for maximum performance.  No performance-based shares are earned for results below the threshold level.  Straight line interpolation is used to determine awards for results in between performance levels.
The number of shares of service-based restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock granted was based on the average closing share price of our Common Stock for ten days prior to the grant date ($37.650 per share).  Accordingly, the Committee approved grants of service-based restricted stock and target grants of performance-based restricted stock to Messrs. Whitehurst (25,936 service-based and 38,904 performance-based shares), Habicht (10,943 service-based and 16,414 performance-based shares), Bayer (6,578 service-based and 9,868 performance based shares) and Tessitore (7,020 service-based and 10,531 performance-based shares each), and Horn (12,279 service-based and 8,797 performance-based shares) as shown in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table.
Executive officers are entitled to receive dividends on unvested shares of service-based restricted stock.  Dividends payable on performance-based restricted stock will accumulate and be payable to the executive officers only if and to the extent the shares vest.  No tax gross-ups shall be paid to the executive officers on any service-based restricted stock nor on any performance-based restricted stock.
In  2016, the executive officers were granted a performance-based restricted stock award as part of the 2016 executive compensation plan.  Vesting for this award was tied to our total shareholder return relative to all Equity REITs in the NAREIT Index for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018.  The Company's total shareholder return during this period was at the  73.2nd percentile compared to all Equity REITs in the NAREIT Index.  As a result, executive officers earned approximately 192.8% of the target number of shares granted.  These shares are included in the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End because they did not vest until January 1, 2019.
Benefits and Other Perquisites
We provide benefits to our executive officers under the National Retail Properties, Inc. Retirement Plan.  We do not sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for our executive officers or any other associates.  Our NEOs are eligible to receive, on the same basis as other associates, employer matching contributions under the plan.  This allows our executive officers to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis through the Section 401(k) savings feature of the plan, with the Company-funded portion of these benefits based on matching the contributions of the executive officers.
Our NEOs are also eligible to participate in the other employee benefit and welfare plans that the Company maintains on similar terms as associates who meet applicable eligibility criteria. We do not consider perquisites to be a principal component of our executive officers' compensation.  Costs attributed to the perquisites and other personal benefits afforded to the named executive officers for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, are shown in the "Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table below.
We believe that our executive officer benefit and perquisite programs provided are reasonable and competitive with benefits and perquisites provided to executive officers of other REITs, and are necessary to sustain a fully competitive executive compensation program.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control
Effective December 1, 2008, the Company entered into new employment agreements with Messrs. Whitehurst, Habicht, Bayer, and Tessitore, each as amended effective November 8, 2010, in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.  The Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Horn on January 2, 2014.  The Company amended and restated the employment agreement of Mr. Whitehurst on September 29, 2016, which amended and restated agreement became effective on April 28, 2017.  Each employment agreement is subject to automatic successive two-year renewals unless one party provides written notice to the other party of non-renewal 60 days prior to the expiration date of the agreement.  The initial expiration date for each employment agreement was as follows: (a) August 17, 2011, for Messrs. Habicht and Whitehurst; (b) January 2, 2011, for Messrs. Bayer and Tessitore,  and (c) January 2, 2015, for Mr. Horn.  Messrs. Whitehurst, Habicht, Bayer, Horn, and Tessitore are collectively referred to herein as  the "Executives" and each, an "Executive."  Each agreement contains provisions that provide for certain payments or benefits to the Executive upon the occurrence of certain events, including death or disability, termination by the Company for "cause" or by the Executive without "good reason," termination by the Company without "cause" or by the Executive with "good reason," termination upon expiration of the employment agreement, and, with respect to Mr. Whitehurst only, termination upon retirement.  In the event the Executive is unable to perform his job duties due to death or disability, each agreement provides for payment of his accrued salary, a prorated performance bonus and, for a period of one year following termination of the agreement due to death, health benefits under the Company's health plans and programs to the Executive's dependents.  In the event the Executive is terminated by the Company for "cause" or the Executive terminates his employment agreement without "good reason," the Executive is entitled to his accrued salary and benefits prior to the date of termination.
Each agreement and the Executive Compensation Program also contain severance provisions that call for payment to the Executive of the following amounts in the event that he is terminated without "cause" or he resigns for "good reason":
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accrued and unpaid salary through the date of termination; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a cash payment equal to 200% (with respect to Messrs. Bayer, Horn, and Tessitore), 250% (with respect to Mr. Habicht), and 300% (with respect to Mr. Whitehurst) of his respective annual salary; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a cash payment equal to 200% (with respect to Messrs. Bayer, Horn, and Tessitore), 250% (with respect to Mr. Habicht), and 300% (with respect to Mr. Whitehurst) of his respective average bonus for the last three years of employment under the agreement; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• immediate vesting of his service-based restricted stock awards, stock options and other equity awards, and all performance-based awards will be allowed to run their course to determine the performance level, and the executive officers will receive such award upon vesting; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for a period of one year after termination (but in no event after the Executive becomes eligible to receive benefits of the same type from another employer), health benefits under the Company's health plans and programs generally available to senior executives of the Company; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in the event of such a termination upon or after a "change of control," a prorated annual non-equity bonus at the target level for the year in which termination occurred. 
[END TABLE]
"Retirement" is defined in the Amended Whitehurst Employment Agreement as voluntary termination of employment by Mr. Whitehurst following the date that Mr. Whitehurst attains age 64, accompanied by written notice from Mr. Whitehurst to the Board of Directors at least 60 days prior to the proposed effective date of retirement notifying the Company of Mr. Whitehurst's election to retire, which such election shall be irrevocable.  Because Mr. Whitehurst was not 64 as of December 31, 2018, no retirement payments would have been payable to Mr. Whitehurst if he retired on that date.  No other employment agreement between the Company and an executive officer provides for payments upon retirement.
Under each employment agreement and the executive compensation program, in the event the agreement naturally terminates at the end of its term because the Company elects not to renew, the Executive will be entitled to the following severance payments:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accrued and unpaid salary through the date of termination; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a cash payment equal to 100% of his annual salary; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• service-based restricted stock awards will accelerate on a pro rata amount based on the date of termination; and all performance-based units and restricted stock awards will be allowed to run their course to determine the performance level and the executive officers will receive a pro rata share based on the date of termination; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for a period of one year after termination (but in no event after the Executive becomes eligible to receive benefits of the same type from another employer), health benefits under the Company's health plans and programs generally available to senior executives of the Company; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a prorated annual non-equity bonus at the target level for the year in which termination occurred. 
[END TABLE]
In addition to the foregoing payments, each Executive, other than Mr. Horn and other than Mr. Whitehurst, will be entitled to gross-up payments to the extent such payments result in the imposition of excise tax, interest or penalties.  In connection with the Company's policy to cease providing gross-up payments, Mr. Whitehurst agreed to eliminate any such entitlements to gross-up payments in the Amended Whitehurst Employment Agreement.  The Committee does not intend to provide excise tax gross-up payments in any future employment agreements. 
"Cause" is defined in each Executive's agreement as the Executive's:
[BEGIN TABLE]

Pay Ratio
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Julian E. Whitehurst, our President and Chief Executive Officer.  The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
We determined our median employee based on total compensation including the base salary of, bonuses paid to and incentive stock awards issued to each of our 67 employees (excluding the Chief Executive Officer) as of December 31, 2018.  Once we identified our median employee, we combined all of the elements of such employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $93,559.  As disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table appearing on page 27, our current Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation for 2018 was $4,902,894.  Based on the foregoing, our estimate of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees was 52 to 1.  Given the different methodologies that various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio reported above should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies.  
PROPOSAL II
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") enables our stockholders to vote, on a non-binding advisory basis, to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement.
As described in detail under the heading "Executive Compensation-Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our executive compensation programs are designed to attract and retain our named executive officers, motivate them to perform to their fullest potential, and align their interests with the interests of our stockholders.  Under these programs, our named executive officers are rewarded for the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic and corporate goals.  Please read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis for additional details about our executive compensation programs and policies, including information about the fiscal 2018 compensation of our named executive officers.
The Compensation Committee continually reviews the compensation programs for our named executive officers to ensure they achieve the desired goals of aligning our executive compensation structure with our stockholders' interests, key business objectives and current market practices.  We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as described in this proxy statement.  This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers' compensation.  This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement.  Accordingly, we will ask our stockholders to vote for the following resolution at the annual meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the related tables and disclosure."
While this vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or our Board of Directors, we value the opinions of our stockholders and will consider those opinions and the vote outcome when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement.  
PROPOSAL III
RATIFICATION OF
ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee appointed Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Company's principal independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Company's financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019, to review quarterly interim results and to perform other appropriate accounting services.  We are requesting ratification of such appointment by the stockholders.
Ernst & Young LLP has acted as our independent registered public accounting firm for our three most recent fiscal years and our Audit Committee currently believes that we should continue our relationship with Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  In the event that the stockholders do not ratify this appointment by the requisite vote, the Audit Committee will reconsider its appointment of Ernst & Young LLP.
A representative of Ernst & Young LLP will be present at the annual meeting and will be provided with the opportunity to make a statement if desired.  Such representative will also be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Fiscal 2018 and 2017 Audit Firm Summary.  During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we retained Ernst & Young LLP to provide services in the following categories and amounts:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Fiscal Year 2018   Fiscal Year 2017 
Audit Fees (1)   $ 1,402,766         $ 1,274,647

All Other Fees    -       -   
Total Fees   $ 1,448,876         $ 1,307,112     
[END TABLE]
__________
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Audit fees include the audit fee and fees for comfort letters, attest services, consents and assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC (including those related to securities offerings).  Aggregate fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP associated with the issuance of comfort letters to underwriters in connection with securities offerings amounted to $210,066 in 2018 and $136,747 in 2017 , respectively. 
(2)  Audit related fees consist of fees incurred for consultation concerning financial accounting and reporting standards, performance of agreed-upon procedures, and other audit or attest services not required by statute or regulation. 
(3)  Tax fees consist of fees for tax compliance services and consulting. 
[END TABLE]
Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Accountants.  Consistent with SEC policies regarding auditor independence, the Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing the work of the independent accountants.  In recognition of this responsibility, the Audit Committee has established a policy to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent accountants.
Prior to engagement of the independent accountants for the next year's audit, management will submit to the Audit Committee for approval an aggregate of services expected to be rendered during that year for each of the services described above in the captions Audit Fees, Audit Related Fees and Tax Fees.
Prior to engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approves these services by category of service.  The fees are budgeted and the Audit Committee requires the independent accountants and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically throughout the year by category of service.  During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent accountants for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval.  In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent accountants. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Audit Committee pre-approved 100% of services described above in the captions Audit Related Fees, Tax Fees and All Other Fees.  For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, no hours expended on Ernst & Young LLP's engagement to audit our financial statements were attributed to work performed by persons other than full-time, permanent employees of Ernst & Young LLP.
Pursuant to our Audit Committee charter, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to the chairman of the Audit Committee, who shall promptly advise the remaining members of the Audit Committee of such approval at the next regularly scheduled meeting.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

Officers, directors and greater than ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Forms 3, 4 and 5 they file.
Based solely on the Company's review of the copies of such forms it has received, written representations from certain reporting persons that they were not required to file Forms 5 for the last fiscal year and other information known to the Company, the Company believes that, except as described below, all its officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners complied with all filing requirements applicable to them with respect to transactions filed during fiscal year 2018.  
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
The Audit Committee is charged with monitoring and reviewing the material facts of any transactions with related parties and either approving or disapproving the entry into such transactions.  The Audit Committee has adopted a written policy governing transactions with related parties.  In determining whether to approve or ratify a transaction with a related party, the Audit Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction.
