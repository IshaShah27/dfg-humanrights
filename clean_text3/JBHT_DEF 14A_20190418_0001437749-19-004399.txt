Ensuring the roads are safe for our drivers and everyone on the road is important to us. We train drivers to understand and comply with required safety measures.
J.B. Hunt has made considerable investments in safety over the past 20 years. Safety is a core value and part of our corporate culture. It just has to be. We share the road with millions of people across the country every day, and our livelihood depends on keeping those roads as safe as possible for everyone.

In CSA (Compliance, Safety, Accountability), our safety performance falls below the threshold in FMCSA's on-road safety performance BASICs (Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories) for unsafe driving, hours of service (HOS), driver fitness, controlled substance/alcohol, vehicle maintenance, and crash indicator.
Proxy Statement – Summary
Public safety is further promoted through smart purchasing decisions. As new safety technologies are made available, we carefully evaluate each to determine the overall impact and benefit they could bring to our drivers, trucks, and equipment.

Process for Reviewing and Setting Nonemployee Director Compensation
The Executive Compensation Committee reviews the adequacy and competitiveness of the nonemployee director compensation program annually and makes recommendations to the full Board for approval. Each year, the Committee directs its compensation consultant to provide an independent assessment of the Company's nonemployee director compensation program. The consultant analyzes and compares the Company's program against the same peer group used to benchmark executive officer compensation (see page 38 for further details about the peer group). The Committee targets total nonemployee director compensation levels at a competitive range of peer group total compensation. The Committee also considers total aggregate Board compensation and other factors when making recommendations to the Board for approval.

Corporate Governance
Director Independence
The Board is composed of a majority of directors who satisfy the criteria for independence under the NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards. In determining independence, each year the Board affirmatively determines, among other items, whether the directors have no material relationship with the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to the NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards. When assessing the "materiality" of a director's relationship with the Company, if any, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances, not merely from the director's standpoint, but from that of the persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation and the frequency or regularity of the services, whether the services are being carried out at arm's length in the ordinary course of business, and whether the services are being provided substantially on the same terms to the Company as those prevailing at the time from unrelated parties for comparable transactions. Material relationships can include commercial, banking, industrial, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable and familial relationships. The Board also considers any other relationship that could interfere with the exercise of independence or judgment in carrying out the duties of a director.
Applying these independence standards, the Board has determined that Douglas G. Duncan, Francesca M. Edwardson, Sharilyn S. Gasaway, Gary C. George, Coleman H. Peterson, and James L. Robo are all independent directors. After due consideration, the Board has determined that none of these nonemployee directors have a material relationship with the Company or any of its subsidiaries (either directly or indirectly as a partner, stockholder or officer of any organization that has a relationship with the Company or any of its subsidiaries) and that they all meet the criteria for independence under the NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards.
Risk Management and Oversight
As previously described in their biographies, current members of our Board represent diverse backgrounds of business and academic experience. The Board, as a whole, performs the risk oversight of the Company and does not assign the task or responsibility to any one member or a committee. Therefore, the Board believes that the members each possess unique yet complementary experiences and backgrounds that create diverse points of view, opinions, personalities and management styles that allow for the proper risk management and oversight of the Company.
Independent Lead Director
The Board has established the position of Independent Lead Director, to which James L. Robo was appointed. The Independent Lead Director directs the executive sessions of independent directors at the Board meetings at which the Chairman is not present and has authority to call meetings of independent directors. The Independent Lead Director facilitates communication between the Chairman, the CEO and the independent directors, as appropriate, and performs such other functions as the Board directs.
Independent Director Meetings
Independent directors generally meet in executive session as part of each regularly scheduled Board meeting, with discussion led by the Independent Lead Director.
Corporate Governance
Director Recommendations by Stockholders
In addition to recommendations from Board members, management or professional search firms, the Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates properly submitted by stockholders who individually or as a group have beneficially owned at least 2% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock for at least one year from the date the recommendation is submitted. Stockholders must submit director candidate recommendations in writing by Certified Mail to the Company's Corporate Secretary not less than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the Proxy Statement relating to the Company's previous Annual Meeting. Accordingly, for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, director candidates must be submitted to the Company's Corporate Secretary by November 9, 2019. Director candidates submitted by stockholders must contain at least the following information:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the name and address of the recommending stockholder,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the number of shares of the Company's common stock beneficially owned by the recommending stockholder and the dates such shares were purchased,

[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the candidate, if elected, will comply with the Company's corporate governance guidelines and any other applicable rule, regulation, policy or standard of conduct applicable to the Board and its individual members,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the recommending stockholder will maintain beneficial ownership of at least 2% of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock through the date of the Annual Meeting for which the candidate is being recommended for nomination and that, upon the candidate's nomination and election to the Board, the recommending stockholder intends to maintain such ownership throughout the candidate's term as director, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the recommending stockholder and the candidate will promptly provide any additional information requested by the Corporate Governance Committee and/or the Board to assist in the consideration of the candidate, including a completed and signed Questionnaire for Directors and Officers on the Company's standard form and an interview with the Corporate Governance Committee or its representative.  
[END TABLE]
For a complete list of the information that must be included in director recommendations submitted by stockholders, please see the "Director Recommendations by Stockholders Policy" on the "Corporate Governance" page of the "Investors" section of our website at jbhunt.com. The Corporate Governance Committee will consider all director candidates submitted through its established processes and will evaluate each of them, including incumbents, based on the same criteria. However, the Corporate Governance Committee may prefer incumbent directors and director candidates whom they know personally or who have relevant industry experience and in-depth knowledge of the Company's business and operations.
Corporate Governance
The policies and procedures as set forth above are intended to provide flexible guidelines for the effective functioning of the Company's director nomination process. The Board intends to review these policies and procedures periodically and anticipates that modifications may be necessary from time to time as the Company's needs and circumstances change.
Board Composition and Director Qualifications
The Corporate Governance Committee periodically assesses the appropriate size and composition of the Board and whether any vacancies on the Board are expected. In the event that vacancies are anticipated or otherwise arise, the Corporate Governance Committee will review and assess potential director candidates. The Corporate Governance Committee utilizes various methods for identifying and evaluating candidates for director. Candidates may come to the attention of the Corporate Governance Committee through recommendations of Board members, management, stockholders or professional search firms. Generally, director candidates should, at a minimum:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● possess relevant business and financial expertise and experience, including a basic understanding of fundamental financial statements,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● have exemplary character and integrity and be willing to work constructively with others,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● have sufficient time to devote to Board meetings and consultation on Board matters, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● be free from conflicts of interest that violate applicable law or interfere with director performance.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Corporate Governance Committee seeks director candidates who possess the following qualities and skills:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the capacity and desire to represent the interests of the Company's stockholders as a whole,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● occupational experience and perspective that, together with other directors, enhances the quality of the Board,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● leadership experience and sound business judgment,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● accomplishments in their respective field, with superior credentials and recognition,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● knowledge of the critical aspects of the Company's business and operations, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the ability to contribute to the mix of skills, core competencies and qualifications of the Board through expertise in one or more of the following areas:  
[END TABLE]
– accounting and finance
– mergers and acquisitions
– investment management
– law
– academia
– strategic planning
– investor relations
– executive leadership development
– executive compensation
– service as a senior officer of, or a trusted adviser to senior management of, a publicly held company.
Corporate Governance
The independent members of the Board each possess the general skills, experience, attributes and qualifications that make them a proper fit for the Company's Board as described above. Specific strengths and qualities possessed by each member that makes him or her eligible to serve on the Company's Board include:
Douglas G. Duncan – 30 years of experience in the transportation industry
Francesca M. Edwardson – business experience in the transportation industry, law, human resources, and corporate governance
Sharilyn S. Gasaway – accounting, finance, mergers and acquisitions, and regulatory experience
Gary C. George – business experience related to managing a diversified business headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas
Coleman H. Peterson – human resource experience with a large international workforce, corporate governance, and retail experience
James L. Robo – financial expertise, leadership experience, and business experience related to equipment and the transportation industry
Messrs. Garrison, Hunt, Roberts and Thompson, as nonindependent directors, have extensive work experience and history with the Company from its origins, which the Board believes is critical to its composition.
Overboarding
To further facilitate each director's ability to effectively serve as a member of the Board, each director is limited to serving on no more than four boards of directors of publicly held companies in total, including that of the Company. In addition, a director is required to obtain Board approval prior to joining the board of another publicly held company, which allows the Board to exercise its judgment regarding various considerations and potential conflicts of interest.
Board Diversity
As indicated by the criteria above, the Board prefers a mix of background and experience among its members. Furthermore, the Board is diverse both in gender and ethnic representation, with 30% of our current members reflecting female or minority demographics. The Board does not follow any ratio or formula to determine the appropriate mix. Rather, it uses its judgment to identify nominees whose backgrounds, attributes and experiences, taken as a whole, will contribute to the high standards of Board service to the Company. The effectiveness of this approach is evidenced by the directors' participation in insightful and robust yet mutually respectful deliberation that occurs at Board and Committee meetings.
Board Leadership Structure
The Company split the titles, roles and responsibilities of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer in 1985. The Company and the Board believe that, while the duties may be performed by the same person without consequence to either Company operations or stockholders' interest, separation of duties allows the Chairman to focus more on active participation by the Board and oversight of management, while the Chief Executive Officer is better able to focus on day-to-day operations of the Company.
Corporate Governance
Communications With The Board
Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Board, Board Committees, the independent or the nonmanagement directors, each as a group or any director individually by submitting their communications in writing to the attention of the Company's Corporate Secretary. All communications must identify the recipient and author, state whether the author is a stockholder of the Company, and be forwarded to the following address via Certified Mail:
J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.
Attention: Corporate Secretary
615 J.B. Hunt Corporate Drive
Lowell, Arkansas 72745
The directors of the Company have instructed the Corporate Secretary not to forward to the intended recipient any communications that are reasonably determined in good faith by the Corporate Secretary to relate to improper or irrelevant topics or that are substantially incomplete.
Board Meetings
The Board held four scheduled meetings during the 2018 calendar year. All directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the Board meetings and committee meetings on which each served during 2018. All members of the Board attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Company has adopted a Director Attendance Policy to stress the importance of attendance, director preparedness, and active and effective participation at Board and Board Committee meetings.
Board Committees
Standing committees of the Board include the Audit, Executive Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees. Committee members are elected annually by the Board and serve until their successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier death, retirement, resignation or removal.
The following table summarizes the membership of the Board and each of its committees and the number of times each met during calendar year 2018:

As required by applicable law, the Company will post on the "Corporate Governance" page of the "Investors" section of its website at jbhunt.com any amendments or waivers of any provision of this Code of Ethics made for the benefit of executive officers or directors of the Company.
Corporate Governance Guidelines
The Board has adopted corporate governance guidelines and policies to assist it in exercising its responsibilities to the Company and its stockholders. These guidelines address, among other items, director qualifications and responsibilities, Board Committees and nonemployee director compensation.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires each director, officer and any individual beneficially owning more than 10% of the Company's common stock to file with the SEC reports of security ownership and reports on subsequent changes in ownership. These reports are generally due within two business days of the transaction giving rise to the reporting obligation.
To the Company's knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to the Company and written representations that no other reports were required, all Section 16(a) filings were made in a timely manner, with the exception of Wayne Garrison and Darren Field, each who had one late filing to report the sale of shares and Kirk Thompson, who had one late filing to report the purchase of shares through the reinvestment of cash dividends paid.

Executive Compensation
Report of the Executive Compensation Committee
The 2018 Executive Compensation Committee (the Compensation Committee) was composed of Coleman H. Peterson, Chairman, Francesca M. Edwardson, Sharilyn S. Gasaway, and Gary C. George, none of whom is an officer or employee of the Company and all of whom have been determined by the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) to be independent. Additionally, all members of the Compensation Committee qualify as "nonemployee directors" for purposes of Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act and as "outside directors" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the Code).
The Compensation Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, a copy of which is available on the "Corporate Governance" page of the "Investors" section of the Company's website at jbhunt.com. In carrying out its responsibilities, the Compensation Committee, among other things:
[BEGIN TABLE]

● reviews other Company executive compensation programs, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● reviews and approves the Compensation Committee report to the stockholders and the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (the CD&A) report included in the Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
The Chairman of the Board recommends to the Compensation Committee the form and amount of compensation to be paid to the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer provides recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding the form and amount of compensation to be paid to executive officers who report directly to him. Additionally, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer regularly attend Compensation Committee meetings, except for executive sessions. Upon request, management has provided to the Compensation Committee historical and prospective breakdowns of primary compensation components for each executive officer, wealth accumulation analyses and internal pay equity analyses as described in more detail below.
At our 2018 Annual Meeting, the stockholders approved, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers (98.9% of votes cast). The Compensation Committee believes this level of stockholder support reflects a strong endorsement of the Company's compensation policies and decisions. The Compensation Committee has considered the results of the last advisory vote on executive compensation in determining the Company's compensation policies and decisions for 2019, and has determined that these policies and decisions are appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders at this time. In addition, at our 2017 Annual Meeting, the stockholders voted for approval of a frequency of holding advisory votes every year with respect to named executive officer compensation (93.4% of votes cast). Accordingly, an advisory vote on executive compensation has been included as Proposal Number Two within this Proxy Statement.
Executive Compensation
In 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (Meridian) to review the Company's executive compensation policies and practices. Meridian was also directed to assist with the development of a comparable peer group for executive compensation purposes and to benchmark compensation levels for the NEOs. Meridian is retained by, and reports to, the Compensation Committee to provide compensation analyses and consultation at the Committee's request.
The Compensation Committee met three times in 2018 to discuss, among other items, the salaries, bonuses and other compensation of the senior executive officers and other key employees of the Company, including the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee did not act by unanimous consent at any time in 2018.
Historically, the Compensation Committee meets during the first quarter to finalize discussion regarding the Company's performance goals for the previous and current year with respect to performance-based compensation to be paid to executive officers and to approve its report for the Proxy Statement. These goals are approved within 90 days of the beginning of the year, pursuant to the Code. In addition, during this and other regularly scheduled meetings throughout the year, the Compensation Committee meets to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● discusses any new compensation issues,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● review base compensation, bonus and MIP award analyses,

Compensation Philosophy and Principles
The Compensation Committee acknowledges that the transportation industry is highly competitive and that experienced professionals have career mobility. The Company believes that it competes for executive talent with a large number of companies, some of which have significantly larger market capitalizations and others of which are privately owned. Retention of key talent remains critical to our success. The Company's need to focus on retention is compounded by its size and geographic location. The Company's compensation program is structured to attract, retain and develop executive talent with the ability to assume a broad span of responsibilities and successfully lead complex business units to market-leading positions in the industry. The Compensation Committee believes that the ability to attract, retain and provide appropriate incentives for professional personnel, including the senior executive officers and other key employees of the Company, is essential to maintaining the Company's leading competitive position, thereby providing for the long-term success of the Company. The Compensation Committee's goal is to maintain compensation programs that are competitive within the transportation industry. Each year, the Compensation Committee reviews the executive compensation program with respect to external competitiveness and linkage between executive compensation and creation of stockholder value and determines what changes, if any, are appropriate.
The overall compensation philosophy of the Compensation Committee and management is guided by the following principles:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Compensation levels should be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain key talent. The Company aims to attract, motivate and retain high-performance talent to achieve and maintain a leading position in our industry. Our total compensation package should be strongly competitive with other transportation and logistics companies.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Compensation should relate directly to performance and responsibility. Total compensation should be tied to and vary with performance and responsibility, both at the Company and individual level, in achieving financial, operational and strategic objectives. Differentiated pay for high-performing individuals should be proportional to their contributions to the Company's success.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Short-term incentive compensation should constitute a significant portion of total executive compensation. A large portion of total compensation should be tied to performance, and therefore at risk, as position and responsibility increase. Individuals with greater roles and the ability to directly impact strategic direction and long-term results should bear a greater proportion of the risk.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Long-term incentive compensation, the Company's Management Incentive Plan (the MIP), should be closely aligned with stockholders' interests. Awards of long-term compensation encourage executive officers to focus on the Company's long-range growth and development and incent them to manage from the perspective of stockholders with a meaningful stake in the Company, as well as to focus on long-term career orientation. Participants in the MIP are required to own Company stock. The requirements are discussed in this CD&A under the caption "Stock Ownership Guidelines."  
[END TABLE]
The Company's executive compensation program is designed to reward the achievement of initiatives regarding growth, productivity and people, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● setting, implementing and communicating strategies, goals and objectives to ensure that the Company grows revenue and earnings at rates that are comparable to or greater than those of our peers and that create value for our stockholders,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● motivating and exhibiting leadership that aligns the interests of our employees with those of our stockholders,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● developing a grasp of the competitive environment and taking steps to position the Company for growth and as a competitive force in the industry,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● constantly renewing the Company's business model and seeking strategic opportunities that benefit the Company and its stockholders, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● implementing a discipline of compliance and focusing on the highest standards of professional conduct.  
[END TABLE]
PROCESS OF SETTING COMPENSATION
Benchmarking Against a Peer Group
The Compensation Committee engaged Meridian to perform a competitive market assessment for the NEOs to evaluate base salary, target annual incentives, target total cash compensation, long-term incentives and total direct compensation.
The assessment involved the use of a peer group, as noted below, consisting of 14 transportation and logistics companies in the national marketplace. This peer group was updated in 2017 to further include companies of comparable size, complexity of operations, or similar customer base. These companies represent both business competition and the most relevant labor market for our executives.
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Hub Group, Inc.   Kansas City Southern   Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings, Inc.

 Ryder System, Inc.   Schneider National Inc.   Stericycle Inc.  
 Waste Management Inc.   XPO Logistics Inc.    
[END TABLE]
For 2018, Swift Transportation Company was replaced by Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings, Inc. as a result of a corporate merger. No other changes were made to the peer group in 2018.
Executive Compensation
Compensation Analysis Tools
In addition to the competitive compensation survey information for each officer that was compiled, the Compensation Committee also reviewed historical executive compensation. The Compensation Committee anticipates that pertinent compensation information will continue to be developed and enhanced to allow the Committee to perform the most relevant analyses practicable.
Our objective for total executive compensation is to target a competitive range around the 50th percentile of the peer group. We believe that a sizeable portion of overall compensation should be at risk and tied to stockholder value. Historically, our bonuses have been tied to operating income, earnings before taxes (EBT), revenue, earnings per share (EPS), or other identified metrics. As these items increase, so do executive bonuses. Long-term incentives are used as tools to reward executives for current and future performance, to encourage an executive to remain with the Company and to align the executive's interests with those of our stockholders. As part of our long-term incentive strategy, executives are expected to maintain stock ownership values as a multiple of their base salaries. Long-term incentives for NEOs are performance-based. While certain components of compensation are directly tied to the Company's reported financial performance, sufficient accounting and operational controls are in place and tested effectively to ensure that the Company's compensation practices and policies, including those for nonexecutives, are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Our Company has a 401(k) plan that assists participants in providing for retirement. The Company contributes to each NEO's account per year based on the NEO's voluntary contribution amount. The equity buildup in unvested equity-based awards and stock owned currently is critical to each executive's ability to adequately provide for his or her retirement. As previously mentioned and explained in detail later, we have a Company stock ownership policy for our executives, but we do not have a "hold until retirement" restriction. We do not believe that such a restriction is prudent for the employee or necessary to protect our Company.
Long-Term Compensation Analyses and Policies
With respect to long-term, equity-based awards, the Company maintains the MIP. The MIP was originally adopted and approved by the Board on March 17, 1989, and an amended and restated MIP was subsequently approved by the stockholders on May 11, 1995. The MIP has been amended and restated since the time of its adoption, and all amendments requiring approval of the stockholders have been approved, with the last approval occurring at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders held in 2017. Currently, there are 44 million shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the MIP, of which approximately 6.3 million shares are available for future equity-based awards.
Performance-based restricted share units, time-vested restricted share units and stock options of the Company may be granted under the MIP in an effort to link future compensation to the long-term financial success of the Company. These equity-based awards are granted to executive officers, including the NEOs, and other key employees and are intended to attract and retain employees, to provide incentives to enhance job performance, and to enable those persons to participate in the long-term success and growth of the Company through an equity interest in the Company.
The Compensation Committee typically grants performance-based restricted share units to the NEOs of the Company. Each grant typically vests ratably over five years based on service and performance conditions. Each portion that vests in a particular year, or each tranche, of performance-based awards is contingent on the Company's attainment of predetermined performance metrics established by the Compensation Committee. Historically, the Compensation Committee has set operating income targets for each tranche of performance-based restricted share units granted to NEOs. Therefore, while an NEO may receive a grant that vests over a period of years, the operating income performance metric must be met for each tranche in order for the NEO to receive the full value of grant.
Executive Compensation
Failure to meet the operating income metric for any tranche would cause that portion of the total grant to be forfeited by the NEO. The Compensation Committee believes that performance-based restricted share units are currently more effective than stock options in achieving the Company's compensation objectives, as these grants are subject to less market volatility and are less dilutive to stockholders. NEOs realize immediate value as restricted share units vest, with such value increasing as the Company's stock performance increases. Cash dividends are not paid and there are no voting rights on unvested restricted share units.
The Company does not have a formal policy, but has an established practice described below, with respect to the granting of any form of equity compensation. The Company does not have a policy or practice of either timing equity-based compensation grants to current or new executive officers, or timing the release of material, nonpublic information to affect the value of executive compensation. Recommendations for all Section 16 filers, except for the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, are presented to the Compensation Committee by the Chief Executive Officer. The Chairman of the Board recommends to the Compensation Committee the award for the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee approves or adjusts the award using the above tools for all Section 16 filers, except for the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. The awards for the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are recommended by the Compensation Committee and submitted for final approval to the Company's independent Board members. This process occurs during our first-quarter Board and Committee meetings in late January of each year to better coincide with the reporting of annual financial and operating results. We consider this our annual award date. The Compensation Committee does not expect to delegate approval authority to grant awards to management or any subcommittee at this time or in the near future. The grant date is typically set by the Compensation Committee. In 2018, 427,205 annual award grants were made on January 24, the date of the first-quarter Board meeting of 2018. Grants have been made in months other than the annual award dates on a very limited basis. The limited exceptions to this grant-date practice have included, for example, the hiring of a key employee or the promotion of an employee to an executive office.
As stated above, the Company does not have a policy or practice of timing the grant of equity-based awards and the release of material, nonpublic information in a manner that would affect compensation for new or current executive officers, nor has it deliberately or knowingly done so. In the event that material, nonpublic information becomes known to the Compensation Committee, the Company or its employees at a time when such information could affect or otherwise impact the imminent grant of equity-based compensation, management and the Compensation Committee will take the existence of such information under advisement and determine whether to delay the grant of such equity-based compensation to a later date to avoid the appearance of any impropriety.
Deductibility of Compensation and Other Regulatory Considerations
Section 162(m) of the Code places a limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation the Company may deduct for federal income tax purposes in any one year with respect to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the next three most highly compensated executive officers whose compensation is required to be disclosed in the Company's annual Proxy Statement (the Covered Employees). Historically, there has been an exception to this $1 million limitation for performance-based compensation that meets certain requirements, and the Chief Financial Officer has been excluded from the definition of a Covered Employee. Effective January 1, 2018, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the exception for performance-based compensation was eliminated, and compensation paid to the Chief Financial Officer is now subject to the $1 million deduction limitation. The amendments to Section 162(m) include a grandfather provision for compensation under a written contract in effect on November 2, 2017, that is not materially modified after such date. The Company therefore believes that the performance-based equity awards granted to its named executive officers before November 2, 2017, will continue to be eligible for the performance-based exception provided certain requirements are met.
Executive Compensation
In reviewing the effectiveness of the Company's compensation program, the Compensation Committee considers the anticipated tax treatment to the Company and to its executives of various payments and benefits. Additionally, the deductibility of certain compensation payments depends upon the timing of an executive's vesting or exercise of previously granted awards, as well as interpretations and changes in the tax laws and other factors beyond the Compensation Committee's control. For these and other reasons, including the need to maintain flexibility in compensating executive officers in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals, the Compensation Committee will not necessarily, nor in all circumstances, limit executive compensation to that which is deductible under the Code. The Company has not adopted a policy requiring all compensation to be deductible.
The Compensation Committee intends to preserve the deductibility of awards granted before November 2, 2017, to the extent reasonably practicable under the current law. The MIP contains specific language and requirements regarding performance-based awards granted to a Covered Employee intended to be "qualified performance-based compensation" as defined by the Code. These awards shall be based on the attainment of one or more objective performance goals established in writing by the Committee. Performance goals must be based on one or more criteria approved by the MIP (e.g., revenue, operating income, return on assets) and be based on an objective formula or standard. The Committee is currently using approved targeted annual operating income levels as the performance criteria for all outstanding qualified performance-based restricted share awards. Prior to any vesting of an award, the Committee must certify in writing that all of the necessary performance goals have been met.
Base salary, bonuses, non-performance-based restricted share units, and performance-based restricted share units that do not qualify under the grandfather provision of the amended Section 162(m) do not qualify as performance-based compensation under the Code. In 2018, $92,998 and $425,799 in NEO compensation paid to Shelley Simpson and Nicholas Hobbs, respectively, was not deductible by the Company. The Compensation Committee does not expect the changes to Section 162(m) under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to materially affect its practice of compensating its executives through performance-based programs.
Derivative Trading, Hedging, Pledging and Trading Plans
The Company has a policy that prohibits directors, officers or employees from engaging in short sales or in transactions involving derivatives based on the Company's common stock, such as option contracts, straddles, collars, hedges and writing puts or calls. In addition, the Company's policy requires that directors and executive officers must obtain authorization from the Board before entering into a trading plan that, under the SEC's Rule 10b5-1, would permit the sale of the Company's stock including at times when the director or executive officer is in the possession of material nonpublic information. In addition, while the Board does not have a formal policy regarding pledging of the Company's common stock, the Board annually reviews any pledges of the Company's common stock by directors and executive officers to assess whether such pledges pose any unnecessary risks to the Company.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
To motivate the Company's officers and senior management to emulate its stockholders, the Company expects its management to own Company stock at levels described in the table shown below.
Stock ownership is defined as stock owned:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● directly or indirectly, and/or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● through the Company's 401(k) Employee Retirement Plan.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Position   Ownership Multiple of Base Salary  
 Chief Executive Officer   6 times  
 Executive Vice Presidents   3.5 times  
 Senior Vice Presidents   2.75 times  
 Vice Presidents   2.5 times  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has determined that as of the most recent annual award date, all of the Company's officers and members of senior management covered by these guidelines had met their ownership goals.
Stock Retention Policy
In addition to the stock ownership guidelines indicated above, the Company requires all shares obtained by an NEO from the vesting or exercise of restricted share units and stock options to be retained until the established ownership levels have been achieved. The Company does not have any other stock retention policy.
Recovery of Awards
The Company does not have a policy, other than required by law, requiring replacement of awards or payments as a result of an officer's illegal transactions or restatements. However, the Compensation Committee has formally adopted and explicitly communicated the "clawback" provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with regard to annual cash bonus awards paid to the Company's executive officers. With regard to equity-based awards, the MIP gives the Company broad discretion to reduce, cancel, seek to forfeit or recoup any Plan participant's awards upon the breach of any agreement with or obligation to the Company, violation of any Company policy or procedure, or engagement in conduct that is otherwise detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company. Since becoming a public company in 1983, the Company has had no illegal actions by its officers or restatements of financial information.
Summary
The Company intends to continue its practice of compensating its executives through programs that emphasize performance. To that end, executive compensation is tied directly to the performance of the Company and is structured to ensure that, due to the nature of the business and the degree of competitiveness for executive talent, there is an appropriate balance between:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● base salary and incentive compensation,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● short-term and long-term compensation, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● cash and noncash compensation.  
[END TABLE]
Each is determined and measured by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● competitive compensation data,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● financial, operational and strategic goals,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● long-term and short-term performance of the Company compared with its peer group, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● individual contribution to the success of the Company.

Executive Compensation
2018 COMPENSATION
Elements of Compensation
The Company's primary compensation components are summarized below. Generally, the Company's compensation program consists of an annual base salary, short-term cash incentive awards, and an annual long-term, equity-based award. Primary benefits for executives include participation in the Company's 401(k) plan, health, dental and vision plans, and various insurance plans, including disability and life insurance, all of which are available to all employees on a nondiscriminatory basis. The Company provides limited perquisites to executive officers and other key employees as described in more detail on page 50 under the section titled "Other Perquisites."
Total direct compensation for executive officers, including the NEOs, consists of one or more of the following components:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● base salary,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● annual performance-based incentive cash bonus awards,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● long-term incentive/equity-based compensation,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● health and welfare benefits, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● other benefits.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee, with recommendations from management, works to create what it believes is the best mix of these components in delivering total direct compensation. In determining annual compensation, the Compensation Committee reviews all elements of compensation separately and in the aggregate. These compensation components are comparable to those of the Company's competitors and peer group.
In its review of executive compensation, and, in particular, in determining the amount and form of incentive awards discussed below, the Compensation Committee generally considers several factors. Among these factors are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● market information with respect to cash and long-term compensation for its peer group,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● amounts paid to the executive officer in prior years as salary,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● annual bonus and other compensation,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the officer's responsibilities and performance during the calendar year, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the Company's overall performance during prior calendar years and its future objectives and challenges.  
[END TABLE]
At transportation companies, generally the largest elements of compensation are paid in the form of annual short-term incentives and long-term compensation. Compensation mix and industry profitability vary as the industry faces many risk factors, such as the economy and fuel prices.
Cash compensation for our NEOs varies as the operating income of the Company changes or with the growth of the combination of revenue and EBT, due to the nature of our bonus plans described below. Grants of performance-based restricted share units are typically made annually. Performance-based restricted share units are based on each employee's level of responsibility and are generally computed as a multiple of base salary.
It has been the policy of the Company to put a significant portion of the executive's compensation at risk. This is accomplished by our cash bonus plans, which are directly tied to operating income, revenue and EBT growth and the issuance of performance-based restricted share units. Equity-based awards from the MIP may also vary in vesting from two to 10 years. These awards are subject to forfeiture if the employee leaves the Company. Furthermore, the future vesting of performance-based equity awards is contingent on the Company's attainment of predetermined performance metrics established by the Committee. The Committee and management believe that the proportion of compensation at risk should rise as the employee's level of responsibility increases.
Executive Compensation
The Compensation Committee has retained Meridian as its compensation consultant. Meridian reports directly to the Compensation Committee and has no other engagements with the Company. In 2017, Meridian prepared a study providing information and an independent analysis of the Company's executive compensation program and practices. The results of this study included observations about the Company's target 2018 executive compensation.
The Compensation Committee does not rely solely on predetermined formulas or a limited set of criteria when it evaluates the individual performances of the NEOs. The Compensation Committee considers actual results against pre-established goals and also bases its compensation decisions for the NEOs on:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● leadership,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the execution of business plans,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● strategic results,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● operating results,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● growth in operating income, revenue and EBT, or other identified metrics  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● size and complexity of the business,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● experience,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● strengthening of competitive position,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● analysis of competitive compensation practices, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● assessment of the Company's performance.  
[END TABLE]
Where possible, the above criteria were compared with the peer group selected as well as the Chief Executive Officer's input for his direct reports and the Chairman of the Board's input for the Chief Executive Officer.
Executive Compensation
Base Salary
The Compensation Committee believes that competitive levels of cash compensation, together with equity-based and other incentive programs, are necessary for motivating and retaining the Company's executives. Salaries provide executives with a base level of monthly income and help achieve the objectives outlined above by attracting and retaining strong talent. Base salaries are evaluated annually for all executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer. Generally, base salaries are not directly related to specific measures of corporate performance, but are determined by the relevance of experience, the scope and complexity of the position, current job responsibilities, retention and relative salaries of the peer group members. The Compensation Committee may elect not to increase an executive officer's annual salary, and has so elected in prior years. However, if warranted, the Compensation Committee may increase base salary where an executive officer takes on added responsibilities or is promoted.
In January 2018 and 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed each NEO's base salary and, after applying the aforementioned guidelines, approved the salary increases listed below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   2017 Salary    2018 Salary    Increase For 2018   2019 Salary    Increase For 2019  
 John N. Roberts, III   825,000   845,000   2.4%   890,000   5.3%  
 David G. Mee   485,000   497,125   2.5%   525,000   5.6%  
 Shelley Simpson   485,000   497,125   2.5%   525,000   5.6%  
 Nicholas Hobbs   475,000   486,875   2.5%   525,000   7.8%  
 Terrence D. Matthews   485,000   497,125   2.5%   525,000   5.6%  
[END TABLE]
Annual Bonus Awards
The Company had in place for several years a bonus plan that was tied to EPS. In January 2018, this plan was modified and is now tied to operating income (company plan), because operating income is a better metric to determine operational efficiency and removes uncontrollable effects of change in income tax law. The Compensation Committee has also established a second bonus plan, referred to as the Performance Growth Incentive (PGI) plan, which was tied to year-over-year revenue and earnings before interest and taxes growth. In January 2018, this plan was modified and is now tied to year-over-year revenue and EBT growth. When management presents its budget for the year, the Compensation Committee establishes separate matrices of reported results with corresponding bonus payout levels for each of the cash bonus plans. These forecasted revenue and earnings results are based on customer freight trends, strategies for growth and controlling costs, and corporate strategies to maximize stockholder return. Once presented to the Board, the financial budget and bonus plan matrices remain fixed, though management continually reforecasts expectations based on actual results and on changing facts and assumptions. Changes in uncontrollable factors such as general economic conditions, railroad or port authority service issues, or rapidly fluctuating fuel costs can have a significant impact on the Company's actual financial results. Therefore, as the Company performs against the original budget, the executive's bonus performs against the pre-established matrices.
Executive Compensation
Annual Bonus Payouts
For 2018, the company plan was based on annual reported operating income and consisted of a single payout to be made in January 2019 based on the full year 2018 operating income matrix approved by the Compensation Committee. The established matrix consisted of operating income ranging from $685 million to $855 million, translating to annual bonus payout percentages ranging from 5% to 55% of an executive's base salary. The 2018 annual bonus payout targets compared with actual reported operating income and actual payout percentages were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Operating Income ($) (millions)     Bonus Payout% of Salary  
 Period   Minimum   Target   Reported (1)     Minimum   Target   Actual (1)  
 Annual   685   795   681     5.0   30.0   30.0  
[END TABLE]
Actual earned bonus amounts for each NEO under the company plan are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Total Annual ($)  
 John N. Roberts, III   253,500  
 David G. Mee   149,138  
 Shelley Simpson   149,138  
 Nicholas Hobbs   146,063  
 Terrence D. Matthews   149,138  
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation
For 2018, the PGI bonus plan was based on targeted annual operating revenue, excluding fuel surcharges (net revenue), and EBT growth rates and also utilized a single payout in January 2019, after full year financial results were publicly reported. For 2018, the established PGI matrix consisted of a net revenue growth rate of 15% and EBT growth rates ranging from 20% to 30%. These ranges translate into annual bonus payouts ranging from $634 thousand to $1.1 million for the Chief Executive Officer and $229 thousand to $467 thousand of all other NEOs. The PGI plan is a blended bonus calculation requiring the minimum threshold of both net revenue and EBT to be met before payout occurs. The 2018 annual PGI bonus payout targets compared with actual reported results and actual payouts were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Net Revenue / EBT Growth%     Bonus Payout ($) (000's)  
 Period   Minimum   Target   Reported (1)     Minimum   Target   Actual (1)  
 Annual - Chief Executive Officer   15.0 / 20.0   15.0 / 20.0   17.4 / 7.7     634   634   845  
 Annual - All other NEOs   15.0 / 20.0   15.0 / 20.0   17.4 / 7.7     229   229   342  
[END TABLE]
Actual earned bonus amounts for each NEO under the PGI plan are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Total Annual ($)  
 John N. Roberts, III   845,000  
 David G. Mee   341,667  
 Shelley Simpson   341,667  
 Nicholas Hobbs   341,667  
 Terrence D. Matthews   341,667  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)   When calculating the 2018 annual bonus payouts, the Compensation Committee, in its discretion and at the recommendation of management, excluded the effect of certain previously announced infrequent charges incurred in 2018, which related to events originating in prior years. The resolution of those events were not a reflection of 2018 operational performance. The Committee certified that the company plan would pay at the percentage of salary associated with a $795 million operating income and the PGI plan would pay the bonus associated with 15% net revenue and 25% EBT growth. The Compensation Committee used similar discretion in January 2018 when calculating the 2017 annual bonus payouts, by excluding the benefit to EPS of the Company's adjustments to its deferred tax balances for the change in future tax rates prescribed by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017, using a similar rationale that the benefit to 2017 EPS was not a true reflection of 2017 operational performance. As a result, no 2017 bonus payout was made under the company plan, which was based on EPS at that time.  
[END TABLE]
Long-Term, Equity-Based Award
Each executive is eligible to receive a long-term incentive award of performance-based restricted share units. Performance-based restricted share units are intended to help achieve the objectives of the compensation program, including the retention of high-performing and experienced talent, a career orientation and strong alignment with stockholders' interests. The performance-based restricted share units are awarded and settled from shares reserved for issuance under the MIP. The Compensation Committee approves or adjusts the award based on the above criteria for all Section 16 filers who are employees of the Company. The awards for the Company's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are presented for final approval to the Company's independent Board members. The Compensation Committee believes that performance-based restricted share units must be sufficient in size to provide a strong, long-term performance and retention incentive for executives and to increase their vested interest in the Company. Performance-based restricted share units are used as long-term incentives because they are less dilutive to shares outstanding and to profits. Performance-based restricted share units generally vest from two to 10 years.
Executive Compensation
In determining the number of performance-based restricted share unit grants for each NEO, the Compensation Committee reviewed peer market data provided by Meridian and a detailed analysis of each NEO's vested and unvested stock holdings. In considering unvested stock holdings, the Committee reviewed a forecast of the timing of potential future restricted stock unit vesting for each NEO over the next 10 years.
The Compensation Committee subjectively considered the following objectives (without any particular weighting) when determining the form and amount of performance-based restricted share units granted to NEOs in 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● align NEOs' long-term interests with those of the Company's stockholders,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● strengthen retention hooks for NEOs over the long term,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● ensure competitiveness of NEOs' total compensation opportunity through an emphasis on performance-based long-term stock compensation,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● reinforce share holdings of NEOs,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● align NEOs' compensation with the Company's long-term leadership succession planning initiatives, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● bolster the continuity of the entire management team through an upcoming period of critical strategic goals and milestones for the Company.  
[END TABLE]
For 2018, the Compensation Committee and/or independent directors approved the following performance-based restricted share unit grants to the NEOs:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Units (#)   Fair Value ($)  
 John N. Roberts, III   39,793   4,877,428  
 David G. Mee   14,247   1,746,255  
 Shelley Simpson   14,247   1,746,255  
 Nicholas Hobbs   14,247   1,746,255  
 Terrence D. Matthews   14,247   1,746,255  
[END TABLE]
The fair value of the awards was based on a 2.5% discount from the Company's closing stock price of $125.65 on January 24, 2018. The discount represents the present value of expected dividends to be paid on the Company's common stock, using the current dividend rate and the risk-free interest rate, over the vesting period. The Company believes that this discount is appropriate to value the performance-based restricted share units, as the units do not collect or accrue dividends until the awards vest and are settled with Company stock.
Executive Compensation
The 2018 NEO awards shown above are performance-based restricted share units. These grants vest (in annual increments over a four-year period), beginning January 31, 2019, upon the Company's attainment of predetermined operating metrics established and approved by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee acknowledges that the separate components of total direct compensation are not always in the 50th percentile of their respective peer groups, as determined earlier, but it believes that its mix of current and long-term compensation is more appropriate to align the NEO's compensation with the stockholders' interests in both the near and longer term.
The Committee also reviewed its compensation strategy in general and specific components of total direct compensation and determined that none of the Company's compensation programs, individually or as a whole, would create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Committee presented its review and conclusion to the entire Board.
Deferred Compensation
The Company administers a Deferred Compensation Plan for certain of its officers. The employee participant may elect on an annual basis to defer part of his or her salary and/or annual bonus awards. This plan assists key employees in planning for retirement. The Company contributes nothing to the plan, and participants are not permitted to defer shares of Company stock.
Health and Welfare Benefits
The Company provides benefits such as medical, vision, life insurance, long-term disability coverage, and 401(k) plan opportunities to all eligible employees, including the NEOs. The Company provides up to $750,000 in life insurance coverage and up to $10,000 per month in long-term disability coverage. The value of these benefits is not required to be included in the Summary Compensation Table since they are available to all employees on a nondiscriminatory basis. The Company matches certain employee contributions to the 401(k) plan. The Company provides no postretirement medical or supplemental retirement benefits to its employees.
The Company also provides vacation, sick leave and other paid holidays to employees, including the NEOs, that are comparable to those provided at other transportation companies. The Company's commitment to provide employee benefits is due to our recognition that the health and well-being of our employees contributes directly to a productive and successful work life that produces better results for the Company and for its employees.
Personal Benefits
The Company provides certain perquisites to management employees, including the NEOs, as summarized below.
Company Aircraft
The Company actively participates in shared ownership of aircraft services with NetJets. With the approval of the Chief Executive Officer, the NEOs and other management employees use Company aircraft services for business purposes. Personal use of Company aircraft services is provided to executive officers on a very limited basis and to other management employees in the event of emergency or other urgent situations.
Company Vehicles
The Company does not provide Company-owned cars to executives.
Executive Compensation
Other Perquisites
The Company provides executive officers a taxable allowance of up to $10,000 a year for financial counseling services, which may include legal, financial, estate and/or tax planning, and tax return preparation. This benefit is based on the actual cost of the services. The Company also provides country club memberships to certain of its executive officers. These memberships are valued based on the actual costs of the membership, including dues, regardless of whether use was personal or business. The Company believes that these clubs provide a quiet venue for negotiations and entertainment of clients, bankers, investment bankers, stockholders, etc.
Severance Agreements
The Company does not have employment contracts or predetermined personal severance agreements with any of its executives. However, according to the terms of the awards granted under the previously mentioned MIP, all outstanding restricted share units are subject to accelerated or immediate vesting upon the occurrence of a double triggering event, which requires both a "change in control" and the NEO's retirement, termination by the Company without cause, or resignation for good reason.
Generally, a "change in control" is deemed to occur when more than 30% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company change ownership in a transaction that is a merger, reorganization or consolidation, when the persons who constitute the Company's incumbent board of directors cease to constitute a majority of the board, or upon the consummation of a merger, reorganization, consolidation or similar form of corporate transaction involving the Company that requires the approval of the Company's stockholders where more than 50% of the outstanding shares change ownership or a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.

 (1)   The value of personal aircraft usage reported above is based on the Company's actual invoiced amount from NetJets for the variable costs incurred on each trip. Since the Company's aircraft is used primarily for business travel, this methodology excludes fixed costs that do not change based on usage, such as depreciation and management fees. On certain occasions, an executive's spouse or other family member may accompany the executive on a flight when such person is invited to attend the event for appropriate business purposes. No additional direct operating cost is incurred in such situations under the foregoing methodology; however, the value of personal use of Company aircraft is imputed for federal income tax purposes as income to the NEO. John N. Roberts III, David G. Mee, Shelley Simpson and Terrance D. Matthews had such imputed income in 2018. This value is calculated pursuant to Internal Revenue Service guidelines using Standard Industry Fare Level rates, which are determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation, and included in the NEO's base salary in the Summary Compensation Table shown on page 51 of this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
Grants of Plan-Based Awards
The following table reflects estimated possible payouts under equity and non-equity incentive plans to the NEOs during 2018. The Company's equity-based and non-equity incentive-based awards are granted to the NEOs based upon pre-established performance goals set annually by the Compensation Committee with a performance period equal to the calendar year for which the performance goals are set.
The MIP is an annual plan consisting of equity-based awards only. The number of performance-based restricted share units awarded is measured based on the executive's level of responsibility and other matters described on page 47 under "Long-Term, Equity-Based Award." Dividends are not paid on awards of performance-based or time-vested restricted share units.
In 2018, NEOs were eligible to earn cash bonuses under the non-equity incentive award plans based on the Company's operating income, revenue and EBT for the calendar year. Please refer to page 45 under "Annual Bonus Award" for further detail.

Components of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for Calendar Year 2018
We have a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that allows eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. Participants can elect to defer up to a maximum of 50% of their base salary as well as up to 85% of their bonus for the year. The compensation deferred under this plan is credited with earnings or losses of investments elected by plan participants. Each participant is fully vested in all deferred compensation and earnings; however, these amounts are subject to general creditor claims until actually distributed to the employee. A participant may elect to receive deferred amounts in one payment or in quarterly installments payable over a period of two to 25 years upon reaching the age of 55, having 15 years of service, or becoming disabled. Our total liability under this plan was $15,719,118 as of December 31, 2018, and $16,411,843 as of December 31, 2017. These amounts are included in other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participant withholdings are held by a trustee and invested as directed by participants. These investments are included in "other assets" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $15,719,118 as of December 31, 2018, and $16,411,843 as of December 31, 2017.

Executive Compensation
Potential Post-Employment Benefits
The Company does not have employment contracts or predetermined personal severance agreements with any of its executives. However, according to the terms of the awards granted under the previously mentioned MIP, all outstanding restricted share units are subject to accelerated or immediate vesting upon the occurrence of a double triggering event, which requires both a "change in control" and the NEO's retirement, termination by the Company without cause, or resignation for good reason.
Generally, a "change in control" is deemed to occur when more than 30% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company change ownership in a transaction that is a merger, reorganization or consolidation, when the persons who constitute the Company's incumbent board of directors cease to constitute a majority of the board, or upon the consummation of a merger, reorganization, consolidation or similar form of corporate transactions involving the Company that requires the approval of the Company's stockholders where more than 50% of the outstanding shares change ownership or a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.
Potential benefits to the NEOs due to his or her separation of service without cause, retirement or resignation for good reason following a "change in control" are shown below. The amounts represent the immediate vesting of all outstanding restricted share units and are valued using the last closing market price of $93.04 on December 31, 2018.
CEO Pay Ratio
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act), we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our "median employee" and the annual total compensation of our CEO.
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The median of the annual total compensation of all of the Company's employees, other than our CEO, was $62,150.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The annual total compensation of our CEO was $6,846,236.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Based on this information, the ratio for 2018 of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees was 110 to 1.  
[END TABLE]
In determining the median of the annual total compensation of all of the Company's employees, other than our CEO, we were required in 2018 to identify the Company's "median employee" for 2017. Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K requires us to identify the Company's median employee once every three years, unless a change in employee population or compensation arrangements is likely to result in a significant change in our CEO pay ratio disclosures. The Company determined that no such change occurred during 2018. Accordingly, for the 2018 pay ratio calculation, we used the same "median employee" identified during our 2017 analysis of our employee population.
Executive Compensation
To identify the "median employee" in 2017, we performed the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We conducted a full analysis of our employee population as of our determination date of November 30, 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We excluded employees residing in Mexico and Canada from our calculation under the De Minimis Exemption. Employees located in Mexico and Canada constituted 0.09% and 0.01% of our total employee population, respectively, which consisted of 22 individuals in Mexico and 3 individuals in Canada as of our determination date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Our employee population, after taking into consideration the aforementioned adjustments, consisted of 23,872 individuals. Of these employees, 23,632 individuals were full-time (or full-time equivalent) employees, with the remainder employed on a part-time (less than 30 hours per week) basis. 99.9% of our employees (23,872 individuals) were located in the United States.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We used a definition that was not total compensation and instead chose the aggregate of the employee's base pay and cash incentive bonuses paid during the period of January 1, 2017, through November 30, 2017. These balances were then annualized, with any anomalous reported earnings being replaced with a substantially similar employee balance. Reasons for the replacement of anomalous earnings were primarily due to a lack of adequate length of employment history with the company or the employee incurring a leave of absence during the analysis period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Using this methodology, we determined that the "median employee" was the average of two single employees – a regional driver and an over-the-road driver.  
[END TABLE]
Finally, to determine the annual total compensation of the "median employee" for 2018, we identified and calculated the elements of compensation for each of the two identified employees in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. The median of the annual total compensation of all of the Company's employees, other than our CEO, represents the average of the annual total compensation of each of these two "median employees."
PROPOSAL TWO  Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or Dodd-Frank Act, enables our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in the Proxy Statement in accordance with SEC rules. At our Annual Meeting in 2017, our stockholders voted to recommend that the Company hold future "say-on-pay" votes annually until the Company is next required to hold an advisory vote on the frequency with which the Company will hold future "say-on-pay" votes, which will be in 2023. Accordingly, we are providing a vote on the resolution set forth below as required by the Dodd-Frank Act and Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
As discussed in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) on page 37, our executive compensation programs for our NEOs, as well as other executives, are designed to be competitive within the transportation industry and to link executive compensation with the creation of stockholder value. The overall compensation philosophy is guided by the following principles:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Compensation levels should be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain key talent. The Company aims to attract, motivate and retain high-performance talent to achieve and maintain a leading position in its industry. Our total compensation package should be strongly competitive with other transportation companies.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Compensation should relate directly to performance and responsibility. Total compensation should be tied to and vary with performance and responsibility, both at the Company and individual level, in achieving financial, operational and strategic objectives. Differentiated pay for high-performing individuals should be proportional to their contributions to the Company's success.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Short-term incentive compensation should constitute a significant portion of total executive compensation. A large portion of total compensation should be tied to performance, and therefore at risk, as position and responsibility increase. Individuals with greater roles and the ability to directly impact strategic direction and long-term results should bear a greater proportion of the risk.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Long-term incentive compensation, the Company's MIP, should be closely aligned with stockholders' interests. Awards of long-term compensation encourage executive officers to focus on the Company's long-range growth and development and incent them to manage from the perspective of stockholders with a meaningful stake in the Company, as well as to focus on long-term career orientation. Participants in the MIP are required to own Company stock. The requirements are discussed in the CD&A under the caption "Stock Ownership Guidelines."  
[END TABLE]
Generally, the Company's compensation program consists of an annual base salary, short-term cash incentive awards, and an annual long-term, performance-based equity-based award. The Compensation Committee, with recommendations from management, works to create what it believes is the best mix of these components in delivering total direct compensation. Base salaries are not directly related to specific measures of corporate performance, but are determined by the relevance of experience, the scope and complexity of the position, current job responsibilities, retention and peer group salaries. The short-term cash incentive awards are tied to operating income, revenue and EBT. The long-term, equity-based awards utilize restricted share units. The restricted share units awarded to the Company's NEOs are performance-based restricted share units, which vest over multiple years annually upon the Company's attainment of predetermined operating metrics established and approved by the Compensation Committee.
PROPOSAL TWO Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
We believe that the Company's executive compensation programs have been effective in incenting the achievement of our positive results. We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our NEO compensation as described in the Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say on pay" proposal, gives you as a stockholder the opportunity to express your views regarding our fiscal year 2018 executive compensation policies and procedures for NEOs. The vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the policies and procedures described in the Proxy Statement. Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the NEOs as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and related narrative discussion in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Although this is an advisory vote that will not be binding on the Compensation Committee or the Board, we will carefully review the results of the vote. The Compensation Committee will consider stockholders' concerns and take them into account when designing future executive compensation programs. The Board therefore recommends that you indicate your support of the Company's executive compensation in fiscal year 2018, as outlined in the above resolution.
Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee
The 2018 Audit Committee was composed of James L. Robo, Chairman, Douglas G. Duncan, and Sharilyn S. Gasaway. Each served as a member of the Audit Committee during the full 2018 calendar year. The Company's Board has determined that all members of the Audit Committee satisfy the independence and other requirements for audit committee membership pursuant to the NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards and has also determined that Messrs. Robo and Duncan and Ms. Gasaway each has the attributes of an audit committee financial expert as defined by SEC requirements.
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is available on the "Corporate Governance" page of the "Investors" section of the Company's website at jbhunt.com. In carrying out its responsibilities, the Audit Committee, among other things:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● monitors the integrity of the financial reporting process, systems of internal accounting controls, and financial statements and reports of the Company,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● appoints, retains, compensates and oversees the Company's independent auditors, including reviewing the qualifications, performance and independence of the independent auditors,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● reviews and preapproves all audit, attest and review services and permitted nonaudit services,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● oversees the performance of the Company's internal audit function, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● oversees the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.  
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the Audit Committee met eight times. The Audit Committee schedules its meetings with a view to ensure that it devotes appropriate attention to all of its responsibilities and duties. The Audit Committee's meetings include, whenever appropriate, executive sessions with the Company's independent auditors and the Company's internal auditors, in each case outside the presence of the Company's management.
In performing its oversight role, the Audit Committee reviewed the audited consolidated financial statements for the 2018 calendar year and met and held discussions with management, the Company's internal auditors and E&Y, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, to discuss those financial statements and the audit related thereto. Management has represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard 1301 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as may be modified, supplemented or amended, which includes, among other items, matters related to the conduct of the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements. The independent auditors also provided the Audit Committee with written disclosures and the letter required by Rule 3526 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as may be modified, supplemented or amended, which relates to the auditors' independence from the Company and its related entities, and the Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors their independence.
Based on the Audit Committee's discussions with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditors as described above, and upon its review of the representation of management and the independent auditors and the reports of the independent auditors, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC.

PROPOSAL THREE  Ratification of Independent  Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committee has selected E&Y as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to examine the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the 2019 calendar year. The Board seeks an indication from our stockholders of their approval or disapproval of the Audit Committee's selection of E&Y as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 calendar year.
E&Y has been our independent auditor since 2005. No relationships exist other than the usual relationships between auditor and client. Representatives of E&Y are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. If our stockholders do not ratify the appointment of E&Y at the Annual Meeting, the Audit Committee will consider such event in its selection of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 calendar year. Additionally, even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, at its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the 2019 calendar year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
AUDIT AND NONAUDIT FEES
The Audit Committee preapproves the audit and nonaudit services to be rendered to the Company, as well as the fees associated with such services. Generally, management will submit to the Audit Committee a detailed list of services that it recommends the Audit Committee engage the independent auditors to provide for the calendar year. The Audit Committee is informed from time to time regarding the nonaudit services actually provided pursuant to the preapproval process. During the year, the Audit Committee periodically reviews the types of services and dollar amounts approved and adjusts such amounts, as it deems appropriate. Unless a service to be provided by the independent auditors has received general preapproval, it will require specific preapproval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also periodically reviews all nonaudit services to ensure that such services do not impair the independence of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee approved all services provided by E&Y for the 2018 and 2017 calendar years. These services included the audit of the Company's annual financial statements, audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, review of the Company's quarterly financial statements, audit of the Company's employee benefit plan, consent for and review of registration statements filed by the Company with the SEC, and tax consultation services. See "Report of Audit Committee" set forth earlier for a discussion of auditor independence.
PROPOSAL THREE Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The following table shows the fees billed by E&Y for audit and other services provided to the Company for the 2018 and 2017 calendar years, respectively:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   2018 ($)   2017 ($)  
 Audit fees (1)   1,315,600   1,414,370  
 Audit-related fees (2)   28,500   27,500  
 Tax fees (3)   391,748   534,472  
 All other fees   —   —  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)   Audit fees consisted of the audit of the Company's annual financial statements, including the audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, the review of the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and consent for and review of registration statements filed by the Company with the SEC.  
 (2)   Audit-related fees consisted of an audit of the Employee Benefit Plan.  
 (3)   Tax fees consisted principally of federal and state income tax consulting.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has considered whether the nonaudit services provided by E&Y, including the services rendered in connection with income tax consultation, were compatible with maintaining E&Y's independence and has determined that the nature and substance of the limited nonaudit services did not impair the status of E&Y as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. E&Y did not bill the Company for any other services during calendar years 2018 and 2017.
PROPOSAL THREE Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Policy on Audit Committee Preapproval of Audit and Permissible Nonaudit Services of Independent Auditor
The Audit Committee has the responsibility of appointing, setting compensation for and overseeing the work of the independent auditor and has established a policy to preapprove all audit and permissible nonaudit services provided by the independent auditor.
Prior to the engagement of the independent auditor for next year's audit, management will submit to the Audit Committee for approval an aggregate of services expected to be rendered during that year for each of four categories of services:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Audit services include audit work performed related to the financial statements, as well as work that generally only the independent auditor can reasonably be expected to provide, including comfort letters, statutory audits, attestation services, and consultation regarding financial accounting and/or reporting standards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Audit-related services are for assurance and related services that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor, including due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions, employee benefit plan audits, and special procedures required to meet certain regulatory requirements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Tax services include all services performed by the independent auditor's tax personnel except those services specifically related to the audit of the financial statements, including fees in the areas of tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Other services are those not captured in the other categories. The Company generally doesn't request such services from the independent auditor.  
[END TABLE]
Prior to the engagement, the Audit Committee preapproves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the Audit Committee requires the independent auditor and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically throughout the year by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise that make it necessary to engage the independent auditor for additional services not contemplated in the original preapproval. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific preapproval before engaging the independent auditor.
The Audit Committee may delegate preapproval authority to one or more of its members. The member(s) to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational purposes only, the preapproval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
PROPOSAL FOUR  Stockholder Proposal Regarding 
Reporting Political Contributions
In accordance with SEC rules, we have set forth below a stockholder proposal, along with the supporting statement of the stockholder proponent, for which we and the Board accept no responsibility. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters General Fund (the Fund), located at 25 Louisiana Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001, is the proponent of the following stockholder proposal and has advised us that the Fund holds 190 shares of the Company's common stock which it has continuously held for at least one year and they intend to present the following proposal for a vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
RESOLVED, that the shareholders of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. ("J.B. Hunt" or "Company"), hereby request that the Company provide a report, updated semiannually, disclosing the Company's:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 1.    Policies and procedures for making, with corporate funds or assets, contributions and expenditures (direct or indirect) to— (a) participate or intervene in any campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office, or (b) influence the general public, or any segment thereof, with respect to an election or referendum.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2.    Monetary and non-monetary contributions and expenditures (direct and indirect) used in the manner described in section 1 above, including:  
[END TABLE]
a. The identity of the recipient as well as the amount paid to each; and, b. The title(s) of the person(s) in the Company responsible for decision-making.
The report shall be presented to the board of directors or relevant board committee and posted on the Company's website within 12 months from the date of the annual meeting. This proposal does not encompass lobbying spending.
Supporting Statement
As long-term shareholders of J.B. Hunt, we support transparency and accountability in corporate electoral spending. This includes any activity considered intervention in a political campaign under the Internal Revenue Code, such as direct and indirect contributions to political candidates, parties, or organizations, and independent expenditures or electioneering communications on behalf of federal, state, or local candidates.
Disclosure is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The Supreme Court recognized this in its 2010 Citizens United decision, which said, "[D]isclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages."
Publicly available records show J.B. Hunt has contributed at least $25,000 in corporate funds since the 2010 election cycle. (CQMoneyLine: http://moneyline.cq.com; National Institute on Money in State Politics: http://www.followthemoney.org).
However, relying on publicly available data does not provide a complete picture of the Company's electoral spending. For example, the Company's payments to trade associations that may be used for election-related activities are undisclosed and unknown. This proposal asks the Company to disclose all of its electoral spending, including payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt organizations, which may be used for electoral purposes. This would bring our Company in line with a growing number of leading companies, including Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific, and CSX, which present such information on their websites.
PROPOSAL FOUR Stockholder Proposal Regarding Reporting Political Contributions
The Company's Board and shareholders need comprehensive disclosure to fully evaluate the use of corporate assets in elections. We urge your support for this critical governance reform.
Board of Directors Statement in Opposition to the Stockholder Proposal 
The Board of Directors has carefully considered this stockholder proposal and concluded that it is unnecessary and not in the best interest of the Company or its stockholders for the reasons described below. The Board of Directors therefore unanimously recommends voting against this proposal.
The Company is in a highly regulated industry, and actions by elected officials can have a significant impact on our industry and our business. The Company generally does not make direct political contributions. However, the Board of Directors and management believe that targeted and responsible involvement in the legislative, regulatory and electoral processes is prudent to protect and promote the interests of the Company's stockholders, employees and customers. The Company may, from time to time, make focused lobbying expenditures or contributions to third party organizations. The Company is also a member of several industry trade organizations.
While the Company's limited involvement in the legislative, regulatory or electoral process serves an important corporate purpose, the Company's related expenses represent only a small fraction of our total annual expenses (less than 0.004% in fiscal 2018). The Company conducts such activities only in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws. For example, U.S. federal law currently prohibits companies from making corporate contributions or providing anything of value to any political candidate, campaign committee or other organization in connection with any federal election. The Company does not make such contributions. The Company is permitted to make donations to political action committees (PACs), which are generally limited in their ability to advocate on behalf of specific parties or candidates and are subject to disclosure requirements at the federal and state levels. The Company has made and may in the future make contributions to such organizations. Details of any such contributions over $200, including the recipient and amount, are generally made publicly available by the Federal Election Commission.
The Company's participation in trade associations and organizations serves various business purposes, most importantly allowing management to stay current on industry standards and best practices, emerging trends and other business or technical issues that may impact the Company. While these organizations may engage in political or lobbying activities, the Company's membership or participation in its trade associations and organizations is not to advance political purposes and does not represent the Company's agreement with all positions, views or objectives of these associations and organizations. Because the Company's involvement with trade associations and third-party organizations is based on reasons unrelated to any political activities and because our involvement and payments to such associations and organizations do not necessarily reflect the Company's views on every action a trade association or organization may take, the Board of Directors believes the proposed report would not provide meaningful information to investors. Further, the Board of Directors believes that providing such information could be used by special interest groups to pressure the Company to oppose actions taken by these organizations or to stop supporting positions or initiatives that are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, employees, and customers, and such efforts could be counter to the Company's best interests to the extent it diverts management's focus from the operation of our business.
PROPOSAL FOUR Stockholder Proposal Regarding Reporting Political Contributions
For the foregoing reasons, the Board of Directors believes this stockholder proposal is unnecessary and not in the best interest of the Company or its stockholders. The Board of Directors therefore unanimously recommends voting against this proposal.

[END TABLE]
What Constitutes A Quorum?
The presence, either in person or by proxy, of the holders of at least a majority of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote is required to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes, which are described in more detail below, are counted as shares present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
Who Is Entitled To Vote?
Only stockholders of record of the Company's common stock at the close of business on Tuesday, February 12, 2019, which is the "record date," are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. Shares that may be voted include shares that are held:
(1) directly by the stockholder of record, and
(2) beneficially through a broker, bank or other nominee.
Each share of our common stock will be entitled to one vote on all matters submitted for a vote at the Annual Meeting.
As of the record date, there were 108,738,788 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to be voted at the Annual Meeting.
Questions and Answers about the Proxy Materials and The Annual Meeting
What Is The Difference Between Holding Shares As A "Registered Owner" And A "Beneficial Owner"?
Most of the Company's stockholders hold their shares through a broker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between registered shares and those owned beneficially:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Registered Owners – If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company N.A., you are, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to the Company or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Beneficial Owners – If your shares are held in a brokerage account, bank or by another nominee, you are, with respect to those shares, the "beneficial owner" of shares held in "street name." As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. However, because you are not a stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from your broker, bank or other nominee (who is the stockholder of record) giving you the right to vote the shares.  
[END TABLE]
What Stockholder Approval Is Necessary For Approval Of The Proposals?
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Election of Directors  
     Each director shall be elected by a vote of the majority of votes cast with respect to that director. This means that a director must receive "for" votes from more than 50% of the number of shares voted with respect to that director. However, if the number of nominees is greater than the number of directors to be elected, the directors will be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any stockholder meeting. For purposes of this vote, a failure to vote, a vote to abstain or withholding your vote (or direction to your broker to do so) is not counted as a vote cast and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of this vote.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Advisory vote on the resolution to approve the Company's compensation of its named executive officers  
     Approval of this resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. For purposes of this vote, a failure to vote, a vote to abstain or withholding your vote (or direction to your broker to do so) is not counted as a vote cast and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of this vote. While this vote is required by law, it will neither be binding on the Company or the Board, nor will it create or imply any change in the fiduciary duties of, or impose any additional fiduciary duty on, the Company or the Board. However, the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Ratification of the appointment of E&Y as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm  
     Ratification of the Audit Committee's appointment of E&Y as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. For purposes of this vote, a failure to vote, a vote to abstain or withholding your vote (or direction to your broker to do so) is not counted as a vote cast and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of this vote. Stockholder ratification is not required for the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. However, we are submitting the proposal to solicit the opinion of our stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Vote on a stockholder proposal requesting the Company to prepare and disclose a report of the Company's political contributions policy and political contributions made by the Company  
     Approval of this resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. For purposes of this vote, a failure to vote, a vote to abstain or withholding your vote (or direction to your broker to do so) is not counted as a vote cast and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of this vote.  
[END TABLE]
Questions and Answers about the Proxy Materials and The Annual Meeting
As of the record date, directors and executive officers of the Company beneficially owned an aggregate 3,946,200 shares of common stock representing 3.6% of our common stock issued and outstanding and, therefore, 3.6% of the voting power entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. The Company believes that its directors and executive officers currently intend to vote their shares as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● FOR the election of directors for one (1) year  
[END TABLE]

● FOR the resolution approving the Company's compensation of its named executive officers

[END TABLE]
May I Vote My Shares In Person At The Annual Meeting?
If you are the registered owner of shares of the Company's common stock on the record date, you have the right to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting.
If you are the beneficial owner of shares of the Company's common stock on the record date, you may vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting if you request and obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee (the stockholder of record) giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting, complete such legal proxy and present it to the Company at the Annual Meeting.
Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you submit your proxy card or voting instructions so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting.
How Can I Vote My Shares Without Attending The Annual Meeting?
If you are a registered owner, you may instruct the named proxy holders on how to vote your shares by completing, signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided with this Proxy Statement, or by using the Internet voting site or the toll-free telephone number listed on the proxy card. Specific instructions for using the Internet and telephone voting systems are provided on the proxy card. The Internet and telephone voting systems will be available until 11:59 p.m. Central Daylight Time on Wednesday, April 17, 2019  (the day before the Annual Meeting).
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," you should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares. Your broker, bank or other nominee has enclosed with this Proxy Statement a voting instruction card for you to use in directing your nominee on how to vote your shares. The instructions from your nominee will indicate whether Internet or telephone voting is available and, if so, will provide details regarding how to use those systems.
If My Shares Are Held In "Street Name," Will My Broker, Bank Or Other Nominee Vote My Shares For Me?
If you hold shares in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, your broker, bank or nominee may not be permitted to exercise voting discretion with respect to some of the matters to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. Under current stock exchange rules, brokers who do not have instructions from their customers may not use their discretion in voting their customers' shares on certain specific matters that are not considered to be "routine" matters, including the election of directors, executive compensation and other significant matters. The proposals in this Proxy Statement regarding the election of directors, the advisory vote concerning executive compensation, and the Company's political contributions policy are not considered to be routine matters. Therefore, without your specific instructions, your shares will not be voted on these matters and will not be counted in determining the number of shares necessary for approval. Shares represented by such "broker non-votes," however, will be counted in determining whether there is a quorum. You should follow the directions provided by your nominee regarding instructions on how to vote your shares.
Questions and Answers about the Proxy Materials and The Annual Meeting
Ratification of the appointment of E&Y as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is considered a routine matter and, therefore, if beneficial owners fail to give voting instructions, brokers, banks and other nominees will have the discretionary authority to vote shares of our common stock with respect to this proposal.
What Is A Broker Non-Vote?
Generally, a "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker, bank or other nominee that holds shares in "street name" for a customer is precluded from exercising voting discretion on a particular proposal because:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)   the beneficial owner has not instructed the nominee on how to vote, and  
 (2)   the nominee lacks discretionary voting power to vote such issues.  
[END TABLE]
Under NASDAQ rules, a nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to the approval of "nonroutine" matters absent specific voting instructions from the beneficial owners of such shares.
How Will My Proxy Be Voted?
Shares represented by a properly executed proxy (in paper form, by Internet or by telephone) that is received in a timely manner, and not subsequently revoked, will be voted at the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in the manner directed on the proxy. Kirk Thompson and John N. Roberts, III are named as proxies in the proxy form and have been designated by the Board as the directors' proxies to represent you and vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. All shares represented by a properly executed proxy on which no choice is specified will be voted:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)   FOR the election of the nominees for director named in this Proxy Statement,  
 (2)   FOR the resolution approving the Company's compensation of its named executive officers,  
 (3)    FOR ratification of the appointment of E&Y as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 calendar year,  
 (4)    AGAINST the stockholder proposal requesting the Company to prepare and disclose a report of the Company's political contributions policy and political contributions made by the Company, and  
 (5)   in accordance with the proxy holders' best judgment as to any other business that properly comes before the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
This Proxy Statement is considered to be voting instructions for the trustees of the J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. Employee Retirement Plan for our common stock allocated to individual accounts under this plan. If account information is the same, participants in the plan (who are stockholders of record) will receive a single proxy representing all of their shares. If a plan participant does not submit a proxy to us, the trustees of the plan in which shares are allocated to his or her individual account will vote such shares in the same proportion as the total shares in such plan for which directions have been received.
Questions and Answers about the Proxy Materials and The Annual Meeting
May I Revoke My Proxy And Change My Vote?
Yes. You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting.
If you are the registered owner, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)   submitting a new proxy bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy),  
 (2)   giving notice of your changed vote to us in writing mailed to the attention of Jennifer R. Boattini, Corporate Secretary, at our executive offices, or  
 (3)   attending the Annual Meeting and giving oral notice of your intention to vote in person.  
[END TABLE]
You should be aware that simply attending the Annual Meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of your proxy.
Who Will Pay The Costs Of Soliciting Proxies?
Proxies will be solicited initially by mail. Further solicitation may be made in person or by telephone, electronic mail or facsimile. The Company will bear the expense of preparing, printing and mailing this Proxy Statement and accompanying materials to our stockholders. Upon request, the Company will reimburse brokers, banks and other nominees for reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding copies of the proxy materials relating to the Annual Meeting to the beneficial owners of our common stock.
In 2018, the Company retained Broadridge, an independent proxy solicitation firm, to assist in soliciting proxies from stockholders. The Company paid Broadridge a fee of approximately $66,000 as compensation for its services and was reimbursed for its out-of-pocket expenses. The fee amount was not contingent on the number of stockholder votes cast in favor of any proposal, and Broadridge is prohibited from making any recommendation to our stockholders to either accept or reject any proposal or otherwise express an opinion concerning a proposal. Proxy solicitation fees in 2019 are expected to be comparable to those paid in 2018.
What Other Business Will Be Presented At The Annual Meeting?
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Board knows of no other business that may properly be, or is likely to be, brought before the Annual Meeting. If any other matters should arise at the Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxy holders, Kirk Thompson and John N. Roberts, III, will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the meeting. If, for any unforeseen reason, any of the director nominees are not available to serve as a director, the named proxy holders will vote your proxy for such other director candidate or candidates as may be nominated by the Board.
What Is The Deadline For Stockholder Proposals For The 2020 Annual Meeting?
In order for a stockholder proposal to be eligible to be included in the Company's Proxy Statement and proxy card for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the proposal:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)   must be received by the Company at its executive offices, 615 J.B. Hunt Corporate Drive, Lowell, Arkansas 72745, Attention: Corporate Secretary, on or before November 9, 2019, and

Questions and Answers about the Proxy Materials and The Annual Meeting
In connection with our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, if we do not receive notice of a matter or proposal to be considered by January 23, 2020, then the persons appointed by our Board of Directors to act as proxy holders for such Annual Meeting (named in the form of proxy) will be allowed to use their discretionary voting authority with respect to any such matter or proposal properly presented for a vote at such meeting.
Where Can I Find The Voting Results Of The Annual Meeting?
The Company will publish final voting results of the Annual Meeting on a Form 8-K within four days after the annual stockholders meeting on April 18, 2019.
What Should I Do If I Receive More Than One Set Of Voting Materials?
You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this Proxy Statement and multiple proxies or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you may receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account. If you are a registered owner and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please vote each proxy and instruction card that you receive.
What Is Householding?
In an effort to reduce printing costs and postage fees, the Company has adopted a practice approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) called "householding." Under this practice, certain stockholders who have the same address and last name will receive only one copy of this Proxy Statement and the Company's Annual Report, unless one or more of these stockholders notifies the Company that he or she wishes to continue receiving individual copies. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards.
If you share an address with another stockholder and received only one copy of this Proxy Statement and the Company's Annual Report and would like to request a separate copy of these materials, or if you do not wish to participate in householding in the future, please:
