PROXY STATEMENT FOR SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of our board of directors for use at our Special Meeting of Stockholders, or the special meeting, to be held on February 22, 2019, at 8:00 a.m., Pacific Time, at our corporate headquarters located at 2 Musick, Irvine, California 92618. Endologix, Inc. is sometimes referred to herein as "we", "us", "our" or our "Company." 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Special Meeting of Stockholders to be Held on February 22, 2019 
This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are available at www.proxyvote.com. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROXY MATERIALS AND VOTING 
These questions and answers are intended to briefly address potential questions that our stockholders may have regarding this proxy statement and the special meeting. They are also intended to provide our stockholders with certain information that is required to be provided under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. 
When and where will the special meeting be held? 
You are invited to attend the special meeting to be held on February 22, 2019, at 8:00 a.m., Pacific Time, at our corporate headquarters located at 2 Musick, Irvine, California 92618. 
Why did I receive these proxy materials? 
We are providing this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation by our board of directors of proxies to be voted at the special meeting, and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. Your proxy is being solicited because you owned our common stock at the close of business on January 17, 2019, which is the record date for the special meeting. 
This proxy statement contains important information for you to consider when deciding how to vote on the matter brought before the special meeting. This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are also available at www.proxyvote.com. 
You are invited to attend the special meeting in person to vote on the proposal described in this proxy statement. However, you do not need to attend the special meeting to vote your shares. 
Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to read this proxy statement and submit your proxy or voting instructions as soon as possible.  Why did I receive a full set of printed proxy materials instead of a notice regarding the Internet availability of the proxy materials? 
For our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, which was held in June 2018, we elected to provide access to the proxy materials through the Internet under the SEC's "notice and access" rules by mailing each of our stockholders a notice regarding the Internet availability of the proxy materials and instructions on how to access the proxy materials on the Internet. However, for purposes of the special meeting, after taking into account a number of considerations, including the timing of the special meeting and the specific purpose of the proposal being considered by our stockholders at the meeting, our board of directors determined it would be more effective to provide a full set of printed proxy materials to each of our stockholders in connection with the special meeting. This is the same delivery approach we followed when making proxy materials available to our stockholders in connection with our special meeting of stockholders held on December 21, 2018. The proxy materials for the special meeting include the proxy statement, as well as the accompanying proxy card. We do not expect that our decision to provide a full set of printed proxy materials in connection with the special meeting will necessarily impact the manner in which we will deliver proxy materials for future meetings of our stockholders. 
Who may vote at the special meeting? 
Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date, January 17, 2019, are entitled to vote at the special meeting. As of the record date, there were 103,453,661 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, held by 237 holders of record. 
What is the quorum requirement for the special meeting? 
At least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy in order to transact business at the special meeting. This is referred to as a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be treated as shares present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether or not a quorum exists. If there is no quorum present at the special meeting, consistent with our bylaws, the chairman of the special meeting, or the holders of a majority of shares present at the special meeting in person or represented by proxy, will adjourn the special meeting to a later date. 
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name"? 
Stockholder of Record 
If, on the record date, your shares were registered directly in your name with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent, then you are a stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the special meeting. Alternatively, you may vote by proxy through the Internet, by telephone or by mail as described in response to the question entitled "How may I vote my shares?" below. 
Beneficial Owner 
If, on the record date, your shares were not registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, but instead were held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, then you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee, which is considered to be the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As a beneficial owner, you are entitled to give instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the special meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee. 
How many votes do I have? 
You have one vote for each share of our common stock that you own as of the close of business on the record date. These shares include shares that you hold directly, as a stockholder of record, and that are held for you in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee.  What proposal will be voted on at the special meeting? 
The single proposal to be voted on at the special meeting is as follows: 
Proposal 1: Approval of an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or our Charter, to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock at a ratio not less than 1-for-5 and not greater than 1-for-10 (inclusive), with the exact ratio to be set as a whole number within that range at the discretion of our board of directors before February 22, 2020 without further approval or authorization of our stockholders. The board of directors may alternatively elect to abandon such proposed amendment and not effect the reverse stock split authorized by our stockholders, in its sole discretion. 
We will also consider such other business as may properly come before the special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
As of the date of this proxy statement, our board of directors is not aware of any matters, other than those described in this proxy statement, which may be presented for consideration at the special meeting. Should any other matters requiring a vote of the stockholders come before the special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the persons named in the accompanying proxy card will have the discretionary authority to vote with respect to such matters in accordance with their best judgment. 
What are my voting options on the proposal? 
You may vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" Proposal 1 or you may abstain from voting on the proposal. 
What is our board of director's voting recommendation on the proposal? 
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote your shares "FOR" approval of Proposal 1 as described in this proxy statement. 
How may I vote my shares? 
The procedures for voting are as follows: 
Stockholder of Record 
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the special meeting. Alternatively, you may vote by proxy through the Internet, by telephone or by mail as described below. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. If you have already voted by proxy, you may still attend the special meeting and vote in person, and your vote at the special meeting will have the effect of revoking your proxy. Please see the response to the question entitled "Can I change my vote after submitting my proxy?" below for additional information. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote in Person. To vote in person, please attend the special meeting and request a ballot when you arrive.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote by Internet. To vote through the Internet, go to www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions  provided on the website. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on February 21, 2019. Our Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders by using individual control  numbers, which are located on the proxy card accompanying these proxy materials. In order to cast your vote, you will be asked to provide the control number from the proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote by Telephone. To vote by telephone, call 1-800-690-6903 from any touch-tone telephone and follow the instructions. Telephonic voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern  Time on February 21, 2019. Our telephonic voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders by using individual control numbers, which are located on the proxy card accompanying these proxy materials. In order to cast your vote, you will  be asked to provide the control number from the proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote by Mail. To vote by mail using the proxy card accompanying these proxy materials, simply complete,  sign and date the proxy card and return it promptly in the postage-paid envelope provided.  
[END TABLE]
Beneficial Owner 
If you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee, you should have received a proxy card containing voting instructions with these proxy materials from that organization rather than from us. To vote your shares, simply follow the instructions provided to you. To vote in person at the special meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee. 
What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions? 
Stockholder of Record 
If you are a stockholder of record and you indicate when transmitting your voting instructions by Internet or by telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by our board of directors, or if you sign and return a proxy card by mail without giving specific voting instructions, then the proxy holders will vote your shares "FOR" Proposal 1 as recommended by our board of directors. The proxy holders will also have the discretionary authority to vote on any other matters properly presented for a vote at the special meeting in accordance with their best judgment. 
Beneficial Owner 
Generally, if you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name", you are entitled to give instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to vote your shares. If you do not provide voting instructions, your broker, bank or other nominee may still vote your shares with respect to matters that are considered to be "routine," but may not vote your shares with respect to matters that are considered to be "non-routine." Whether a proposal is considered a "routine" matter or a "non-routine" matter is subject to the interpretation of certain rules that are applicable to brokers and dealers. 
We have been advised that Proposal 1 constitutes a "routine" matter under applicable rules, meaning that, to the extent you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, the nominee may vote your shares on this proposal. You can avoid having your broker, bank or other nominee vote your shares by providing the nominee with your specific voting instructions on Proposal 1. 
What is the voting requirement to approve the proposal? 
The approval of Proposal 1 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. 
What is the effect of broker non-votes and abstentions on the approval of the proposal? 
Because we have been advised that Proposal 1 constitutes a "routine" matter under applicable rules, your broker, bank or other nominee may generally vote your shares without instructions on this matter, so we do not expect any broker non-votes in connection with this proposal. Because Proposal 1 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as votes against Proposal 1. 
How can I attend the special meeting in person? 
You must present a form of government-issued personal photo identification in order to be admitted to the special meeting. If your shares are held in "street name," you will also need proof of ownership to be admitted to the special meeting. A recent brokerage statement or a letter from your broker, bank or other nominee are examples of acceptable proof of ownership. No cameras, recording equipment, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted at the special meeting. 
Can I change my vote after submitting my proxy? 
Yes. Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke it at any time before it is voted at the special meeting.  Stockholder of Record 
If you are the stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy in any one of four ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may vote again through the Internet or by telephone at a later time (prior to the deadline for Internet or  telephone voting).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may submit a properly completed proxy card with a later date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may send a written notice (to be delivered prior to the commencement of the special meeting) that you are  revoking your proxy to Endologix, Inc. at 2 Musick, Irvine, California 92618, Attention: Corporate Secretary.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may attend the special meeting and vote in person. However, attending the special meeting will not, by  itself, revoke your proxy or change your vote.  
[END TABLE]
Beneficial Owner 
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," you may revoke your proxy by following the instructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee. 
Who is paying for the cost of this proxy solicitation? 
We will bear the entire cost of this proxy solicitation, including costs of preparing, assembling, printing and mailing this proxy statement, the accompanying proxy card and any additional solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders. Copies of these proxy materials will be furnished to brokerage firms, banks or other nominees that hold shares of our common stock in "street name," so that they may forward the proxy materials to the beneficial owners of our shares. We have retained Morrow & Sodali LLC, 470 East Ave, Stamford, Connecticut 06902, or Morrow, a proxy solicitation firm, to deliver solicitation materials to beneficial owners and to assist us in collecting proxies from such individuals. We expect to pay Morrow a fee of approximately $10,000 for their proxy solicitation services. We may reimburse persons representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. Solicitation of proxies may be supplemented by telephone, electronic mail or personal solicitation by our directors, officers or other regular employees. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or other regular employees for such services. 
I share an address with another stockholder, and we received only one copy of these proxy materials. How may I obtain an additional copy of these proxy materials? 
SEC rules permit companies, banks, brokers and other nominees to deliver a single copy of proxy materials to households at which two or more stockholders reside. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce duplicate mailings and save significant printing and postage costs, as well as natural resources. Stockholders sharing an address who have been previously notified by their broker, bank or other nominee and have consented to "householding" will receive only one copy of our proxy materials. 
If you would like to opt out of this practice for future mailings and receive separate proxy materials for each stockholder sharing the same address, please contact your broker, bank or other nominee. You may also obtain additional copies of our proxy materials without charge by contacting us at Endologix, Inc., 2 Musick, Irvine, California 92618, Attention: Corporate Secretary, or by telephone by calling (949) 595-7200. 
Stockholders sharing an address that are receiving multiple copies of our proxy materials can request delivery of a single copy of our proxy materials by contacting their broker, bank or other nominee, or by contacting us as indicated above. 
How do I request electronic delivery of future proxy materials? 
If you would like to reduce the costs incurred by us in mailing proxy materials, you can consent to receiving all future proxy statements, proxy cards and annual reports electronically via e-mail or the Internet. To sign up for electronic delivery, please follow the instructions in the response to the question entitled "How may I vote my shares?" above, to vote using the Internet and, when prompted, indicate that you agree to receive or access proxy materials electronically in future years. 
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting? 
We will announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and will publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that we expect to file with the SEC within four business days of the special meeting.  BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS

 PROPOSAL NO. 1 
AMENDMENT TO OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED, TO EFFECT A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT 
General 
On January 9, 2019, our board of directors unanimously approved, subject to stockholder approval, an amendment to our Charter to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of not less than 1-for-5 and not greater than 1-for-10 (inclusive), with the exact ratio to be set as a whole number within that range by our board of directors before February 22, 2020 without further approval or authorization of our stockholders. The board of directors may alternatively elect to abandon the proposed Charter amendment and not effect the reverse stock split authorized by stockholders, in its sole discretion. Upon the effectiveness of the amendment to our Charter effecting the reverse stock split, the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock will be reclassified and converted into a lesser number of shares such that one share of our common stock will be issued for a specified number of shares within the approved reverse stock split range. 
If this proposal is approved by our stockholders as proposed, our board of directors would have the sole discretion to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• fix the specific ratio for the reverse stock split, provided that the ratio would be not less than 1-for-5 and not more than 1-for-10; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approve the filing of the amendment to our Charter with the designated ratio to effect the reverse stock split at  any time before February 22, 2020.  
[END TABLE]
We believe enabling our board of directors to fix the specific ratio of the reverse stock split within the stated range will provide us with the flexibility to implement the reverse stock split in a manner designed to maximize the anticipated benefits for our stockholders. The determination of the ratio of the reverse stock split will be based on a number of factors, which are described in more detail under the heading "Criteria to be Used for Decision to Apply the Reverse Stock Split." 
The reverse stock split, if approved by our stockholders, would become effective upon the filing of the amendment to our Charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law. The exact timing of the filing of the amendment (and of the effectiveness of the reverse stock split) will be determined by our board of directors based on its evaluation as to when such action would be the most advantageous to us and our stockholders, but will not occur after February 22, 2020. In addition, our board of directors reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to abandon the filing of the amendment (and the effectiveness of the reverse stock split) if, at any time prior to the effectiveness of the amendment, our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest or the best interests of our stockholders to proceed. Our board of directors reserves this right notwithstanding that stockholder approval for the filing of the amendment may have been obtained, and without the requirement for further action by our stockholders. 
The primary reason for effecting the reverse stock split is to increase the per share trading price of our common stock so as to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• maintain the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and seek to avoid the delisting of  our common stock from that market in the future;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• broaden the pool of investors that may be interested in investing in our common stock by attracting investors who  may prefer to invest in shares that trade at higher share prices;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• improve the marketability of our common stock and thus improve the liquidity of our shares and lower average  transaction costs for our stockholders; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide a greater number of authorized shares available for issuance for corporate purposes including, without  limitation, restructuring our existing indebtedness, paying monthly interest payments under our current debt facility in shares of common stock (to the extent permitted by the terms of the debt facility), raising additional capital, selling  securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock, acquiring companies or assets, or entering into strategic partnerships or collaborations.  
[END TABLE]
 The reverse stock split would only apply to our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and would not change the number of authorized shares of our common stock as set forth in our Charter. Therefore, because the reverse stock split would result in the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock decreasing, the number of authorized shares of common stock remaining available for issuance would increase from 66,546,339 to approximately 149,309,267 (as of January 17, 2019, assuming a 1-for-5 reverse stock split ratio) or approximately 159,654,633 (as of January 17, 2019, assuming a 1-for-10 reverse stock split ratio), proportionately to the ratio of the reverse stock split. 
As the reverse stock split does not impact the number of our shares of common stock authorized for issuance, we expect that, if the reverse stock split is implemented, we will have a significant number of authorized but unissued shares available for issuance. The additional authorized shares of common stock would be available for issuance from time to time for corporate purposes, including, without limitation, restructuring existing indebtedness, paying monthly interest payments under our current debt facility in shares of common stock (to the extent permitted by the terms of the debt facility), raising additional capital through equity financing, acquiring companies or assets, entering into strategic partnerships or collaborations, or selling securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock. We believe the availability of the additional authorized shares will provide us with the flexibility to raise the necessary capital to execute our business plans and finance our strategic objectives, and to otherwise take advantage of favorable opportunities as they arise. If we issue additional shares for any of these purposes, the ownership interest of our current stockholders would be diluted. 
In evaluating the reverse stock split, our board of directors took into consideration a number of negative factors commonly associated with reverse stock splits. These factors include the negative perception of reverse stock splits held by some investors and analysts, as well as the fact that the stock prices of some companies that effect reverse stock splits do not necessarily trade at levels commensurate with expectations based on the applicable reverse stock split ratios. However, our board of directors determined that these potential negative factors were significantly outweighed by the potential benefits, and believes that the increase of the per share market price of our common stock that may result from the reverse stock split may allow us to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, encourage greater interest in our common stock from market participants, improve our ability to raise additional capital to execute our business plans and finance our strategic objectives, and promote greater liquidity for our stockholders. 
The form of the proposed amendment to our Charter to effect the reverse stock split is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement. If this proposal is approved by our stockholders, the amendment to our Charter that may be filed to effect the reverse stock split will include the reverse stock split ratio fixed by our board of directors, within the range approved by our stockholders. 
Criteria to be Used for Decision to Apply the Reverse Stock Split 
If our stockholders approve the amendment to our Charter to effect the reverse stock split, our board of directors will be authorized to proceed with the reverse stock split. In determining whether to proceed with the reverse stock split, and setting the exact ratio as a whole number within the range approved by our stockholders, our board of directors will consider a number of factors, including the historical and projected trading price of our common stock, our historical and projected financial condition and results of operations, existing and anticipated market conditions, the marketability and liquidity of our common stock, the impact on our ability to raise additional capital and the dilutive impact of any such capital raising activities, the requirements of the continued listing rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and the ratio that is anticipated to result in the least administrative cost to us. However, even if the reverse stock split is approved by our stockholders, our board of directors reserves the right to abandon the reverse stock split at any time. 
Effect of the Reverse Stock Split 
The reverse stock split will be effected simultaneously with respect to all issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. The reverse stock split will affect all of our stockholders uniformly and will not affect any stockholder's percentage ownership interest in our Company, except to the extent that the reverse stock split results in any of our stockholders owning a fractional share. The treatment of fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split is described in more detail under the heading "Fractional Shares." 
The reverse stock split will not change the existing terms of our common stock. After the reverse stock split, the shares of common stock will have the same voting rights and rights to dividends and distributions and will be identical in all other respects to the common stock now authorized. The common stock that remains outstanding following the reverse stock split will continue to be fully paid and non-assessable.  The reverse stock split is not intended as, and will not have the effect of, a "going private transaction" covered by Rule 13e-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. 
Following the reverse stock split, we will continue to be subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and we expect that our common stock will continue to be listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 
The reverse stock split would not change the number of authorized shares of our common stock or preferred stock as set forth in our Charter. In addition, the undesignated status of our preferred stock would not be impacted. 
As of the effective time of the reverse stock split, all outstanding options and warrants and other rights to acquire our common stock will be proportionately reduced in the same ratio as the reduction in the number of shares of outstanding common stock, except that any fractional shares resulting from such reduction will be rounded down to the nearest whole share. Correspondingly, the per share exercise or purchase price of such options and warrants will be increased in direct proportion to the reverse stock split ratio, so that the aggregate dollar amount payable for the purchase of the shares subject to such options and warrants will remain approximately the same. In addition, as of the effective time, we will adjust and proportionately decrease the total number of shares of our common stock that may be the subject of future grants under our equity incentive plans. 
Assuming reverse stock split ratios of 1-for-5 and 1-for-10 (which reflect the low and high end of the range that our stockholders are being asked to approve), the following table sets forth (i) the approximate number of shares of our common stock that would be issued and outstanding, (ii) the approximate number of shares of our common stock that would be reserved for future issuance pursuant to outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and warrants, as well as our existing equity incentive plans, indebtedness and other contractual obligations, and (iii) the weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options and warrants, each giving effect to the reverse stock split and based on securities outstanding as of January 17, 2019.

[END TABLE]
If this proposal to amend our Charter to effect a reverse stock split is approved and our board of directors elects to effect the reverse stock split, the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock will be reduced in proportion to the ratio of the stock split chosen by our board of directors. Accordingly, if a reverse stock split is effected, the number of authorized shares of our common stock will be proportionally increased.  Additionally, if this proposal is approved and our board of directors elects to effect the reverse stock split, we would communicate to the public, prior to the effective date of the stock split, additional details regarding the reverse split, including the specific ratio selected by our board of directors. If the board of directors does not implement the reverse stock split by February 22, 2020, the authority granted in this proposal to implement the reverse stock split will terminate and we would be required to seek the further approval of our stockholders to implement a reverse stock split. 
Our directors and executive officers have no substantial interests, directly or indirectly, in the matters set forth in this proposed amendment, except to the extent of their direct or indirect ownership of shares of our common stock and securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock. 
Certain Risks and Potential Disadvantages Associated with the Reverse Stock Split
Reverse Stock Split 
The effect of the reverse stock split upon the market prices for our common stock cannot be accurately predicted, and the history of similar stock split combinations for companies in like circumstances is varied. If the reverse stock split is implemented, the post-split market price of our common stock may be less than the pre-split price multiplied by the reverse stock split ratio. 
In addition, some investors may view the reverse split negatively because it reduces the number of shares of common stock available in the public market. A reduction in the number of shares outstanding may impair the liquidity for our common stock, which may reduce the value of our common stock. Also, some stockholders may consequently own less than one hundred shares of our common stock. A purchase or sale of less than one hundred shares may result in incrementally higher trading costs through certain brokers, particularly "full service" brokers. Therefore, those stockholders who own less than one hundred shares following the reverse stock split may be required to pay modestly higher transaction costs should they then determine to sell their shares. 
Even if the reverse split is implemented, we may still be ineligible for listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Although we believe we will meet the minimum requirements for listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, there is no assurance that our stock price will achieve the minimum amount and that the stock price will continue to meet the minimum requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. 
Increase in the Number of Authorized and Unissued Shares of Common Stock 
Because the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock would decrease, the number of shares remaining available for issuance under our authorized pool of common stock would increase. Future issuances of common stock may, depending on the circumstances, have a dilutive effect on the earnings per share, voting power and other interests of our existing stockholders. For example, we may use the additional authorized but unissued shares to restructure existing indebtedness, pay monthly interest payments under our current debt facility in shares of common stock (to the extent permitted by the terms of the debt facility), raise additional capital through equity financing, acquire companies or assets, enter into strategic partnerships or collaborations, or sell securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock, any of which may result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. 
The issuance of authorized but unissued stock could be used to deter a potential takeover of our Company that may otherwise be beneficial to stockholders by diluting the shares held by a potential suitor or issuing shares to a stockholder that will vote in accordance with the desires of our board of directors. A takeover may be beneficial to independent stockholders because, among other reasons, a potential suitor may offer such stockholders a premium for their shares of stock compared to the then-existing market price. We do not have any plans or proposals to adopt provisions or enter into agreements that may have material anti-takeover consequences. 
Although an increase in the authorized shares of common stock could, under certain circumstances, have an anti-takeover effect, this proposal to adopt the amendment is not in response to any effort of which we are aware to accumulate common stock or obtain control of our Company. Nor is it part of a plan by management to recommend a series of similar amendments to our board of directors and stockholders.  Procedure for Effecting the Reverse Stock Split and Exchange of Stock Certificates 
If our stockholders approve the proposal to effect the reverse stock split, and if our board of directors elects to proceed with the reverse stock split, our board of directors will determine the ratio of the reverse stock split to be implemented within the range approved by our stockholders, and we will file the amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and certain regulatory bodies reflecting the designated ratio. After the amendment becomes effective, the shares of our common stock will have a new Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (CUSIP) number, which is a number used to identify our common stock. As soon as practicable after the effective date of the reverse stock split, stockholders will be notified that the reverse stock split has been effected. 
Stockholder of Record 
Certain of our stockholders hold some or all of their shares electronically in book-entry form with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC. These stockholders do not hold physical stock certificates evidencing their ownership of our common stock. However, they are provided with a statement reflecting the number of shares of our common stock registered in their accounts. If a stockholder holds registered shares in book-entry form with our transfer agent, no action needs to be taken to receive post-reverse stock split shares. If a stockholder is entitled to post-reverse stock split shares, a transaction statement will automatically be sent to the stockholder's address of record indicating the number of shares of our common stock held following the reverse stock split. 
Beneficial Owner 
Upon the implementation of the reverse stock split, we intend to treat shares held by stockholders in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee in the same manner as stockholders of record whose shares are registered in their names. Brokers, banks and other nominees will be instructed to effect the reverse stock split for their beneficial holders holding our common stock in "street name". However, these brokers, banks and other nominees may have different procedures than stockholders of record for processing the reverse stock split. If a stockholder holds shares of our common stock with a broker, bank or other nominee and has any questions about the reverse stock split, the stockholder is encouraged to contact its nominee. 
Holders of Certificated Shares of Common Stock 
As of the date of this proxy statement, certain of our shares of common stock were held in certificated form. Stockholders of record at the time of the reverse stock split who hold shares of our common stock in certificated form will be sent a transmittal letter by our transfer agent after the effective time that will contain the necessary materials and instructions on how a stockholder should surrender its certificates representing shares of our common stock to the transfer agent. 
Fractional Shares 
We will not issue fractional shares in connection with the reverse stock split. Instead, stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the reverse stock split will receive one whole share of common stock in lieu of such fractional share. We expect that this will result in a slight increase in the overall number of shares outstanding after the reverse stock split than if we were to elect payment of cash for fractional shares, but the effect on stockholders' respective ownership percentages will be negligible. 
No Appraisal Rights 
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders are not entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights with respect to the reverse stock split, and we will not independently provide stockholders with any such rights.  Accounting Consequences 
The reverse stock split will not affect total assets, liabilities or stockholders' equity. However, the per share net income or loss and net book value of the common stock will be retroactively increased for each period because there will be fewer shares of common stock outstanding. 
In addition, the reverse stock split will not affect the par value of a share of our common stock. As a result, as of the effective time of the reverse stock split, the stated capital attributable to common stock on our balance sheet will be reduced proportionately based on the reverse stock split ratio (including a retroactive adjustment for prior periods), and the additional paid-in capital account will be credited with the amount by which the stated capital is reduced.
Federal Income Tax Consequences 
The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of a reverse stock split to us and to stockholders that hold shares of our common stock as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This discussion is based upon current U.S. tax law, which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, and differing interpretations. Any such change may cause the U.S. federal income tax consequences of a reverse stock split to vary substantially from the consequences summarized below. 
This summary does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to stockholders in light of their particular circumstances or to stockholders who may be subject to special tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, including, without limitation, dealers in securities, commodities or foreign currency, persons who are treated as non-U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax purposes, certain former citizens or long-term residents of the U.S., insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, banks, financial institutions, small business investment companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, retirement plans, persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, traders that mark-to-market their securities, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax or Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, persons who hold their shares of our common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion or other risk reduction transaction, persons who hold their shares of our common stock as "qualified small business stock" under Section 1045 and/or 1202 of the Code, or who acquired their shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of compensatory stock options, the vesting of previously restricted shares of stock or otherwise as compensation. 
The state and local tax consequences of a reverse split may vary as to each stockholder, depending on the jurisdiction in which such stockholder resides, and any state or local tax considerations are beyond the scope of this discussion. This discussion should not be considered as tax or investment advice, and the tax consequences of a reverse stock split may not be the same for all stockholders. Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to understand their individual federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences. 
Tax Consequences to our Company 
We believe a reverse stock split will constitute a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(E) of the Code. Accordingly, we should not recognize taxable income, gain or loss in connection with a reverse stock split. In addition, we do not expect a reverse stock split to affect our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards. 
Tax Consequences to Stockholders 
Stockholders should not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of a reverse stock split, except stockholders whose fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split are rounded up to the nearest whole share may recognize gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the value of the additional fractional share. A stockholder's tax basis in the shares received as a result of the reverse split will be equal, in the aggregate, to its basis in the shares exchanged, increased by the income or gain attributable to the rounding up of fractional shares, as described herein. New shares attributable to the rounding up of fractional shares to the nearest whole number of shares may be treated for tax purposes as if the fractional shares constitute a disproportionate dividend distribution. Such stockholders generally should recognize ordinary income to the   extent of our earnings and profits allocated to the portion of each whole share attributable to the rounding up process, and the remainder, if any, may be treated as a return of tax basis and gain received from the exchange of property. The stockholder's holding period for the shares of common stock it receives in a reverse stock split should include the stockholder's holding period for the shares of common stock exchanged in the reverse stock split. The portion of the shares received by a stockholder that are attributable to rounding up for fractional shares will have a holding period commencing on the effective date of the reverse split. 
Individual tax circumstances can vary, and stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax effects to them, based on their particular circumstances, in particular, stockholders whose fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split are rounded up to the nearest whole share and with respect to allocating tax basis and holding period among their post-reverse stock split shares. 
Required Vote 
Pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, the approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. We do not expect any broker non-votes in connection with this proposal. Abstentions will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum and, if a quorum is present, will have the same effect as votes against this proposal. 
Recommendation of our Board of Directors 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT OUR STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE AMENDMENT TO OUR CHARTER TO EFFECT THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT.  DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2019 ANNUAL MEETING 
Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act specifies the requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals in our proxy statement for an annual meeting of stockholders. If we hold our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders on or about the same time as our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, then any stockholder desiring to submit a proposal for action at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders should arrange for such proposal to be delivered to us at our principal place of business no later than December 31, 2018, in order to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement relating to that meeting. However, if we hold our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders on a date that is more than 30 days earlier or later than our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, then a stockholder proposal must be received by us at our principal place of business in a reasonable amount of time prior to when we begin to print and mail our proxy materials. Matters pertaining to such proposals, including the number and length thereof, the eligibility of persons entitled to have such proposals included and other aspects are regulated by Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, rules and regulations of the SEC and other laws and regulations. 
If a stockholder desires to bring business before the meeting which is not the subject of a proposal properly submitted in accordance with Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, the stockholder must follow procedures outlined in our bylaws. Our bylaws provide that a stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting may make nominations for the election of directors or may propose that other business be brought before the meeting only if (i) such nominations or proposals are included in our proxy statement or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our board of directors, or (ii) the stockholder has delivered or mailed written notice to us (containing certain information specified in our bylaws), and our Corporate Secretary has received such written notice, not less than 90 days prior to the date of the meeting. However, if we have given less than 100 days' advance notice or public disclosure of the date the meeting is to be held, written notice of a nomination or proposal to be submitted by a stockholder at the meeting will be timely if it has been received by us not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made.  OTHER BUSINESS 
As of the date of this proxy statement, our board of directors is not aware of any matters, other than those described in this proxy statement, which may be presented for consideration at the special meeting. Should any other matters requiring a vote of the stockholders come before the special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the persons named in the accompanying proxy card will have the discretionary authority to vote with respect to such matters in accordance with their best judgment.
