Dear Fellow Shareholder:

Materials being provided include the Notice of Annual Meeting setting forth the business expected to come before the meeting, the 2019 proxy statement and A. H. Belo's 2018 annual report. If you requested printed versions of the materials by mail, these materials also include a proxy/voting instruction card for the annual meeting. The proxy statement tells you more about the agenda and voting procedures for the meeting and provides information about A. H. Belo's directors nominated for election at this year's meeting. 
As permitted by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, most of the Company's shareholders were mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials with instructions for electronically accessing these proxy materials and for voting via the Internet. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also provides information on how you may obtain printed copies of our proxy materials free of charge. We believe that this approach allows us to provide shareholders with the information they need to vote their shares while reducing delivery costs and conserving natural resources. 
For those A. H. Belo shareholders with access to the Internet, we encourage you to vote your shares online. Detailed instructions on how to vote over the Internet or by telephone are set forth in the proxy materials and in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. We encourage you to elect to receive future annual reports, proxy statements and other materials over the Internet by following the instructions in the proxy statement. This electronic means of communication is quick and convenient and reduces the Company's printing and mailing costs. 
Whether or not you attend the meeting, it is important that your shares be represented at the annual meeting. I encourage you to vote your shares as soon as possible either by returning your proxy/voting instruction card or by voting using the Internet or telephone voting procedures outlined in the proxy materials or in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.

PROXY STATEMENT 
For the Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
To Be Held On May 9, 2019 
This proxy statement contains information related to the annual meeting of shareholders of A. H. Belo Corporation ("A. H. Belo," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us") to be held on Thursday, May 9, 2019, beginning at 9:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, in the auditorium of our corporate headquarters at 1954 Commerce Street, Dallas, Texas 75201, and any postponement or adjournment of the meeting. 
A Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") is being mailed or otherwise sent to shareholders of A. H. Belo on or about March 28, 2019. Paper copies of this proxy statement and related proxy/voting instruction card will be distributed to shareholders beginning on or about March 28, 2019. 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the 2019 Annual Meeting to be Held on May 9, 2019. A. H. Belo's 2019 proxy statement and 2018 annual report, which includes consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, are available at www.proxyvote.com by entering a control number found in your notification materials. These documents are also posted on our website at www.ahbelo.com. 
ABOUT THE MEETING 
What is the purpose of the annual meeting? 
At the annual meeting, shareholders will act on matters outlined in the accompanying notice, including the election of directors, ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and any other matters properly brought before the meeting. Management will report on A. H. Belo's performance in 2018 and respond to questions and comments from shareholders. 
Who can attend the annual meeting? 
Shareholders and guests of A. H. Belo may attend the annual meeting. 
Who may vote at the meeting? 
Only shareholders who owned A. H. Belo shares of common stock at the close of business on March 18, 2019 (the "record date"), or their duly appointed proxies, are entitled to vote at the meeting, or at any postponement or adjournment of the meeting. Our common stock is divided into two series: Series A common stock and Series B common stock. Holders of either series of common stock as of the close of business on the record date will be entitled to vote at the meeting. At the close of business on the record date, a total of 19,079,551 shares of Series A common stock and 2,469,544 shares of Series B common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote. 
What are the voting rights of the holders of Series A common stock and Series B common stock? 
Holders of A. H. Belo Series A and Series B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters to be acted upon at the annual meeting. Each outstanding share of Series A common stock will be entitled to one vote on each matter. Each outstanding share of Series B common stock will be entitled to 10 votes on each matter.  Why did I receive a one-page Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a full set of proxy materials? 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the Company has elected to provide access to its proxy materials via the Internet and has sent the Notice to its shareholders. Shareholders can access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or request to receive free of charge a printed set of the proxy materials, including a proxy/voting instruction card. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy are set forth in the Notice. If you hold A. H. Belo shares in your A. H. Belo Savings Plan account, the Notice also has instructions on how to provide your voting instructions via the Internet. 
In addition, all shareholders may request to receive proxy materials electronically by email on an ongoing basis by following the instructions in the paragraph captioned "How to Receive Future Proxy Statements and Annual Reports Online" in the "Annual Report and Additional Materials" section of this proxy statement. The Company encourages shareholders to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials on the Internet in order to help reduce printing and mailing costs and environmental impacts. 
What constitutes a quorum to conduct business at the meeting? 
In order to carry on the business of the meeting, we must have a quorum present in person or by proxy. A majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock eligible to vote and at least one-third of the outstanding shares entitled to vote must be present at the meeting, in person or by proxy, in order to constitute a quorum. 
Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present at the meeting for purposes of determining whether we have a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker or other nominee returns a proxy but does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker or nominee does not have authority to vote on that particular item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. 
How do I cast my vote? 
You may receive more than one Notice or proxy/voting instruction card depending on how you hold your shares. It is important that you follow the instructions on each card or Notice and vote the shares represented by each card or Notice separately. 
Shareholders of record. If you hold shares directly and are listed as a shareholder on A. H. Belo's stock records, you may vote in person if you attend the meeting or you may vote by proxy, which gives the proxy holder the right to vote your shares on your behalf. You may vote by proxy online via the Internet, by telephone, or, if you request copies of the proxy materials, by completing and returning your proxy card in the envelope provided. Shares represented by proxy cards that are properly completed and submitted will be voted in accordance with the shareholder's instructions. 
Shares held in broker or other nominee name ("street name"). If you hold shares in street name, you have the right to instruct your broker or other nominee on how to vote those shares on your behalf, and you will receive a Notice or, if you request, a copy of the proxy materials, including a voting instruction form, from them. Alternatively, you may vote these shares in person at the meeting, by following the instructions below under "How do I vote in person." 
Shares held in your A. H. Belo Savings Plan account. These shares may be voted only by the plan trustee, but you may instruct the plan trustee on how to vote them. Information on how to provide voting instructions to the plan trustee via the Internet is set out in the Notice. The Notice also includes information on how to obtain paper copies of the proxy materials, including a voting instruction card, if you so desire. For more information, please refer to the question and answer "How do I vote my shares held in the A. H. Belo Savings Plan" below. 
If you want to vote using the Internet or telephone, please follow the instructions on each proxy/voting instruction card or in the Notice, and have the proxy/voting instruction card or the Notice available when you call in or access the voting site. In order to be included in the final tabulation of proxies, completed proxy/voting instruction cards must be received, and votes cast using the Internet or telephone must be cast, by the date and time noted on the card or in the Notice.  How do I vote in person? 
For shares held of record in your name, you may vote in person by completing a ballot at the annual meeting. If you plan to vote in person but hold shares through a broker or other nominee, you must provide a "legal proxy" from the broker or nominee evidencing your authority to vote shares the broker held for your account at the close of business on March 18, 2019. You must contact your brokerage firm directly in advance of the annual meeting to obtain a legal proxy. Blank ballots will be available at the registration table at the meeting. Completed ballots may be deposited at the registration table and a call for completed ballots will be made during the course of the meeting prior to the close of the polls. Voting instructions with respect to shares held in the A. H. Belo Savings Plan must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 7, 2019, and may not be provided at the meeting. 
Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy prior to the final voting? 
Yes. For shares held of record in your name, you may revoke your proxy (including an Internet or telephone vote) by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ➤    filing a written notice of revocation with the Secretary of A. H. Belo at any time prior to the annual meeting; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ➤    delivering a duly executed written proxy bearing a later date by the voting deadline set forth on the proxy card; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ➤    submitting a new proxy by Internet or telephone by the voting deadline set forth on the proxy card; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ➤    voting by ballot at the meeting. Attendance at the meeting does not by itself revoke a previously granted proxy.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held through a broker or nominee, contact that broker or nominee if you wish to change your voting instructions. 
For information on how to revoke or modify previously given voting instructions with respect to shares held through the Savings Plan, please see "How do I vote my shares held in the A. H. Belo Savings Plan" below. 
How do I vote my shares held in the A. H. Belo Savings Plan? 
Fidelity Management Trust Company is the plan trustee for the A. H. Belo Savings Plan. The A. H. Belo Savings Plan is referred to herein as the "Savings Plan." Only the plan trustee can vote the shares held by the Savings Plan. If you participate in the Savings Plan and had full shares of A. H. Belo common stock credited to your account as of the record date, you received a Notice in lieu of a paper copy of our proxy materials. The Notice includes instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet and how to request a printed set of the proxy materials, including a voting instruction card, if you desire to do so. The Notice also has information on how to provide your voting instructions to the plan trustee via the Internet or telephone. You will not be able to vote these shares in person at the annual meeting. 
Because of the time required to tabulate voting instructions from participants in the Savings Plan before the annual meeting, the plan trustee must receive your voting instructions by May 7, 2019. If you sign, date and return a paper voting instruction card but do not check any boxes on the card, the plan trustee will vote your shares FOR the nominees standing for election as directors named in this proxy statement, and FOR ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, at its discretion, the plan trustee will be authorized to vote on any other matter that may properly come before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting. If the plan trustee does not receive instructions from you (by Internet, telephone or voting instruction card) by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 7, 2019, the plan trustee will vote your shares in the same proportion as the shares in the Savings Plan for which voting instructions have been received from other plan participants. You may revoke or modify previously given voting instructions by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 7, 2019, by submitting a new voting instruction by Internet or telephone, filing with the plan trustee either a written notice of revocation or submitting a properly completed and signed voting instruction card by that date.  What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions? 
If you indicate when voting on the Internet or by telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by the Board or you sign and return a proxy card or voting instruction card without giving specific voting instructions, then the proxy holders or the plan trustee, as appropriate, will vote your shares in the manner recommended by the Board on all matters presented in this proxy statement as follows: FOR the nominees standing for election as directors named in this proxy statement, and FOR ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, the proxy holders or the plan trustee, as appropriate, may vote in their discretion on any other matter that may properly come before the annual meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the annual meeting. 
If you hold your shares through a broker, and you do not provide any voting instructions on the Internet or by telephone and do not return a voting instruction form, your broker may vote your shares at its discretion only on certain "routine matters." If the organization that holds your shares does not receive any voting instructions from you, the organization that holds your shares will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote your shares with respect to "non-routine" matters. This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote." 
Which proposals are considered "routine" or "non-routine"? 
The Company believes that the election of directors (Proposal One) is not a "routine matter" and a broker or other nominee will not be permitted to vote any uninstructed shares on Proposal One. The Company believes that Proposal Two, the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, is a "routine matter" on which brokers will be permitted to vote uninstructed shares. With respect to all other matters, however, your broker may not vote your shares for you without instructions and the aggregate number of unvoted shares is reported as the "broker non-vote." 
How are broker non-votes and abstentions treated? 
For Proposal One (election of directors), abstentions and broker non-votes have no effect. Proposal Two (the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm), abstentions and broker non-votes have the effect of negative votes, meaning that abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted in the denominator, but not the numerator, in determining whether a matter has received sufficient votes to be approved. 
What vote does the Board recommend? 
The Board recommends a vote: 
FOR all director nominees named in this proxy statement, and 
FOR ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm 
With respect to any other matter that properly comes before the meeting, the proxy holders will vote in their own discretion. 
What number of votes is required to approve each proposal? 
➤    Election of directors (Proposal One)  The affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast represented at the annual meeting and entitled to vote is required for the election of directors. This means that the nominees receiving the highest number of votes cast for the number of positions to be filled are elected. You do not have the right to cumulate votes in the election of directors. In other words, you cannot multiply the number of shares you own by the number of directorships being voted on and then cast the total for only one candidate or among several candidates as you see fit. Votes that are instructed to be withheld with respect to the election of one or more directors will not be voted for the director or directors indicated, although they will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. Shares held in broker or street name cannot be voted on this proposal without your instruction.  Additionally, if an incumbent director does not receive the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast with respect to that director's election at the annual meeting (which for this purpose includes votes cast "for" the director's election and votes to withhold authority with respect to the director's election), then that director is required to promptly tender his or her resignation, and the Board will act on such resignation as provided in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the applicable portion of which is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A. 
➤    Ratification of appointment of independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal Two)  The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power represented at the annual meeting and entitled to vote is required to ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for 2019. With respect to shares held in broker or street name, your broker has discretion to vote any uninstructed shares on this matter. 
➤    Other matters  Unless otherwise required by law or the Companys Certificate of Formation, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power represented at the annual meeting and entitled to vote is required for other matters that properly may come before the meeting. 
Where can I find the voting results of the annual meeting? 
The preliminary voting results will be announced at the annual meeting. The final voting results will be tallied by the inspector of election and published in a Current Report on Form 8-K, which the Company is required to file with the SEC within four business days following the annual meeting.  PROXY SOLICITATION 
Your proxy is being solicited on behalf of A. H. Belo's Board of Directors. In addition to use of the mail, the solicitation may also be made by use of facsimile, the Internet or other electronic means, or by telephone or personal contact by directors, officers, employees and agents of A. H. Belo. A. H. Belo pays the costs of this proxy solicitation. 
We have hired Morrow Sodali LLC, 470 West Ave, Stamford, CT 06902, to assist in soliciting proxies from beneficial owners of shares held in the names of brokers and other nominees, and have agreed to pay Morrow Sodali a fee of $3,500 plus its related costs and expenses. We also supply brokers, nominees and other custodians with proxy forms, proxy statements and annual reports for the purpose of sending proxy materials to beneficial owners. We reimburse brokers, nominees and other custodians for their reasonable expenses.  A. H. BELO CORPORATION STOCK OWNERSHIP 
The following tables set forth information about the beneficial ownership of A. H. Belo common stock by our current directors, nominees for election as director, the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table (the "named executive officers" or "NEOs"), all current directors, director nominees and executive officers as a group, and by each person known to A. H. Belo to own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of A. H. Belo Series A or Series B common stock. At the close of business on March 18, 2019, there were 19,079,551 Series A shares, 2,469,544 Series B shares and 21,549,095 combined Series A and Series B shares issued and outstanding. 
Under SEC rules, the beneficial ownership of a person or group includes not only shares held directly or indirectly by the person or group but also shares the person or group has the right to acquire within 60 days of the record date pursuant to exercisable options and convertible securities. The information below, including the percentage calculations, is based on beneficial ownership rather than direct ownership of issued and outstanding shares, except as described in footnote (1) to the table below. 
Unless otherwise indicated, each person listed below has sole voting power and sole dispositive power with respect to the shares of common stock indicated in the table as beneficially owned by such person. Series A common stock has one vote per share and Series B common stock has 10 votes per share. Consequently, the voting power of Series B holders is greater than the number of shares beneficially owned. For example, the shares of A. H. Belo common stock beneficially owned by all current directors, director nominees and executive officers as a group, representing 12.8% of the total outstanding shares of Series A and Series B common stock, have combined voting power of 50.7%.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Federal securities laws require that A. H. Belo's executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of A. H. Belo common stock, file reports with the SEC within specified time periods disclosing their beneficial ownership of A. H. Belo common stock and any subsequent changes in beneficial ownership of A. H. Belo common stock. These reporting persons are also required to furnish us with copies of these reports. Based on information provided to us by these reporting persons or otherwise, we believe that all filings required to be made by the reporting persons during 2018 were timely filed.  PROPOSAL ONE: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
A. H. Belo's bylaws provide that the Board of Directors comprises five to ten directors who are elected annually. The number of directors is determined by resolution of the Board of Directors consistent with the bylaws. The number of directors has been set at seven. The bylaws further provide that a director will retire on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders next following his or her 70th birthday. 
Selection, Qualifications and Experience of Directors 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for identifying director candidates and making recommendations to the Board. The Board is ultimately responsible for nominating recommended candidates for election to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee employs a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating director nominees. Candidates may come to the Committee's attention through current Board members, shareholders or other persons. In evaluating director candidates, the Committee considers a variety of criteria, including an individual's character and integrity; business, professional and personal background; skills; current employment; community service; and ability to commit sufficient time and attention to activities of the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also may take into account any specific financial, technical or other expertise, and the extent to which such expertise would complement the Board's existing mix of skills and qualifications. The Committee considers these criteria in the context of the perceived needs of the Board as a whole. For more information regarding the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the nominee selection and evaluation process, please see "Corporate Governance — Committees of the Board — Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee." 
Based on a review of the background and experiences of the directors, we believe that each of our directors possesses the professional and personal qualifications necessary for service on the A. H. Belo Board of Directors. In the individual biographies below, we have highlighted particularly noteworthy attributes of each Board member that led to the Board's conclusion that the person should serve as an A. H. Belo director in light of the Company's business and structure. In addition, we note that, based on their length of service to the Company, several of our directors have significant exposure to both our business and the communities in which we operate.  Nominees for A. H. Belo Directors 
Each of the following candidates has been nominated by the Board, is an incumbent director and will be eligible to serve a one-year term until the 2020 annual meeting and until his or her successor is elected and qualified. The independence of each director is addressed under "Corporate Governance — Director Independence." 
Each independent director serves on each of the three standing committees of the Board (Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance). Mr. Decherd and Mr. Moroney do not serve on any standing committee of the Board.

Vote Required for Approval 
The affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast represented at the annual meeting and entitled to vote is required for the election of directors. This means that the nominees receiving the highest number of votes cast for the number of positions to be filled are elected. For additional information, please see "What number of votes is required to approve each proposal?" 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR Proposal One, for the election of each of the director nominees named in this proxy statement.  PROPOSAL TWO: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Grant Thornton LLP served as A. H. Belo's independent auditors for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee has appointed Grant Thornton LLP to serve in such capacity for 2019, and as a matter of good corporate governance has determined to submit the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP for ratification by the shareholders. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP, the Audit Committee will consider the appointment of other independent public accounting firms. 
KPMG LLP served as our independent public accounting firm from March 2009 to March 2018. The Audit Committee dismissed KPMG on March 16, 2018. The audit reports of KPMG on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. The audit reports of KPMG on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that KPMG's report as of December 31, 2017, indicates that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. 
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the subsequent interim period through March 16, 2018, there were no (1) disagreements (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and related instructions) with KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG, would have caused KPMG to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in their reports, or (2) reportable events (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K), except that KPMG advised the Company of certain material weaknesses in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting, disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
The Audit Committee discussed the material weaknesses with KPMG. The Company authorized KPMG to respond fully to inquiries of Grant Thornton concerning the material weaknesses. There were no limitations placed on KPMG or Grant Thornton concerning the inquiry or any matter related to the Company's financial reporting. 
The Company provided KPMG and Grant Thornton with a copy of the disclosures required by Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K prior to the time this proxy statement was filed with the SEC. In the event that KPMG or Grant Thornton believed the disclosures were incorrect or incomplete, each was permitted to express its views in a brief statement to be included in this proxy statement. Neither submitted such a statement. 
In March 2018, the Audit Committee approved the appointment of Grant Thornton as our independent public accountant for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the subsequent interim period through March 16, 2018, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf has consulted Grant Thornton with respect to either (1) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, where either a written report or oral advice was provided to the Company that Grant Thornton concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (2) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a reportable event as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 
Representatives of Grant Thornton will be present at the annual meeting. They will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions presented at the annual meeting.  The table below sets forth the Grant Thornton fees related to the audits of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and those of our prior auditors, KPMG LLP, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and the reviews of our financial statements for the quarterly periods within those fiscal years, and all other fees Grant Thornton and KPMG, respectively, have billed us for services rendered during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively:

(2)  Consists of $34,103 of Grant Thornton fees for financial due diligence related to a potential acquisition and $25,000 in fees related to  KPMG's consent to the inclusion of the 2017 audited financial statements in the Form 10-K.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy and related procedures that set forth the manner in which the Audit Committee will review and approve all services to be provided by Grant Thornton before the firm is retained to provide such services. The policy requires Audit Committee pre-approval of the terms and fees of the annual audit services engagement, as well as any changes in terms and fees resulting from changes in audit scope or other items. The Audit Committee also pre-approves, on an annual basis, other audit services and audit-related and tax services set forth in the policy, subject to estimated fee levels pre-approved annually by the Committee. Any other services to be provided by the independent auditors must be separately pre-approved by the Audit Committee. In addition, if the fees for any pre-approved services are expected to exceed by 5% or more the estimated fee levels previously approved by the Audit Committee, the services must be separately pre-approved by the Committee. As a general guideline, annual fees paid to the independent auditors for services other than audit, audit-related and tax services should not exceed one-half the dollar amount of fees to be paid for these three categories of services collectively. The Audit Committee has delegated to the Committee chairman and other Committee members the authority to pre-approve services up to certain limits. Services pre-approved pursuant to delegated authority must be reported to the full Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Company's Chief Financial Officer reports periodically to the Audit Committee on the status of pre-approved services, including projected fees. All of the services and fees reflected in the above table were approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with our pre-approval policy. 
Vote Required for Approval 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power represented at the annual meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal is required for approval.

H. Belo's internal audit and financial staffs with respect to corporate accounting, reporting, risk management and internal control practices. The Audit Committee met six times during 2018. 
The Board has determined that at least one member of the Audit Committee meets the NYSE standard of having accounting or related financial management expertise. The Board has also determined that at least one member of the Audit Committee, Ron McCray, meets the SEC criteria of an "audit committee financial expert."  Compensation Committee 
Louis E. Caldera chairs the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee evaluates the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and sets his compensation level based on this evaluation. The Compensation Committee also approves the compensation of the other executive officers and recommends compensation for non-management directors, and administers, among other plans, the Company's 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan, the A. H. Belo Savings Plan, the A. H. Belo Change in Control Severance Plan, the A. H. Belo Pension Plan I and the A. H. Belo Pension Plan II. It also shares responsibility for senior executive succession planning with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Compensation Committee met four times during 2018. 
To assist the Compensation Committee and management in assessing and determining appropriate, competitive compensation for our executive officers and directors, the Compensation Committee annually engages an outside compensation consultant. Beginning in February 2008, the Compensation Committee has annually engaged Mercer LLC ("Mercer"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. ("Marsh"), as its compensation consultant. The scope of Mercer's engagement is to assist the Compensation Committee with its responsibilities related to the Company's executive and Board-level compensation programs. A representative from Mercer may attend Compensation Committee meetings, and reports directly to the Compensation Committee on matters relating to compensation for our executive officers, including the CEO. With respect to 2018 compensation recommendations, Mercer, at the Compensation Committee's request: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• conducted in February 2018, a compensation study regarding a comparison of executive pay for senior positions with leading newspapers versus  companies in the broader market of similar size. The analysis also included market data for the publisher role. A summary of alternative pay strategies and philosophies for similar business situations was also produced;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provided compensation cost comparisons of the Company's upper management levels (directors and above) relative to other leading newspapers  which provided insight as to the number of leaders in director, vice president and senior executive roles and their total target compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provided market research for stock grants for senior executive officers of public companies in order to make a determination on accelerating issued  and outstanding TBRSUs, and eliminating future equity grants under the Company's 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee makes the final decisions on CEO compensation, with market data from Mercer, as appropriate. Our senior management develops preliminary recommendations regarding compensation matters with respect to all executives other than the CEO and provides these recommendations to the Compensation Committee, which makes the final decisions as to these other executive officers. For 2018, the primary management liaisons to the Compensation Committee were Mr. Decherd and Ms. Hoagland. The management team is responsible for the administration of the compensation program once Compensation Committee decisions are finalized. 
Mercer was engaged by the Compensation Committee directly in 2018 to provide the Compensation Committee with recommendations for 2019 target total direct compensation. In 2018, the Company paid Mercer $40,680 for executive compensation matters. The Company has also retained Mercer and/or its Marsh affiliates to provide other services unrelated to executive compensation. These services include actuarial analysis of unpaid liabilities related to certain insurance claims. The aggregate expense for these other services in 2018 was approximately $18,000, exclusive of insurance premiums. The decision to engage Mercer or its Marsh affiliates for these other services unrelated to executive compensation consulting was made by Company management, and these services and related fees were not separately approved by the Compensation Committee or the Board. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is chaired by John Beckert, who also serves as the Board's Lead Director. The responsibilities of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee include the identification and recommendation of director candidates and the review of qualifications of directors for con-  tinued service on the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also has responsibility for shaping A. H. Belo's corporate governance practices, including the development and periodic review of the corporate governance guidelines and the Board committee charters and shares responsibility for senior executive succession planning. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met five times in 2018. 
In evaluating director nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers a variety of criteria, including an individual's character and integrity; business, professional and personal background; skills; current employment; community service; and ability to commit sufficient time and attention to the activities of the Board. It may also take into account any specific financial, technical or other expertise and the extent to which such expertise would complement the Board's existing mix of skills and qualifications. The Committee considers these criteria in the context of the perceived needs of the Board as a whole and seeks to achieve a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives on the Board. The Board does not have a formal diversity policy, but does endeavor to have members with a broad mix of professional and personal backgrounds. The Committee assesses the effectiveness of its criteria and its efforts at achieving a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives on the Board when evaluating and recommending new director candidates. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee employs a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating director nominees. The Committee reviews the size and composition of the Board as part of the annual Board evaluation process and makes recommendations to the Board as appropriate. If vacancies on the Board are anticipated, or otherwise arise, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers various potential candidates for director. Candidates may come to the Committee's attention through current Board members, shareholders or other persons. 
At the annual meeting, a shareholder may nominate candidates for election as directors if the shareholder has supplied the information required for director nominations under the advance notice provisions set forth in Article II of A. H. Belo's bylaws within the time periods set forth in such Article of the bylaws. The policy of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, as set forth in A. H. Belo's corporate governance guidelines, is to consider a properly made shareholder's recommendation for nominee(s) along with other potential nominees. The Committee evaluates shareholder-recommended nominees based on the same criteria it uses to evaluate nominees from other sources. Shareholders desiring to submit a nomination for director should consult A. H. Belo's bylaws, which are available upon request. 
After the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies a potential candidate, there is generally a mutual exploration process, during which A. H. Belo seeks to learn more about a candidate's qualifications, background and level of interest in A. H. Belo, and the candidate has the opportunity to learn more about A. H. Belo. A candidate may meet with members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, other directors and senior management. Based on information gathered during the course of this process, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee makes its recommendation to the Board. If the Board approves the recommendation, the candidate is nominated for election by A. H. Belo's shareholders. The Board or the shareholders may also elect a director between annual meetings of shareholders. A director so elected will hold office until the next annual meeting. Between two successive annual meetings the Board may not elect more than two directors to fill vacancies caused by increases in the number of directors. 
The Board convenes executive sessions of non-management directors without Company management present at each regularly-scheduled meeting. The Lead Director presides at the executive sessions of the non-management directors. In addition, the independent directors meet in executive session at least annually, without Jim Moroney or Robert Decherd present. Board committee chairs preside at executive sessions of their respective committees. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Robert Decherd serves as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). The Board believes that the Company and its shareholders are best served by a leadership structure in which Mr. Decherd serves as chairman and CEO and the Board has an independent Lead Director. Combining the roles of chairman and CEO makes clear that the person serving in these roles has primary responsibility for managing the Company's business, under the oversight and review of the Board. Under this structure, the chairman and CEO chairs Board meetings, where the Board discusses strategic and business issues. The Board believes that this approach makes   sense because the CEO is the individual with primary responsibility for implementing the Company's strategy and managing its day-to-day operations. This structure also enables the CEO to act as a bridge between management and the Board, helping both to act with a common purpose. 
At the same time, the Board believes that strong, independent Board leadership is a critical aspect of effective corporate governance. Accordingly, to provide independent leadership, the Board has established the position of Lead Director. The Lead Director is an independent director elected annually by the Board. John Beckert currently serves as the Lead Director. The Lead Director's responsibilities and authority include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• presiding at meetings of the Board at which the chairman and CEO is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• having the authority to call executive sessions of the independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• serving as a liaison between the chairman and CEO and the independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• advising on the flow of information sent to the Board, and reviewing the agenda, materials and schedule for Board meetings; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• being available for consultation and communication with major shareholders, as appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that a combined chairman/CEO, together with a Lead Director, is the most appropriate leadership structure for the Board at this time. The Board also believes that it is in the best interests of the Company for the Board to make a determination about whether to separate or combine the roles of chairman and CEO based upon the Company's circumstances at a particular time. The Company's bylaws permit the roles of chairman and CEO to be filled by the same or different individuals, thereby providing the Board flexibility to determine whether the roles should be combined or separated based upon the Company's needs from time to time. 
Board Risk Oversight 
At least annually, Company management provides the Audit Committee with a report regarding its enterprise risk assessment. The report identifies areas of enterprise risk, and aligns managerial and Board-level oversight, including at the Board committee level, and responsibility with the type of risk. In order to prepare the report, the Company's Internal Audit department interviews A. H. Belo business leaders at the corporate and operating unit level about the risk factors identified by the Company in its SEC filings, as well as other potential risks, to confirm Internal Audit's baseline risk assessment. The risk assessment results are reviewed with management to determine if any future adjustments to the audit plan are needed. 
The Audit Committee discusses the report's findings with management. The Audit Committee oversees management's risk assessment, including reviewing the Company's risk profile and evaluating management's approach to addressing identified risks. As specified in the Audit Committee charter, one of the specific duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee is to review and discuss the Company's policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. While the Audit Committee has primary oversight responsibility for the risk assessment and management process, other committees of the Board also have responsibility for oversight of risk management. For example, our Human Resources department and Compensation Committee consider the risks associated with our compensation policies and practices. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees risk associated with the Company's governance structure and processes. 
The Board is kept informed of its committees' risk oversight and related activities primarily through attendance at Board and committee meetings and management reports. In addition, the Audit Committee escalates issues related to risk oversight to the full Board as appropriate so that the Board is appropriately informed of developments that could affect the Company's risk profile and other aspects of its business. The Board also considers specific risk topics in connection with strategic planning and other matters. While the Board's role in oversight of Company risk is not determinative of its leadership structure, the Board's leadership structure helps facilitate risk assessment and review by independent directors under the leadership of the Lead Director. 
Audit Committee Report 
As described more fully in our written charter, which is posted on the Company's website at www.ahbelo.com under "About A. H. Belo — Corporate Governance," the Audit Committee represents the Board in its oversight   of A. H. Belo's financial reporting processes. In this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and Grant Thornton LLP, the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, A. H. Belo's audited consolidated financial statements and the audit of the effectiveness of A. H. Belo's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has discussed with Grant Thornton LLP various matters, including the firm's judgments as to the quality of A. H. Belo's accounting principles and other matters required to be discussed under the rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), including PCAOB Auditing Standards No. 1301. In addition, the Audit Committee has received from Grant Thornton LLP the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Grant Thornton LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the firm its independence from A. H. Belo and our management team. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in A. H. Belo's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC. 
Respectfully submitted,

Incentive Programs 
The Company's NEOs have the opportunity to earn incentive awards, which may be granted in the form of annual cash incentive bonuses, long-term equity-based incentive compensation ("LTEI compensation" or "LTEIs") or long-term cash incentive compensation ("LTCI compensation" or "LTCIs"). Incentive awards are supplemental to the executive's base salary and are designed to focus executives on achieving key financial goals, encourage retention, and motivate and reward them for market-driven results. 
Beginning with the March 2018 grants, annual cash incentive bonuses and LTEIs are provided under the A. H. Belo 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan ("ICP") and administered by the Compensation Committee. Grants made prior to March 2018 were made under the Company's 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan, which has now terminated with respect to future grants. 
Annual Cash Incentive Bonus Program 
Overview.    Under the terms of the ICP, each A. H. Belo executive officer is eligible to receive an annual cash incentive bonus based on financial performance objectives established in the annual financial plan approved by the Board of Directors or other management objectives (such as individual objectives) approved by the Board of Directors. The financial and individual objectives may vary from year to year and reflect the cyclical nature of A. H. Belo's businesses due to fluctuating advertising demand and changes in media usage habits by consumers and advertisers, and other competitive conditions, including recruiting and retaining talent. All NEOs participate in the annual cash incentive bonus program.  Specific Program for 2018. The Compensation Committee established a 2018 target bonus opportunity expressed as a percentage of base salary as follows: Mr. Moroney – 85%; and Mr. Moise – 80%. In 2018, the Compensation Committee approved Mr. Storer's employment agreement, and set the target annual cash incentive bonus for Mr. Storer at $300,000. Mr. Decherd opted not to be eligible for a 2018 cash incentive bonus. 
Mr. Moroney and Mr. Moise were each eligible to receive an annual cash incentive bonus based 50% on financial performance objectives and 50% on individual objectives. In order to calculate achievement of financial performance under the ICP with respect to 2018 incentive bonuses for Mr. Moroney and Mr. Moise, the Compensation Committee selected Publishing EBITDA, Marketing Services EBITDA, consolidated Company EBITDA, Publishing revenue, and Marketing Services revenue as the financial performance measures, and individual objectives, both financial and non-financial, as performance measures. Payouts of any bonuses to Mr. Moroney and Mr. Moise under the annual cash incentive program required the Company's overall achievement threshold of at least 70% of target consolidated EBITDA. For Mr. Moroney and Mr. Moise, the weighting given to the financial performance measures was 20% against consolidated Company EBITDA, 20% against Publishing EBITDA, 20% against Marketing Services EBITDA, 20% against Publishing revenue, and 20% against Marketing Services revenue. For Mr. Storer, pursuant to his employment agreement, the Compensation Committee set DMV Portfolio Adjusted EBITDA and Total Contract Value Revenue ("TCV Revenue") as the financial performance measures. 
For the consolidated Company, Publishing, and Marketing Services EBITDA and Marketing Services revenue financial performance metrics, the threshold, target and maximum performance ranges were 85%, 100%, and 115%, respectively, and the threshold, target and maximum bonus payout ranges were 10%, 100%, and 200% respectively. Threshold, target and maximum performance and payout ranges for the Publishing revenue component was 95%, 100%, and 105%, respectively, for performance and 10%, 100%, and 200%, respectively, for payout. For financial performance metrics for Mr. Storer, the weighting was 50% against DMV Portfolio Adjusted EBITDA results and 50% against TCV Revenue. The threshold, target and maximum performance ranges were 85%, 100%, and 200%, respectively, and the threshold, target and maximum bonus payout ranges were 50%, 100% and 200%, respectively, for DMV Portfolio Adjusted EBITDA and TCV Revenue. 
The Company believes that linking one-half of the bonus opportunity directly to financial performance, with an opportunity to earn a greater payout than target bonus amount if maximum financial performance is achieved, provides participants with significant motivation to achieve the Company's financial objectives. 
Individual objectives for Mr. Moroney and Mr. Moise were comprised of performance metrics based on a point system allocated to each objective which included threshold, target and maximum performance and payout ranges for each objective of 50%, 100%, and 150%, respectively, with payments pro-rated for performance achievement between the three points. The Company believes that, given the transitional state of the newspaper industry and the unpredictability of core advertising revenues, which directly affect EBITDA and revenue, it is important to link one-half of the bonus opportunity to individual objectives that the NEOs can directly influence, and which have a positive qualitative and quantitative impact on the Company and increase retention. In 2018, individual objectives were not established for Mr. Storer, as his annual cash incentive bonus was weighted 100% on financial performance metrics. 
Financial Performance Goals and Results for 2018.    The tables below show the financial performance goals for 2018 for each of the corresponding performance levels (threshold, target and maximum) and our actual financial performance results for 2018. Actual EBITDA results shown in the table below include adjustments for items that are excluded for purposes of bonus calculation, as management's ability to control or influence such items is limited. The adjustments include variances above or below the levels set in the 2018 financial plan approved by the Board of Directors for share-based compensation expense, newsprint pricing, pension expense, workers' compensation expense, severance costs, transaction costs, bonus expense, and certain board-approved costs associated with the reincorporation merger, the sale of the former company headquarters, the CEO transition, certain consulting expenses, and transaction due diligence expense, as well as self-insured medical expense above or below actuarial projections and other miscellaneous one-time items.

For 2018, the Board of Directors set a floor for Consolidated Company EBITDA at 70% of plan, or $5,763,000. In order for the NEO's, other than Mr. Storer, to be eligible to earn payouts on any of the financial metrics, 2018 Consolidated Company EBITDA (as adjusted) had to exceed the floor. Consolidated Company EBITDA (as adjusted) for 2018 was $4,791,000, or 58.2% of plan, and did not exceed the floor. Accordingly, our executive officers, other than Mr. Storer, did not receive any financial performance bonus amounts.

[END TABLE]
The DMV Portfolio Adjusted EBITDA results (as adjusted) did not exceed threshold level goals and resulted in an achievement of 78.0% of target. As a result, Mr. Storer did not earn a bonus based on DMV Portfolio Adjusted EBITDA. TCV Revenue exceeded threshold level goals and resulted in an achievement of 110.0% of target, and as a result, Mr. Storer earned a bonus of $165,400 based on TCV Revenue. 
Individual Objectives and Results for 2018.    In an industry that continues to experience significant challenges, the Company believes the use of individual objectives as compensation tool increases retention and drives individual performance. For 2018, Mr. Moroney worked with Mr. Moise to craft appropriate individual objectives, which were then reviewed by the Compensation Committee. These objectives are comprised of quantitative and qualitative objectives that are focused on strategic factors that create long-term shareholder value. Each objective has a performance metric based on a point system allocated to each objective which includes threshold, target, and maximum performance and payout ranges for each objective of 50%, 100%, and 150%, respectively, with payments pro-rated for performance achievement between the three points. Each specific individual objective may be weighted differently to better align with the Company's business strategies. Minimum threshold performance at 70% of consolidated EBITDA must be met before executives are entitled to bonus payout on individual objectives. Because company performance did not meet that level, our executive officers did not receive any bonus payout based upon individual objectives, except that, in connection with his retirement as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Moroney was paid at-target on his individual objectives, resulting in a payment of $255,000 on March 1, 2019. 
Summary of Annual Cash Incentive Bonus Payouts.    The following table shows the total annual cash incentive bonus award opportunity available to Mr. Moroney and Mr. Moise for 2018 for the combined individual objectives bonus and the financial performance bonus, and the total actual amount that each NEO achieved.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
In developing long-term incentive compensation recommendations for 2018, the Compensation Committee's primary focus was to balance dilution, cost and retention concerns. The Compensation Committee decided to continue granting Mr. Moroney 50% of the total long-term incentive compensation amount in the form of time-based RSUs under the ICP ("LTEI") and 50% in the form of time-based cash outside of the ICP ("LTCI"). For 2018, 33% of the total long-term incentive compensation amount for Mr. Moise was granted in the form of LTEI and 67% in the form of LTCI. For Mr. Storer, no LTCI award was granted in 2018. This LTEI compensation and LTCI compensation structure is intended to accomplish several objectives, including: (1) managing share usage and dilution to acceptable levels; (2) aligning the interests of executives with those of shareholders; (3) providing retention to key executives over a multi-year period; (4) enhancing the Company's ability to recruit executives who can further diversify sources of revenue and grow EBITDA; and (5) ensuring that the total expense incurred is consistent with the value delivered to executives. 
LTEI Compensation for 2018.    Under the terms of the ICP, each A. H. Belo executive officer is eligible to receive LTEI compensation. The terms of Mr. Storer's LTEI awards are governed by his employment agreement. These awards are designed to offer competitive compensation that encourages the retention and motivation of key executives, and rewards them based upon market-driven results. The ICP provides the Compensation Committee with discretion to require performance-based standards to be met before grants vest. According to the ICP structure, the Compensation Committee determines each executive officer's intended LTEI compensation value (other than Mr. Storer), then determines the allocation of the LTEI compensation award among three available types of equity instruments: time-based RSUs, stock options and performance-based RSUs. For 2018, the Compensation Committee elected to award the full value of LTEI compensation in the form of time-based RSUs for Mr. Moroney and Mr. Moise. Mr. Storer was awarded time-based RSUs pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement. 
Each time-based RSU represents a contingent right to receive the value of one share of A. H. Belo Series A common stock. Time-based RSUs are valued as of the date of vesting and are paid 60% in shares of A. H. Belo Series A common stock and 40% in cash. Time-based RSUs granted in 2018 vest as follows: 40% on the third trading day following the annual earnings release date for the year ending December 31, 2018; and 30% each on the third trading day following the annual earnings release date for the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2020, provided that the executive remains employed through the vesting date. 
The following table displays the grant date fair market value of the LTEIs granted in 2018 to the respective NEOs:

(2)  In addition, Mr. Moroney received 10,245 TBRSUs on August 2, 2018 in connection with his  pro-rated, non-employee director compensation, valued at $44,877 on the date of the award (see Director Compensation – Director Compensation for 2018).

 2018 Changes to Long-Term Incentive Compensation; TBRSUs 
On December 10, 2018, the holders of an aggregate of 607,553 TBRSUs of A. H. Belo, which were all of the outstanding TBRSUs granted by the Company under the Company's 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2008 Plan") and the ICP (together with the 2008 Plan, collectively, the "Plans"), entered into amendments to their award agreements with the Company agreeing to (1) accelerate the vesting of all outstanding TBRSUs granted to them by the Company effective as of December 10, 2018, (2) change the form of payment of such TBRSUs from 60% stock / 40% cash to 100% cash, (3) provide that each outstanding TBRSU will be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the closing market price of a share of Series A Common Stock of the Company on the New York Stock Exchange on December 10, 2018 and (4) provide for the payment of such TBRSUs in cash (a) within twenty (20) calendar days following the accelerated vesting date in the case of those individuals not subject to Code Section 409A and (b) on December 11, 2019 in the case of those individuals subject to Code Section 409A. As a result of the amended award agreements, the TBRSUs became vested as of the close of business on December 10, 2018 rather than the later dates when such TBRSUs would have vested in the normal course. TBRSUs granted under the Plans to executive officers typically vested as follows: 40% on the third trading day following the annual earnings release date for the year in which the TBRSU was granted; and 30% each on the third trading day following the annual earnings release date for each of the two subsequent calendar years; provided that the executive remains employed through the vesting date. These executive officer TBRSUs were paid within 10 days of vesting. TBRSUs granted under the Plans to non-employee directors typically vested on the date of the annual shareholders meeting approximately one year following the initial grant or on the next regularly scheduled shareholders meeting date for prorated awards made during a service period, and paid out on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders three years after the date of grant. Payment of TBRSUs was previously made 60% in shares of Series A Common Stock of the Company and 40% in cash. 
The accelerated TBRSUs included 25,618 TBRSUs held by Robert W. Decherd, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, 31,640 TBRSUs held by Grant S. Moise, Publisher and President, The Dallas Morning News, 97,087 TBRSUs held by Timothy M. Storer, President, Belo + Company, and 381,136 TBRSUs held by A. H. Belo's seven non-employee directors. The estimated aggregate value of the TBRSUs accelerated was approximately $2,521,345, which amount is based upon the closing price of the Series A Common Stock of the Company on December 10, 2018 of $4.15 per share. Beginning in 2019, non-employee directors will receive all-cash compensation for their annual service in the amount of $117,000. 
LTCI Compensation for 2018.    The LTCIs granted outside of the ICP in 2018 vested 50% on December 31, 2018 and the remaining 50% will vest on December 31, 2019. The following table displays the amounts of the LTCIs granted to Mr. Moroney and Mr. Moise. Mr. Storer was not awarded LTCIs under his employment agreement. Mr. Decherd opted not to be eligible to receive a 2018 LTCI award. In connection with his retirement as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Moroney was paid 100% of his 2018 LTCI and 50% of his 2017 LTCI on March 1, 2019.

Amendments to Long-Term Cash Incentive Compensation 
On December 6, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved changes to the vesting and payout schedule of time-based, long-term cash incentive compensation beginning with 2019 grants for its named executive officers. Beginning with 2019 grants, the executive officers' LTCI payments will vest over a two-year period, 50% one year from the date of grant and 50% two years from date of grant. Each tranche of these LTCI's will be paid in December of the year of vesting. LTCI payments are made outside of the ICP. The remaining one-half of the executive officers' 2017 LTCI grants were paid in December 2018. One-half of the executive officers' 2018 LTCI grants were paid in December 2018, and one-half will be paid in December 2019.  Executive Employment Agreements 
Jim Moroney retired as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer effective May 17, 2018 at which time he became Publisher Emeritus of The Dallas Morning News through August 1, 2018 at his annualized base salary of $600,000. Upon termination of employment, Mr. Moroney received a lump sum payment equal to his 2018 base salary, less actual amounts received as base salary compensation during 2018. Mr. Moroney continued to be eligible for a 2018 annual cash incentive bonus in an amount equal to 85% of his 2018 base salary, based one-half on financial performance objectives and one-half on individual objectives established by the Compensation Committee of the Board at its March 1, 2018 meeting. For the individual objective component, upon termination of employment, Mr. Moroney was entitled to an "at target" level award of $255,000. Long-term incentive compensation in the form of time-based RSUs and time-based cash remained vested and paid out on an accelerated basis in accordance with their terms. Mr. Moroney will not continue to be covered under the Change-in-Control Plan or the Severance Plan. 
Effective May 17, 2018, Robert W. Decherd became Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer with a base salary of $360,000 per year. In addition, pursuant to a letter agreement dated June 19, 2013, entered into in connection with his then retirement as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, the Company will continue to provide Robert with an executive assistant until his retirement as a director of the Company. The terms of the June 19, 2013 letter agreement remain in effect after Mr. Decherd became Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer effective May 17, 2018. 
On December 10, 2018, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Timothy M. Storer, amending and restating his five-year Employment Agreement entered into on March 2, 2017 as subsequently amended on September 6, 2017. Under the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, Mr. Storer will receive a compensation package that consists of a base salary of $461,250, with a target bonus opportunity set at $300,000, or approximately 67% of his base salary. Mr. Storer will continue to be eligible for an annual 2.5% increase in base salary beginning in 2019 if Belo + Company achieves 85% or more of the adjusted EBITDA target for the prior calendar year. 
Mr. Storer's 2017 and 2018 annual cash incentive bonus opportunities were based upon financial performance metrics of the DMV Portfolio companies. For 2017 and 2018, the financial performance metrics were weighted as follows: (i) 50% against the DMV Portfolio Adjusted EBITDA target; and (ii) 50% against the TCV Revenue target. Threshold, target and maximum performance and payout ranges for the DMV Portfolio Adjusted EBITDA and TCV Revenue were 85%, 100%, and 200%, respectively, for performance, and 50%, 100%, and 200%, respectively, for payout. 
Mr. Storer's 2019 annual cash incentive bonus opportunity will be based one-half upon financial performance metrics and one-half on individual objectives. For 2019, the financial performance metrics for Mr. Storer will be weighted as follows: (i) 50% against Belo + Company adjusted EBITDA; and (ii) 50% against total Belo + Company total revenue. Threshold, target and maximum performance ranges for the Belo + Company adjusted EBITDA component are 85%, 100%, and 115%, respectively; and the threshold, target and maximum performance ranges for Belo + Company total revenue are 95%, 100% and 105%, respectively, and for both financial performance measures, 10%, 100%, and 200%, respectively, for payout. 
Beginning in 2019, Mr. Storer is eligible annually for $200,000 in LTCI compensation. LTCI payments will vest over a two-year period, 50% one year from the date of grant and 50% two years from date of grant. Mr. Storer must remain in the continuous employment of the Company up to and through each respective vesting date in order to receive the amount vesting on such date. 
In connection with his prior Employment Agreement, Mr. Storer was eligible to receive TBRSUs in 2020 and 2021 with an annual at-target value of $500,000 per grant, provided that Mr. Storer remained employed by the Company and Belo + Company's prior year consolidated adjusted EBITDA was at least 95% of target. In consideration for the amendment and restatement of his Employment Agreement, Mr. Storer has agreed to forego these future TBRSU grants in exchange for a payment of $1 million paid on January 2, 2019. In addition, the amendment provides that Mr. Storer is eligible to participate in benefit plans afforded other executive officers of the Company, including the Severance Plan and the Change-in-Control Severance Plan.  Change in Control Arrangements and Other Agreements Upon Termination of Employment 
The following descriptions reflect the amount of compensation that would have become payable to each of the NEOs under existing arrangements if there had been a change in control or the NEO's employment had terminated on December 31, 2018, given the NEO's compensation and service levels at A. H. Belo as of such date and, if applicable, based on A. H. Belo's closing stock price on that date. As used in this section, termination means the termination of a NEO's employment with the Company due to death, disability or retirement at or after age 55 with at least seven years of service or involuntary termination without cause. These amounts are in addition to benefits that were available without regard to the occurrence of any termination of employment or change in control, including then-exercisable stock options, and benefits available generally to salaried employees. 
At December 31, 2018, the Company had an individual employment agreement with one of its named executive officers: Timothy Storer, president, Belo + Company. Mr. Storer's employment arrangement provides for certain guaranteed payments and benefits in the event of a termination of employment by the Company without Cause or by Mr. Storer for Good Reason (as each is defined under his employment agreement) prior to March 2, 2022 (the "Employment Period"). If he is terminated by the Company without Cause, Mr. Storer is entitled to (1) receive any earned and accrued but unpaid installments of base salary and benefits due to him through the date of termination and (2) participate in the Company's Severance Plan. If Mr. Storer is terminated for Good Reason, as defined in his employment agreement, Mr. Storer is eligible to receive cash severance payments equal to the base salary that would otherwise be payable to him during the Employment Period (paid pursuant to the Company's standard payroll practices over the Employment Period). 
Except as described above with respect to Mr. Storer, at December 31, 2018, the Company did not have individual written agreements with any of the NEOs that would provide guaranteed payments or benefits in the event of a termination of employment or a change in control. The actual amounts that would be paid upon a NEO's termination of employment or a change in control can be determined only at the time of any such event. Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon any such event, the actual amounts paid or distributed may be higher or lower than the amounts set forth in the table that follows. Factors that could affect these amounts include the timing during the year of such event, the Company's stock price, the level of financial performance as of the date of such event, and whether executive is of retirement age. 
Severance Plan 
The Severance Plan, an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, provides severance benefits to eligible employees, including the NEOs, following involuntary terminations of employment by the Company, including, but not limited to, reduction-in-force and re-engineering actions. The severance benefit provided under the Severance Plan for participants at or above the level of vice president is an amount equal to 1.0 week of base pay multiplied by the number of years of service, subject to a minimum benefit of 16 weeks of pay, plus six months of COBRA premiums. Severance benefits are paid in a lump sum following termination of employment and upon the execution of a release. Outplacement services also may be provided. In the event of an involuntary termination of employment by the Company, all unvested option and RSU awards are forfeited immediately and all vested options remain exercisable for one year from the date of termination. 
Change-in-Control Plan Benefits 
Under the Change-in-Control Plan ("CIC Plan"), each designated executive is eligible for certain payments upon a change in control. The circumstances that would result in a change in control under the CIC Plan include: (1) the acquisition by a person or group of 30 percent or more of the combined voting power of the Company's voting securities (excluding voting securities held by Mr. Decherd and voting securities held by any entity over which Mr. Decherd has sole or shared voting power); (2) certain changes in the membership of the Company's Board of Directors that are not approved by the incumbent directors; (3) consummation of a business combination or sale of substantially all of the Company's assets, unless immediately following such transaction the beneficial owners of shares of A. H. Belo's common stock and other securities eligible to vote immediately prior   to the transaction beneficially own more than 60 percent of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the continuing company resulting from such transaction; or (4) approval by A. H. Belo shareholders of a plan of liquidation or dissolution. In connection with any actual termination of employment, change in control or otherwise, A. H. Belo may determine to enter into or amend other agreements or arrangements that provide additional or alternative benefits that would be payable as a result of such events, as the Compensation Committee or Board determines appropriate. 
The amounts presented in the table below with respect to change in control payments are based upon the terms of the CIC Plan had there been a termination of employment in connection with a change in control on December 31, 2018. 
ICP Change in Control Benefits 
Compensation and benefits of all plan participants, which include A. H. Belo's executive officers, under the Company's ICP may also be affected by a change in control of A. H. Belo. Generally under the ICP, a change in control event means the first of the following to occur, unless the A. H. Belo Board of Directors has adopted a resolution stipulating that such event will not constitute a change in control for purposes of the ICP: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• specified changes in the majority composition of A. H. Belo's Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• specified mergers or sales or dispositions of all or substantially all of A. H. Belo's assets;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• shareholder approval of a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of A. H. Belo; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• acquisition of more than 30 percent of the combined voting power of A. H. Belo common stock.  
[END TABLE]
 Following a change in control of A. H. Belo, ICP bonuses are paid in full at the higher of target or forecasted full-year results in the year of the change in control; stock options held by ICP participants become fully-vested and are immediately exercisable; time-based RSUs vest and are payable in full immediately; and performance-based RSUs vest at the higher of target or forecasted full-year results in the year of the change in control; and all vested units are payable in full immediately. The approximate value of the severance benefits available to each of the NEOs, if there had been a termination of employment (as defined) due to death, disability or retirement, involuntary termination without cause, or had there been a termination of employment in connection with a change in control (as defined), on December 31, 2018, under the ICP, the Severance Plan or the CIC Plan, would have been as follows, based on a closing market price of $3.37 per share for A. H. Belo's Series A common stock for the year ended December 31, 2018:

(1)  In the event of a change in control, short-term, non-equity incentives (cash incentive bonuses) are  paid in a lump sum to each executive at the higher of target or actual financial performance based on current full-year forecasted results (taking into consideration actual financial performance to date). The amounts in column (c) reflect the  target bonus for each NEO. Cash bonuses are not automatically paid for executives terminating under other circumstances.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Generally, all unvested LTEIs and LTCIs are forfeited immediately in the event an executive is terminated with or without cause or  voluntarily resigns; however, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to accelerate the vesting of these awards in the case of involuntary severance without cause. At December 31, 2018, in the event of a change in control or an  executive's retirement after age 55 with at least seven years of service, qualification for long-term disability, or death, vesting of all LTEIs and LTCIs is accelerated and payment is made as soon as practicable but no earlier than allowable  under Section 409A of the Code. On December 10, 2018, all time-based RSUs held by officers and directors were accelerated and converted to  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     cash. Under the requirements of 409A, Mr. Decherd's payment is delayed and will be made on December 11, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  As of December 31, 2018, a multiple of 2.0 applied to the Chief Executive Officer and a multiple of 1.5 applied to each of the other  NEO's payments under the CIC Plan had a termination of employment in connection with a change in control occurred. This multiple is used to determine the total cash payment to be awarded to each executive, and is applied to the sum of the  following components: (1) base salary in effect at the time of the change in control; (2) higher of the current target bonus in effect prior to the change in control or the average of the last three years' bonus payments;  (3) employer-provided contributions to the A. H. Belo Savings Plan for the current year; and (4) employer cost of medical and dental benefits in excess of employee premiums. In addition to this change in control amount, the employee is  also eligible for outplacement services valued at no more than $25,000, plus reimbursement for any legal fees incurred to enforce the participant's rights under the plan. For each executive, the assumptions for outplacement costs and legal fees  in the table above were $25,000 and $0, respectively. To the extent the cash payment exceeds three times the employee's average taxable compensation earned during the five years preceding the year of the change in control, excise taxes will be  assessed. Of the officers listed above, only Mr. Moise would have been entitled to a gross-up payment.

 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Director Compensation for 2018 
Non-employee directors receive compensation for their Board and committee service. Mr. Moroney became eligible to receive compensation as a non-employee director effective August 2, 2018, prorated for his term of service. Mr. Decherd became Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer effective May 17, 2018 and is no longer eligible to receive compensation as a non-employee director. Based on recommendations from the Compensation Committee, the Board determines the amount of non-employee director compensation each year and designates the manner in which it is paid. An annual retainer is paid on the date of the Company's annual meeting of shareholders for service through the date of the next annual meeting. Non-employee directors who are initially elected at a time other than at an annual meeting of shareholders receive a proportionate share of compensation relative to the service provided during an ordinary term of service. During 2018, non-employee directors on the A. H. Belo Board received an annual retainer package with a nominal value of $117,000. The annual retainer was for the 2018-2019 term of service beginning June 6, 2018, the date of the Company's 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, through May 9, 2019, the date of the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. One-half of the Board's annual retainer was paid in cash and the remaining one-half was paid in the form of time-based RSUs for A. H. Belo Series A Common Stock. The number of time-based RSUs was determined based on the closing market price of A. H. Belo Series A common stock on the date of the award. Annual awards for 2018-2019 were made on June 6, 2018. On December 10, 2018, all outstanding director RSU awards were accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and will be paid on December 11, 2019. Beginning with the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, directors will receive an annual cash retainer package of $117,000. 
A. H. Belo directors who served as committee chairs in 2018 received an additional $10,000 in cash. The Company's lead director received an additional $20,000 in cash. A. H. Belo reimburses directors for travel expenses incurred in attending meetings. No additional fee is paid to directors for attendance at Board and committee meetings. 
The following table sets forth compensation for each A. H. Belo non-employee director for service as a director during the year ended December 31, 2018:

Board Composition & Qualifications 
Majority Voting in the Election of Directors; Director Resignation Policy 
If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director does not receive the vote of at least a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, the director will promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. For purposes of this Corporate Governance Guideline, a majority of votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election. Votes cast include votes to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions with respect to that director's election. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or the decision of the Board with respect to his or her offer to resign.

A majority of the directors comprising the Board shall be independent directors.

The Board may determine that a director or nominee is "independent" even if the director or nominee does not meet each of the standards set forth in paragraphs (7) through (10) above as long as the Board determines that such person is independent of management and free from any relationship that in the judgment of the Board would interfere with such person's independent judgment as a member of the Board and the basis for such determination is disclosed in A. H. Belo's annual proxy statement. 
In addition, a director is not considered independent for purposes of serving on the Audit Committee, and may not serve on that committee, if the director: (1) receives, either directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from A. H.

H. Belo; or (2) is "an affiliated person" of A. H. Belo Corporation or any of its subsidiaries; each as determined in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. 
In determining whether a director is considered independent for purposes of serving on the Compensation Committee, the Board must consider all factors relevant to determining whether the director has a relationship to A. H. Belo that is material to the director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a Compensation Committee member, including: (1) the source of the director's compensation, including any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from A. H. Belo; and (2) whether the director is affiliated with A. H. Belo, any of its subsidiaries, or an affiliate of any of its subsidiaries. 
For purposes of this Attachment A, an "immediate family member" means a person's spouse, parents, children, siblings, mother and father-in-law, sons and daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters-in-law, and anyone (other than domestic employees) who shares such person's home.

The annual meeting will be held for the purpose of electing directors, ratifying the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and considering any other matters that properly may come before the meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the meeting. 
Directions to the Trustee 
Only Fidelity Management Trust Company, as the trustee of the Savings Plan ("Fidelity"), can vote the shares of A. H. Belo stock held by the Savings Plan. However, under the terms of your plan, you are entitled to instruct Fidelity how to vote the shares of A. H. Belo stock that were allocated to your plan account at the close of business on the Record Date. Voting instructions with respect to shares held in the Savings Plan must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 7, 2019, and may not be provided at the meeting. 
The Notice you received includes instructions on how to access the proxy materials and how to provide your voting instructions to Fidelity via the Internet. It also provides information on how to request a printed set of the proxy materials, including a voting instruction card. Your participation is important and your vote is confidential. Please take the time to vote your plan shares via the Internet using the instructions included in the Notice, by using the toll-free telephone number provided in the proxy materials, or, if you opt to receive paper copies, by completing the voting instruction card and returning it in the envelope provided. 
With respect to the Savings Plan, Fidelity will vote all A. H. Belo shares held by the plan in accordance with the voting instructions that are received via mail, telephone, or Internet on or before May 7, 2019 from participants in the plan, unless Fidelity determines such instructions are contrary to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). If you sign, date and return a paper voting instruction card but do not check any boxes on the card, then Fidelity will vote your plan shares FOR all nominees standing for election as directors and FOR ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, at its discretion, Fidelity is authorized to vote on any other matter that properly may come before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting. 
Confidentiality and Instructions 
Your voting instructions to Fidelity are strictly confidential and will not be revealed, directly or indirectly, to any director, officer, or other employee of A. H. Belo or to anyone else, except as otherwise required by law. Therefore, you should feel completely free to instruct Fidelity to vote your plan shares in the manner you think best. 
Voting Deadline 
Because of the time required to tabulate voting instructions from participants before the annual meeting, Fidelity must establish a cut-off date for receipt of voting instructions. The cut-off date is May 7, 2019, and therefore it is important that you act promptly to vote your plan shares on or before that date. Voting instructions received by Fidelity after the cut-off date will not be tabulated. If Fidelity does not receive timely instructions from you with respect to your plan shares, Fidelity will vote your shares in the same proportion as the shares for which voting instructions have been received from other participants in the Savings Plan. 
Further Information 
If you are a direct shareholder of A. H. Belo, please note that you must vote your directly-owned shares and your plan shares separately. You may not use the card or the voter identification information with respect to your directly-owned shares to vote your plan shares. Your direct vote of non-plan shares is not confidential. 
If you have questions regarding the information provided to you, you may contact the plan administrator at (800) 835-5098 between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Central Time, Monday through Friday. 
Your ability to instruct Fidelity how to vote your plan shares is an important part of your rights as a participant. Please consider the proxy materials carefully and provide your voting instructions to us promptly.
