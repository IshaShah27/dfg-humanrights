In such a case, the stockholder would be required to sign the proxy card and deliver it to the person named as his or her proxy, and that person would be required to be present and vote at the Annual Meeting. Any proxy card so marked should not be mailed to the Company.
If you return a signed proxy card without having specified any choices, Mr. Juneau, named as proxy, will vote the shares represented at the Annual Meeting and any adjournment thereof as follows:

Our executive officers and directors who own shares of Common Stock have advised us that they intend to vote their shares in favor of the proposals presented in this Proxy Statement. As of the close of business on the Record Date, 6,172,779 shares of Company common stock were issued and outstanding, approximately 14.4% of which were owned and entitled to be voted by CORE's executive officers and directors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   A:   Election of directors requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting.  All other proposals require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy entitled to vote thereon.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   A:   Presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by all record holders of Common Stock will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a quorum is not present, the Annual Meeting may be adjourned from time to time until a quorum is obtained.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   A:   Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business. A broker non-vote occurs when a nominee holding shares of Common Stock for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Abstentions are counted in tabulations of the votes cast on proposals presented to stockholders as a vote against, whereas broker non-votes are not counted for purposes of determining whether a proposal has been approved.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

Stockholders may contact any member (or all members) of the Board or the independent directors as a group, any committee of our Board or any chair of any such committee by mail. Correspondence may be addressed to any individual director by name, to the independent directors as a group or to any chair of any committee either by name or title. Mail will not be opened but will be forwarded to the Chairman of the Audit Committee or the named independent director. Mail addressed to the Board will be delivered to Brad Juneau, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Juneau is not an independent director.  
[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL 1ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
At the Annual Meeting, we will present the nominees named below and recommend that they be elected to serve as directors until the next annual stockholders meeting or until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Each nominee has consented to being named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected.
Your proxy will be voted for the election of the four nominees named below unless you give instructions to the contrary. Your proxy cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named.
Nominees
Presented below is a description of certain biographical information, occupations and business experience for the past five years of each person nominated to become a director. Four directors are to be elected at the Annual Meeting. All nominees are current directors standing for reelection to the Board.  If any nominee should become unavailable for election, your proxy may be voted for a substitute nominee selected by the Board, or the Board's size may be reduced accordingly. The Board is unaware of any circumstances likely to render any nominee unavailable. Directors of the Company hold office until the next annual stockholders meeting, until successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier resignation or removal.  Each nominee other than Mr. Juneau is an independent director.
On September 15, 2010, the Company's Board established a Nominating Committee to recommend nominees for director to the Board and to insure that such nominees possess the director qualifications set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. Additionally, the Nominating Committee reviews the qualifications of existing Board members before they are nominated for re-election to the Board. Once nominees are selected, the Board determines which nominees are presented to the Company's stockholders for final approval.
The Board will also consider nominees recommended by stockholders. The Company's Bylaws contain provisions that address the process by which a stockholder may nominate an individual to stand for election to the Board at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The procedures include a requirement that notices regarding a person's nomination be received in writing from the stockholder and by the Company's Secretary not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. Moreover, the notice must include such nominee's written consent to be named in the Company's Proxy Statement and to serve if elected. Supporting information should include (a) the name and address of the candidate and the proposing stockholder, (b) a comprehensive biography of the candidate and an explanation of why the candidate is qualified to serve as a director taking into account the criteria identified in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and (c) proof of ownership, the class and number of shares, and the length of time that the shares of our common stock have been beneficially owned by each of the candidate and the proposing stockholder. Minimum qualifications include extensive business experience, a solid understanding of financial statements and a reputation for integrity. Each nominee below has been recommended by the Nominating Committee.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
We believe that good corporate governance is important to assure that the Company is managed for the long term benefit of its stockholders. The Board and management of the Company are committed to good business practices, transparency in financial reporting and the highest level of corporate governance and ethics. The Board has specifically reviewed the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and applicable listing standards and rules to maintain its standards of good corporate governance.
The Board has reaffirmed existing policies and initiated actions adopting policies consistent with new rules and listing standards. In particular, we have:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Established an Audit Committee consisting solely of independent directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adopted a formal Audit Committee Charter in September 2010, a copy of which is available on the Company's website at www.contangoore.com.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Empowered the Audit Committee to engage independent auditors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provided the Audit Committee with access to independent auditors and legal counsel.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adopted a Code of Ethics that satisfies the definition of "code of ethics" under the rules and regulations of the SEC, a copy of which is available on the Company's website. The Code of Ethics applies to all of the Company's executives, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adopted a formal whistleblower protection policy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adopted a formal process for stockholders to communicate with the independent directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adopted a formal Nominating Committee Charter in September 2010, a copy of which is available on the Company's website at www.contangoore.com.  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adopted a formal Compensation Committee Charter in September 2010, a copy of which is available on the Company's website at www.contangoore.com.  
[END TABLE]
Independence.  Although the Company is not subject to the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") listing requirements, the Company evaluates the independence of its directors using the NYSE listing standards.  After reviewing the qualifications of our current directors and nominees, and any relationships they may have with the Company that might affect their independence, the Board has determined that each director and nominee, other than Mr. Juneau, is "independent" as that concept is defined by the listing standards of the NYSE and the applicable rules of the SEC. Mr. Juneau is an executive officer of the Company and, therefore, the Board has concluded that Mr. Juneau is not an independent director.
Corporate Authority & Responsibility. All corporate authority resides in the Board, as the representative of the stockholders. Authority is delegated to management by the Board in order to implement the Company's mission pursuant to Delaware law and our bylaws. Such delegated authority includes the authorization of spending limits and the authority to hire executives and terminate their services. The independent members of the Board retain responsibility for selection, evaluation and the determination of compensation of the chief executive officer of the Company, oversight of the succession plan, approval of the annual budget, assurance of adequate systems, procedures and controls, and all matters of corporate governance. Members of the Board are kept informed of the Company's business through discussions with Mr. Juneau and with key members of senior management, by reviewing materials provided to them and by participating in Board and committee meetings. Each Board member other than Mr. Juneau is independent. Additionally, the Board provides advice and counsel to senior management.
Compensation of Directors. None of the Board members has received cash compensation since the founding of the Company. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, each outside director of the Company received 25,000 shares of restricted Common Stock that vest in January 2020. There were no other payments for meetings attended or service as chair of a committee. Compensation of directors is determined by Mr. Juneau and the independent directors. Directors who are also executives of the Company do not receive compensation for serving as a director or as a member of a committee of the Board. All directors are reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with serving as a member of the Board.
Director Compensation Table. The following table sets forth the compensation paid by the Company to non-employee directors for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018:

There were no actual forfeitures of non-executive director restricted stock awards in fiscal year 2018. These restricted stock awards were granted in December 2015, November 2016, and November 2017.  Of the restricted stock awards granted in December 2015, one-third of the shares vested on the date the shares were granted; one-third vested in December 2016; and one-third vested in December 2017.  Of the restricted stock awards granted in November 2016, all of the shares will vest in January 2019.

[END TABLE]
Board Size. We believe smaller to mid-size boards are more cohesive, work better together and tend to be more effective monitors than larger boards. Our Bylaws currently provide for at least three and not more than seven directors.
Annual Election of Directors. In order to create greater alignment between the Board's and our stockholders' interests and to promote greater accountability to the stockholders, directors are elected annually.
Meetings. Our Board has meetings, as necessary. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Board held nine meetings. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Board did not pass any resolutions by unanimous written consent. All of our Board members attended 100% of all Board and applicable committee meetings and the Company's 2017 annual meeting. We encourage our Board to attend our annual meeting of stockholders.
Committee Structure. It is the general policy of the Company that the Board as a whole will consider all major decisions. The committee structure of the Board includes the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating Committee. The Board may form other committees as it determines appropriate. A copy of the charter for each committee is available to any stockholder who requests a copy by delivering written notice to Contango ORE, Inc., 3700 Buffalo Speedway, Suite 925, Houston, Texas 77098. The charter for each committee is also available on our website at www.contangoore.com.
Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee was established by the Board for the purpose of overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company and audits of the financial statements of the Company. The Audit Committee recommends the appointment of independent public accountants to conduct audits of our financial statements, reviews with the accountants our quarterly and annual financial statements and the plan and results of the auditing engagement, approves other professional services provided by the accountants and evaluates the independence of the accountants. The Audit Committee also reviews the scope and adequacy of our system of internal controls and procedures over financial reporting and oversees compliance with our Code of Ethics. Members of the Audit Committee are Messrs. Compofelice (Committee Chairman), Greenberg, and Shortz. Each member of the Audit Committee is independent, as independence for audit committee members is defined in the listing standards of the NYSE and the applicable rules of the SEC. The Audit Committee met formally four times during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The Board has determined that Mr. Compofelice is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the rules of the SEC.
Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee was created by the Board for the purpose of administering the Equity Plan and the compensation for the Chief Executive Officer. Additionally, the Compensation Committee determines which executive officers and other executives may receive stock options, stock units, stock awards, stock appreciation rights and other stock based awards and the amounts of such stock based awards. Members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Shortz (Committee Chairman), Compofelice, and Greenberg. Each member of the Compensation Committee is an "independent director" as defined in the applicable listing standards of the NYSE and in the applicable rules of the SEC.  For a description of the Compensation Committee's processes and procedures, see the section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below.  The Compensation Committee met formally two times during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee was created by the Board for the purpose of overseeing the identification, evaluation and selection of qualified candidates for appointment or election to the Board. The Nominating Committee identifies individuals qualified to become Board members and recommends to the Board nominees for election as directors of the Company, taking into account that the Board as a whole shall have competency in industry knowledge, accounting and finance, and business judgment. While the Company does not have a formal diversity policy, the Nominating Committee seeks members from diverse backgrounds so that the Board consists of members with a broad spectrum of experience and expertise and with a reputation for integrity. Directors should have experience in positions with a high degree of responsibility, be leaders in the companies or institutions with which they are affiliated, and be selected based upon contributions that they can make to the Company. The Nominating Committee shall give the same consideration to candidates for director nominees recommended by Company stockholders as those candidates recommended by others. Members of the Nominating Committee are Messrs. Greenberg (Committee Chairman), Compofelice, and Shortz. Each member of the Nominating Committee is independent as independence for nominating committee members is defined in the applicable listing standards of the NYSE and the applicable rules of the SEC. The Nominating Committee met formally once during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
Board Leadership Structure. The Board has elected Mr. Juneau as both Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for a number of reasons. Mr. Juneau is a co-founder of the Company and, through JEX, initially acquired the property leased from the Village of Tetlin, which is the primary asset of Peak Gold, LLC (the "Joint Venture Company"), which in turn is the primary asset of the Company.  Furthermore, we believe that the advantages of having a single Chief Executive Officer and Chairman with extensive knowledge of our Company outweigh potential disadvantages. The Board has chosen the combined CEO and Chairman role because it provides an effective balance between management of the Company and non-employee director participation in our Board process and because of Mr. Juneau's knowledge of and experience in our operations.
Risk Oversight. We administer our risk oversight function through our Audit Committee and our Compensation Committee as well as through our Board as a whole. Our Audit Committee is empowered to appoint and oversee our independent registered public accounting firm, monitor the integrity of our financial reporting processes and systems of internal controls and provide an avenue of communication among our independent auditors, management, our internal auditing department and our Board. Our Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks related to our compensation arrangements.
More information about the Company's corporate governance practices and procedures is available on the Company's website at www.contangoore.com.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF THE FOUR NOMINEES AS DIRECTORS OF CORE, TO SERVE UNTIL THE NEXT ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS OR UNTIL THEIR SUCCESSORS ARE DULY ELECTED AND QUALIFIED.
PROPOSAL 2      RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF OUR AUDITORS
The Board has appointed Moss Adams LLP ("Moss Adams"), independent public accountants, for the examination of the accounts and audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. At the Annual Meeting, the Board will present a proposal to the stockholders to approve and ratify the engagement of Moss Adams. The Board expects that representatives of Moss Adams will be present and will have the opportunity to make a statement, if they desire, and to respond to appropriate questions. The Audit Committee will consider the failure to ratify its selection of Moss Adams as independent public accountants as a direction to select other auditors for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.
Effective November 16, 2017, Hein & Associates LLP ("Hein"), the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company, combined with Moss Adams. As a result of this transaction, on November 16, 2017, Hein effectively resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company. Concurrent with such resignation, the Audit Committee of the Board of the Company approved the engagement of Moss Adams as the new independent registered public accounting firm for the Company.
During the Company's two most recent fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, and through the date hereof, there were (i) no disagreements with Moss Adams or Hein on any matter of GAAP or practices, financial statement disclosures, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Moss Adams or Hein would have caused Moss Adams or Hein to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports, and (ii) no events of the type listed in paragraphs (A) through (D) of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
During the Company's two most recent fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, and through the date hereof, neither the Company, nor anyone on its behalf, has consulted Moss Adams or Hein with respect to (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to the Company nor oral advice was provided to the Company that Moss Adams or Hein concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
Fees
Aggregate fees for professional services rendered to us by Moss Adams and Hein, the Company's independent public accountants, for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, were:
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Year Ended June 30,    
 Category of Service     2018       2017    
 Audit Fees - Moss Adams    $ 63,800     $ —

 Tax Fees      —       —   
 All Other Fees      —       —   
[END TABLE]
The Audit Fees for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 were for professional services rendered in connection with the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, issuance of consents, quarterly reviews and assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC.
There are no other fees for services rendered to us by Moss Adams or Hein. Moss Adams and Hein did not provide to us any financial information systems design or implementation services during fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 or June 30, 2017.
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
All of the 2018 audit services provided by Moss Adams and Hein were approved by the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee has established pre-approval policies and procedures related to the provision of audit and non-audit services. Under these procedures, the Audit Committee selects and appoints outside auditors, considers the independence and effectiveness of the outside auditors, approves the fees and other compensation to be paid to the outside auditors and is responsible for oversight of the outside auditors and reviews any revisions to the estimates of audit and non-audit fees initially approved. The Audit Committee's procedures prohibit the independent auditor from providing any non-audit services unless the service is permitted under applicable law and is pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee receives the written disclosures required by generally accepted auditing standards. The Audit Committee annually requires the outside auditors to provide the Audit Committee with a written statement delineating all relationships between the outside auditors and the Company. The Audit Committee actively engages in a dialogue with the outside auditors with respect to any disclosed relationships or services that may impact the objectivity and independence of the outside auditors. The Audit Committee recommends that the Board of Directors take appropriate action in response to the outside auditors' report to satisfy itself of the outside auditors' independence. The scope of services and fees are required to be compatible with the maintenance of the accounting firm's independence, including compliance with SEC rules and regulations.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE 
SELECTION OF MOSS ADAMS LLP AS INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS.
PROPOSAL 3
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Introduction
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") requires that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement and to express their views on such compensation. We welcome the opportunity to give our stockholders an opportunity to vote on executive compensation at the Annual Meeting. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the named executive officers and our philosophy, policies and practices as described in this Proxy Statement. We currently conduct annual advisory votes on executive compensation, and we expect to conduct the next advisory vote on executive compensation at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
We recognize that executive compensation is an important matter for our stockholders. Stockholders are encouraged to read the "Executive Compensation" section of this Proxy Statement, which discusses in detail how our compensation policies and procedures implement our compensation philosophy.
Text of the Resolution to be Adopted
As a matter of good corporate governance and in accordance with Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Board is asking stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Contango ORE, Inc. (the "Company") approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Executive Compensation section, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of the Stockholders of the Company."
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on the Board or the Compensation Committee. Although the vote is non-binding, the Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders, and will carefully consider the outcome of the vote in its ongoing evaluation of the Company's executive compensation program and when making future compensation decisions for executive officers. In particular, to the extent there is any significant vote against the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our stockholders' concerns and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" 
THE APPROVAL, ON A NON-BINDING, ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
This section of the Proxy Statement describes and analyzes our executive compensation philosophy and program in the context of the compensation paid during the last fiscal year to our named part-time executive officers.
Overview of 2018 fiscal year Performance and Compensation. We are engaged in the exploration in the State of Alaska for gold ore and associated minerals. Following the establishment of our Joint Venture Company with an affiliate of Royal Gold, Inc. ("Royal Gold") in January, 2015, the Joint Venture Company continued the drilling program initiated by the Company at the Tetlin gold project in Alaska. The Joint Venture Company has expended approximately $34.1 million through June 30, 2018 in connection with the Tetlin gold project to delineate and expand upon the original Peak zone discovery by the Company. The work program has included expansion of the Peak zone and the discovery and expansion of the North Peak, Connector and West Peak target areas resulting in significant new mineral resources.  Through June 30, 2018, Royal Gold has contributed $31.7 million to the Joint Venture Company and earned a 40.0% economic interest in the Joint Venture Company.
Philosophy. The Company is an exploration stage organization without any source of revenue. We currently have three part-time executives who are employees of JEX. The Company has not historically paid cash salaries or other benefits to these executives. The Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Board in October 2016 adopted and approved a new management and compensation system effective October 1, 2016. The Company entered into a Management Services Agreement with JEX, which is owned by Brad Juneau and his affiliates. Under the Management Services Agreement, JEX will manage the business and affairs of the Company and its interest in the Joint Venture Company, subject to the direction of the Board, including corporate finance, accounting, budget, SEC reporting, risk management, operations and stockholder relation functions of the Company for an initial term of one year for a monthly fee of $32,000 which includes an allocation of $6,900 for office space and equipment. No part of the fee will be allocated for compensation of Brad Juneau who will be compensated separately as determined in the sole discretion of the independent directors of the Company. JEX will also be reimbursed for its reasonable and necessary costs and expenses of third parties incurred for the Company. In addition, executives of the Company may be granted restricted stock, stock options or other forms of compensation by the Board of the Company. The Company has adopted this management and compensation program because employees of JEX have historically spent significant time and effort in managing and administering the affairs of the Company. While the Company remains a small exploratory stage entity whose shares are publicly traded, the successful drilling program of the Joint Venture Company has required a significant additional allocation of time and effort to the business and affairs of the Company by the three part time executives. The amount of time and expertise required to effectively manage and administer the business and affairs of the Company will continue to be monitored by the Board for necessary adjustments or modifications depending upon the amount of time required to be spent on the business and affairs of the Company by the executives and the progress of the Joint Venture Company in its exploratory programs in Alaska.
Objectives. We compete with a variety of companies and organizations to hire and retain individual talent. As a result, the primary goal of our compensation program is to help us attract, motivate and retain the best people possible. We implement this philosophy by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• encouraging, recognizing and rewarding outstanding performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recognizing and rewarding individuals for their experience, expertise, level of responsibility, leadership, individual accomplishment and other contributions to us; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recognizing and rewarding individuals for work that helps increase our value.  
[END TABLE]
We use executive compensation to align our executive officers' goals with our mission, business strategy, values and culture.
Market Compensation Data. The Company has selected a list of four peer companies (the "Peer Group"), all of which are very small companies in the mining industry. These companies share relevant business risk and financial factors such as revenue, market capital, net income, and total assets. Companies similar in size but in unrelated industries are not included because the Company typically does not hire executives from such companies, nor would the Company be likely to lose executives to such companies:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ATAC Resources Ltd.  
• Corvus Gold  
• Sabina Gold & Silver Corp.  
[END TABLE]
Components of Senior Executive Compensation. Historically, the primary element of annual compensation for executives of the Company has been the granting of equity awards in the form of restricted stock and stock options. Compensation for each executive is designed to align the executive's incentives with the long-term interests of the Company's stockholders. The Company only has three part-time executives and as a result, our executives are required to manage a number of different responsibilities and projects. The Company predominantly grants equity awards to create incentives for future performance. Executives receive equity awards to align their interests with our stockholders' interests and for working toward the long-term success of the Company.
Equity Awards.  The Company has implemented an equity compensation program for its executive officers (and other persons) that provides an incentive for such officers to achieve the Company's business objectives. The Company's equity compensation program includes two forms of long-term incentives: restricted stock and stock options. Award size and frequency are based on each executive's demonstrated level of performance and Company performance over time. All awards are made by the Compensation Committee.  At our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, we presented stockholders with a vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation paid to our named executive officers as disclosed in the "Executive Compensation" section of our proxy statement.  The vast majority of the votes cast on the proposal voted in favor of the proposal. We believe this strongly affirms stockholders' support of our approach to executive compensation, and we did not make any material changes to our program solely due to the advisory vote received. The Compensation Committee reviews award levels from time to time but at least annually. In making individual awards, the Compensation Committee considers industry practices, the performance of each executive, the performance of the Company, the value of the executive's previous awards and the Company's views on executive retention and succession. On September 18, 2015, the Company granted to Mr. Juneau and Ms. Gaines 45,000 and 20,000 shares of restricted Common Stock, respectfully. Mr. Juneau's shares vested over two years, beginning with one-third vesting on the date of grant. One-third of Ms. Gaines's shares vested on the date of grant, one-third vested on the anniversary date of the grant, and one-third will vest in January 2019. On August 24, 2016, the Company granted 80,000 and 10,000 shares of restricted Common Stock to Mr. Juneau and Ms. Gaines, respectfully. Mr. Juneau's shares vested over two years, beginning with one third vesting on the date of grant. Ms. Gaines's shares will vest in January 2019.  On November 14, 2017, the Company granted 50,000 and 15,000 shares of restricted Common Stock to Mr. Juneau and Ms. Gaines, respectfully. Mr. Juneau's and Ms. Gaines's shares will vest in January 2020. 
As of the Record Date, the Company had 6,172,779 million fully diluted shares.
Equity Award Mechanics. On September 15, 2010, the Board adopted the Equity Plan, which was amended and restated at the 2017 Annual Meeting. Awards typically fall into two categories: annual awards and new hire and promotion awards. New hire and promotion awards are made on the date of hire or promotion, and annual awards are made annually in connection with the end of the fiscal year. From time to time the Board may make grants at other times in connection with executive retention.
All stock option awards have a per share exercise price equal to the closing price of our Common Stock on the grant date. Stock option awards and restricted stock awards vest upon the passage of time. The Board has not granted, nor does it intend in the future to grant, equity awards in anticipation of the release of material nonpublic information. Similarly, the Company has not timed, nor does it intend in the future to time, the release of material nonpublic information based upon equity award grant dates.
Deferred Compensation and Retirement Plans. The Company does not have a deferred compensation program, pension benefits, a retirement plan, or any sort of post-retirement healthcare plan.
Perquisites and Other Benefits. The Company does not have any perquisites or employee benefit plans, such as medical, dental, group life and disability insurance.
Employment and Severance Agreements. We have no employment or severance agreement with any executive officer.
Compensation Risk Management. The Compensation Committee considers, in establishing and reviewing our executive compensation program, whether the program encourages unnecessary or excessive risk taking and has concluded that it does not. None of our officers has received cash compensation since the founding of the Company. The Compensation Committee believes that our compensations program appropriately balances risk and the desire to focus executives on specific goals important to the Company's success, and that it does not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking. In addition, the Compensation Committee believes that our compensation program provides an appropriate balance between the goals of increasing the price of our Common Stock and avoiding risks that could threaten our growth and stability.
Other Compensation Arrangements. Mr. Juneau was appointed the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company in August 2012 and in April 2013, Mr. Juneau was elected Chairman of our Board. Mr. Juneau is the sole manager of the general partner of JEX which has entered into a number of agreements and arrangements with the Company, including the Management Services Agreement. These agreements and arrangements are described under "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" and have been approved by the Audit Committee of the Company.

Options may be granted to executives, consultants and non-executives directors. Incentive stock options may be granted only to executives of the Company or its subsidiaries. Non-qualified stock options may be granted to executives, consultants or non-executive directors. The Compensation Committee shall determine the term of options granted to participants under the Equity Plan but, in any event, all options must be exercised no later than ten years from the issue date. All options may only be exercised while a participant is employed as an employee or providing services as a consultant or non-employee director. Restricted stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated until the end of the applicable period of restriction established by the Compensation Committee and specified in the award agreement granting the restricted stock.
In making the decision to make additional grants and/or awards, the Compensation Committee would consider factors such as the size of previous grants/awards and the number of stock options and shares of stock already held and the degree to which increasing that ownership stake would provide the additional incentives for future performance, the likelihood that the grants/awards would encourage the executive officer to remain with the Company and the value of the executive's service to the Company.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934 requires our officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of our Common Stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. These persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based on our review of the copies of such reports, we believe that all such reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act were in compliance with such filing requirements during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, except that the Form 4 filed by Scott J Reiman and Hexagon, LLC on December 15, 2017 reported two late transactions, and the Form 4 filed by Leah Gaines on October 3, 2018 reported two late transactions.  Each filing was made promptly after the issue was discovered.
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
On October 23, 2017, the Company completed the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 553,672 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company at a purchase price of $19.00 per share of common stock, in a private placement to certain purchasers pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of October 23, 2017, by and among the Company and each Purchaser named therein.  Brad Juneau, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, purchased 13,200 shares of common stock, at an aggregate purchase price of $250,800, in the Private Placement on the same terms and conditions as all other Purchasers. 
In March 2013, the Company completed the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 1,230,999 units ("Units") at a price of $12.00 per Unit with each Unit consisting of (i) one share of Common Stock and (ii) a five-year warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock at $10.00 per share, in a private placement for total proceeds of approximately $14.1 million.  Both Mr. Peak, our then Chairman, and Mr. Juneau, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, invested in the private placement. See "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" for more information regarding the Estate of Mr. Peak and Mr. Juneau's respective holdings.  In September 2016, the Company distributed a Private Placement Memorandum to its warrant holders to give them the opportunity to exercise their warrants at a reduced exercise price and receive shares of Common Stock by paying the reduced exercise price in cash and surrendering the original warrants.  The offering applied to warrant holders with an exercise price of $10.00 per share originally issued in March 2013. The offering gave the warrant holders the opportunity to exercise the warrants for $9.00 per share. The offer expired on November 15, 2016. In conjunction with the offering, a total of 587,500 warrants were exercised resulting in total cash to the Company of $5.3 million. Of the total warrants exercised, 83,334 were exercised by entities controlled by Mr. Brad Juneau, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer for a total of $750,006. 
In August 2012, Mr. Juneau was elected President, Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company and in April 2013, Mr. Juneau was also elected Chairman of the Board. Mr. Juneau is the sole manager of the general partner of JEX. JEX entered into a Mineral Lease dated effective July 15, 2008 covering approximately 675,000 acres (the "Tetlin Lease") with the Tribe of Tetlin, also known as the Tetlin Village Council, an Alaska Native Tribe, and acquired certain State of Alaska Mining Claims prospective for gold and related minerals covering approximately 18,560 acres (the "Tetlin Claims").
Contango Mining Company ("Contango Mining"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Contango Oil & Gas Company ("Contango"), was formed in October 2009 for the purpose of engaging in exploration in the State of Alaska for (i) gold ore and associated minerals and (ii) rare earth elements. Contango Mining initially acquired a 50% interest in the Tetlin Claims in Alaska from JEX in exchange for $1 million and a 1% overriding royalty interest ("ORRI") in the properties under a Joint Exploration Agreement (the "Joint Exploration Agreement"). We believe JEX expended approximately $1 million on exploratory activities and related work on the properties prior to selling the initial 50% interest to Contango Mining. Contango Mining also agreed to fund the next $2 million of exploration costs. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, Contango Mining paid JEX approximately $0.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively, for exploration costs incurred by JEX in the State of Alaska.
The Company previously subleased office space from JEX at 3700 Buffalo Speedway, Suite 925, Houston, TX 77098 for approximately $13,800 per fiscal quarter. The sublease was terminated as of September 30, 2016 pursuant to the Management Services Agreement.
In September 2016, the Company and JEX entered into a Management Services Agreement effective October 1, 2016. Under the Management Services Agreement, JEX will manage the business and affairs of the Company and its interest in the Joint Venture Company, subject to the direction of the Board, including corporate finance, accounting, budget, SEC reporting, risk management, operations and stockholder relation functions of the Company for an initial term of one year for a monthly fee of $32,000 which includes an allocation of approximately $6,900 for office space and equipment. No part of the fee will be allocated for compensation of Brad Juneau who will be compensated separately as determined in the sole discretion of the independent directors of the Company. JEX will also be reimbursed for its reasonable and necessary costs and expenses of third parties incurred for the Company. In addition, executives of JEX may be granted restricted stock, stock options or other forms of compensation by the independent directors of the Company. The Company has adopted this management and compensation program because employees of JEX have historically spent significant time and effort in managing and administering the affairs of the Company. While the Company remains a small exploratory stage entity whose shares are publicly traded, the successful drilling program of the Joint Venture Company has required a significant additional allocation of time and effort to the business and affairs of the Company by the three part time executives, two of whom are officers of the Company. The amount of time and expertise required to effectively manage and administer the business and affairs of the Company will continue to be monitored by the Board for necessary adjustments or modifications depending upon the amount of time required to be spent on the business and affairs of the Company by the executives and the progress of the Joint Venture Company in its exploratory programs in Alaska.
Related Person Transaction Policies and Procedures
The Company has instituted written policies and procedures for the review, approval and ratification of "related person" transactions as defined under SEC rules and regulations. Our Audit Committee Charter requires management to inform the Audit Committee of all related person transactions. Examples of the type of transactions the Audit Committee reviews include payments made by the Company directly to a related person (other than in his or her capacity as a director or employee), or to an entity in which the related person serves as an officer, director, employee or owner, and any other transaction where a potential conflict of interest exists. In order to identify any such transactions, among other measures, the Company requires its directors and officers to complete questionnaires identifying transactions with any company in which the officer or director or their family members may have an interest. In addition, our Code of Ethics requires that the Audit Committee review and approve any related person transaction before it is consummated. The Audit Committee of the Company has reviewed and approved all agreements and arrangements described above in "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee is a standing committee of the Board, which met four times during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The Audit Committee consists of three members, Joseph S. Compofelice (Chairman), Joseph G. Greenberg, and Richard A. Shortz each of which is independent as defined in the listing standards of the NYSE. The Board has designated Mr. Compofelice as the "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules. The Audit Committee assists, advises and reports regularly to the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities related to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the integrity of the Company's financial statements;  
• the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;  
• the independent auditor's qualifications and independence; and  
• the performance of the Company's outside auditors.  
[END TABLE]
In meeting its responsibilities, the Audit Committee is expected to provide an open channel of communication with management, the outside auditors and the Board. The Audit Committee's specific responsibilities are set forth in its charter, as amended.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2018 and consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for the year ended June 30, 2018 with the Company's management. The Audit Committee has discussed with Moss Adams LLP, the Company's independent auditors, the matters required to be discussed concerning the accounting methods used in the financial statements.
The Audit Committee has also received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from Moss Adams LLP required by the SEC and the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1 AU Section 380), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T (concerning matters that may affect an auditor's independence), and has discussed with Moss Adams LLP their independence.
Based on the foregoing review and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018 for filing with the SEC.
This report is submitted on behalf of the Audit Committee.
