PROXY STATEMENT 
Special Meeting of Shareholders 
To be Held on April 22, 2019 
This Proxy Statement is being furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Board of Trustees (the "Board of Trustees" or the "Board") of PIMCO Equity Series VIT (the "Trust"), a Delaware statutory trust and open-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act") for use at a special meeting of shareholders of PIMCO StocksPLUS® Global Portfolio, the series of the Trust (the "Portfolio") (the "Meeting"). The Meeting is scheduled to be held at the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa, Sunset Room, 900 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach, California 92660 on April 22, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., Pacific time, or as adjourned from time to time. This Proxy Statement, Notice of Special Meeting and proxy card are first being mailed to shareholders on or about March 18, 2019. 
The purpose of the Meeting is to consider and act upon a proposal to elect four Trustees to the Board of Trustees (the "Proposal") and to transact such other business as may properly come before the Meeting or any adjournments thereof. 
Shares of the Portfolio are currently sold to segregated asset accounts ("Separate Accounts") of insurance companies to serve as an investment medium for variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies (each, an "Insurance Company" and collectively, the "Insurance Companies"). The Separate Accounts invest in shares of the Portfolio in accordance with allocation instructions received from owners of variable annuity contracts and variable life   insurance policies ("Variable Contract Owners"). The Trust is soliciting votes from Variable Contract Owners in connection with the Proposal. As such and for ease of reference, throughout this Proxy Statement, Variable Contract Owners may be referred to as "shareholders" of the Trust. 
The principal business address of Pacific Investment Management Company LLC ("PIMCO"), the Portfolio's investment adviser and administrator, is 650 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach, California 92660. The principal business address of PIMCO Investments LLC, the Portfolio's principal underwriter and distributor, is 1633 Broadway, New York, New York 10019. 
All properly executed proxies received prior to the Meeting will be voted at the Meeting in accordance with the instructions marked on the proxy card. Unless instructions to the contrary are marked on the proxy card, proxies submitted by holders of the Portfolio's shares ("Shares") will be voted "FOR" the Proposal. The persons named as proxy holders on the proxy card will vote in their discretion on any other matters that may properly come before the Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. Any shareholder executing a proxy has the power to revoke it prior to its exercise by submission of a properly executed, subsequently dated proxy, by voting in person, or by written notice to the Secretary of the Trust (addressed to the Secretary at the principal executive office of the Trust, 650 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach, California 92660). However, attendance at the Meeting, by itself, will not revoke a previously submitted proxy. Unless the proxy is revoked, the Shares represented thereby will be voted in accordance with specifications therein. Because Shares are held through a variable annuity contract or variable life insurance policy, please consult with your participating Insurance Company regarding your ability to revoke voting instructions after such instructions have been provided. 
Variable Contract Owners, who have a voting interest in the Separate Accounts holding shares of the Portfolio, can attend the Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
The record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting and at any adjournment or postponement thereof has been fixed at the close of business on February 26, 2019 (the "Record Date"), and each shareholder of record at that time is entitled to cast one vote for each Share registered in his or her name. Shares of the Portfolio, which are held by the Separate Accounts, will be voted in accordance with the instructions received from the Variable Contract Owners. The total number of Shares outstanding as of the Record Date for the Portfolio and for each class of the Portfolio is set forth in Exhibit A. Please see Exhibit B for more information regarding the beneficial ownership of Shares.  As you hold Shares through a variable annuity contract or a variable life insurance contract, if you do not vote your Shares or do not give specific voting instructions for your Shares, they may not be voted at all or, as described above, they may be voted in a manner that you may not intend. Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to give your Insurance Company specific instructions as to how you want your Shares to be voted. 
Shareholders can find important information about the Portfolio in the annual report to shareholders, dated December 31, 2018, which previously has been furnished to shareholders. Shareholders may request another copy of this report by writing to the Trust at the above address, by calling the appropriate telephone number above or online at http://pvit.pimco-funds.com. 
PROPOSAL: ELECTION OF FOUR TRUSTEES TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES 
The purpose of this Proposal is to elect four nominees to the Board of Trustees. The election of these four nominees will allow for the combined oversight of the Portfolio with PIMCO's broader open-end and exchange-traded fund complex (the "PIMCO Fixed Income Funds") under a single Board of Trustees. 
The Trustees of the Portfolio, together with the Trustees of the PIMCO Fixed Income Funds, have been considering ways to structure oversight in a manner that ensures shareholders will continue to be well served by Trustees in the years ahead. As a result of its considerations, the Board of Trustees of the Trust — with the support of PIMCO — have made a decision to combine oversight of the Portfolio with the PIMCO Fixed Income Funds under a combined Board. The combined Board will oversee nearly all of the open-end funds and exchange-traded funds advised by PIMCO (151 funds with approximate assets of over $451.8 billion as of December 31, 2018 (including fund-of-fund assets)). Unifying oversight under a combined Board will allow for the realization of greater efficiencies in the oversight and the combined Board will include Trustees with significant experience overseeing a broad range of PIMCO funds. 
The Portfolio will begin to operate under the combined Board immediately after the last election is held to elect Trustees in connection with this Proposal. The Trustees fully expect that the strong governance culture of the Portfolio and protection of the interests of Portfolio shareholders will continue under the combined Board.  Of the four nominees, one nominee currently serves as a Trustee of the Trust and three nominees do not. The nominees for election to the Board of Trustees are George E. Borst, Kym M. Hubbard, Gary F. Kennedy and Peter G. Strelow. Messrs. Borst and Kennedy as well as Ms. Hubbard are not "interested persons" of the Trust, as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the "Independent Trustee Nominees"). The other Trustees of the Trust — Jennifer Holden Dunbar, Brent R. Harris, Peter B. McCarthy and Ronald C. Parker — will continue to serve as Trustees. 
Each of the Independent Trustee Nominees was recommended for nomination by the Trustees who are not "interested persons" of the Trust, as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the "Independent Trustees"). All of the nominees were then approved by the Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees and by the Board of Trustees. 
Each of the nominees has consented to serve, or to continue to serve in the case of Mr. Strelow, as a Trustee. The Board of Trustees knows of no reason why any of the nominees will be unable to serve, but in the event any nominee is unable to serve or for good cause will not serve, the proxies received indicating a vote in favor of such nominee will be voted for a substitute nominee as the Board of Trustees may recommend. 
At the Meeting, the nominees are to be elected, each to serve for a term of indefinite duration and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier resignation or removal (as provided in the Trust's Declaration of Trust) or death. It is the intention of the persons named as proxies in the enclosed proxy to vote the Shares covered thereby for the election of the four nominees named above, unless the proxy contains contrary instructions. 
The Declaration of Trust does not provide for the annual election of Trustees. However, in accordance with the 1940 Act, (i) the Trust will hold a shareholders' meeting for the election of Trustees at such time as less than a majority of Trustees holding office have been elected by shareholders; or (ii) if, as a result of a vacancy in the Board of Trustees, less than two-thirds of the Trustees holding office have been elected by shareholders, that vacancy may only be filled by a vote of the shareholders.  Nominees 
Basic information concerning the nominees is set forth below. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of all persons below is 650 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach, California 92660.

 Qualifications of Nominees 
Each nominee was nominated to join the Board based on a variety of factors, none of which, by itself, was a controlling factor. The Board has concluded that, based on each nominee's experience, qualifications, attributes and skills, on an individual basis and in combination with those of other nominees, each nominee is qualified to serve as a Trustee of the Trust. Among the attributes common to all the nominees are their ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with the other Trustees, PIMCO, counsel, the independent registered public accounting firm and other service providers, and to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties as Trustees. A nominee's ability to perform his or her duties effectively may have been attained through the nominee's business and/or public service positions, and through experience from service as a Trustee of PIMCO Funds, PIMCO Variable Insurance Trust and PIMCO ETF Trust, public companies, non-profit entities or other organizations. Each nominee's ability to perform his or her duties effectively also has been enhanced by his or her educational background or professional training, and/or other life experiences. 
The following is a summary of qualifications, experiences and skills of each nominee (in addition to the principal occupation(s) during the past five years noted in the table above) that support the conclusion that each individual is qualified to serve as a Trustee: 
Mr. Strelow's position as a Managing Director and Co-Chief Operating Officer of PIMCO, his former position as Chief Administrative Officer of PIMCO, as well as his role as President of the Trust, PIMCO Equity Series, PIMCO Funds, PIMCO Variable Insurance Trust, PIMCO ETF Trust, PIMCO Managed Accounts Trust, PIMCO-Sponsored Interval Funds and PIMCO-Sponsored Closed-End Funds, give him valuable experience with the day-to-day management of the Trust as well as other funds within the Fund Complex, enabling him to provide essential management input to the Board. 
Mr. Borst served in multiple executive positions at a large automotive corporation. Mr. Borst has prior financial experience from his oversight of the chief financial officer, treasury, accounting and audit functions of that automotive corporation. He also served as the chief executive officer of a credit company. Additionally, Mr. Borst has prior experience as a board member of a corporation. He also has gained relevant experience as a Trustee of PIMCO Funds, PIMCO Variable Insurance Trust and PIMCO ETF Trust since April 2015.  Ms. Hubbard has prior financial, operations and management experience as the global head of investments, chief investment officer and treasurer of a large accounting firm. She currently serves on the board of directors of a public company. She also has gained relevant experience as a Trustee of PIMCO Funds, PIMCO Variable Insurance Trust and PIMCO ETF Trust since February 2017. 
Mr. Kennedy served as general counsel, senior vice president and chief compliance officer for a large airline company. He also has experience in management of the airline company's corporate real estate and legal departments. He also has gained relevant experience as a Trustee of PIMCO Funds, PIMCO Variable Insurance Trust and PIMCO ETF Trust since April 2015.

These procedures shall not apply to any communication from an officer or Trustee of the Portfolio or any communication from an employee or agent of the Portfolio, unless such communication is made solely in such employee's or agent's capacity as a shareholder, but shall apply to any shareholder proposal submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), or any communication made in connection with such a proposal. 
The Board of Trustees has designated management's representative on the Board, if any, or any officer of the Portfolio, as the full Board's representative to attend meetings of the Portfolio's shareholders and to otherwise make himself or herself available to shareholders for communications. 
Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight Function 
The Board is currently composed of five Trustees, three of whom are Independent Trustees. The Trustees meet periodically throughout the year to discuss and consider matters concerning the Trust and to oversee the Trust's activities, including its investment performance, compliance program and risks associated with its activities. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, there were four regular meetings of the Board. 
Mr. Strelow, a Managing Director and Co-Chief Operating Officer of PIMCO, and therefore an "interested person" of the Trust, serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board has established four standing committees to facilitate the Trustees' oversight of the management of the Trust: an Audit Committee, a Valuation Oversight Committee, an Investment Performance Committee and a Governance Committee. The scope of each committee's responsibilities is discussed in greater detail below. The Board does not currently have a lead Independent Trustee; however, the Chairs of the Committees, each of whom is an Independent Trustee, act as liaisons between the Independent Trustees and the Trust's management between Board meetings and, with management, are involved in the preparation of agendas for Board and committee meetings. Once oversight is unified under a combined Board, it is expected that Mr. Parker will serve as the Board's Lead Independent Trustee. The Board believes that, as Chairman, Mr. Strelow provides skilled executive leadership to the Trust.   Further, the Board believes that an interested Chairman performs an essential liaison function between the Trust and PIMCO, its investment adviser and administrator. The Board believes that its governance structure allows all of the Independent Trustees to participate in the full range of the Board's oversight responsibilities. The Board reviews its structure regularly as part of its annual self-evaluation. The Board has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate in light of the characteristics and circumstances of the Trust because it allocates areas of responsibility among the committees and the Board in a manner that enhances effective oversight. The Board considered, among other things, the role of PIMCO in the day-to-day management of the Trust's affairs; the extent to which the work of the Board is conducted through the committees; the number of portfolios that comprise the Trust and other trusts in the Fund Complex overseen by members of the Board; the variety of asset classes those portfolios include; the net assets of the Portfolio, the Trust and the Fund Complex; and the management, distribution and other service arrangements of the Portfolio, the Trust and the Fund Complex. 
In its oversight role, the Board has adopted, and periodically reviews, policies and procedures designed to address risks associated with the Trust's activities. In addition, PIMCO and the Trust's other service providers have adopted policies, processes and procedures to identify, assess and manage risks associated with the Trust's activities. The Trust's senior officers, including, but not limited to, the Chief Compliance Officer and Treasurer, PIMCO portfolio management personnel and other senior personnel of PIMCO, the Trust's independent registered public accounting firm (the "independent auditors") and personnel from the Trust's third-party service providers make periodic reports to the Board and its committees with respect to a variety of matters, including matters relating to risk management. 
Standing Committees of the Trust 
Audit Committee. The Board of Trustees has a standing Audit Committee that consists of all of the Independent Trustees (Ms. Dunbar and Messrs. McCarthy (Chair) and Parker). The Audit Committee's responsibilities include, but are not limited to, (i) assisting the Board's oversight of the integrity of the Trust's financial statements, the Trust's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications and independence of the Trust's independent auditors, and the performance of such firm; (ii) overseeing the Trust's accounting and financial reporting policies and practices, its internal controls and, as appropriate, the internal controls of certain service providers; (iii) overseeing the quality and objectivity of the Trust's financial statements and the independent audit thereof; and (iv) acting as liaison between the Trust's independent auditors and the full Board. The Audit Committee also reviews both the audit and  non-audit work of the Trust's independent auditors, submits a recommendation to the Board of Trustees as to the selection of an independent auditor, and reviews generally the maintenance of the Trust's records and the safekeeping arrangement of the Trust's custodian. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, there were four meetings of the Audit Committee. 
Valuation Oversight Committee. The Board of Trustees has formed a Valuation Oversight Committee who has been delegated responsibility by the Board for overseeing determination of the fair value of the Portfolio's portfolio securities and other assets on behalf of the Board in accordance with the Portfolio's valuation procedures. The Valuation Oversight Committee reviews and approves procedures for the fair valuation of the Portfolio's portfolio securities and periodically reviews information from PIMCO regarding fair value determinations made pursuant to Board-approved procedures, and makes related recommendations to the full Board and assists the full Board in resolving particular fair valuation and other valuation matters. In certain circumstances as specified in the Trust's valuation policies, the Valuation Oversight Committee may also determine the fair value of portfolio holdings after consideration of all relevant factors, which determinations shall be reported to the full Board of Trustees. The Valuation Oversight Committee consists of Ms. Dunbar (co-Lead) and Messrs. Harris, McCarthy (co-Lead) and Parker. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, there were four meetings of the Valuation Oversight Committee. 
Investment Performance Committee. The Board of Trustees has recently established an Investment Performance Committee. The Investment Performance Committee meets periodically to review and assess the Portfolio's investment performance. The Performance Committee also meets with and receives periodic reports from the Portfolio's investment adviser, sub-adviser and/or portfolio implementer, as applicable, regarding the Portfolio's investment objectives and strategies and the investment adviser's (sub-adviser's and/or portfolio implementer's, as applicable) views and assessment as to the factors and conditions contributing to the Portfolio's performance and outlook and strategies for future periods. The Investment Performance Committee was established in February 2019 and did not have any meetings during the Portfolio's fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Governance Committee. The Board of Trustees also has a Governance Committee, which is responsible, among other things, for the promotion of sound governance practices and for the selection and nomination of candidates to serve as Trustees of the Trust. Only Independent Trustees may serve as members of the Governance Committee, and the Governance Committee currently consists of Ms. Dunbar (Chair) and Messrs. McCarthy and Parker. Prior to November 7,   2018, the Governance Committee comprised all of the Trustees, but only members of the Committee who were Independent Trustees voted on the nomination of Independent Trustee candidates. The Governance Committee has established a policy whereby the Chairman of the Board will serve for a term that is not longer than five years from the date of appointment. Upon a vote of the majority of the Trustees, such Chairman may serve up to two additional consecutive five-year terms. 
The Governance Committee requires that each prospective Trustee candidate have a college degree in addition to relevant business experience. In addition, it is the Board's policy that Trustees may not serve simultaneously in a similar capacity on the board of a registered investment company that is not sponsored or advised by the Portfolio's investment adviser or its affiliates. The Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering prospective Trustee candidates, including (but not limited to): (i) availability and strong and dedicated commitment of a candidate to attend all meetings and perform his or her Board responsibilities with diligence; (ii) relevant industry and related experience; (iii) educational background; (iv) finance and relevant financial expertise; (v) the candidate's business abilities, demonstrated quality of judgment and developed expertise; and (vi) overall diversity of the Board's composition. The Governance Committee takes diversity of a particular nominee and overall diversity of the Board into account when considering and evaluating nominees for Trustees. While the Governance Committee has not adopted a particular definition of diversity, when considering a nominee's and the Board's diversity, the Committee generally considers the manner in which each nominee's professional experience, education, expertise in matters that are relevant to the oversight of the Portfolio (e.g., investment management, distribution, accounting, trading, compliance, legal), general leadership experience, and life experience are complementary and, as a whole, contribute to the ability of the Board to oversee the Portfolio. 
The Governance Committee has a policy in place for considering Trustee candidates recommended by shareholders. The Governance Committee may consider potential Trustee candidates recommended by shareholders provided that the proposed candidates: (i) satisfy any minimum qualifications of the Trust for its Trustees; and (ii) are not "interested persons" of the Trust or the investment adviser within the meaning of the 1940 Act. The Governance Committee will not consider submissions in which any shareholder submitting a proposed Trustee candidate (a "Nominating Shareholder") has submitted himself or herself as the proposed Trustee candidate. 
Any Nominating Shareholder must continuously own as of record, or beneficially through a financial intermediary, shares of the Trust having a net   asset value of not less than $25,000 during the two-year period prior to submitting the proposed Trustee candidate. Each of the securities used for purposes of calculating this ownership must have been held continuously for at least two years as of the date of the nomination. In addition, such securities must continue to be held through the date of the special meeting of shareholders to elect Trustees. 
All Trustee candidate submissions by Nominating Shareholders must be received by the Portfolio by the deadline for submission of any shareholder proposals which would be included in the Portfolio's proxy statement for the next special meeting of shareholders of the Portfolio. 
Nominating Shareholders must substantiate compliance with these requirements at the time of submitting their proposed Trustee nominee to the attention of the Trust's Secretary. Notice to the Trust's Secretary should be provided in accordance with the deadline specified above and include, (i) the Nominating Shareholder's contact information; (ii) the number of Shares which are owned of record and beneficially by the Nominating Shareholder and the length of time which such Shares have been so owned by the Nominating Shareholder; (iii) a description of all arrangements and understandings between the Nominating Shareholder and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the submission is being made and a description of the relationship, if any, between the Nominating Shareholder and the Trustee candidate; (iv) the Trustee candidate's contact information, age, date of birth and the number of Shares owned by the Trustee candidate; (v) all information regarding the Trustee candidate's qualifications for service on the Board of Trustees as well as any information regarding the Trustee candidate that would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of Trustees required by Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act, had the Trustee candidate been nominated by the Board; (vi) whether the Nominating Shareholder believes the Trustee candidate would or would not be an "interested person" of the Portfolio, as defined in the 1940 Act and a description of the basis for such belief; and (vii) a notarized letter executed by the Trustee candidate, stating his or her intention to serve as a nominee and be named in the Portfolio's proxy statement, if nominated by the Board of Trustees, and to be named as a Trustee if so elected. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, there were two meetings of the Governance Committee. 
The Governance Committee charter is attached as Exhibit C.  Trustee Retirement Policy 
The Board has in place a retirement policy for all Trustees who are not "interested persons" of the Trust, as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, that seeks to balance the benefits of the experience and institutional memory of existing Trustees against the need for fresh perspectives, and to enhance the overall effectiveness of the Board. No Independent Trustee shall continue service as a Trustee beyond the first Board meeting occurring after his or her 76th birthday, provided that this policy may be waived or modified from time to time at the discretion of the Governance Committee. The continued appropriateness of the retirement policy is reviewed from time to time by the Governance Committee. 
VOTING AND OTHER INFORMATION 
Quorum and Voting Requirements 
The holders of one-third of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum at a shareholders' meeting. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority of the outstanding Shares voted shall decide any questions, except that Trustees shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast at such meeting. For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the Meeting, abstentions will be treated as Shares that are present. 
Insurance Companies will vote Shares held by their Separate Accounts in accordance with the instructions received from the Variable Contract Owners. An Insurance Company also will vote Shares held in the Separate Account for which it has not received timely instructions in the same proportion as it votes Shares held by that Separate Account for which it has received instructions. An Insurance Company whose Separate Account invests in the Portfolio will vote Shares by its general account and its subsidiaries in the same proportion as other votes cast by its Separate Account in the aggregate. As a result, the Trust does not anticipate receiving any broker non-votes on the Proposal, and there exists a possibility that a small number of Variable Contract Owners could determine the outcome of the vote if other Variable Contract Owners fail to vote. 
Approval of the Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of the Shares of the entire Trust voted in person or by proxy at the Meeting. With respect to the Proposal, votes to ABSTAIN will have no effect. 
Adjournment 
Any meeting of shareholders, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the Shares represented   at the meeting, either in person or by proxy. Any adjourned session of a meeting of shareholders may be held within a reasonable time without further notice. In the event of such a proposed adjournment, the persons named as proxies will vote those proxies which they are entitled to vote "FOR" the proposal in favor of such an adjournment and will vote those proxies required to be voted "AGAINST" the proposal against any such adjournment. A shareholder vote may be taken prior to any adjournment of the Meeting on any proposal for which there is sufficient votes for approval, even though the Meeting is adjourned as to other proposals. 
The Board of Trustees, including the Independent Trustees, recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the Proposal. Unmarked proxies will be so voted. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
Expenses and Methods of Proxy Solicitation 
The expense of preparation, printing and mailing of the enclosed proxy card and accompanying Notice of Special Meeting and Proxy Statement will be borne by PIMCO under the terms of the Trust's Supervision and Administration Agreement, including the costs of retaining AST Fund Solutions, LLC, which are estimated to be approximately $2,000. PIMCO will reimburse banks, brokers and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding proxy solicitation material to the beneficial owners of Shares. 
Shareholders may sign and mail the proxy card received with the Proxy Statement or attend the Meeting in person. Any proxy given by a shareholder is revocable. A shareholder may revoke the accompanying proxy at any time prior to its use by submitting a properly executed, subsequently dated proxy, giving written notice to the Secretary of the Trust at 650 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach, California 92660, or by attending the Meeting and voting in person. However, attendance in person at the Meeting, by itself, will not revoke a previously tendered proxy. 
The solicitation is being made primarily by the mailing of this Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy on or about March 18, 2019. In order to obtain the necessary quorum at the Meeting, supplementary solicitation may be made by mail, telephone or personal interview. Such solicitation may be conducted by, among others, officers and regular employees of PIMCO. 
With respect to votes recorded by telephone or through the internet, the Trust will use procedures designed to authenticate shareholders' identities, to   allow shareholders to authorize the voting of their Shares in accordance with their instructions, and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. Proxies voted by telephone or through the internet may be revoked at any time before they are voted in the same manner that proxies voted by mail may be revoked.

Shareholder Proposals 
The Trust does not hold regular shareholders' meetings. Shareholders wishing to submit proposals for inclusion in a proxy statement for a subsequent shareholders' meeting should send their written proposals to the Secretary of the Trust at the address set forth on the cover of this Proxy Statement. 
Proposals must be received a reasonable time prior to the date of a meeting of shareholders to be considered for inclusion in the proxy materials for a meeting. Timely submission of a proposal does not, however, necessarily mean that the proposal will be included. Persons named as proxies for any subsequent shareholders' meeting will vote in their discretion with respect to proposals submitted on an untimely basis. 
OTHER MATTERS 
The proxy holders have no present intention of bringing before the Meeting for action any matters other than the Proposal referred to above, nor has the management of the Trust any such intention. Neither the proxy holders nor the management of the Trust is aware of any matters which may be presented by others. If any other business properly comes before the Meeting, the proxy holders intend to vote thereon in accordance with their best judgment.  Notice to Insurance Companies 
Please advise the Trust, in care of PIMCO Investments LLC, 1633 Broadway, New York, New York 10019, whether other persons are beneficial owners of Shares for which proxies are being solicited and, if so, the number of copies of the Proxy Statement you wish to receive in order to supply copies to the Variable Contract Owners of the respective Shares. 
Please complete, date and sign the enclosed proxy and return it promptly in the enclosed reply envelope. NO POSTAGE IS REQUIRED if mailed in the United States.

Governance Function 
1. The Committee shall consult with Fund management, the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer, counsel and other consultants, as and when appropriate, to discuss legal and business developments affecting the investment management industry and fund governance with a view to recommend changes to the Board's and each Fund's governance practices, as appropriate. 
2. The Committee shall consider, be responsible for and implement an annual evaluation process of the Board. Such evaluation process should include, at a minimum, an evaluation of the operation of the various committees of the Board and an evaluation of the number of funds overseen by the trustees. 
Nominating Function — Board 
1. The Committee shall at times and from time to time make nominations for trustees of the Funds and submit such nominations to the full Board. The Committee shall evaluate candidates' qualifications for such positions, and, in the case of candidates for independent trustee positions, their independence from the Funds' investment adviser and other principal service providers. Persons selected as independent trustees must not be "interested persons" of the Funds as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. The Committee shall also consider the effect of any relationships beyond those delineated in the 1940 Act that might impair independence, e.g., business, financial or family relationships with the investment adviser. In determining nominees' qualifications for Board membership, the Committee shall consider factors which may be delineated in this charter, or a Fund's bylaws, and may consider such other factors as it may determine to be relevant to fulfilling the role of being a member of the Board. In addition, given that certain series of PIMCO Equity Series operate as exchange-traded funds, the Committee shall take into consideration any applicable financial literacy, independence, or other qualifications imposed on members of the Board by applicable listed company standards. 
2. The Committee may consider potential trustee candidates recommended by shareholders, provided that the proposed candidates: (i) satisfy any minimum qualifications of the Fund for its trustees; and (ii) are not "interested persons" of the Fund or the Fund's investment adviser within the meaning of the 1940 Act. In order for the Committee to evaluate any nominee recommended by a shareholder, potential trustee candidates and nominating shareholders must satisfy the requirements provided in Appendix A to this charter. Other than the requirements provided in Appendix A, the Committee shall not otherwise evaluate trustee nominees submitted by shareholders in a different manner than other nominees. 
C-2 
3. The Committee may identify prospective trustees from any reasonable source, including, but not limited to, the consultation of third-party trustee search services. 
4. The Committee requires that each prospective trustee candidate have a college degree in addition to relevant business experience. In addition, it is the Board's policy that trustees on the Board may not serve simultaneously in a similar capacity on the board of a registered investment company which is not sponsored or advised by the Funds' investment adviser or its affiliates. The Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering prospective trustee candidates, including (but not limited to): (i) availability and strong and dedicated commitment of a candidate to attend all meetings and perform his or her Board responsibilities with diligence; (ii) relevant industry and related experience; (iii) educational background; (iv) finance and relevant financial expertise; (v) the candidate's business abilities, demonstrated quality of judgment and developed expertise; and (vi) overall diversity of the Board's composition. 
5. The Committee shall periodically review the composition of the Board to determine whether it may be appropriate to add individuals with different, but relevant, skills or backgrounds from those already on the Board. In addition, the Committee shall periodically review the Board's Statement of Trustee Retirement Policy ("Retirement Policy"), and, at such time as any one independent trustee reaches age 74, the Committee Chair shall in the ordinary course initiate a process to identify, and ultimately nominate for appointment or election, independent trustee candidates to maintain the size and composition of the Board in a manner deemed advisable by the Committee. 
6. The selection and nomination of independent trustees is exclusively the responsibility of the independent trustees. The interested trustees of each Fund may participate in the process of identifying potential independent trustee candidates and in any related matters, as requested by the independent trustees and to the extent permitted under applicable law. 
7. The Committee shall periodically review trustee compensation and shall recommend any appropriate changes to the Board as a group. 
8. The Committee shall periodically review issues related to the succession of officers of the Funds, including the chairman of the Board. The chairman of the Board shall serve for a term that is not longer than five years from the date of appointment. Upon a vote of the majority of the Trustees, such chairman may serve up to two additional consecutive five-year terms. In the event the chairman of the Board reaches a term limit with respect to one Fund, such limit shall be 
C-3 
 applied to the Board of each Fund overseen by the Board. This paragraph shall be effective at the conclusion of the February 14, 2019 Board meeting. 
Nominating Function — Committees 
1. The Committee shall make nominations for membership on all committees of the Board and submit such nominations to the full Board, and shall review committee assignments as necessary. 
2. The Committee may review as necessary the responsibilities of any committees of the Board, whether there is a continuing need for each committee, whether there is a need for additional committees, and whether committees should be combined or reorganized, subject to applicable law. The Committee may consult with, and receive recommendations in connection with the foregoing from the Board and Fund management, and shall make and discuss recommendations for any such action to and with the full Board. 
Other Powers and Responsibilities 
1. The Committee shall normally meet twice yearly prior to the meeting of the full Board in February and November, to carry out its nominating and governance functions, and at such other time or times as the Committee or Board may determine appropriate or necessary, and is empowered to hold special meetings as circumstances require. In the event that a Committee meeting is proposed outside of regularly scheduled meetings of the full Board, such meeting will be scheduled only with the unanimous prior consent of the members of the Committee. 
2. The Committee shall be responsible for making recommendations to the full Board regarding the retirement, resignation or removal of trustees, in a manner consistent with each Fund's declaration of trust and by-laws. 
3. The Committee shall have the resources and authority appropriate to discharge its responsibilities, including authority to utilize Fund counsel and to retain experts or other persons with specific competence at the expense of the Funds. 
4. The Committee shall review this charter periodically and recommend any changes to the full Board. 
5. In recognition of the significant time commitment and responsibility attendant to serving on the Board of the Funds, and to avoid potential conflicts of interest and potential impediments to a trustee devoting necessary attention to 
C-4 
 Fund matters, it is the policy of the Funds that prior to accepting a position as a board member of any other entity (other than a not-for-profit or charitable entity or closely held family company), an independent trustee will formally and fully consult with the Committee, first through a discussion with the chairman of the Committee, regarding the potential board position. 
Governance Committee Chairman 
1. The Committee shall appoint a chairman of the Committee ("Governance Chair") by a vote of the majority of the members of the Committee. The Governance Chair is encouraged to understand the subtleties of his/her duties as Governance Chair, particularly as differentiated from governance committees of public or private corporations or other public entities. 
2. The Governance Chair shall serve until a successor is appointed by the Committee, but in any event, for a term not longer than five years from the date of appointment. Upon a vote of the majority of the members of the Committee, the Governance Chair may serve one additional consecutive five-year term. Such additional term shall be shortened if a five-year term would extend beyond the Governance Chair's retirement date contemplated by the Board's Retirement Policy and consistent with Section 4 below. 
3. The Committee shall not appoint or re-appoint any member as Governance Chair if the term of such Chair would commence within the lesser of one year or fewer than four (4) upcoming Board meetings of the member's retirement date directed by the Retirement Policy. 
4. No later than the date of the regular Board meeting occurring immediately preceding the Governance Chair's final regular Board meeting as contemplated by the Retirement Policy, the Governance Chair shall resign as chairman of the Committee, effective upon conclusion of such penultimate Board meeting. For the avoidance of doubt, a member of the Committee who is required to resign as chairman of the Committee under this Section is not required to resign from the Committee, and may continue to serve on the Committee through his or her final regular Board meeting. 
5. The Governance Chair may be replaced at any time by a vote of the majority of the members of the Committee (with the Governance Chair recused). 
6. For the avoidance of doubt, a member of the Committee who is serving on the Board pursuant to a waiver of the Retirement Policy may not serve as Governance Chair but is not required to resign from the Committee.

EXHIBIT E 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), 1100 Walnut Street, Suite 1300, Kansas City, Missouri 64106-2197, serves as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Portfolio. PwC provides audit services, tax assistance and consultation in connection with review of SEC and Internal Revenue Service filings. 
PwC audited the financial statements of the Portfolio for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. At a meeting held on February 14, 2019, the Board of Trustees approved by the vote, cast in person, of all of the Trustees, including all of the Independent Trustees, the selection of PwC to audit the financial statements of the Portfolio for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. PwC has audited the financial statements of the Portfolio for its last two fiscal years (as applicable), and has represented that it does not have any direct financial interest or any material indirect financial interest in the Portfolio. Representatives of PwC are not expected to attend the Meeting but will be available by phone and will have the opportunity to make a statement and respond to appropriate questions from shareholders. 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm's Fees 
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed by PwC for the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered for: (i) the audit of each of the Portfolio's annual financial statements included in the Portfolio's annual report to shareholders; (ii) assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit of each of the Portfolio's financial statements and are not reported under (i), which include advice and education on accounting and auditing issues, and consent letters; (iii) tax compliance, tax advice and tax return preparation, which includes an annual distribution review; and (iv) aggregate non-audit services provided to the Portfolio, PIMCO and entities that control, are controlled by or under common control with PIMCO that provide ongoing 
E-1 
 services to the Portfolio ("Service Affiliates"), which include conducting an annual internal control report. No other services were provided to the Portfolio during this period.

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee's policies and procedures require the pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services provided to the Portfolio by the Portfolio's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee policies and procedures also require pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services provided to PIMCO and Service Affiliates to the extent that these services are directly related to the operations or financial reporting of the Portfolio. All of the amounts for Audit Fees, Audit-Related Fees and Tax Fees in the table are for services pre-approved by the Audit Committee. During the periods indicated in the table above, no services described under "Audit-Related Fees," "Tax Fees" or "All Other Fees" were approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X. 
The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of any non-audit services not pre-approved by the Audit Committee provided by the Portfolio's independent registered public accounting firm to PIMCO and Service Affiliates is compatible with maintaining the independent registered public accounting firm's independence.
