[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote. These shares include those (1) held directly in your name as the shareholder of record ("Shareholder of Record"),                        and (2) held for you as the beneficial owner through a broker, bank or other nominee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the Record Date?

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the difference between holding shares as a Shareholder of Record and as a beneficial owner?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially.  
[END TABLE]
Shareholder of Record
If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, you are considered, with respect to those           shares, the Shareholder of Record. As the Shareholder of Record, you have the right to submit a proxy directly to the Company to have your shares voted at the meeting or to vote in person at the Special Meeting. Beneficial Owner
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares           held in "street name" and your broker, bank or other nominee is considered, with respect to those shares, the Shareholder of Record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or nominee on how to vote and are also           invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the Shareholder of Record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you receive a proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee. Your broker, bank or           other nominee has provided voting instructions for you to use. If you wish to attend the Special Meeting and vote in person, please contact your broker, bank or other nominee so that you can receive a legal proxy to present at the Special           Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What am I voting on?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  You are being asked to vote on (1) a proposal to amend the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Amended and Restated Certificate                        of Incorporation"), to effect a reverse stock split of the Company's Common Stock at a ratio within the range of 1:5 to 1:15, as determined by the Board, and with such reverse stock split to be effected at such time and date, if at                        all, as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and (2) a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary, if a quorum is present, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve                        Proposal 1.  
[END TABLE]
The Company is not currently aware of any matters that will be brought before the Special Meeting (other than           procedural matters) that are not referred to in the enclosed Proxy Card. If any other business should properly come before the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, the persons named in the proxy will vote on such matters           according to their best judgment. Discretionary authority to vote on such matters is conferred by such proxies upon the persons voting them.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How do I vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Shareholders of Record may vote by completing and signing the enclosed Proxy Card and returning it promptly in the enclosed postage prepaid, addressed envelope, or at the                        Special Meeting in person. We will pass out written ballots to anyone who is eligible to vote at the Special Meeting. We also will request persons, firms, and corporations holding shares of the Company's Common Stock in their names or                        in the name of their nominees, which are beneficially owned by others, to send proxy material to and obtain proxies from the beneficial owners and will reimburse the holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. Proxy Cards                        properly executed and delivered by shareholders (by mail or via the Internet) and timely received by the Company will be voted in accordance with the instructions contained therein. If you authorize a proxy to vote your shares over                        the Internet or by telephone, you should not return a Proxy Card by mail, unless you are revoking your proxy. If you hold your shares in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, and are therefore not a Shareholder of                        Record, you must request a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to vote at the Special Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If you hold your shares in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may vote via the Internet by going to http://www.proxyvote.com, while Shareholders of Record may go to www.AALvote.com/RNNSM           to vote via the Internet. All shareholders must have their control number from their proxy card or voting instruction form in order to vote via the Internet. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How many votes do you need to hold the Special Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Forty percent of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date must be present at the Special Meeting, either in person or by proxy,                        in order to hold the Special Meeting and conduct business. This is called a quorum.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What are the voting requirements to approve the proposals?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  The affirmative vote of a majority of the Company's issued and outstanding shares is required to approve the reverse stock split. The affirmative vote of a majority of                        the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is required to approve an adjournment of the Special Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who will count the votes?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Votes at the Special Meeting will be counted by an inspector of election, who will be appointed by the Board or the chairman of the Special Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the effect of not voting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you are a beneficial owner of shares in street name and do not provide the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares with specific voting instructions then,                        under applicable rules, the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares can generally vote on "routine" matters, but cannot vote on "non‑routine" matters. In the case of a non-routine item, your shares will be considered                        "broker non-votes" on that proposal.  
[END TABLE]
Proposal 1 (approval of the reverse stock split) and Proposal 2 (approval of the adjournment of the Special Meeting,           if necessary, if a quorum is present, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve Proposal 1) are matters we believe will be considered "routine."
If you are a Shareholder of Record and you do not cast your vote, no votes will be cast on your behalf on any of the           items of business at the Special Meeting. If you are a Shareholder of Record and you properly sign and return your Proxy Card, your shares will be voted as you direct. If no instructions are indicated on such Proxy Card and you are a Shareholder           of Record, shares represented by the proxy will be voted in the manner recommended by the Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement, namely "FOR" the approval of the reverse stock split and "FOR" the adjournment of the Special           Meeting, if necessary.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How are broker non-votes and abstentions treated?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Broker non-votes and abstentions with respect to a proposal are counted as present or represented by proxy for purposes of establishing a quorum.  If a quorum is present,                        abstentions will count as votes against Proposal 2 (approval of the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary, if a quorum is present, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve Proposal 1), and                        broker non-votes and abstentions will have the same effect as votes against Proposal 1 (approval of the reverse stock split).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I revoke my proxy or change my vote after I have voted?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  You may revoke your proxy and change your vote by voting again via the Internet or telephone, by completing, signing, dating and returning a new Proxy Card or voting                        instruction form with a later date, or by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person. Only your latest dated Proxy Card received at or prior to the Special Meeting will be counted. Your attendance at the Special Meeting will                        not have the effect of revoking your proxy unless you forward written notice to the Secretary of the Company at the above stated address or you vote by ballot at the Special Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What does it mean if I receive more than one Proxy Card?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  It means that you have multiple accounts at the transfer agent and/or with brokers, banks or other nominees. To ensure that all of your shares in each account are voted,                        please sign and return all Proxy Cards, vote with respect to all accounts via the internet or by telephone, or, if you plan to vote at the Special Meeting, contact each broker, bank or other nominee so that you can receive all                        necessary legal proxies to present at the Special Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who is soliciting my vote and who will bear the cost of this solicitation?  
[END TABLE]
Our Board is making this solicitation, and we will bear the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing these                       proxy materials and soliciting votes. We have engaged Alliance Advisors, LLC ("Alliance Advisors") to assist us with the solicitation of proxies. We will pay Alliance Advisors a base fee of $6,000, plus out-of-pocket expenses and                       additional fees based upon work performed at our request. We estimate the total amount payable to Alliance Advisors will be approximately $35,000 to $45,000. We have also agreed to indemnify Alliance Advisors against certain claims.                       Alliance Advisors is reaching out to shareholders to encourage them to vote in favor of Proposal 1. In addition to solicitations by mail, Alliance Advisors may solicit proxies by telephone and e-mail. If Alliance Advisors calls you,                       please answer the call.

 PROPOSAL 1: APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY'S
AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
TO EFFECT A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT
General
The Board has unanimously approved, and recommended that our shareholders approve, an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated           Certificate of Incorporation in substantially the form attached hereto as Annex A (the "Certificate of Amendment"), to effect a reverse stock split at a ratio within a           range from 1-for-5 to 1-for-15, with the final ratio to be determined by the Board, in its sole discretion, following shareholder approval. If the shareholders approve the reverse stock split and the Board decides to implement it, the reverse           stock split will become effective at the effective time set forth in the Certificate of Amendment to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
The reverse stock split will be realized simultaneously for all outstanding Common Stock and the ratio determined by the Board will be           the same for all outstanding Common Stock. The reverse stock split will affect all holders of Common Stock uniformly and each shareholder will hold the same percentage of Common Stock outstanding immediately following the reverse stock split as           that shareholder held immediately prior to the reverse stock split, except for adjustments that may result from the treatment of fractional shares as described below. The proposed Certificate of Amendment will not reduce the number of authorized           shares of Common Stock (which will remain at 75,000,000) or preferred stock (which will remain at 10,000,000) or change the par values of our Common Stock (which will remain at $0.0001 per share) or preferred stock (which will remain at $0.0001           per share).
Purposes of the Proposed Reverse Stock Split
Listing on Another National Securities Exchange.
If the reverse stock split is approved, our Board will consider at that time whether it is in the best interests of our shareholders to           seek a listing of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market or potentially another national securities exchange to improve the visibility of our Common Stock, enhance trading liquidity in shares of our Common Stock and provide us with greater           exposure to institutional investors.  Eligibility for listing on Nasdaq is subject to a number of criteria, such as public float, minimum share price, number of shareholders, market capitalization, net income and other factors.  For example, the           Nasdaq Stock Market requires, among other items, an initial bid price of at least $4.00 per share and, following initial listing, maintenance of a continued price of at least $1.00 per share. On February 11, 2019, the last reported sale price of           our Common Stock on the NYSE American was $0.60 per share. Reducing the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock should, absent other factors, increase the per share market price of the Common Stock, helping us move toward satisfying the           minimum bid price listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. There can be no assurance that the market price for our Common Stock will increase in the same proportion as the reverse stock split or, if increased, that such price will be           maintained or that it will be sufficient to permit us to apply to list our shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market. We have not applied to transfer our listing to the Nasdaq Stock Market or another national securities exchange, and, even if we satisfy           the applicable listing requirements, we may not apply to have our Common Stock listed. Furthermore, even if we do satisfy the requirements and apply for listing, there is no guarantee that our application will be approved. Application for or           approval of our Common Stock for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market or another national securities exchange is not a condition or requirement for effecting the reverse stock split. Increase Our Common Stock Price to a Level More Appealing for Investors.
We believe that the reverse stock split could enhance the appeal of our Common Stock to the financial community, including institutional           investors, and the general investing public.  We believe that a number of institutional investors and investment funds are reluctant to invest in lower-priced securities and that brokerage firms may be reluctant to recommend lower-priced           securities to their clients, which may be due in part to a perception that lower-priced securities are less promising as investments, are less liquid in the event that an investor wishes to sell its shares, or are less likely to be followed by           institutional securities research firms and therefore more likely to have less third-party analysis of the company available to investors.  We believe that the reduction in the number of issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock caused by           the reverse stock split, together with the anticipated increased stock price immediately following and resulting from the reverse stock split, may encourage interest and trading in our Common Stock and thus possibly promote greater liquidity for           our shareholders, thereby resulting in a broader market for the Common Stock than that which currently exists.
Enhance Our Profile for Potential Collaborators.
A key component of our corporate strategy is to seek to establish strategic alliances and partnerships with larger biotechnology and           pharmaceutical companies to support the development and commercialization and co-development of our drug candidates. We believe that a number of potential collaborators are reluctant to partner with companies that lack reasonable access to           capital and who trade at very low share prices. We believe that the reduction in the number of issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock caused by the reverse stock split (which has the effect of increasing our authorized but unissued           shares of Common Stock), together with the anticipated increased stock price immediately following and resulting from the reverse stock split, may enhance our profile with potential partners and facilitate our business development strategy.
Maintaining our Listing on the NYSE American.
Our Common Stock is listed on the NYSE American.  Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide provides that a company's common           stock may be delisted from the NYSE American if it is selling for a substantial period of time at a low price per share and the Company fails to effect a reverse stock split within a reasonable time after being notified that the NYSE American           deems such action to be appropriate under all the circumstances.  While we have not received a notice from the NYSE American providing notice that the NYSE American deems it appropriate for the Company to effect a reverse stock split, and our           Common Stock is not at the level at which we currently expect to receive such a notice, increasing the price of our Common Stock would provide us with a greater opportunity to avoid the receipt of such a notice in the future.
Delisting from the NYSE American may adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of           equity securities, may significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and liquidity of the Common Stock.  Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of           employee confidence, the loss of institutional investors or interest in business development opportunities. Moreover, the Company committed in connection with the sale of securities to use commercially reasonably efforts to maintain the listing           of the Common Stock during such time that certain warrants are outstanding. If the Common Stock were to be delisted from the NYSE American and we are not able to list the Common Stock on another exchange, the           Common Stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the "pink sheets."
Even if this proposal is approved, our Board will have complete discretion as to whether or not to consummate the reverse stock split. We           cannot assure you that all or any of the anticipated beneficial effects on the trading market for our Common Stock will occur.  Our Board cannot predict with certainty what effect the reverse stock split will have on the market price of the           Common Stock, particularly over the longer term.  Some investors may view a reverse stock split negatively, which could result in a decrease in our market capitalization.  Additionally, any improvement in liquidity due to increased institutional           or brokerage interest or lower trading commissions may be offset by the lower number of outstanding shares.  We cannot provide you with any assurance that our shares will qualify for, or be accepted for, listing on a national securities exchange.           As a result, the trading liquidity of our Common Stock may not improve. In addition, investors might consider the increased proportion of unissued authorized shares to issued shares to have an anti-takeover effect under certain circumstances           because the proportion allows for dilutive issuances.
Determination of Ratio
The ratio of the reverse stock split, if approved and implemented, will be a ratio of not less than 1-for-5 and not more than 1-for-15,           as determined by the Board in its sole discretion. In determining the reverse stock split ratio, the Board will consider numerous factors, including:

The purpose of asking for authorization to implement the reverse stock split at a ratio to be determined by the Board, as opposed to a           ratio fixed in advance, is to give the Board the flexibility to take into account then-current market conditions and changes in the price of the Common Stock and to respond to other developments that may be deemed relevant when considering the           appropriate ratio. Principal Effects of the Reverse Stock Split
A reverse stock split refers to a reduction in the number of outstanding shares of a class of a corporation's capital stock, which may be           accomplished, as in this case, by reclassifying and combining all of our outstanding shares of Common Stock into a proportionately smaller number of shares. For example, if the Board decides to implement a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of Common           Stock, then a shareholder holding 10,000 shares of Common Stock before the reverse stock split would instead hold 2,000 shares of Common Stock immediately after the reverse stock split. Each shareholder's proportionate ownership of outstanding           shares of Common Stock would remain the same, except that shareholders that would otherwise receive fractional shares as a result of the reverse stock split will receive cash payments in lieu of fractional shares.
The following table illustrates the effects of the reverse stock split at certain exchange ratios within the 1-for-5 to 1-for-15 range,           without giving effect to any adjustments for fractional shares of Common Stock on our outstanding shares of Common Stock and authorized shares of capital stock as of February 11, 2019:

[END TABLE]
Because no fractional shares will be issued, holders of Common Stock could be eliminated in the event that the proposed reverse stock           split is implemented. However, the Board does not intend to use the reverse stock split as a part of or a first step in a "going private" transaction within the meaning of Rule 13e-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the           "Exchange Act"). There is no plan or contemplated plan by the Company to take itself private as of the date of this Proxy Statement. As of February 11, 2019, we had approximately 31 record holders who held fewer than 15 shares of Common Stock,           out of a total of approximately 54 record holders. The reverse stock split will not decrease the number of our public shareholders (as defined in the NYSE American Company Guide) below the required minimum of 300 and, as a result, it should not           have a negative effect on our continued listing status on NYSE American. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock will not be decreased and will remain at 75,000,000. Because the number of outstanding           shares will be reduced as a result of the reverse stock split, the number of shares available for issuance will be increased. Following our most recent equity offering in January 2019, we have limited authorized but unissued shares available for           future capital raising transactions or strategic transactions.
Our Board believes that we will need to raise additional capital in the ordinary course of business, including to fund our clinical           development programs and/or complete a strategic partnering transaction, which may involve a partner making an equity investment in our company. In either case, we do not have sufficient authorized but unissued shares to accomplish these goals,           which is why we are not seeking a proportional adjustment of our authorized shares in connection with the reverse stock split. The resulting increase in our authorized but unissued shares will provide flexibility to raise additional capital when           needed to fund our ongoing clinical development programs to key value inflection points. If the shareholders do not approve the proposed amendment, we will be limited by the inability to use shares of Common Stock for equity financings or           collaborations, which we believe will harm our shareholder value. The inability to use equity financings in order to raise capital could lead to delays to or the suspension of our clinical programs as a result of the lack of funding. The           inability to raise capital could also have a negative impact on potential collaborations, partnerships, and other business opportunities integral to our growth and success by creating a perception that we do not have reasonable access to capital           and because some collaborators and partners will be interested in acquiring some of our equity as part of collaborations, partnerships or other ventures. Similarly, we may have difficulty attracting, retaining and motivating skilled and           experienced employees, officers and directors if they also perceive that we do not have access to capital and ability to use authorized capital for general corporate purposes.
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we have no specific plans, arrangements or understandings, whether written or oral, with respect           to the increase in shares available for issuance as a result of the reverse stock split. See the table above under the caption "Principal Effects of the Reverse Stock Split" that shows the number of unreserved shares of Common Stock that would be           available for issuance at various reverse stock split ratios.
Potential Anti-Takeover and Dilutive Effects
The purpose of the reverse stock split is not to establish any barriers to a change of control or acquisition of the Company. However,           because the number of authorized shares of Common Stock will remain at 75,000,000, this proposal, if adopted and implemented, will result in a relative increase in the number of authorized but unissued shares of our Common Stock vis-à-vis the           outstanding shares of our Common Stock and could, under certain circumstances, have an anti-takeover effect. Shares of Common Stock that are authorized but unissued provide our Board with flexibility to effect, among other transactions, public or           private financings, mergers, acquisitions, stock dividends, stock splits and the granting of equity incentive awards. However, these authorized but unissued shares may also be used by our Board, consistent with and subject to its fiduciary           duties, to deter future attempts to gain control of us or make such actions more expensive and less desirable. After implementation of the proposed amendment, our Board will continue to have authority under the provisions of our Amended and           Restated Certificate of Incorporation to issue additional shares from time to time without delay or further action by the shareholders except as may be required by applicable law or the NYSE American listing standards, assuming the Company           remains listed on NYSE American. Our Board is not aware of any attempt to take control of our business and has not considered the reverse stock split to be a tool to be utilized as a type of anti-takeover device. We currently have no plans,           proposals or arrangements to issue any shares of Common Stock that would become newly available for issuance as a result of the reverse stock split. In addition, if we do issue additional shares of our Common Stock, the issuance could have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and           the book or market value of the outstanding Common Stock, depending on the circumstances, and would likely dilute a shareholder's percentage voting power in the Company. Holders of Common Stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other           protections against dilution. Our Board intends to take these factors into account before authorizing any new issuance of shares.
Certain Risks Associated with the Reverse Stock Split
Before voting on this Proposal 1, you should consider the following risks associated with the implementation of the reverse stock split:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Although we expect that the reverse stock split will result in an increase in the market price of the Common Stock, we cannot assure you that the reverse stock split, if                        implemented, will increase the market price of the Common Stock in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding or result in a permanent increase in the market price, nor can we assure you that                        we will be able to move our listing to the Nasdaq Stock Market.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The effect the reverse stock split may have upon the market price of the Common Stock cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the history of similar reverse stock                        splits for companies in similar circumstances to ours is varied. For example, the market price of the Common Stock increased after we effected a previous reverse stock split in May 2017, but we have been unable to maintain that price.                        The market price of the Common Stock is dependent on many factors, including our business and financial performance, general market conditions, prospects for future success and other factors detailed from time to time in the reports                        we file with the SEC. Accordingly, the total market capitalization of the Common Stock after the proposed reverse stock split may be lower than the total market capitalization before the proposed reverse stock split and, in the                        future, the market price of the Common Stock following the reverse stock split may not exceed or remain higher than the market price prior to the proposed reverse stock split.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The reverse stock split may result in some shareholders owning "odd lots" of less than 100 shares of Common Stock on a post-split basis. These odd lots may be more                        difficult to sell, or require greater transaction costs per share to sell, than shares in "round lots" of even multiples of 100 shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· While the Board believes that a higher stock price may help generate investor interest, there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split will result in a per share                        price that will attract institutional investors or investment funds or that such share price will satisfy the investing guidelines of institutional investors or investment funds. As a result, the trading liquidity of the Common Stock                        may not necessarily improve.  
[END TABLE]
While we believe that the reverse stock split may enhance our profile with potential partners and facilitate our business development strategy, there can                         be no assurance that we will enter into agreements with any such potential partners on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Although the Board believes that the decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as a consequence of the reverse stock split and the anticipated increase                        in the market price of Common Stock could encourage interest in the Common Stock and possibly promote greater liquidity for our shareholders, such liquidity could also be adversely affected by the reduced number of shares outstanding                        after the reverse stock split.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The reverse stock split will have the effect of increasing the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, which could then be used for issuances that are                        dilutive to current shareholders. In addition, investors might consider the increased proportion of unissued authorized shares to have an anti-takeover effect.  
[END TABLE]
Effect on Fractional Shareholders
No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued in connection with the reverse stock split. If, as a result of the reverse stock           split, a shareholder of record would otherwise hold a fractional share, the shareholder will receive a cash payment in lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share in an amount per share equal to the closing price per share on the NYSE           American on the effective date of the reverse stock split, without interest. The ownership of a fractional interest will not give the holder thereof any voting, dividend or other right except to receive the cash payment therefor.
If a shareholder is entitled to a cash payment in lieu of any fractional share interest, a check will be mailed to the shareholder's           registered address as soon as practicable after the reverse stock split. By signing and cashing the check, shareholders will warrant that they owned the shares of Common Stock for which they received a cash payment.
Shareholders should be aware that, under the escheat laws of the various jurisdictions where shareholders reside, where we are domiciled           and where the funds will be deposited, sums due for fractional interests that are not timely claimed after the Effective Time (as defined below) may be required to be paid to the designated agent for each such jurisdiction. Thereafter,           shareholders otherwise entitled to receive such funds may have to seek to obtain them directly from the state to which they were paid.
Effect on Beneficial Shareholders
If you hold shares of Common Stock in street name through a broker, bank or other nominee, we will treat your Common Stock in the same           manner as Common Stock held by Shareholders of Record. Brokers and other nominees will be instructed to effect the reverse stock split for their customers holding Common Stock in street name. However, these brokers, banks and other nominees may           have different procedures for processing a reverse stock split. If you hold shares of Common Stock in street name, we encourage you to contact your broker, bank or other nominee. Registered "Book-Entry" Holders of Common Stock
If you hold shares of Common Stock electronically in book-entry form with our transfer agent, you do not currently have and will not be           issued stock certificates evidencing your ownership after the reverse stock split, and you do not need to take action to receive post-reverse stock split shares. If you are entitled to post-reverse stock split shares, a transaction statement will           automatically be sent to you indicating the number of shares of Common Stock held following the reverse stock split.
If you are entitled to a payment in lieu of any fractional share interest, payment will be made as described above under "Effect on           Fractional Shareholders."
Effect on Registered Shareholders Holding Certificates
As soon as practicable after the reverse stock split, our transfer agent will mail transmittal letters to each shareholder holding shares           of Common Stock in certificated form. The letter of transmittal will contain instructions on how a shareholder should surrender his or her certificate(s) representing shares of Common Stock (the "Old Certificates") to the transfer agent in           exchange for certificates representing the appropriate number of whole shares of post-reverse stock split Common Stock (the "New Certificates"). No New Certificates will be issued to a shareholder until such shareholder has surrendered all Old           Certificates, together with a properly completed and executed letter of transmittal, to the transfer agent. No shareholder will be required to pay a transfer or other fee to exchange his or her Old Certificates. Shareholders will then receive a           New Certificate(s) representing the number of whole shares of Common Stock that they are entitled as a result of the reverse stock split. Until surrendered, we will deem outstanding Old Certificates held by shareholders to be cancelled and only           to represent the number of whole shares of post-reverse stock split Common Stock to which these shareholders are entitled. Any Old Certificates submitted for exchange, whether because of a sale, transfer or other disposition of stock, will           automatically be exchanged for New Certificates.
If you are entitled to a payment in lieu of any fractional share interest, payment will be made as described above under "Effect on           Fractional Shareholders."
Effect on Outstanding Options, Warrants and Restricted Stock Units
Upon a reverse stock split, all outstanding options, warrants, restricted stock units and future or contingent rights to acquire Common           Stock will be adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. With respect to all outstanding options and warrants to purchase Common Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock that such holders may purchase upon exercise of such options or           warrants will decrease, and the exercise prices of such options or warrants will increase, in proportion to the fraction by which the number of shares of Common Stock underlying such options and warrants are reduced as a result of the reverse           stock split. Also, the number of shares reserved for issuance under our existing stock option and equity incentive plans would be reduced proportionally based on the ratio of the reverse stock split. Procedure for Effecting the Reverse Stock Split
If our shareholders approve this proposal, and the Board elects to effect the reverse stock split, we will effect the reverse stock split           by filing the Certificate of Amendment (as completed to reflect the reverse stock split ratio as determined by the Board, in its discretion, within the range of not less than 1-for-5 and not more than 1-for-15) with the Secretary of State of the           State of Delaware. The reverse stock split will become effective, and the combination of, and reduction in, the number of our outstanding shares as a result of the reverse stock split will occur automatically, at the effective time set forth in           the Certificate of Amendment (referred to as the "Effective Time"), without any action on the part of our shareholders and without regard to the date that stock certificates representing any certificated shares prior to the reverse stock split           are physically surrendered for new stock certificates. Beginning at the Effective Time, each certificate representing pre-reverse stock split shares will be deemed for all corporate purposes to evidence ownership of post-reverse stock split           shares. The text of the Certificate of Amendment is subject to modification to include such changes as may be required by the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and as the Board deems necessary and advisable to effect the           reverse stock split.
The Board reserves the right, notwithstanding shareholder approval and without further action by the shareholders, to elect not to           proceed with the reverse stock split if, at any time prior to filing the Certificate of Amendment, the Board, in its sole discretion, determines that it is no longer in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to proceed with the           reverse stock split. By voting in favor of the reverse stock split, you are expressly also authorizing the Board to delay (until March 26, 2020) or abandon the reverse stock split.  If the Certificate of Amendment has not been filed with the           Secretary of State of the State of Delaware by the close of business on March 26, 2020, the Board will abandon the reverse stock split.
Shareholders should not destroy any stock certificate(s) and should not submit any certificate(s) until they receive a           letter of transmittal from our transfer agent.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Reverse Stock Split
The following is a summary of important tax considerations of the reverse stock split. It addresses only shareholders who hold Common           Stock as capital assets. It does not purport to be complete and does not address shareholders subject to special rules, such as financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, foreign shareholders,           shareholders who hold their pre-reverse stock split shares as part of a straddle, hedge or conversion transaction, and shareholders who acquired their pre-reverse stock split shares pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise           as compensation. This summary is based upon current law, which may change, possibly even retroactively. It does not address tax considerations under state, local, foreign and other laws. The tax treatment of a shareholder may vary depending upon           the particular facts and circumstances of such shareholder. Each shareholder is urged to consult with such shareholder's own tax advisor with respect to the tax consequences of the reverse stock split.
A shareholder generally will not recognize gain or loss on the reverse stock split, except to the extent of cash, if any, received in           lieu of a fractional share interest. The aggregate tax basis of the post-reverse stock split shares received will be equal to the aggregate tax basis of the pre-reverse stock split shares exchanged therefor (excluding any portion of the holder's           basis allocated to fractional shares), and the holding period of the post-reverse stock split shares received will include the holding period of the pre-reverse stock split shares exchanged. A holder of the pre-reverse stock split shares who receives cash will generally be treated as having exchanged a fractional share           interest for cash in a redemption by us. The amount of any gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the portion of the tax basis of the pre-reverse stock split shares allocated to the fractional share interest and the cash received,           and generally would be a long-term capital gain or loss to the extent that the holder's holding period exceeds 12 months.
The foregoing views are not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts. Accordingly, each shareholder should consult with his           or her own tax advisor with respect to all of the potential tax consequences to him or her of the reverse stock split.
Accounting Matters
The par value of the Common Stock will remain unchanged at $0.0001 per share after the reverse stock split. As a result, our stated           capital, which consists of the par value per share of the Common Stock multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock issued and outstanding, will be reduced proportionately at the Effective Time of the reverse stock split.           Correspondingly, our additional paid-in capital, which consists of the difference between our stated capital and the aggregate amount paid to us upon the issuance of all currently outstanding shares of Common Stock, will be increased by a number           equal to the decrease in stated capital. Further, net loss per share, book value per share and other per share amounts will be increased as a result of the reverse stock split because there will be fewer shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date will be required to           approve the reverse stock split. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes (to the extent a broker does not exercise its authority to vote) will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. Shares represented by valid proxies and not           revoked will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions given. If no voting instructions are given, such shares will be voted "FOR" this proposal.
The Board recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the reverse stock split. PROPOSAL 2: THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING
Our shareholders are being asked to consider and vote upon an adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary, if a quorum is           present, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes in favor of approval of a proposed amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effectuate a reverse stock split as described in Proposal 1.
Approval of the adjournment of the Special Meeting requires an affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or           represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter. Abstentions will count against the proposal.
The Board Recommends that you vote FOR the adjournment of the Special             Meeting, if a quorum is present, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve Proposal 1. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT AND CERTAIN SECURITY HOLDERS

 SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
Shareholder Proposals Pursuant to Rule 14a-8
Shareholders interested in submitting a proposal for inclusion in the proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the           "2019 Annual Meeting") may do so by submitting the proposal in writing to our executive offices, 15245 Shady Grove Road, Suite 455, Rockville, Maryland 20850, Attention: Corporate Secretary. Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, to be           eligible for inclusion in our proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting, shareholder proposals must have been received no later than December 24, 2018, which was 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the Proxy Statement for the 2018 Annual           Meeting. The submission of a shareholder proposal does not guarantee that it will be included in the proxy statement.
Nominations and Shareholder Proposals Under our Bylaws
Our Amended and Restated Bylaws also establish an advance notice procedure with regard to nominations of persons for election to the           Board and shareholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting. No shareholder proposal or nomination may be brought before the 2019 Annual Meeting unless, among other things, the submission contains certain information concerning the           proposal or the nominee, as the case may be, and other information specified in our Amended and Restated Bylaws, and the submission is received by us no earlier than the close of business on February 14, 2019, and no later than March 16, 2019.           Proposals or nominations not meeting these requirements will not be entertained at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
Shareholders recommending candidates for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee must provide the           candidate's name, biographical data and qualifications. Any such recommendation should be accompanied by a written statement from the individual of his or her consent to be named as a candidate and, if nominated and elected, to serve as a           director. These requirements are separate from, and in addition to, the SEC's requirements that a shareholder must meet in order to have a shareholder proposal included in the proxy statement. A copy of the full text of these bylaw provisions may           be obtained from our website at www.rexahn.com.
HOUSEHOLDING
If you are a beneficial owner, but not the record holder, of shares of our Common Stock, your broker, bank or other nominee may only           deliver one (1) copy of this Proxy Statement to multiple shareholders at the same address, unless that nominee has received contrary instructions from one (1) or more of the shareholders. We will deliver, upon request, a separate copy of this           Proxy Statement to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered. A shareholder desiring to receive a separate copy of the Proxy Statement, now or in the future, should call our Secretary, Lisa Nolan, at           240-268-5300, or submit a request by writing to 15245 Shady Grove Road, Suite 455, Rockville, Maryland 20850 or by emailing us at ir@rexahn.com.
