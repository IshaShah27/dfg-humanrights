SPARTON CORPORATION 
425 N. Martingale Road 
Suite 1000 
Schaumburg, Illinois 60173-2213 
PROXY STATEMENT 
For the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on December 20, 2018 
SOLICITATION 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of SPARTON CORPORATION, an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), of proxies for use at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company (the "Annual Meeting") to be held at 425 North Martingale Road, Schaumburg, Suite 1000, Illinois 60173-2213, on Thursday, December 20, 2018, at 8:00 a.m., Local Time, and at any and all adjournments thereof. The cost of solicitation will be paid by the Company. In addition to solicitation of proxies by mail, the Company will request that banks, brokers and other holders of record send proxies and proxy materials to the beneficial owners of Company common stock and secure their voting instructions. The Company has also made arrangements with Morrow Sodali LLC to assist it in soliciting proxies and has agreed to pay Morrow Sodali LLC approximately $8,500 plus reasonable expenses for these services. Officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries may solicit proxies personally, by facsimile or other means, without additional compensation. 
At the meeting, the Company's shareholders will act upon three proposals. The first proposal is the election of six directors, each to serve for a one-year term until the annual meeting held in the year 2019 and the election and qualification of their successors. The second proposal is the ratification of the appointment of independent registered public accountants by an advisory vote. The third proposal is the approval of the compensation of the Named Executive Officers (defined below) by an advisory vote. The proposals are described in more detail in this Proxy Statement. 
OUTSTANDING STOCK AND VOTING RIGHTS 
In accordance with the Code of Regulations of the Company, the Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on November 13, 2018 as the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. Only shareholders of record on that date will be entitled to vote. As of the record date for the Annual Meeting, the Company had outstanding 9,834,723 shares of common stock, each entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Votes cast at the meeting and votes submitted by proxy are counted by the inspectors of the election, who are appointed by the Company. 
Voting by Proxy 
If a shareholder is a corporation or partnership, the accompanying proxy card should be signed in the full corporate or partnership name by a duly authorized person. If the proxy card is signed pursuant to a power of attorney or by an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian, the signer's full title should be given and a certificate or other evidence of appointment should be furnished. 
You can vote in one of four ways. You can vote by mail, you can authorize the voting of your shares over the telephone, you can authorize the voting of your shares over the Internet, or you can vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Your proxy may be solicited up to the date and time of the meeting.  Voting by Mail 
If you choose to vote by mail, you may vote by completing and signing the proxy card that accompanies this Proxy Statement and promptly mailing it in the enclosed postage-prepaid envelope. You do not need to put a stamp on the enclosed envelope if you mail it in the United States. The shares you own will be voted according to the instructions on the proxy card you mail. If you return the proxy card, but do not give any instructions on a particular matter described in this Proxy Statement, the shares you own will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Company's Board of Directors. If you choose to vote by mail, your duly signed proxy card must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on December 19, 2018. 
Voting by Internet 
If you choose to vote over the Internet, instructions for a shareholder of record to vote by the Internet are set forth on the enclosed proxy card. The Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate votes cast by use of a personal identification number that appears on the proxy card. These procedures allow shareholders to appoint a proxy to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote over the Internet, you do not have to mail in your proxy card, but your vote must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on December 19, 2018. 
Voting by Phone 
If you choose to vote by telephone, call 1-800-690-6903. These procedures allow shareholders to appoint a proxy to vote their shares and confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote by telephone, you do not have to mail in your proxy card, but your vote must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on December 19, 2018. 
Voting 401(k) Plan Shares 
If you participate in the Company's 401(k) retirement savings plan (the "401(k) Plan") and hold shares in your plan account, you may vote the number of shares credited to your account as of the record date. You should receive instructions from the 401(k) Plan trustee, Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith ("Merrill Lynch") on how to vote your shares of Company common stock held in the 401(k) Plan. You must provide Merrill Lynch with instructions on how to vote your shares. Only the trustee may vote your shares. You may not vote shares held in the 401(k) Plan by returning a proxy card directly to the Company or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. If you do not instruct the 401(k) Plan trustee, Merrill Lynch, as how to vote your shares held in the 401(k) Plan, Merrill Lynch may vote your shares in accordance with its fiduciary obligations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act as 1974, as amended. Your voting instructions (or change or revocation in voting instructions) must be received before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time December 17, 2018. 
Shares Held in Street Name 
If you are not the record holder of the shares you own because they are held in "street name" by a bank or brokerage firm, your bank or brokerage firm is required to vote your shares according to your instructions. In order to vote your shares, you will need to follow the directions your bank or brokerage firm provides you. Many banks and brokerage firms also offer the option of voting over the Internet or by telephone, instructions for which would be provided by your bank or brokerage firm on your vote instruction form. Under the rules of The New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), if you do not give instructions to your brokerage firm, it may still be able to vote your shares with respect to certain "discretionary" items that are deemed by the NYSE to be routine (e.g., the ratification of the appointment of independent registered public accountants), but it will not be allowed to vote your shares with respect to certain "non-discretionary" items. If you do not provide voting instructions to your broker with respect to non-discretionary items such as election of directors and the advisory vote on the compensation of Named Executive Officers, your shares will not be voted for any such proposal. In such case, the shares will be treated as "broker non-votes." Revocation and How Shares are Voted if No Instructions are Provided 
Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before it is voted. Proxies may be revoked by (i) filing a written notice of revocation with the Chairman or Secretary of the Company, at or before the Annual Meeting, (ii) duly executing a subsequent proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to the Chairman or Secretary of the Company either signed and returned by mail or transmitted using the Internet or telephone procedures at or before the Annual Meeting subject to deadlines set forth above or (iii) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person with adequate notification. Attending the Annual Meeting alone, without voting at the Annual Meeting, will not be sufficient to revoke your proxy. Written notice of revocation should be mailed to: Sparton Corporation, Attn: Corporate Secretary, 425 North Martingale Road, Suite 1000, Schaumburg, Illinois 60173-2213. 
Unless revoked, the shares represented by the enclosed proxy will be voted at the meeting in accordance with any specification made thereon, if the proxy is returned properly executed and delivered in time for voting in accordance with the deadlines set forth above. 
Unless otherwise specified, the proxy will be voted "FOR" the election of the six director nominees, "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of independent registered public accountants, and "FOR" approval of the compensation of the Named Executive Officers. 
Quorum and Vote Required 
At all meetings of shareholders, including the Annual Meeting, the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding voting shares of the Company, present in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business. 
In accordance with the Company's Second Amended Articles of Incorporation, and with respect to Proposal 1, a director nominee must receive, in an uncontested election of directors, a greater number of votes cast "FOR" his or her election than "AGAINST" his or her election. Broker non-votes and abstentions are not counted for purposes of this Proposal. Under our governing documents and Ohio law, an incumbent director who is not re-elected will continue in office as a "holdover" director until his or her successor is elected by a subsequent shareholder vote, or his or her earlier resignation, removal from office or death. In order to address "holdover" terms for any incumbent directors who fail to be re-elected under our majority vote standard, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that if a director nominee does not receive a majority affirmative vote, he or she will promptly offer his or her resignation as a director to the Board of Directors. Within ninety (90) days, the Board of Directors will decide, after taking into account the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (in each case excluding the nominee(s) in question), whether to accept the resignation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors may consider any relevant factors in deciding whether to accept a director's resignation. The Board of Directors explanation of its decision shall be promptly disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 
With respect to Proposal 2, the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accountant requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon and present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes are not counted for purposes of this Proposal. Abstentions have the same effect as a vote against this Proposal. 
With respect to Proposal 3, the approval of the compensation of the Named Executive Officers requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon and present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes are not counted for purposes of this Proposal. Abstentions have the same effect as a vote against this Proposal. 
Proposals 2 and 3 are advisory in nature and not binding, although the Board of Directors will carefully consider the shareholder votes.  Other Matters 
Management does not intend to present, and does not know of anyone who intends to present, any matters at the meeting to be acted upon by the shareholders not referred to in the Notice and this Proxy Statement. If any other matters should properly come before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy to vote in accordance with their judgment on such matters.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS 
Director Independence 
Independence criteria and determination 
The listing requirements under Section 303A.01 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (the "Manual") provide that a majority of the members of a listed company's board of directors must be independent. The question of independence is determined with respect to each director pursuant to standards set forth in the Manual. The Manual also requires that certain committees be composed entirely of independent directors. The committees covered by this requirement are the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees. Based upon the standards set forth in the Manual, as of the date of this Proxy Statement, six of the Board of Director's seven members, being more than a majority of the Board of Directors, are independent. All current members of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees are independent in that those directors do not have a material relationship with the Company directly or as a partner, shareholder or affiliate of an entity that has a relationship with the Company. 
In making such determinations, the Board considered (i) whether a director had, within the last three years, any of the relationships under Section 303A.02(b) of the Manual with the Company that would disqualify a director from being considered independent, (ii) whether the director had any disclosable transaction or relationship with the Company under Item 404 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), which relates to transactions and relationships between directors and their affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company and its affiliates (including management), on the other, and (iii) the factors suggested in the NYSE's Commentary to Section 303A.02, such as commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable or familial relationships, among other relationships, or other interactions with management that do not meet the absolute thresholds under Section 303A.02 or Item 404(a) but which, nonetheless, could reflect upon a director's independence from management. In considering the materiality of any transactions or relationships that do not require disqualification under Section 303A.02(b), the Board of Directors considered the materiality of the transaction or relationship to the director, the director's business organization and the Company and whether the relationship between (i) the director's business organization and the Company, (ii) the director and the Company and (iii) the director and his or her business organization interfered with the relevant director's business judgment. 
Based on the foregoing, the Company has determined that the following directors are independent: Alan L. Bazaar, James D. Fast, Charles R. Kummeth, David P. Molfenter, James R. Swartwout and Frank A. Wilson. 
Meetings of Independent Directors 
The independent directors schedule meetings in executive sessions without the presence of the Company's management. The Chairman presides over the sessions during the year. 
The independent directors met four times during fiscal year 2018. 
Shareholder Communication with Independent Directors 
Shareholders wishing to communicate directly with the independent directors may send correspondence addressed as follows: 
Independent Directors c/o Corporate Secretary 
Sparton Corporation 
425 N. Martingale Road, Suite 1000 
Schaumburg, Illinois 60173-2213  Board Leadership Structure and Board and Committee Information 
Chairman 
Mr. James R. Swartwout has been elected by the directors as the Chairman. The Chairman provides leadership to enhance the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, presides over meetings of the directors, and serves as a liaison between the Board of Directors and management. The Chairman is responsible for determining when to hold, and who shall preside over, executive sessions held by the independent directors. If a shareholder, employee, or third party prefers not to communicate directly with the entire Board of Directors or management, communications may be sent to the Chairman, in care of the Corporate Secretary, using the above address. 
Board and Committee Structure 
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Company's Board of Directors consists of six independent directors, including the Chairman of the Board, Mr. Swartwout, and one non-independent director, Mr. Joseph J. Hartnett, the Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Board of Directors has established four committees, being the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance, and Process Committees, as further described below. Other than the Process Committee, each of the committees is comprised solely of independent directors, and each committee has a different chair. The Company believes that its predominantly independent Board of Directors, mixed with the experience of its non-independent director, constitutes a leadership structure that is most appropriate for the Company and its shareholders. 
The Board of Directors had 19 meetings during fiscal year 2018.

Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee met four times during fiscal year 2018 and is currently comprised of Messrs. Frank A. Wilson (Chairman), Alan L. Bazaar, and James R. Swartwout. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter and oversees auditing, financial reporting and internal control matters regarding accounting and financial controls. It also selects the firm that the Company retains as its independent registered public accountants and recommends the ratification of their selection by the shareholders. The Audit Committee consults with the independent registered public accountants and oversees their audit and other work. The Audit Committee also consults with the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer and oversees those individuals who review the Company's internal controls and compliance with policies. Each member of the Audit Committee is "independent," as defined under the NYSE listing standards. 
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Bazaar, in addition to being "independent," each qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in the SEC Regulation S-K, Item 407(d)(5)(ii). Mr. Wilson's relevant financial experience includes that he is a Certified Public Accountant and has a B.B.A, Accounting, from Baylor University. Mr. Wilson has served as the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of PerkinElmer since 2009 and   retired in 2018. Previously, Mr. Wilson served in various financial management roles over a period of 12 years at the Danaher Corporation. Mr. Bazaar's relevant financial experience includes that he is a Certified Public Accountant and has a MBA from the Stern School of Business at New York University. Mr. Bazaar serves as the Chief Executive Officer of a full-service wealth management firm, Hollow Brook Wealth Management LLC, and he has served as a Managing Director and Portfolio Manager in public equity, in investment decision-making roles and conducting financial and other due diligence. 
For additional detail, see "Director Biographies" below at page 13 describing the members of the Board of Directors and their respective experience, qualifications, attributes and skills. 
The independent registered public accountants have access to the Audit Committee without any other members of management being present. The Audit Committee met with management and the independent registered public accountants before the announcement of earnings each quarter. The Audit Committee also met with the independent registered public accountants without management present on four occasions during fiscal year 2018. The Audit Committee also reviewed the annual consolidated financial statements and annual report on Form 10-K and the Audit Committee report in this Proxy Statement before each was filed with the SEC. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee held three meetings during fiscal year 2018. The Compensation Committee is currently comprised of Messrs. David P. Molfenter (Chairman), Frank A. Wilson and Charles R. Kummeth. The Compensation Committee monitors the remuneration, including any restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options, for the Company's management, including the Named Executive Officers. 
The Compensation Committee may delegate its authority to subcommittees consisting of independent directors and may be assisted on compensation matters by members of the Company's staff. The Compensation Committee may, as needed, employ compensation consultants to assist the committee with its determination of the amount and/or form of executive compensation. The compensation philosophy, the compensation components, and their application as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which appears below, are generally employed by the Compensation Committee in connection with the compensation for all of the executive officers of the Company. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which is currently comprised of Messrs. Alan L. Bazaar (Chairman), James D. Fast, and David P. Molfenter, held three meetings during fiscal year 2018. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews corporate governance documents, and reviews the makeup of the existing Board of Directors and the tenure of its members, consistent with appropriate principles of corporate governance and applicable regulations, and reviews and recommends director remuneration to the full Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also receives candidate resumes, and considers and recommends candidates for election to the Board of Directors consistent with the needs of the Company, regulatory requirements, and the qualifications of the candidates. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has implemented a formal process for consideration of candidates, which is described under "Director Qualifications" below. 
Process Committee 
The Process Committee, which is comprised of Messrs. Alan L. Bazaar, Joseph J. Hartnett, David P. Molfenter, and James R. Swartwout, held eight meetings during fiscal year 2018. The Process Committee operates under a written charter approved by the Board of Directors, and was charged by the Board of Directors with exploring a range of strategic alternatives to determine the best way to enhance shareholder value. The Board retained Wells   Fargo Securities, LLC ("Wells Fargo Securities") and Raymond James & Associates, Inc. ("Raymond James") as financial advisors, and Mayer Brown LLP ("Mayer Brown"), as legal advisor, to assist in this process. Prior to establishment of the Process Committee and when the Board of Directors had a different composition, the Board of Directors had established a Special Committee, but the Special Committee is not currently active. 
On July 7, 2017 the Company, Ultra Electronics Holdings plc ("Ultra"), and Ultra Electronics Aneira, Inc. ("Merger Sub") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") that provides for Ultra to acquire the Company by merging Merger Sub into the Company (such transaction referred to as the "Merger"), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Before entering into the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors, the Process Committee, and the Special Committee extensively reviewed the Company's options to enhance shareholder value. The Board of Directors held 23 meetings, the Special Committee held 8 meetings and the Process Committee held 46 meetings between September 2, 2015 and July 6, 2017 at which the possibility of selling the Company was discussed. The Company's outside legal advisor, Mayer Brown, participated in portions of all but one of these meetings, and one or both of the Company's financial advisors, Wells Fargo Securities and Raymond James, participated in portions of certain of these meetings. 
On October 5, 2017, at a special meeting of holders of shares of common stock of the Company, shareholders voted to adopt the Merger Agreement. Although the Merger Agreement had been adopted by the Company's shareholders, consummation of the Merger remained subject to other closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (or any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the "HSR Act"). 
On March 5, 2018, the Company announced the termination by the Company and Ultra of the Merger Agreement as a result of the staff of the United States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") informing the parties that it intended to recommend that the DOJ block the Merger. Under a Merger Termination Agreement entered into by the Company, Ultra and Merger Sub, the parties agreed to release each other from certain claims and liabilities arising out of or related to the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated therein or thereby, including any termination fees. The parties also agreed that certain agreements with confidentiality obligations will continue in full force and effect. 
As a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company announced that it would seek to re-engage with parties that previously expressed an interest in acquiring all or a part of the Company and that are in a position to expeditiously proceed to effect such a transaction. There can be no assurance that any such process will result in the execution of a definitive agreement or the completion of a transaction. 
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for oversight of risk management. As part of the risk management process, the Company's management team, through its Risk Management Committee, is responsible for identifying and monitoring potential risks facing the Company. The Risk Management Committee's Chairman will rotate annually and various business departments report potential risks to the Chairman on a periodic basis. The Chairman of the Risk Management Committee reviews such potential risks with the Committee and counsel and reports its determinations to the Board of Directors. The Company believes that reviewing risk at the business department level by the Risk Management Committee, as reported to the Board of Directors, provides the Board of Directors with a comprehensive and detailed overview of enterprise risk. 
The Audit Committee is charged with reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the accounting and financial controls, including the Company's systems to monitor, assess and manage financial, business, legal and compliance risk.  Further, the Board of Directors believes that the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors should be separated and, therefore, two different individuals serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. Mr. Joseph J. Hartnett serves as the Company's Interim Chief Executive Officer and Mr. James R. Swartwout serves as the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors. 
The Company's risk structure allows the Company's independent directors to exercise effective oversight of the actions of management, led by Mr. Joseph J. Hartnett as Interim Chief Executive Officer and President, in identifying risks and implementing effective risk management policies and controls. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines and Charters 
The Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines applicable to the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the Guidelines annually to determine whether to recommend changes to the Board of Directors to reflect new laws, rules and regulations and developing governance practices. The Guidelines address several key areas of corporate governance, including the Company's governance philosophy, director responsibilities, Board of Directors composition, Board of Directors meetings and committees, director independence, and director compensation. The Guidelines are available on the Company's website, www.sparton.com. 
In addition to the Guidelines, the Board of Directors adopted charters for the Compensation, Audit, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees addressing corporate governance issues. These charters address issues such as independence of the committee members, committee organization and powers, member qualifications, duties and responsibilities, and corporate governance. 
As of July 1, 2018, all members of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees were independent directors. Copies of the charters for each of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees are located on the Company's website, www.sparton.com. The Company continues to develop and refine its corporate governance policies and practices and their place within the committee structure of the Board of Directors. 
The Board of Directors has determined that maintaining an Executive Committee as a standing committee is not necessary, in part due to the smaller size of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will continue to review whether or not it is appropriate to re-establish an Executive Committee in the future. 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
The Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets forth the Company's corporate values. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics governs the actions and working relationships of the Company's employees, officers and directors, and sets forth the standard of conduct of the Company's business at the highest ethical level and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 
To the extent any waiver is granted with respect to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that requires disclosure under applicable SEC rules, such waiver will also be posted on the Company's website, as will any amendment that may be adopted from time to time. 
Additionally, the Company has established the following statement of its "Corporate Values": 
"We demand performance excellence in all that we do." 
"We demand integrity of ourselves, our products, and our services."  "We foster growth and success in an environment of teamwork, collaboration, empowerment, and accountability." 
"We develop long term, trusting relationships to ensure mutually profitable growth." 
"We will maintain a safe and environmentally sound workplace." 
"We will be good corporate citizens in the communities in which we reside." 
Whistleblower Provisions 
It is the Company's policy to encourage its employees and other persons to disclose improper activities, and to address complaints alleging acts of reprisal or intimidation resulting from disclosure of improper activities. Individuals wishing to report improper activities may call the Company's Whistleblower service at 1-800-488-1933 (from within the United States) or 1-800-4818 (from Vietnam). Activities may be reported anonymously if desired. 
Director Attendance at Meetings 
All directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and committees on which they serve during fiscal year 2018. In addition, the directors are expected to attend the Annual Meeting. At the Company's 2017 Annual Meeting of the Shareholders, all of the directors serving at that time were in attendance. Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines our directors are encouraged to attend director education programs on an annual basis. 
Director Qualifications 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing with the Board of Directors, from time to time, the appropriate qualities, skills and characteristics desired for members of the Board of Directors in the context of the current make-up of the Board of Directors. This assessment includes consideration of the following summary of qualifications that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes must be met by all directors, as well as the following considerations for the composition of the Board of Directors as a whole:

[END TABLE]

Process for Identifying and Evaluating Director Nominees 
The Board of Directors is responsible for selecting director candidates. The Board of Directors delegates the identification, recruitment and recommendation of director nominees to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, with the expectation that other members of the Board of Directors and management will be requested to take part in the process as appropriate. 
When it is determined by the Board of Directors that a new director or nominee is to be recruited, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee undertakes a candidate selection process. The Committee maintains a selection criteria document, which has been approved by the Board of Directors and which the Committee reviews regularly to ensure that it is applicable. The criteria include both general criteria that all candidates must meet and specific criteria regarding skill or background that are desirable to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, with the counsel of the full Board of Directors, determines which specific background should be represented in the candidate. The criteria are then given to a professional recruiter who specializes in board placements and a search is commenced. Potential candidates known to existing directors or suggested by shareholders who are believed to meet the criteria may be suggested to the recruiting agency for inclusion in the initial pool of candidates. Once candidates have been identified, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee confirms that the candidates meet all of the qualifications for director nominees established by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Based on the results of an evaluation process, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends candidates for the Board of Directors' approval as director nominees for election to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also recommends candidates for the Board of Directors' appointments to the committees of the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has included in its search criteria the need for diverse candidates to be recruited and considered. 
Procedure for Recommendation of Director Nominees by Shareholders 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates who are recommended by shareholders of the Company. As required by Article I, Section 10 of the Company's Code of Regulations, to recommend a nominee, a shareholder should write to the Company's Corporate Secretary at 425 N. Martingale Road, Suite 1000, Schaumburg, Illinois 60173-2213. Under the Code of Regulations, to be considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for nomination and inclusion in the Company's Proxy Statement for its Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a shareholder recommendation for a director must be received by the Company's Secretary no later than 120 days nor more than 240 days prior to the one year anniversary of the preceding Annual Meeting. 
Any recommendation must include (i) all information relating to such nominee that is required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of   directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (ii) a description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings during the past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among such shareholder and beneficial owner, if any, and their respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the one hand, and each proposed nominee, and his or her respective affiliates and associates, or others acting in concert therewith, on the other hand, including without limitation all information that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule 404 of Regulation S-K; (iii) a representation of the shareholder that he or she intends to appear at the annual meeting to bring such nomination or other business before the annual meeting; and (iv) such other information as may reasonably be required by the Board of Directors as described in the Company's proxy statement for the preceding year's annual meeting. The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Company to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as an independent director of the Company or that could be material to a reasonable shareholder's understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee. 
Further information regarding shareholder recommendation of director candidates is contained in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, which is available at the Company's website at www.sparton.com. 
Assuming the appropriate information is provided for candidates submitted by shareholders, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate those candidates by following the same process, and applying the same criteria, as for candidates submitted by members of the Board of Directors. All director nominees recommended for election at the Annual Meeting are current members of the Board of Directors. 
Shareholder Communications Policy 
Shareholders should communicate with the Board of Directors by sending a letter to the Sparton Corporation Board of Directors, c/o the Corporate Secretary, 425 N. Martingale Road, Suite 1000, Schaumburg, Illinois 60173-2213. The Corporate Secretary will receive the correspondence and forward it to the director or directors to whom the communication is directed, unless the communication is unduly hostile, threatening, harassing, illegal, not reasonably related to the Company or its business, or similarly inappropriate. The Corporate Secretary has the authority to discard or disregard any inappropriate communications (other than a proposal submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, or any communication made in connection with such a proposal) or to take other appropriate actions with respect to any such inappropriate communications. In addition, the Corporate Secretary is authorized to forward communications that are clearly more appropriately addressed by other departments, such as customer service or accounting, to the appropriate department. The foregoing instructions by the directors to the Corporate Secretary are subject to change by the directors. Additionally, all communications are available to any director who wishes to review them.

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Director Nominees 
Our Code of Regulations provides that our Board of Directors will consist of not less than seven members, but our Board of Directors is authorized to fix and change the actual number of our directors from time to time. Our Code of Regulations also provides that a person shall not be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation if at the time of such election that person has reached the age of 73. After careful consideration of the Company's governance documents, Mr. Molfenter and the Board of Directors determined he would not run given he has reached the age of 73, and the Board of Directors reduced the number of directors to six. 
Messrs. Alan L. Bazaar, James D. Fast, Joseph J. Hartnett, Charles R. Kummeth, James R. Swartwout, and Frank A. Wilson, current directors whose terms of office expire at the Annual Meeting, are nominees for election to a one year term expiring in 2019 and the election and qualification of their successors. The nominations were made by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. 
It is believed that all six nominees are, and will be at the time of the Annual Meeting, available for election; and, if elected, will serve. Each of the nominees has consented to being named a nominee in this Proxy Statement and has agreed to serve as a director, if elected at the Annual Meeting. However, in the event one or more of them is or should become unavailable, or should decline to serve, it is intended that the proxies will be voted for the balance of the nominees and for such substitute nominee or nominees as the Board of Directors may in its discretion select. 
Vote Required for Approval 
Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote for each of the six director positions being filled at the Annual Meeting. In order to elect a nominee as a director of the Company, he or she must receive a greater number of votes cast "FOR" his or her election than "AGAINST" his or her election. Shares not voted at the Annual Meeting, whether by abstention, broker non-vote, or otherwise, will have no effect on the election of directors. See "Outstanding Stock and Voting Rights – Quorum and Vote Required" at page 3 for additional information. 
Board Recommendations 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the election of each of the six nominees, Alan L. Bazaar, James D. Fast, Joseph J. Hartnett, Charles R. Kummeth, James R. Swartwout, and Frank A. Wilson. 
Unless otherwise directed by marking the accompanying proxy, the proxy holders named therein will vote FOR the election of the six nominees. 
Director Biographies 
The following table summarizes the specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors to conclude that the following individuals should serve as directors are set forth opposite each individual's name. The Company's Board of Directors consists primarily of individuals with broad leadership and business skills, as detailed below, who have relevant experience with companies ranging in size from smaller to much larger than the Company, including individuals who have served as chief executive officers and chief financial officers of such companies. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors consider the skill sets both individually and as a whole in considering who to recommend as nominees. The Board of Directors believes that all of the members of the Board of Directors have the highest professional and personal ethics and values.

Relationship with Independent Registered Public Accountants 
The Audit Committee appoints the independent registered public accounting firm to serve as the Company's independent registered public accountant. BDO USA, LLP ("BDO USA") is currently the independent registered public accountant for the Company. In addition to performing the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements, BDO USA provided various other services during fiscal year 2018. The Audit Committee has considered the provision of all non-audit services performed by BDO USA during fiscal year 2018 with respect to maintaining auditor independence. The Audit Committee reviewed and pre-approved all professional services requested of, and performed by, BDO USA. The aggregate fees billed for fiscal year 2018 and 2017 for each of the following categories of services are set forth below. 
Pursuant to the Pre-Approval Policy, the Audit Committee annually reviews and pre-approves the services that may be provided by the independent registered public accountant, and such services are considered approved through the next annual review. The Audit Committee revises the list of pre-approved services from time to time based on subsequent determinations. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to its Chairman. The Chairman shall report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Pre-Approval Policy for audit and non-audit services is available on the Company's website at www.sparton.com.

Vote Required for Approval 
On August 21, 2018, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors agreed to recommend the appointment of the accounting firm of BDO USA as the independent registered public accountants for the Company for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, and, on October 31, 2018, the Board of Directors approved such appointment. The Board of Directors is asking the shareholders to ratify the appointment of BDO USA. 
Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote for this Proposal. In order to be adopted, this Proposal must be ratified by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote thereon present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes are not counted for purposes of this Proposal. Abstentions have the same effect as a vote against this Proposal. Because this vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board of Directors. However, the Board of Directors values the opinion of its shareholders and, in the event that the shareholders do not ratify the appointment by approving this Proposal 2, the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee will consider the selection of other independent registered public accountants. 
Board Recommendation 
The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the ratification of the selection of BDO USA, LLP by an advisory vote. 
Representatives of BDO USA, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.  PROPOSAL 3 
ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
The Company has designed its executive compensation program to attract, motivate, retain and reward its senior management in order to achieve the Company's corporate objectives and increase value for our shareholders. The Company believes that its compensation policies and procedures are centered on a pay-for-performance philosophy and are aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. 
The Company is presenting the following proposal, as required under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which gives each shareholder the opportunity to have a voice and endorse or not endorse the Company's executive compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers by voting for or against the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related compensation tables and the narrative discussion, is hereby approved." 
As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this Proxy Statement, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors believes that the executive compensation for fiscal year 2018 is justified by the performance of the Company in a very competitive environment, is reasonable and is the result of a carefully considered approach. 
In deciding how to vote on this Proposal, the Company urges you to consider the various factors regarding compensation matters as discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Your vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our Named Executive Officers and the compensation policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board of Directors. However, our Board of Directors values your opinion and the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
Vote Required for Approval 
Approval of the proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to be voted on the proposal at the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes are not counted for purposes of this Proposal. Abstentions have the same effect as a vote against this Proposal. 
Board Recommendation 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" approval of the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers as set forth in Proposal 3.  STOCK OWNERSHIP AND SECTION 16 COMPLIANCE

 Executive Summary 
In this section, we describe the material components of our executive compensation program for our Named Executive Officers, whose compensation is set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and other compensation tables contained in this Proxy Statement: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Joseph J. Hartnett, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer;  
• Joseph G. McCormack, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer;  
• Gordon B. Madlock, Senior Vice President, Operations;  
• Steven M. Korwin, Senior Vice President, Quality and Engineering;  
• Michael A. Gaul, Group Vice President, Manufacturing and Design Services; and  
• Joseph T. Schneider, former Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing.  
[END TABLE]
Mr. Schneider resigned as Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing of the Company effective April 13, 2018, but is included as a Named Executive Officer in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
We also provide an overview of our executive compensation philosophy and our executive compensation program. In addition, we explain how and why the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors (the "Committee") arrives at specific compensation policies and decisions involving the Named Executive Officers.
2018 Key Compensation Highlights  
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Committee identified our 14 key peer companies based on Committee-selected criteria.  
• The Committee continued alignment of short term and long term incentive plan goals with the achievement of specific annual and long term financial  goals.  
• The Committee completed the annual review of the Compensation Committee Charter.  
• The Committee reviewed Named Executive Officer stock ownership progress.  
• The Committee actively worked with management to retain and motivate employees during the process of marketing the Company for sale.   
• The Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors approved, the issuance of (i) cash retention bonuses and (ii) discretionary bonuses to  certain key employees.  
• The Committee conducts an annual review and approval of the Company's compensation strategy, including a review of the Company's  compensation-related risk profile, to ensure that compensation-related risks are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  
• The Company maintains a clawback policy that provides that, in connection with any restatement of the Company's financial statements due to  material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements, it is the Company's policy to require forfeiture by current and former executive officers of incentive-based compensation in accordance with  applicable laws, rules and regulations.  
[END TABLE]
Consideration of Last Year's "Say On Pay" Vote 
Following our annual meeting of shareholders in November 2017, the Committee reviewed the results of the shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation that was held at the meeting with respect to the fiscal year 2017 compensation of the Named Executive Officers. 97.6 percent of the votes cast (excluding broker non-votes) were voted in support of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers set forth in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2017 Summary Compensation Table and the related compensation tables and narratives in last year's proxy statement. 
After considering the results of the 2017 Say On Pay vote, which indicate that our shareholders overwhelmingly approve of our methodology for establishing compensation, as well as the other factors considered in determining executive compensation as described in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Committee was encouraged to continue its practices in determining executive compensation.  Specific Compensation and Corporate Governance Policies and Practices 
Our compensation philosophy and related governance features are complemented by several specific policies and practices that are designed to align our executive compensation with long-term shareholder interests, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers and members of our Board of Directors, that are  applicable within five years of eligibility under the LTIP for the Named Executive Officers and within five years of Board of Directors appointment for our directors. Each of the members of our Board of Directors has met his individual stock  ownership level under the guidelines in effect for fiscal year 2018, except for Mr. Frank A. Wilson who joined the Board of Directors in fiscal year 2015, and Alan L. Bazaar who joined the Board of Directors in fiscal year 2016.  Mr. Steven M. Korwin is the only Named Executive Officer who has met these guidelines for fiscal year 2018. Mr. Joseph J. Hartnett, as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, is not eligible for the LTIP,  Mr. Joseph G. McCormack was hired in fiscal year 2016, and Mr. Joseph T. Schneider was hired in fiscal year 2015 and resigned his position on April 13, 2018. The guidelines were revised in June of 2014, as described below.  As a result of the potential sale of the Company, executive officers and the Board of Directors have been prohibited from acquiring or disposing of Company stock.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have a policy prohibiting all employees, including Named Executive Officers and members of our Board of Directors, from engaging in any hedging  transactions with respect to our equity securities held by them.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Under our Insider Trading Policy, certain of our employees and consultants, including executive officers and members of our Board of Directors, are  prohibited from pledging shares of our capital stock without first obtaining pre-clearance of the transaction from our Compliance Officer. None of these covered individuals have pledged their stock.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Executive Officers, including the Named Executive Officers, receive minimal perquisites or other personal benefits.  
[END TABLE]
CEO Pay Ratio 
The following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of the CEO, Joseph Hartnett, for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2018 is set forth below as required by Section 953(b) of Dodd-Frank and the applicable rules of the SEC. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median of the annual total compensation of all of Sparton's employees (other than Mr. Hartnett) was $41,413.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual total compensation of Mr. Hartnett as reported in the "Total" column of the Summary Compensation Table in this Proxy  Statement which was calculated in accordance with Item 402(c) of Regulation S-K was $1,052,210.  
[END TABLE]
The CEO's annual total compensation is twenty-five times or 25:1 the median annual total compensation of all employees. The methodology used to establish the median employee was to compile the data from the Sparton payroll systems. The date selected for the purpose of median employee calculations was May 25, 2018. Sparton had a total of 1,400 U.S. employees and 171 non-U.S. employees, including 155 employees in Vietnam and 16 employees in Canada as of such date. The only exclusion to the employee population in the calculation of the pay ratio was the Woodbridge Canada facility that employs a total of 16 employees who were excluded under the 5% de minimis exemption for non-U.S. employees. All other employees except the CEO were included in the median population. The pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by us, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios.

 Key Features of Our 2018 Executive Compensation Program   
 Key Features of Our 2018 Executive Compensation Program   
 What We Do   Align CEO Pay with Company Performance: Our CEO's direct compensation is aligned with revenue growth and profitability (other than base salary and retention bonus during the potential sale  of the Company).   Review Named Executive Officer  Pay against Peers' Executive Officer Pay: In fiscal year 2016, a reputable executive compensation consultant, Meridian Compensation  Partners, LLC, was engaged to provide the Committee with broad market-based compensation data of peer group companies based on Committee-selected criteria to permit the Committee to analyze whether the total compensation of the Name Executive  Officers is competitive. In fiscal years 2017 and 2018, in light of the potential sale of the Company, the Committee did not engage Meridian, however, the committee continued to refer to data previously provided by Meridian.   Use Long-Term Incentives to Link a Significant Portion of  All Current Named Executive Officer Pay to Company Performance: Historically, 33% of annual pay for our Named Executive Officers has been  linked to either our long term Valuation Index or stock options related to vesting of awards granted under our 2010 LTIP. The components and calculations of these programs correlate directly to the profitability growth of the Company. The Deferred  Compensation Plan adopted in fiscal 2014, as amended, permits participants to defer certain aspects of their compensation, creating additional incentive to focus on long-term planning. In light of the potential sale of the Company, no LTIP awards  were granted; rather, the Company paid retention bonuses to certain executives and key employees, including the Named Executive Officers.   Balance Short-Term and Long-Term Incentives: The incentive programs provide an appropriate balance of annual and long-term incentives and include multiple measures of financial performance.   Cap Short Term Incentive Awards: Awards under our annual Short Term Incentive Plan are capped at 200% of target.   Mitigate Excessive Risk-taking Behaviors by  Named Executive Officers: Our executive compensation program includes features that reduce the possibility of our Named  Executive Officers, either individually or as a group, making excessively risky business decisions that could maximize short-term results at the expense of long-term value.     What We Don't Do   Determine Named Executive Officer Pay based only on External Market Compensation Data: The Committee and Board of Directors have approved compensation for our Named Executive Officers both above and below the external market data points.  These decisions are individually based upon job scope, job performance, years of related work experience, annual company performance, and our talent attraction and retention strategies.   No Hedging of Company Stock: Our Named Executive Officers are prohibited from hedging their company stock.   No Tax Gross Ups: We do not provide tax reimbursements unless they are provided pursuant to our standard relocation practices.

The Committee seeks to reward performance with cost-effective compensation that aligns employee efforts with our corporate strategy through adherence to the following compensation policies:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An element of pay should be long-term incentives to align management interests with those of our shareholders.  
[END TABLE]

• Total compensation opportunities should enhance our ability to attract, retain and develop knowledgeable and experienced executives.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total compensation should be competitive in the marketplace based on a review of similarly sized manufacturers and identified peer companies and the  comparable compensation paid to executives of such similarly sized manufacturers and peer companies.  
[END TABLE]
Our overall compensation philosophy is generally to pay our employees, including Named Executive Officers, competitively based on market data and commensurate with our performance. The market data includes information such as salary reports for the manufacturing industry generally and specifically for peer companies. The Committee and Board of Directors, with input from management, use the market data points to determine what fair and reasonable compensation would be based on our performance. The Committee also consults with management, and outside accounting and legal advisors as appropriate. The Committee and Board of Directors have approved compensation to our management both above and below the market data points. See the narrative discussion below for a detailed discussion of our long-term and short-term incentive plans. 
Importance of Our Corporate Values 
The Sparton Corporate Values guide us in fulfilling our responsibilities to our customers, employees, communities, and shareholders. 
Sparton Corporate Values 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Performance Excellence: We demand performance excellence in all that we do.  
● Integrity: We demand integrity of ourselves, our products, and our services.  
● Teamwork & Accountability: We foster growth and success in an environment of teamwork, collaboration,  empowerment, and accountability.  
● Growth: We develop long term, trusting relationships to ensure mutually profitable growth.  
● Safety: We will maintain a safe and environmentally sound workplace.  
● Citizenship: We will be good corporate citizens in the communities in which we reside.  
[END TABLE]
In assessing our Named Executive Officers' contributions to Sparton's performance, the Committee not only looks to results-oriented measures of performance, but also considers how those results were achieved – whether the decisions and actions leading to the results were consistent with the values embodied in our Corporate Values   – and the long-term impact of a Named Executive Officer's decisions. Corporate Values-based behavior is not something that can be precisely measured; thus, there is no formula for how Corporate Values-based behavior can, or will, impact an executive's compensation. The Committee and the CEO use their judgment and experience to evaluate whether an executive's actions were aligned with our Corporate Values. 
How We Make Compensation Decisions 
Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Committee is comprised of three independent directors, as defined under the rules of the NYSE. The Committee is responsible for the review and approval of all aspects of our executive compensation program. Among its duties, the Committee is responsible for formulating the compensation recommendations for our CEO and non-CEO executive officers. The recommendation of the Committee must be approved, with respect to the CEO, by the independent directors of the Board of Directors, and with respect to the non-CEO executive officers, by the full Board of Directors. In addition, the Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviews our incentive and compensation plans and programs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Evaluates annually the CEO's and non-Executive Officers' compensation levels and payouts against  various financial and non-financial measures.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee is supported in its work by our CEO and Compensation Consultants, as described below. 
The Committee's charter, which sets out its duties and responsibilities and addresses other matters, can be found on our website at www.sparton.com. 
Role of the Chief Executive Officer 
Each year our CEO makes recommendations with respect to the compensation of our non-CEO executive officers and our Committee reviews these recommendations with the CEO and the appropriate human resources personnel. The CEO's recommendations are based upon his assessment of each executive officer's performance, the performance of the individual executive officer's respective business or function, and employee retention considerations. Our Committee reviews the CEO's recommendations, and approves any compensation changes affecting our executive officers as it determines in its sole discretion. Our CEO does not play any role with respect to any matter affecting his own compensation. 
Peer Companies 
Our executive compensation package is designed to be competitive in the market and commensurate with our performance. In making compensation decisions, we analyze executive compensation paid at selected peer companies. In fiscal year 2016, Meridian provided our Committee with a list of potential peer companies based on their 8 digit GICS codes, revenue, and market cap. The Committee reviewed this list and then selected the peer companies it believes are most comparable to us. The Committee then requested that Meridian provide it with compensation information, including incentive awards, from such peer companies. In fiscal year 2018, the Committee did not engage Meridian, but continued to use certain of the previously provided data and other appropriate compensation information in making compensation decisions. In reviewing such data, the Company revised the list of peer companies based on certain changes in the ownership and business focus of those companies since its prior assessment. The annual revenues of the peer companies during their most recent fiscal year ranged from $82 million to $1,462 million, with the median revenue being $377 million. Our annual revenue for fiscal year 2018 was $375 million.  The Committee uses the data obtained from Meridian, proxy statements of peer companies, and broad-based market driven compensation surveys published from time to time by national human resources consulting firms, together with other information, to assist it in determining the compensation of the Named Executive Officers. The Committee does not target compensation to any specific percentile paid by such peer or other companies, but rather considers compensation of peer and such other companies as one of the factors in making compensation decisions. As noted, the Committee approves compensation to the Named Executive Officers both above and below market data points. 
For 2018 executive compensation, our peer companies were:

Elements of Compensation 
The key elements of our executive compensation program are base salary, short-term (annual) incentive and long-term (multi-year) incentive compensation. These elements are addressed separately below. 
The Committee does not exclusively use mathematical formulas to determine compensation. In setting each element of compensation, the Committee considers all elements of an executive's total compensation package, including base salary, incentive compensation, and the value of benefits.  The following table includes various elements of our executive compensation program, the primary purpose of each element, and form of compensation for each element. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Base Salaries 
A competitive base salary provides the foundation for a total compensation package required to attract, retain, and motivate executive officers and other members of management, including the Named Executive Officers, in alignment with our business strategies. The Committee reviews the proposed annual base salaries for executive officers and management (including the Named Executive Officers other than the Chief Executive Officer) with the Chief Executive Officer and the appropriate human resources personnel, and with modifications considered appropriate, provides a recommendation to the Board of Directors for its approval. The Committee independently reviews and sets base salary for the Chief Executive Officer, subject to the approval of the independent members of the Board of Directors. 
Base salaries are initially premised upon the responsibilities of each Named Executive Officer and may be further adjusted based on market surveys and related data, including individual experience levels and performance judgments as to the past and expected future contributions of the applicable Named Executive Officer. The Committee reviews each Named Executive Officer's base salary annually. 
Short-Term Incentives 
STIP Generally 
On June 26, 2009, the Board of Directors approved and adopted the Sparton Short-Term Incentive Plan (the "STIP"). The STIP did not require shareholder approval. On April 28, 2016, the Board of Directors approved and   adopted the First Amendment to the STIP, which provides for pro rata payment of awards to certain employees upon a change of control, as defined in the Amendment. The purpose of the STIP is to increase shareholder value and ensure our success by motivating participants to achieve all defined financial and operating goals and strategic objectives of the business in line with our corporate strategy. The STIP is further intended to attract and retain key employees essential to the success of the business and to provide competitive compensation programs consistent with market competitive pay practices. 
The Committee has been appointed by the Board of Directors to administer the STIP. The Committee, with the approval of the Board of Directors, annually selects our executive or key employees, including Named Executive Officers, to be participants in the STIP. The first annual performance period for which awards under the STIP were made was fiscal year 2010. 
The Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may amend or terminate the STIP, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason. The amendment, suspension or termination of the STIP will not, without the consent of the participant, alter or impair any rights or obligations under any actual incentive award previously earned by such participant. No award may be granted during any period of suspension or after termination of the STIP. The STIP will remain in effect until terminated. 
As discussed above, our overall compensation philosophy, including with respect to awards under the STIP, is generally to pay our employees competitively based on market data, and commensurate with our performance which is aligned to achieve our corporate strategy. Working together, the Committee along with the Chief Executive Officer and the appropriate human resources personnel, reviews the individual incentive plans and awards to be made to executives and key employees under the STIP (other than the Chief Executive Officer, whose awards are only reviewed by the Committee). The recommendations of the Committee are subject to approval of the Board of Directors. 
How Awards Are Determined Under the STIP 
The Committee, subject to approval by the Board of Directors, establishes an individual target award for each participant equal to a percentage of such participant's salary. The Chief Executive Officer (other than with respect to himself) and the appropriate human resources personnel, recommend, and the Committee, in its sole discretion, considers, determines and approves the performance goals and objectives applicable to any actual incentive award. The performance goals and objectives are driven by achievement of our corporate strategy and may be on the basis of any performance factors the Committee determines relevant, including individual, business unit or Company-wide performance. Failure to meet the performance goals and objectives of the annual performance period will result in the participant's failure to earn the actual incentive award, except as otherwise determined by the Committee. Actual incentive award payments will be determined, based on verified achievement levels of established performance goals and objectives for the annual performance period, by the Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. 
For each annual performance period, the Committee, subject to approval by the Board of Directors, establishes an incentive award pool (the "STIP Pool") based on achievement of the financial objectives. Payment of each actual incentive award is made as soon as practicable as determined by the Committee after the completion of the independent audit and filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the annual performance period during which the actual performance award was earned. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, to receive payment of an actual incentive award, a participant must be employed by the Company or any affiliate on the last day of the annual performance period, and, subject to certain exceptions in the event of a participant's death or disability, on the date of payment of the actual incentive award. Actual incentive awards are paid from the incentive award pool in cash in a single lump sum. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant an award for an extraordinary individual contribution which substantially benefits the Company but is not reflected in the achievement of a participant's individual goals.  2018 STIP Awards 
The Committee, with the approval of the Board of Directors, selected 87 key employees, including certain of the Named Executive Officers, to be participants in the STIP for the annual performance period ending July 1, 2018 and established target awards for that period in line with our corporate strategy based on EBITDA and Net Sales (each term as defined below) and personal objectives, the funding for which came from the STIP Pool. The individual target award percentages for these participants ranged from 10% to 45% of a participant's base salary. These components were weighted separately for each participant. Awards were payable on a graduated scale ranging from a threshold of 50% of the target award for each component up to a maximum of 200% of the target award for that component, subject to availability of funds under the STIP Pool. No award for a component was payable if performance was below the threshold. The STIP Pool for fiscal year 2018 was set at $2,971,354, assuming achievement of 100% of the target financial objective described under "Target for Objectives under the STIP," below. In addition, the Committee, with the approval of the Board of Directors, guaranteed STIP payments at 100% of targeted award for retention purposes. For the fiscal 2018 STIP awards, the Committee, with the approval of the Board of Directors, recommended and the Company granted a minimum STIP payout to participants equal to 100% of target, with the exception of Mr. Madlock for which this target was set at $120,000 (39% of base salary). In addition, the Committee, with the approval of the Board of Directors, recommended and the Company granted Mr.  Hartnett a $450,000 discretionary bonus under the STIP. 
Target Awards as a Percentage of Base Salary under the STIP. The following table sets forth the target awards for each of the Named Executive Officers as a percentage of their base salaries for fiscal year 2018:

Fiscal Year 2019 STIP Awards 
On August 22, 2018, the Committee, with the approval of the Board of Directors, approved financial targets for awards for fiscal year 2019 under the STIP for the Named Executive Officers. The awards are based on achieving targets for EBITDA and Net Sales for fiscal year 2019. The STIP Pool for the Company for fiscal year 2019 was set at $2,539,139, assuming achievement of 100% of the targets by all participating key employees. For retention purposes, the participants, including named executive officers, are guaranteed a minimum payout of 100% of target if they remain employed by the Company in September 2019. Targets for Messrs. McCormack, Madlock and Korwin were set at $150,000, $120,000 and $120,000, respectively. Additionally, if the Company is sold during fiscal 2019, participants would be paid 50% of the targeted STIP if they are employed by the Company at the time of sale. Additional detail regarding such awards, including actual awards in fiscal year 2019, will be included in the next annual proxy statement. 
Fiscal Year 2017 STIP Awards 
For fiscal 2017 STIP awards, non-executive participants were paid 100% of the target awards as a retention measure. As a result, additional STIP awards in the amount of $745,000 were paid in fiscal 2018. 
Bonuses 
The Committee may recommend bonuses in addition to or in lieu of bonuses earned under the STIP based on the Committee's evaluation of the individual performance and level of responsibility of the Named Executive Officers and other members of management. In determining discretionary annual incentive bonuses for the Named Executive Officers, the Committee evaluates the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations based on   individual performance. The Committee independently evaluates the individual performance of the Chief Executive Officer. The results of those evaluations are used by the Committee to recommend bonuses for the Named Executive Officers to the Board of Directors. 
Retention Bonuses 
On April 25, 2018, the Committee, with the approval of the Board of Directors, approved and adopted a cash retention bonus pool. Under the arrangement, the Company will pay certain executives and key employees a cash retention bonus, in the event that the participant remains continuously employed with the Company and there is no Change in Control (as defined in the 2010 LTIP) prior to September 14, 2019 or earlier in the event the participant is involuntarily terminated after June 30, 2018. 
Participants employed on or after June 30, 2018 and involuntarily terminated prior to September 14, 2019 will be entitled to 50% of the approved cash retention bonus plus a pro rata portion of the remaining 50%. Each participant's pro rata portion will be equal to the number of full calendar months that have elapsed during the period June 30, 2018 through August 31, 2019, including the calendar month in which the termination occurs, divided by 14 (which is the number of calendar months occurring during the period June 30, 2018 through August 31, 2019). 
Participants who remain employed by the Company through September 14, 2019 will receive payment on that date or within 14 days of involuntary termination if termination occurs during the period June 30, 2018 through September 14, 2019. 
Participants in the arrangement include the Principal Financial Officer and certain of the Named Executive Officers. For a description of the amounts of potential retention bonuses due to the Principal Financial Officer and certain of the Named Executive Officers, see "Employment Agreements and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" below. 
Long-Term Incentives 
Our long-term incentive program historically involved the grant of restricted stock. During fiscal year 2015, the Committee worked with Meridian to better align the types of equity awarded under the 2010 LTIP with the market, and recommended to the Board of Directors that future awards include a mix of restricted stock units and options. The grants are designed to (i) align the interest of our key employees with our shareholders through the employees' ownership of equity, (ii) accomplish our corporate strategy by requiring the vesting of such awards to be tied to the achievement of certain performance goals, and (iii) encourage the long-term employment of key employees. 
Due to the potential sale of the Company, no awards under the 2010 LTIP were made for the 2018 fiscal year. 
The Company annually reviews the long-term incentive elements of its compensation package, including the beneficial and detrimental aspects of particular compensation components such as restricted stock awards and stock options, to determine the continuing efficacy of such programs. 
2010 LTIP 
In keeping with our philosophy of providing a total compensation package that includes long-term incentives, the total compensation package of our key employees, including our Named Executive Officers, may include restricted stock, stock options, restricted stock units and/or cash under the Sparton Corporation 2010 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the "2010 LTIP"). On August 20, 2014, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the 2010 LTIP to permit awards of restricted stock units. The Company previously awarded long-term incentives under the Sparton Corporation Stock Incentive Plan, as amended in October 2001 (the "2001 SIP"), but as of October 2011 the Company was no longer permitted to make new awards under the 2001 SIP.  The total number of shares that may be awarded under the 2010 LTIP is 1,000,000 shares of common stock, 557,141 of which remain available for awards as of the date hereof. To the extent that any award is forfeited, terminates, expires or lapses without exercise or settlement under the 2010 LTIP, the shares subject to such awards forfeited or not delivered as a result thereof will again be available for awards under the 2010 LTIP. 
As previously discussed during fiscal year 2018, we did not grant any awards under the 2010 LTIP. 
The restricted stock units previously granted vest in four equal annual installments, with the first installment commencing one year after the awards are made, with the exception of a grant of 25,000 restricted stock units to Joseph Hartnett on August 8, 2016 that vested upon the earliest of (i) a change of control, (ii) Sparton's appointment of a permanent chief executive officer, (iii) Sparton's termination of Mr. Hartnett without cause, and (iv) March 1, 2017. Of the restricted stock unit awards that were granted in fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017, as of July 1, 2018 none of those units have vested, other than the award to Mr. Hartnett. Other than the award to Mr. Hartnett, the restricted stock unit awards are performance based in that vesting is dependent upon achievement of the Valuation Index. The stock options also vest in four equal annual installments, with the first installment commencing one year after the awards are made other than 24,808 stock options awarded in fiscal 2015 that vest in three equal annual installments, with the first installment commencing one year after the awards are made. Of the stock options that were granted in fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017, as of July 1, 2018, 175,233 of the option shares have been forfeited and 47,625 of the options have vested. The stock option awards are time-based only and are not based on achieving the Valuation Index. 
Prior to fiscal year 2015, restricted stock awards (and no restricted stock units or stock options) were granted in fiscal years 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014 under the 2010 LTIP and the 2001 SIP and, as of July 1, 2018, 199,805 of those shares have vested. 
In order for the recipient's restricted stock, restricted stock units and/or option shares to vest, he or she must be an employee when the Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed for the applicable year. See footnote 1 under "Table – Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control," for a description of acceleration of vesting under the 2010 LTIP upon a termination or change in control as determined at the discretion of the Committee. 
The Valuation Index is based on a formula determined by the Committee in consultation with Meridian which incorporates various financial metrics which the Committee believes are critical to improving our long term enterprise value and increasing shareholder value, including EBITDA, cash, outstanding debt, dividends, and the weighted average of outstanding shares of our common stock. The target Valuation Index increases in each of the four annual vesting periods based on a growth rate determined by the Committee. Should we fail to achieve the required Valuation Index in any of the respective periods, the awards allow for vesting in subsequent years should we achieve certain future Valuation Index targets. 
We designed the Valuation Index growth rates to reflect an aggressive, but reasonably achievable, increase in enterprise value over the previous fiscal year. Based upon the fiscal year 2018 financial results and resulting Valuation Index calculations, the following vesting has occurred in the LTIP program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Fiscal Year 2019 Awards under the 2010 LTIP 
For the 2019 fiscal year, awards will be made under the 2010 LTIP only in the event of a termination of the exploration of a sale of the Company. Such awards would be time-based over a 2 year period with 50% earned in June 2019 and 50% in June 2020. The number of shares to be granted would be based on the fair market value of our shares determined two (2) days after an announcement of the termination of the sales process. The amount of the awards were determined by the Committee, with input from the Chief Executive Officer, and after taking into account market data, responsibilities and performance of an executive, our consolidated financial projections, business unit financial projections, and the potential sale of the Company, recommended, for Board of Directors approval, a dollar value award for certain executives which will be payable in restricted stock units. 
Allocation of Compensation Components 
We use a balanced approach in compensating company executives, combining fixed and performance-based compensation, annual and long-term compensation, and cash and equity compensation. The Committee determines the appropriate balance, as approved by the Board of Directors, based upon careful consideration, including consideration of market data provided by independent compensation consultants. We do not have a specific policy for allocation of compensation components. The following chart sets forth the allocation of compensation components for the Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2018, using fixed salary, cash-based discretionary and retention awards, stock awards, incentive components at target, and grant date fair values of restricted stock units as of July 1, 2018: 
For fiscal year 2018, 22% of the compensation components for the Named Executive Officers (other than the Interim Chief Executive Officer) were variable and tied to performance. 
Mr. Schneider resigned as Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing of the Company effective April 13, 2018.  Post-Employment Compensation 
Retirement Plans 
We maintain a 401(k) plan that is available to substantially all U.S. employees of the Company, including Named Executive Officers. The Company also maintains a defined benefit plan, however, participation in the plan was frozen effective April 1, 2009. None of the Named Executive Officers are participants in our defined benefit plan as it was frozen prior to the time that they would have become eligible to participate. 
Severance and Change in Control Arrangements 
To enable us to offer competitive total compensation packages to our executive officers, as well as to ensure the on-going retention of these individuals when considering potential takeovers that may create uncertainty as to their future employment with us, we offer certain post-employment payments and benefits to our executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, upon the occurrence of certain specified events. 
A more detailed discussion of the retirement plans and severance and change in control arrangements are discussed under "Other Benefit Plans" and "Employment Agreements and Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below. 
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
We do not currently provide our executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, with perquisites or other personal benefits including vehicle allowances. These are disclosed in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" set forth below. We do not provide tax reimbursement or any other tax payments to any of our executive officers other than those pursuant to our standard relocation practices. 
Other Compensation Policies 
In addition to the other components of our executive compensation program, we maintain the compensation policies described below. These policies are consistent with evolving best practices. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
In fiscal year 2014, the Board of Directors approved target unrestricted common stock ownership guidelines for management, including Named Executive Officers, as follows: (i) the Chief Executive Officer must attain stock ownership equal to 300% of base salary within five years after eligibility under the LTIP; (ii) the other Named Executive Officers must attain stock ownership equal to 150% of base salary within five years after eligibility under the LTIP; and (iii) the other executive officers must attain stock ownership equal to 100% of base salary (until such time, 50% of all new stock grants, net of voluntary stock forfeitures, must be retained by the applicable executive officer). If any Named Executive Officer's target is not met within five years, 50% of such Named Executive Officer's payment under the STIP will be paid in common stock until the target is met. As a result of the potential sale of the Company, executive officers have been prohibited from acquiring or disposing of Company stock. As of fiscal year 2018 only Mr. Madlock has not met the stock ownership guidelines. 
Policies on Hedging and Pledging 
Under our Insider Trading Policy, all employees, including Named Executive Officers and members of our Board of Directors, are prohibited in engagement in any hedging transactions with respect to our securities. Also under our Insider Trading Policy certain of our employees and consultants, including executive officers and members of our Board of Directors, are prohibited from pledging shares of our securities without first obtaining pre-clearance from our Compliance Officer. None of these covered individuals have pledged their stock.  Clawback Policy 
In connection with any restatement of the Company's financial statements due to material noncompliance by the Company with any financial reporting requirements under applicable securities laws, it is the policy of the Board of Directors to require forfeiture by current and former executive officers of incentive-based compensation in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. No amounts were required to be clawed back during fiscal year 2018. 
Further, under the 2010 LTIP, an award of restricted stock or options may be cancelled or suspended under certain circumstances, including: (1) commission of fraud, embezzlement or a felony; (2) disclosure of confidential information or trade secrets; (3) termination for cause; (4) active engagement in a business that competes with the Company, a subsidiary or an affiliate; and (5) engaging in conduct that adversely affects the Company, a subsidiary or an affiliate. 
Impact of Tax Policies 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
It is our policy to structure and administer our long-term incentive compensation plans for our Named Executive Officers to maximize the tax deductibility of the payments as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) to the extent practicable. In 2018, all such performance-based compensation was deductible to the Company. The Committee may provide compensation that is not tax deductible to the Company if it determines that such action is appropriate.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement (the "CD&A") for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2018, which appears above. Based on the review and discussions referred to in the preceding sentence, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the CD&A be included in the Company's Form 10-K/A filed October 29, 2018 and in this Proxy Statement to be distributed to shareholders in connection with the Company's 2018 annual meeting.

Option Exercises and Stock Vested 
No options were exercised by the Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2018 and no restricted stock or restricted stock units of the Named Executive Officers vested during fiscal year 2018.  Other Benefit Plans 
401(k) Retirement Plan 
The Company maintains a 401(k) Plan that is available to substantially all U.S. employees of the Company. The Company matches 50% of each participant's voluntary contribution up to 6% of the participant's compensation and: (i) for contributions prior to January 1, 2011, a participant will vest ratably over a 5-year period in the matching contributions and (ii) for contributions as of and after January 1, 2011, the participant vests immediately in the matching contributions. At the election of the participant, both employer and employee contributions may be invested in any of the available investment options under the plan, which election options include the Company's common stock. 
Qualified Defined Benefit Plan 
The pension plan is a defined benefit plan covering substantially all U.S. employees of the Company that were eligible employees prior to the date that participation in the plan was frozen (described below). In fiscal year 2013, the Company made contributions to the pension plan in the aggregate amount of $0.2 million in order to satisfy funding requirements. Effective April 1, 2009, the Company notified employees that it would freeze participation and the accrual of benefits in the plan. The Named Executive Officers are not participants in the Company's defined benefit plan because participation and the accrual of benefits were frozen as of April 1, 2009, prior to the time that they would have become eligible to participate. 
Deferred Compensation Plans or Agreements 
Effective January 1, 2014, the Company established a Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended, which permits selected individuals to defer certain types of compensation ("Eligible Pay Types"). The plan applies to selected employees, members of the Board of Directors and members of committees established by the Board of Directors. The following chart lists the Eligible Pay Types from which participants can elect to defer compensation. The chart also summarizes what percentage of each Eligible Pay Type a participant can defer for each year. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Base Salary    80% 
 Annual Bonus    80% 
 Annual Commissions    80% 
 Director Fees    100% 
 401(k) Refund    100% 
 Restricted Stock Units    100% 
[END TABLE]
Once an individual is permitted to participate in the plan, the individual is permitted to elect how much, if any, of the Eligible Pay Types listed above will be deferred. Deferrals are only made prospectively and generally in the year before the year in which the deferred compensation is earned. As amounts are deferred, participants may suggest how those deferred amounts are invested. The investment choices are substantially similar to those options available under the 401(k) plan. 
The plan may, but is not required to, purchase life insurance to fund the deferred compensation. The life insurance is intended to have a cash value that could be used to pay benefits that otherwise would come out of the Company's general assets. If life insurance is obtained, it would be used to provide the compensation participants would receive on a future date. The investment choices and the payments under the plan are not altered by the purchase or failure to purchase a life insurance policy. 
The amounts deferred under the plan remain subject to the general claims of creditors of the Company. In general, the Company tracks the amounts deferred and the investments directed by participants for accounting purposes and is not required to put aside assets or actually make the selected investment.  Employment Agreements and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
In June 2012 and August 2012, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, authorized management to review and amend the employment agreements of the Company executives reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer and the General Managers of each of the Company's business units, including certain of the Named Executive Officers, with respect to severance packages. Any such amendments could include the following, based on a review of the facts and circumstances of each such employee (including the applicable compensation package payable to the employee): (i) up to nine months' severance, (ii) certain COBRA costs, and (iii) outplacement program support not to exceed $25,000 (all subject to the individual executing an appropriate and comprehensive release, including non-disparagement, non-compete, and non-solicitation). The amended severance packages for the Named Executive Officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer, whose severance package was not amended) are included in the description of their employment agreements below, which amended packages also include severance upon a change in control if the Named Executive Officer is terminated within a year after a change in control. 
The following is a brief summary of employment agreements of Named Executive Officers and potential payments upon termination or change in control:

Under the 2010 LTIP, upon termination of employment (as determined under criteria established by the Compensation Committee,  including upon death or disability) or upon a Change in Control, the Compensation Committee may in its discretion waive any remaining restrictions applicable to any of the awards issued to the Named Executive Officers. Under the 2010 LTIP,  "Change in Control" means: (i) any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than fifty percent of the  total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company; (ii) any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during any twelve month period) ownership of stock of the company possessing  thirty percent or more of the total voting power of the stock of the Company; (iii) a majority of the members of the Board of Directors is replaced during any twelve month period by directors whose appointment is not endorsed by a majority of  the members of the Board of Directors before the date of appointment or election; or (iv) any one person, or

     more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during any twelve month period) assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to or more than forty  percent of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Company immediately before such acquisition or acquisitions.

      In the event of acceleration of the vesting of the option awards, no value would be ascribed to the Named Executive Officers, as the option  strike prices are all greater than the closing market price of the Company's common stock as of June 29, 2018, being $18.99 per share.

(7)  These amounts are only payable in the event of the applicable officer's involuntary termination within twelve months of a Change in  Control.  
[END TABLE]
Target Stock Ownership for Management 
In fiscal year 2015, the Board of Directors approved target unrestricted common stock ownership guidelines for management, including Named Executive Officers, as follows: (i) the Chief Executive Officer must attain stock ownership equal to 300% of base salary within five years after eligibility under the LTIP; (ii) the other Named Executive Officers must attain stock ownership equal to 150% of base salary within five years after eligibility under the LTIP; and (iii) the other executive officers must attain stock ownership equal to 100% of base salary (until such time, 50% of all new stock grants, net of voluntary stock forfeitures, must be retained by the applicable executive officer). If any Named Executive Officer's target is not met within five years, 50% of such Named Executive Officer's payment under the STIP will be paid in common stock until the target is met. Prior to approval of such targets, the target was 250% of base salary in excess of $100,000 to be attained within five years. As a result of the potential sale of the Company, executive officers have been prohibited from acquiring or disposing of Company stock. In fiscal 2018 only Mr. Madlock did not meet stock ownership guidelines for the Named Executive Officers.  Monitoring Risks Related to Compensation Policies and Practices 
Our Compensation Committee and our Board of Directors believes that our compensation programs are appropriately designed to attract and retain talent and properly incentivize our employees. We have compared our compensation policies and programs to those of other similar companies in making our determination. Our Compensation Committee and Board of Directors are aware that if the programs are not carefully designed, the programs could incentivize executives to take imprudent business risks. Although our programs are generally based on pay-for-performance and provide incentive-based compensation, our programs also include mitigation factors to help ensure that our employees and executives are not incentivized to take risks that could adversely affect our business. We believe that the following features of our compensation program help to mitigate risks: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Oversight by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors and frequent reporting on compensation matters by management to the Compensation  Committee and the Board of Directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A large portion of each employee's compensation is base salary, so we do not believe our employees are dependent on achieving high incentive  compensation to satisfy their basic financial needs (see "Allocation of Compensation Components" for the percentages that each element of compensation bears to total compensation);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Careful consideration of plan targets and final payout amounts with targets focusing on reportable financial metrics;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Significant ownership goals by key executives in our common stock;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Inclusion of both short-term (such as incentive pay based upon the profitability and financial health of the Company) and long-term goals (such as  using restricted stock and vesting over time based upon achieving specific performance goals);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Providing for a mixture of both cash and equity-based compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The short-term incentive opportunities under the STIP are capped at two times the applicable target;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The measures for both the short-term and long-term incentive plans are aligned with achievable operating and strategic plans for the Company, and the  payouts at threshold, target and maximum are at reasonable levels such that management is not incentivized to achieve short-term goals that are adverse to the long-term well-being of the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The long-term incentive opportunities under the Company's LTIP are based upon achieving specific measurable performance goals over time (i.e., the  participants do not receive the benefit of the awards simply by virtue of employment with the Company);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have adopted a clawback policy in accordance with applicable laws and regulations (see a description under "Clawback Policy").   
[END TABLE]
After review of our various compensation policies and programs, the Company does not believe that its compensation policies and practices create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  Director Compensation 
General 
Effective November 4, 2015, the annual retainer payable to the independent directors is as follows: (i) to the independent directors other than the Chairman, $90,000, being $40,000 in cash payable quarterly and $50,000 as an annual stock grant; and (ii) to the Chairman, $145,000, being $70,000 in cash payable quarterly and $75,000 as an annual stock grant. The increases in director compensation were based on the Committee's review of data published by the National Association of Corporate Directors ("NACD") regarding director compensation. 
In addition, directors serving on the Compensation Committee and the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee are paid $1,000 for each regularly scheduled committee meeting. Directors serving on the Audit Committee are paid $1,100 for each regularly scheduled meeting. The higher Audit Committee fees reflect the additional time the committee spends on Company matters. Directors serving on the Process Committee receive a monthly stipend of $2,000. This monthly stipend reflects the additional time the committee spends on exploring and evaluating strategic alternatives and other Company matters. An annual retainer in the amount of $10,000, $6,000 and $6,000 is paid in quarterly installments to the Chairman of each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, respectively. 
The number of shares of stock granted pursuant to the annual stock grant to independent directors is determined based on fair market value two (2) days after the later of: (i) the date of the annual shareholder meeting and (ii) the date of the earnings release for the first quarter. The annual stock grants for fiscal year 2017 were granted under the 2010 LTIP and are described in the "Director Compensation" table below. 
In fiscal 2018, the Board of Directors approved payment of the independent directors' annual retainer entirely in cash, rather than a mix of cash and equity, related in part to restrictions on issuing new shares of common stock contained in the Merger Agreement. The retainer payments are paid quarterly to directors. Other than the payment of the retainer in cash rather than equity, the director compensation remained the same for fiscal year 2018. 
Target Stock Ownership for Directors 
In addition to the compensation described above, under guidelines approved by the Board of Directors, the directors are required to achieve a Company common stock ownership target, within five years, of a market value of three times the annual board retainer (consisting of cash and the value of stock grants). The target ownership includes shares paid as a portion of the Board of Directors retainer. All of our directors have achieved the target, other than Frank A. Wilson who joined the Board in fiscal 2015 and Alan L. Bazaar who joined the Board of Directors in fiscal 2016.  Director Compensation Table

 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 1, 2018 with management and with the Company's independent registered public accountants, BDO USA. Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accountants are responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
