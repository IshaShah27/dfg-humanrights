Table of Contents
The following charts show the composition of the eight director nominees by age, tenure and gender. More information about our process for evaluating the composition of the Board and the role of diversity in recommending candidates for a director position can be found on page 26.
INDEPENDENCE We have an Executive Compensation Committee that is 100% independent. The Executive Compensation Committee engages its own compensation consultant and affirms each year that the consultant has no conflicts of interest and is independent.
NO HEDGING OR PLEDGING TRANSACTIONSWe have a policy prohibiting all directors and named executive officers ("NEOs") from engaging in any hedging transactions with respect to equity securities of the Company held by them, which includes the purchase of any financial instrument (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, and collars) designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of our equity securities. We also have a policy that prohibits directors and NEOs from using Common Stock in any pledging transactions.
COMPENSATION CLAWBACK POLICY We may seek repayment of cash and equity incentive compensation paid to NEOs in the event of a material misstatement of the Company's financial results where an NEO engaged in actual fraud or willful unlawful misconduct that materially contributed to the need to restate the Company's financial results.
STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES We have stock ownership guidelines for our directors and executive officers. As of December 31, 2018, each of the directors and executive officers (other than Mses. Hogan Preusse and Richardson) satisfied his or her individual stock ownership requirement. Ms. Hogan Preusse became a director of the
Company on February 1, 2017 and has until February 1, 2022 to meet her required ownership levels under our current stock ownership guidelines. Ms. Richardson became a director of the Company on June 4, 2018 and has until June 4, 2023 to meet her required ownership levels under our current stock ownership guidelines. In January 2019, the Executive Compensation Committee approved a stock retention requirement for non-employee directors and executive officers who have not achieved the applicable stock ownership level. See page 23 for a detailed discussion of our stock ownership guidelines.
CHANGE OF CONTROL PAYMENTS We maintain an executive severance plan with a "double trigger" change in control arrangement that covers certain of our NEOs. The executive severance plan does not provide for any gross-up payments for taxes.
STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT The Board of Directors believes that accountability to stockholders is a mark of good corporate governance and is critical to the Company's success. The Company regularly communicates with its stockholders throughout the year to better understand their views on a range of topics and to provide perspective on the Company's corporate governance policies and practices.
During 2018, the Company met with more than half of its top 25 stockholders (representing approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock). Topics discussed included our strategy and performance, board composition and structure, executive compensation program and sustainability initiatives. We solicited feedback from stockholders on these subjects and reported their responses to our Board of Directors.

We are requesting that the stockholders approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of the NEOs as described in this Proxy Statement. The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR Proposal 2 as it believes that the 2018 compensation decisions are consistent with key objectives of Kimco's executive compensation program: to promote long-term performance through emphasis on the individual performances and achievements of our executive officers, commensurate with our business results, and to successfully execute our strategy to be the premier owner and operator of open-air shopping centers in the U.S. This proposal was supported by over 91% of the votes cast (which excludes abstentions and broker non-votes) in 2018 and 2017. Please see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, Summary Compensation Table for 2018 and other compensation tables and disclosures beginning on page 30 of this Proxy Statement for a full discussion of our executive compensation.

The increase in U.S. pro-rata cash-basis rental rate leasing spreads represents the difference between new rent and prior rent for the same spaces on all renewals, options, or new leases executed during 2018, subject to certain exclusions. Total small-shop pro-rata occupancy refers to our proportional ownership percentage being applied against properties in which we own less than a 100% interest. Small-shop is defined as any space less than 10,000 square feet.

We are providing you with this Proxy Statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be exercised at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Meeting") of Kimco Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation. The Meeting will be held at the Grand Hyatt New York, 109 East 42nd Street, New York, NY 10017, on Tuesday, April 30, 2019, at 10:00 a.m. (local time) for the purposes set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. This Proxy Statement contains important information regarding the Meeting, the proposals on which you are being asked to consider and vote upon, information you may find useful in determining how to vote, and information about voting procedures. As used in this Proxy Statement, "we," "us," "our," "Kimco" or the "Company" refers to Kimco Realty Corporation.
This solicitation is made by the Company on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors" or the "Board"). Costs of this solicitation will be borne by the Company. Directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and its affiliates may also solicit proxies by telephone, fax, e-mail or personal interview. The Company will reimburse banks, brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them in sending proxy materials to stockholders. The Company will pay fees of approximately $11,500 to Alliance Advisors, L.L.C. for soliciting proxies on behalf of the Company.
Holders of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), at the close of business on March 5, 2019, the record date, may attend and vote at the Meeting. We refer to the holders of our Common Stock as "stockholders" throughout this Proxy Statement. Each stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held as of the close of business on the record date. At the close of business on the record date there were 421,998,965 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. The presence at the Meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to be voted at the Meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Meeting.
If you received your proxy materials by mail, you should have received a proxy card enclosed with the Proxy Statement. Stockholders can vote in person at the Meeting or by authorizing a proxy. There are three ways to authorize a proxy to vote your shares:
BY TELEPHONE - Stockholders located in the United States that received proxy materials by mail can authorize a proxy by telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903 and following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card;
BY INTERNET - Stockholders can authorize a proxy over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com by following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card or Notice of Internet Availability (as defined on the next page); or
BY MAIL - Stockholders that received proxy materials by mail can authorize a proxy by mail by signing, dating and mailing the enclosed proxy card.
Telephone and Internet authorization methods for stockholders of record will be available 24 hours a day and will close at 11:59 p.m. (local time) on April 29, 2019.
If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record (in "street name"), you will receive instructions from the holder of record. You must follow the instructions of the holder of record in order for your shares to be voted. Telephone and Internet proxy authorization also will be offered to stockholders owning shares through certain banks and brokers. If your shares are not registered in your own name and you plan to vote your shares in person at the Meeting, you should contact your broker or agent to obtain a legal proxy or broker's proxy card and bring it to the Meeting in order to vote.
If you authorize a proxy to vote your shares, the individuals named on the proxy card or authorized by you by telephone or Internet (your "proxies") will vote your shares in the manner you indicate. If you sign and return the proxy card or authorize your proxies by telephone or Internet without indicating your instructions, your shares will be voted as follows:
FOR the election of all nominees for director (see Proposal 1); FOR the resolution to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the Company's executive compensation (see Proposal 2); FOR the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 (see Proposal 3); and in the discretion of the proxy holder on any other matter that may properly come before the Meeting.

If you own shares through a broker or other nominee in street name, you may instruct your broker or other nominee as to how to vote your shares. A "broker non-vote" occurs when you fail to provide a broker or other nominee with voting instructions and a broker or other nominee does not have the discretionary authority to vote your shares on a particular matter because the matter is not a routine matter under the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules. Broker non-votes and abstentions will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at the Meeting. The vote required for each proposal is listed below:
With respect to Proposal 1, you may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN for each nominee. If you ABSTAIN from voting on Proposal 1, the abstention will have no effect because it will not be a vote cast. The nominees receiving a majority of the votes cast will be elected as directors (i.e., the number of votes cast for a nominee must exceed the number of votes against that nominee).
With respect to Proposals 2 and 3, you may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN. If you ABSTAIN from voting on Proposal 2 or Proposal 3, the abstention will have no effect because it will not be a vote cast.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules permit us to deliver a single Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice of Internet Availability") or single set of Meeting materials to one address shared by two or more of our stockholders. We have delivered only one Notice of Internet Availability, Proxy Statement or annual report, as applicable, to multiple stockholders who share an address, unless we received contrary instructions from the impacted stockholders prior to the mailing date. We will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability, Proxy Statement or annual report, as applicable, to any stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of those documents was delivered. In the future, if you prefer to receive separate copies of the Notice of Internet Availability, Proxy Statement or annual report, as applicable, contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. at 1-866-540-7095 or in writing at 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717, Attention: Householding Department. If you are currently a stockholder sharing an address with another stockholder and are receiving more than one Notice of Internet Availability, Proxy Statement or annual report, as applicable, and wish to receive only one copy of future Notices of Internet Availability, proxy statements or annual reports, as applicable, for your household, please contact Broadridge at the above phone number or address.

TERM OF OFFICE All directors of the Company elected at the Meeting will serve terms ending at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualify.
ATTENDANCE AT BOARD OF DIRECTORS, COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND 2018 ANNUAL MEETING. The Board of Directors met five times in person or telephonically in 2018. During 2018, each director attended 100% of the aggregate of the total meetings of the Board and of the committees of the Board on which such director serves. Ms. Richardson attended 100% of all Board and committee meetings after her election to the Board in June 2018. The Company encourages directors to attend each annual meeting of stockholders, and all of the directors were in attendance at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on April 24, 2018. Our director attendance policy is included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are available on the Company's website located at www.kimcorealty.com and are available in print to any stockholder who requests them.
COMMUNICATIONS WITH DIRECTORS The Audit Committee and the non-management directors welcome anyone who has a concern about the Company's conduct or policies, or any employee who has a concern about the Company's accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, to communicate that concern directly to the Board of Directors, the Lead Independent Director, the non-management directors or the Audit Committee. Such communications may be confidential or anonymous, and may be submitted in writing to the Board of Directors, the Lead Independent Director, the non-management directors or the Audit Committee by sending a letter by mail addressed to the Board of Directors, the Lead Independent Director, the non-management directors or the Chair of the Audit Committee, as applicable, c/o Secretary of the Company, Kimco Realty Corporation, 3333 New Hyde Park Road, Suite 100, New Hyde Park, NY, 11042-0020. The Board of Directors has designated its Lead Independent Director to review these communications and present them to the entire Board of Directors or forward them to the appropriate directors. In addition, the Company maintains an Ethics Helpline, as further discussed in the Company's Code of Conduct, which allows employees and contractors to submit concerns anonymously via phone or the Internet.
Our Board of Directors has adopted a formal set of categorical independence standards for directors. These categorical standards specify the criteria by which the independence of our directors will be determined, including guidelines for directors and their immediate families with respect to past employment or affiliation with the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm. These categorical standards meet, and in some areas exceed, the listing standards of the NYSE. The Board of Directors' categorical standards are available along with our Corporate Governance Guidelines on the Company's website located at www.kimcorealty.com and are available in print to any stockholder who requests them. In accordance with these categorical standards and the NYSE listing standards, the Board of Directors undertook its annual review of the independence of its directors on January 29, 2019. During this review, the Board of Directors considered transactions and relationships between each director or members of his or her immediate family and the Company. The Board of Directors also considered whether there were any transactions or relationships between directors or members of their immediate family (or any entity of which a director or an immediate family member is an executive officer, general partner or significant equity holder).
The purpose of this review was to determine whether any such relationships or transactions existed that were inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent.
As a result of this review, the Board of Directors affirmatively determined that the following directors are independent of the Company and its management under the standards set forth in the categorical standards and the NYSE listing standards:
In making these determinations, the Board of Directors considered the relationships and transactions described under the caption "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" beginning on page 49.
In addition, none of the independent directors' family members serves as an executive officer, as defined by Rule 3b-7 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of the Company.

BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE The Board of Directors has separated the roles of the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and the CEO in recognition of the differences between the two roles. The CEO is responsible for setting the strategic direction for the Company and the day-to-day leadership and performance of the Company, while the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors provides guidance to the CEO, establishes the agenda for Board of Directors meetings in consultation with the CEO and presides over meetings of the full Board of Directors. Because Mr. Cooper, the Executive Chairman, is an employee of the Company and is, therefore, not "independent," the Board of Directors appointed Richard G. Dooley, as Lead Independent Director to preside at all executive sessions of "non-management" directors, as defined under the NYSE Listed Company Manual. After the Annual Meeting, the Board of Directors will select a new Lead Independent Director to replace Mr. Dooley. Mr. Dooley's long-term service on the Board of Directors is ending at the conclusion of the Annual Meeting.
LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR The Lead Independent Director is elected by the other independent directors and presides at all meetings of the Board of Directors at which the Executive Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors which typically occur after each in-person Board meeting. The Lead Independent Director encourages and facilitates active participation of all directors and serves as a liaison between management and the other independent directors. The Lead Independent Director also has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors, monitors and coordinates with management on corporate governance issues and developments and approves meeting agendas and the information sent to the Board of Directors, including the quality, quantity and timeliness of such information.
STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT The Board of Directors believes that accountability to stockholders is a mark of good corporate governance and is critical to the Company's success. The Company regularly communicates with its stockholders throughout the year to better understand their views on a range of topics and to provide perspective on the Company's corporate governance policies and practices.
During 2018, the Company met with more than half of its top 25 stockholders (representing approximately 46% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock). Topics discussed included our strategy and performance, board composition and structure, executive compensation program and sustainability initiatives. We solicited feedback from stockholders on these subjects and reported their responses to our Board of Directors.
STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES The Board of Directors adopted revised stock ownership guidelines in July 2012 for non-employee directors and executive officers that require each non-employee director and executive officer to own shares of our Common Stock. Under the guidelines, all current non-employee directors and executive officers must own shares of our Common
Stock with a value equal to a certain multiple of his or her annual Board of Directors retainer or base salary. Please refer to the table below for the applicable multiple. Equity interests that count towards the satisfaction of the ownership guidelines include shares owned outright, shares jointly owned, restricted shares and shares held in a 401(k) retirement plan. Directors and executive officers have five years from the date they become a member of the Board of Directors or an executive officer to meet the ownership levels. In January 2019, the Executive Compensation Committee approved a stock retention requirement for non-employee directors and executive officers. Non-employee directors and executive officers who have not achieved the applicable stock ownership threshold must hold all net-settled shares (after payment of withholding taxes, transaction costs and the exercise price for options, as applicable) until he or she meets the applicable stock ownership threshold. All of our directors and executive officers are currently in compliance with the stock ownership requirements, except for Ms. Hogan Preusse, who was elected to the Board of Directors on February 1, 2017 and has until February 1, 2022 to meet the required ownership levels and Ms. Richardson who was elected to the Board of Directors on June 4, 2018 and has until June 4, 2023 to meet the required ownership levels.
DIRECTOR CONTINUING EDUCATION The Company maintains a formal program of continuing education for directors. In 2018, directors participated in customized Company-sponsored sessions on business-related topics, corporate governance matters, SEC rule changes, and other current topics such as ethical conduct and cyber security, including issues applicable to particular committees of the Board of Directors. These sessions included detailed presentations on these matters and discussions on each of the covered topics.
CLAWBACK POLICY The Company may seek repayment of cash and equity incentive compensation paid to NEOs in the event of a material misstatement of the Company's financial results where an NEO engaged in actual fraud or willful or unlawful misconduct that materially contributed to the need to restate. When the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines that these circumstances exist, the Committee may direct the Company to recover the after-tax portion of the difference between the compensation actually paid or awarded and the compensation calculated using the restated financial statements, based upon the Committee's view of all relevant facts and circumstances and the best interests of the Company.

RISK OVERSIGHT Our Board of Directors oversees an enterprise-wide approach to risk management designed to support the achievement of organizational objectives, including strategic objectives, to improve long-term organizational performance and enhance stockholder value. A fundamental part of risk management is not only understanding the risks a company faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for the Company. Management is responsible for establishing our business strategy, identifying and assessing the related risks and establishing appropriate risk management practices. Our Board of Directors reviews our business strategy and management's assessment of the related risk and discusses with management the appropriate level of risk for the Company. Our Board of Directors administers its risk oversight function with respect to our operating risk as a whole, and meets with management at least quarterly to receive updates with respect to our operations, business strategies and the monitoring of related risks. The Board of Directors also delegates oversight to the Audit, Executive Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees to oversee selected elements of risk:
Our Board of Directors and committees' risk oversight responsibilities are discussed further in "Committees of the Board of Directors" below.
The following table identifies the current committee chairs and members:

 AUDIT COMMITTEE 
[END TABLE]
Messrs. Coviello, Dooley, Grills and Lourenso and Mses. Hogan Preusse and Richardson are each an "audit committee financial expert," as determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K, and Messrs. Coviello, Dooley, Grills and Lourenso and Mses. Hogan Preusse and Richardson are each "independent" from the Company as defined by the current listing standards of the NYSE.
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is available on the Company's website located at www.kimcorealty.com and is available in print to any stockholder who requests it.
The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities as related to the Company's risk management processes. The Board of Directors and Audit Committee oversee:
The Audit Committee receives regular reports from management regarding the Company's assessment of risks. In addition, the Audit Committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors and Audit Committee focus on the Company's general risk management strategy, and also ensure that risks undertaken by the Company are consistent with the business strategies approved by the Board of Directors. While the Board of Directors oversees the Company's risk management, management is responsible for the day-to-day risk management processes and reports directly to both the Board of Directors and Audit Committee on a regular basis and more frequently as appropriate. The Board of Directors believes this division of responsibilities is an effective approach for addressing the risks facing the Company.
The Audit Committee works with management to adopt and annually reviews a code of conduct designed to support the highest standards of business ethics. The Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics ("Code of Conduct") is available on the Company's website located at www.kimcorealty.com and is available in print to any stockholder who requests it.
The Board of Directors has established an Executive Compensation Committee, comprised solely of independent directors to:
More specifically, the Executive Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives relevant to the total direct compensation of the CEO and the other NEOs, including changes in base salary, bonus and equity awards. The Executive Compensation Committee also reviews the performance of the CEO and the other NEOs against these goals and objectives and, based on its evaluation, approves their total direct compensation. The details of the processes and procedures involved are described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 30.
The Executive Compensation Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. A copy of the Executive Compensation Committee Charter is on the Company's website located at www.kimcorealty.com and is available in print to any stockholder who requests it.
The Executive Compensation Committee has retained an independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance LLC ("Pay Governance"), which performs no other services for the Company. The Board of Directors and the Executive Compensation Committee, in consultation with Pay Governance and management, have reviewed the design and operation of the Company's incentive compensation arrangements, including the performance objectives and target levels used in connection with incentive awards, and evaluated the relationship between the Company's risk management policies and practices and these arrangements.
Kimco Realty Corporation 2019 PROXY STATEMENT       25
Table of Contents
As a result of this review, management has determined, and the Board of Directors has affirmed management's determination, that the Company's compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company because they do not encourage the Company's employees to take excessive or unnecessary risks. The Executive Compensation Committee believes that the combination of the Company's (i) balanced approach to compensation, (ii) reliance on a variety of performance measures and (iii) use of both quantitative and qualitative assessments of performance reflected in the Company's compensation program is consistent with the Company's objectives and risk profile. Accordingly, the performance objectives in the Company's annual incentive compensation plan are balanced with those contained in the Company's long-term incentive compensation plan to ensure that both are aligned and consistent with the Company's long-term business objectives. The Company's mix of equity-based awards has been allocated to ensure an appropriate combination of incentive and retention objectives, and the Company has established stock ownership guidelines to ensure that the interests of the Company's executive officers are aligned with the interests of the Company's stockholders.
In reaching its conclusion that the Company's compensation policies and practices do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk taking, the Executive Compensation Committee considered several factors including salaries, bonuses and equity awards. There is an annual performance-based bonus program for employees other than NEOs that provides a discretionary award based on their respective levels in the Company, individual performance and overall Company performance. While the Company's bonus program for its leasing personnel is tied to personal production for new lease deals and renewals, management believes that this fairly incentivizes leasing personnel without being excessive. In addition, executive bonuses and equity awards are based on certain performance measures (established by the Executive Compensation Committee and management) including, but not limited to, FFO, results from operations, contributions from real estate investment programs, individual performance and enterprise-wide performance. The Company's long-term equity awards consist of performance shares and restricted stock. These awards are intended to further link recipient and stockholder interests. The Company's benefits and retirement plans are not linked to performance. The Company's Executive Severance Plan provides severance protections to certain of its NEOs. Since there are no performance-based aspects of these severance arrangements, and the Company generally retains the ability to terminate an executive "for cause" without triggering severance, the Executive Compensation Committee does not believe these agreements encourage excessive risk taking. The Executive Compensation Committee believes it is not overly reliant on any single measure of performance and assesses actual results against each performance measure and takes into account overall performance compared to targets. In addition to the quantitative performance measures, the Executive Compensation Committee also assesses the broader business environment and relative performance of the Company in order to evaluate individual performance. Finally, the Executive Compensation Committee considers changes in the business, industry and capital markets environment in determining compensation policies and practices.
All of the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are independent directors. The functions of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee include recommending candidates for annual election to the Board of Directors and the filling of vacancies on the Board of Directors that may arise from time-to-time and senior management succession. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is not limited to any specific process in identifying candidates and will consider candidates suggested by other members of the Board of Directors, as well as candidates recommended by stockholders. Such recommendations should include the name and address and other pertinent information about the candidate as is required to be included in the Company's Proxy Statement. Recommendations should be submitted to the Secretary of the Company. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is authorized to retain search firms and other consultants to assist it in identifying candidates and fulfilling other duties.
As described in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, consideration is given to assuring that the Board of Directors, as a whole, considers diversity in its broadest sense, including persons diverse in geography, gender and ethnicity as well as representing diverse experiences, skills and backgrounds. We believe a diverse group of directors can best perpetuate the success of the business and represent stockholder interests through the exercise of sound business judgment. The Board of Directors and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee take into account many factors in recommending candidates for a director position. These factors include, but are not limited to:
26       Kimco Realty Corporation 2019 PROXY STATEMENT
Table of Contents
In addition, each candidate nominee must possess fundamental qualities of intelligence, honesty, good judgment, high ethics and standards of integrity, fairness and responsibility. The Board of Directors and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluate each individual candidate by considering all appropriate factors as a whole. The Company's approach favors active deliberation rather than using rigid formulas to assign relative weights to these factors. Following the end of each fiscal year, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee establishes the criteria for and conducts an annual assessment of the performance of each member of the Board of Directors with respect to these factors. Consideration of other corporate governance principles or modifications of such principles may also be discussed at that time.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is also responsible for ensuring that the Company adheres to good corporate governance principles and developing and implementing the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines that apply to all of its directors and management. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is also charged with ensuring the Company's compliance with all NYSE listing requirements. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. Copies of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter and the Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on the Company's website located at www.kimcorealty.com and are available in print to any stockholder who requests either document.

We pay our NEOs primarily using salary, annual incentives and equity awards. We seek to pay our NEOs in a way that encourages long-term increases in stockholder value and long-term employee retention. We also recognize that our NEO pay must compete with what comparable employers pay. For 2018, our NEOs were:
Our Board of Directors has an Executive Compensation Committee (the "Committee") that administers and monitors what and how we pay our NEOs and other executives.
The Committee held five meetings in person or by phone during 2018. The Committee is currently comprised of Joe Grills (Chairman), Philip E. Coviello, Richard G. Dooley, Frank Lourenso, Colombe M. Nicholas, Mary Hogan Preusse, Valerie Richardson and Richard B. Saltzman. We encourage feedback from our stockholders regarding our executive compensation program. In 2018, over 91% of the votes cast (i.e., excluding abstentions and broker non-votes) in our Say-on-Pay advisory vote were to approve the proposal.
Our senior management team worked in 2018 to strategically position Kimco for long-term performance by focusing their efforts on strengthening our portfolio, maintaining our capital and liquidity positions and operating competitively. Our compensation decisions in 2018 emphasized rewarding corporate / financial performance and individual performance and achievements by our NEOs, commensurate with our business results, to successfully execute our strategy to be the premier owner and operator of open-air shopping centers in the U.S.
Kimco Realty Corporation is one of the nation's largest publicly traded owners and operators of open-air shopping centers, measured in gross leasable area ("GLA").

At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we provided our stockholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on executive compensation, and in future years we expect such advisory vote will occur annually. Over 91% of the votes cast (i.e., excluding abstentions and broker non-votes) on the 2018 Say-on-Pay vote were voted in favor of the proposal. We have considered the results of the 2018 vote and believe the support of our stockholders for that proposal indicates that our stockholders are supportive of our approach to executive compensation, including the ratio of performance-based compensation to all other compensation, the ratio of performance-based equity compensation to time-based equity compensation, and the integrity of our peer group. Thus, we did not make changes to our executive compensation arrangements in response to the vote. In the future, we will continue to consider the outcome of our Say-on-Pay votes when making compensation decisions regarding our NEOs.

Our executive compensation program provides pay-for performance compensation that we believe is aligned with the interests of our stockholders and is designed to continue to attract, retain and appropriately motivate our key employees who drive long-term value creation.
FFO as adjusted, EBITDA as adjusted including the pro-rata share of joint ventures ("EBITDA as adjusted"), and leverage, defined as consolidated debt plus the pro-rata share of joint venture debt divided by the total gross consolidated assets and the pro-rata share of joint venture gross assets, are the financial metrics used in our annual incentive program, ensuring that pay and performance, as measured in our executive compensation program, are aligned.

*  Amounts are based on the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 on page 40. 
[END TABLE]
In reviewing our NEOs' base salaries, the Executive Compensation Committee considers each NEO's scope of responsibilities, individual qualifications and experience, future potential, past performance and the practices of our peer group, without applying a quantitative formula. We did not seek a specific target within our peer group. Base salary increases, if any, are effective January 1 and are approved by the Board of Directors and the Committee. No formulaic base salary increases are provided to the NEOs, and other forms of compensation are generally used to reward overall Company performance or exceptional performance of a particular NEO. For 2018, the Executive Compensation Committee increased Mr. Ross Cooper's base salary from $450,000 in 2017 and Mr. Jamieson's base salary from $425,000 in 2017. The Executive Compensation Committee determined to make these increases after considering the level of fixed cash compensation that the Executive Compensation Committee believes is necessary to retain the services of these executives in a competitive talent market and the market practices of our peer group, without applying a quantitative formula.
Under our executive compensation program, each of the NEOs were eligible to receive an annual cash bonus based on the Company's corporate / financial performance compared to targets and the NEO's individual performance against specific quantitative and qualitative goals as further discussed starting on page 35. For 2018 the NEO's annual bonus opportunity for the performance year was: 60% based on the Company's corporate / financial performance compared to targets as measured by the Company's (1) FFO as adjusted per diluted share compared to Target FFO, (2) EBITDA as adjusted compared to Target EBITDA and (3) leverage compared to Target Leverage, and 40% was based on individual NEO performance against specific quantitative and qualitative goals as discussed starting on page 35 and as evaluated by the Executive Compensation Committee.

The table below shows the percentage of the Total Annual Target Bonus each of our NEOs would receive based on achievement of specified levels for corporate / financial performance and individual performance.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The annual bonus is linearly interpolated between the specified performance levels. 
[END TABLE]
The table on page 36 shows the target bonus and the bonus actually earned in 2018 for the NEOs. In establishing the target bonuses, we considered the responsibilities of each NEO, Mr. Flynn's recommendations (other than with respect to his own target bonus) and the peer group practices discussed in "Comparison to Competitive Market." The Committee awarded 2018 bonuses based on the following analysis of our corporate / financial performance and each applicable NEO's individual performance:
CORPORATE / FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. In 2018, the corporate / financial incentive was based upon the percentage weighting of 60% FFO as adjusted per diluted share, 20% EBITDA as adjusted, and 20% leverage. For 2018, the Company's Target FFO was $1.45 on a diluted per share basis, Target EBITDA was $890 million and Target Leverage was 37.7%. The decrease in the Company's Target FFO and Target EBITDA relative to its targets in 2017 was driven by the dilutive impact of the 2018 disposition program aimed at strengthening the overall portfolio and building concentration in major core markets by selling properties having limited growth, higher risk or located in secondary and tertiary markets. The cash proceeds from the 2018 disposition program aided in funding the Company's development and redevelopment projects that are expected to foster future long-term growth. After the Executive Compensation Committee considered the Company's actual 2018 FFO as adjusted of $1.45 per diluted share, EBITDA as adjusted of $890.0 million and leverage of 37.5%, the payout for the corporate financial incentive was based on the Company meeting Target FFO, meeting Target EBITDA and exceeding Target Leverage by 0.531%. Interpolating linearly between target and maximum performance levels for each of the three financial measures resulted in a payout for the corporate / financial incentive of 61.2% of each applicable NEO's total annual target bonus, which is 102% of each applicable NEO's 2018 target corporate / financial performance bonus of 60%.
INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE. The Executive Compensation Committee considers the NEO's overall performance in determining the individual performance component of each NEO's annual bonus. For the NEOs other than the CEO, the Committee also considers our CEO's evaluation of our NEO's performance and his recommended set of compensation actions for the NEOs.
The Committee awarded each of Messrs. Milton Cooper, Ross Cooper, Cohen and Jamieson bonuses for calendar year 2018 based on recommendations made by Mr. Flynn and the Committee's assessment of their 2018 performance compared to specific quantitative and qualitative goals. The Committee awarded Mr. Flynn's bonus for calendar year 2018 based on the Committee's review of Mr. Flynn's 2018 performance.
The decision to pay each of Messrs. Milton Cooper, Flynn, Ross Cooper, Cohen and Jamieson 150% of their target bonus with respect to their individual component was based on the Committee's quantitative and qualitative assessment of each individual's contributions to the Company's performance in 2018 in their respective job functions. The material components of such contributions include but are not limited to: (a) for Mr. Milton Cooper, his work in overseeing and guiding management during a period of dynamic retail transformation, which was essential in establishing the Company's simplification strategy; (b) for Mr. Flynn, his work in helping the Company to achieve its financial and operational results for 2018, including critical capital allocation decisions to enhance Kimco's overall portfolio quality and long-term growth profile, as well as the accretive use of the Company's stock buyback program; (c) for Mr. Ross Cooper, his work successfully executing the Company's large-scale disposition program in 2018 which involved 71 separate transactions. This approach enabled the Company to maximize pricing while enhancing the quality of the remaining portfolio and reducing leverage; (d) for

(e) for Mr. Jamieson, his work in overseeing the Company-wide operating teams and key development and redevelopment projects, including the completion of three Signature Series™ ground-up development projects totaling $317.4 million and 28 redevelopment projects totaling $89.7 million with a blended return of 10.9%.
CALCULATION OF TOTAL 2018 BONUS. The bonus actually received by the NEOs was determined by adding the corporate / financial performance bonus and the individual performance bonus together. Thus, each of the NEOs earned a total 2018 bonus of approximately 121.2% of his 2018 target bonus.
The Company maintains a long-term incentive plan pursuant to which the Company makes annual equity-based compensation awards to the NEOs. We used our business judgment to determine appropriate equity compensation in order to recognize the potential of our executive officers for our business and retain our executive officers for the long term.
In 2016, Messrs. Milton Cooper, Flynn and Cohen were granted performance shares that permitted them to earn vested shares of Common Stock based on the Company's total stockholder return compared to peers listed in the NAREIT Retail Index over a three-year performance period, which commences with the year of grant. The grant date fair value of the performance shares granted to Messrs. Milton Cooper, Flynn and Cohen for 2016 was $870,298, $1,124,266 and $870,298, respectively, calculated using the Monte Carlo method in accordance with the provision of FASB ASC 718, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures. The Monte Carlo method is a methodology that generates a large number of possible outcomes with respect to the variables that will determine the ultimate value of the performance share award- in this case, the Company's total stockholder return over the applicable performance period and the total stockholder return of the companies in the NAREIT Retail Index. The Company's total shareholder return for the 2016-2018 performance period was in the 18th percentile of the peer group. Because this was below the threshold level of the award, no shares were issued in respect of the 2016 performance share awards and Messrs. Milton Cooper, Flynn and Cohen did not realize any value in respect of these awards.
Approximately 33% of the value of the equity awards granted in 2018 to the NEOs was awarded in the form of time-vesting restricted stock eligible to vest, at the election of the NEO, either in 20% increments on each of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date, or in a single installment on the fifth anniversary of the grant date.
For 2018, the time-vesting awards were granted under the Company's 2010 Equity Participation Plan. The actual time-vesting awards granted in 2018 are set out in the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards for 2018" table on page 41.
Approximately 67% of the value of the equity awards granted in 2018 to the NEOs was awarded in the form of performance shares. The performance shares granted in 2018 permit the NEOs to earn vested shares of Common Stock based on the Company's total stockholder return compared to peers listed in the Bloomberg REIT Shopping Center Index over a three-year performance period, which commences with the year of grant. In 2018, the Committee determined to use the peers listed in the Bloomberg REIT Shopping Center Index instead of the peers listed in the NAREIT Retail Index because of its determination that the Bloomberg REIT Shopping Center Index provided a more narrowly defined peer group that more closely matches our business. The performance shares granted in 2018 also include the right to receive, if and when the underlying shares are earned, the equivalent value (paid in shares without interest) of dividends declared on the earned shares following issuance of the performance shares and
36       Kimco Realty Corporation 2019 PROXY STATEMENT
Table of Contents before issuance of any earned stock. The 2018 performance shares provide a target number of shares that may be earned in the performance period if the Company's total stockholder return for the period equals the 50th percentile of its peers listed in the Bloomberg REIT Shopping Center Index. The number of performance shares actually earned for the performance period may range between a threshold of 50% of the target number of shares if the Company's total stockholder return for the period is at least in the 25th percentile of its peers listed in the Bloomberg REIT Shopping Center Index and a maximum of 200% of the target number of shares for the period if the Company's total stockholder return for the period equals or exceeds the 85th percentile of its peers listed in the Bloomberg REIT Shopping Center Index. Linear interpolation is used to determine the shares earned for the performance period if the Company's total stockholder return falls between the specified percentile levels. If the Company's total stockholder return for the performance period is less than the threshold level, no performance shares are earned or issued for the period.
In 2018, we also issued Mr. Milton Cooper 79,780 shares of restricted stock subject to time-based vesting conditions. These shares were issued pursuant to his election to receive his 2017 annual bonus payment in the form of shares of restricted stock with a grant date fair value based on the closing price on the day before the grant date equal to 120% of his bonus award. These restricted shares are scheduled to vest in a single installment on February 13, 2023.
Companies listed in the Bloomberg REIT Shopping Center Index on January 1st of each calendar year (excluding the Company) are the peer group used to determine relative total stockholder return and the number of shares of stock earned with respect to each performance period beginning on January 1, 2018. If a constituent company in the peer group ceases to be actively traded, due, for example, to merger or bankruptcy or the Executive Compensation Committee otherwise reasonably determines that it is no longer suitable, then such company shall be removed from the peer group. For 2018, these companies were:
We review competitive compensation data from a select group of peer companies and broader survey sources. However, we do not set our NEOs' compensation as a direct function of market pay levels. Instead, we use market data to help confirm that our pay practices are reasonable. For 2018, we reviewed the following REITs with market capitalizations comparable to ours and with whom we compete for executive talent.
In March 2017, we removed Equity One Inc. from our group of peer companies due to its merger with Regency Centers Corp. In August 2018, we removed GGP, Inc. from our group of peer companies due to its merger with Brookfield Properties Corp.

Our senior management team developed the peer group of companies, which was reviewed by the Executive Compensation Committee with the assistance of Pay Governance. Pay Governance reports directly to the Committee and, in 2018, provided no services to the Company other than executive compensation consulting services.
The survey sources utilized by the Committee in reviewing executive compensation provide aggregate data, and the Committee is not provided with compensation data specific to any individual constituent company in the surveys, other than any overlap between the survey constituent companies and our peer group discussed above.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES – EQUITY AWARDS As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Milton Cooper and Cohen were eligible to retire from the Company. See page 45 "Compensation Tables – Assumed Termination for Death, Disability or Retirement" for information regarding the amounts each of them would be eligible to receive upon a qualifying retirement that occurred December 31, 2018. The Executive Compensation Committee may accelerate equity vesting upon an NEO's termination at its discretion. We do not maintain special pension plans for our NEOs because we believe the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards in connection with retirement should offset the lack of such plans, though we retain discretion on whether or not to accelerate equity awards in connection with retirement.
If an NEO holding restricted stock is terminated prior to vesting for reasons other than death, disability, retirement (without consent of the Executive Compensation Committee), without cause or change of control, the employee would forfeit the unvested stock. Prior to vesting, recipients of restricted stock may vote the shares and also receive dividends.
EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN – "DOUBLE-TRIGGER" CHANGE IN CONTROL SEVERANCE ARRANGEMENT On March 15, 2010, the Executive Compensation Committee adopted the Kimco Realty Corporation Executive Severance Plan, as amended from time to time (the "Executive Severance Plan") pursuant to which certain of our NEOs are eligible for severance payments if the covered executive's employment is terminated by the Company without "Cause" or, following a change in control, by the executive for "Good Reason" (each as defined in the Executive Severance Plan), subject in all cases to the terms and conditions described in the Executive Severance Plan. Upon a covered termination of employment, a participant will receive two times the sum of (a) the participant's annual base salary and (b) the amount of the participant's annual bonus received in the prior year, payable in equal installments over the two years following the termination or in a lump sum if the termination occurs within two years following a change in control.
The participant will also receive a payment equivalent to 18 months of premium payments for continued participation in the Company's health insurance plans or successor plans (running concurrently with the COBRA period) and accelerated vesting of all unvested stock options and restricted stock awards. In certain circumstances, if a participant would otherwise have incurred excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Internal
Revenue Code ("Parachute Payment Taxes"), his or her payments will be reduced to the "safe harbor amount," such that no such excise taxes would be due. The Executive Severance Plan does not provide for any gross-up payments for Parachute Payment Taxes incurred by any participant. Mr. Milton Cooper did not participate in the Company's Executive Severance Plan for 2018. However, Mr. Milton Cooper qualifies for "Retirement" under the terms of his equity award agreements dated prior to 2018. Accordingly, all of his equity awards prior to 2018 may become fully vested upon his retirement.
RETIREMENT PLANS We maintain a 401(k) retirement plan (the "401(k) Plan") in which substantially all employees, including our NEOs, are eligible to participate. The 401(k) Plan permits participants to defer up to a maximum of 100% of their eligible base salary compensation, up to the federal limit. The Company currently makes matching contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis to all employees contributing to their 401(k) accounts and who have completed one year of employment with the Company, of up to 5% of the employee's base salary compensation (and subject to a maximum of $8,500 for highly compensated employees). Participants in the 401(k) Plan are not subject to federal and state income tax on salary deferral contributions or Company contributions or on the earnings thereon until such amounts are withdrawn from the 401(k) Plan. Salary reduction contributions are treated as wages subject to FICA and Medicare tax. Withdrawals from the 401(k) Plan may only be made upon termination of employment, or in connection with certain provisions of the 401(k) Plan that permit hardship withdrawals, allow in-service distributions and loans, or require minimum distributions. The 401(k) Plan also includes a Roth 401(k) feature which enables participants to defer some or all of their 401(k) contributions on an after-tax rather than pre-tax basis, allowing for tax-free (federal and most state) distributions on both participant contributions and related earnings at retirement. Generally, participation in the Roth 401(k) allows for tax free distributions if the Roth account has been in place for 5 years and the participant has attained age 59 ½. We do not maintain any other retirement plans for our NEOs or employees. The Company does not provide any pension benefits or any nonqualified deferred compensation to its NEOs or employees.
TAX AND ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS The recognition or deferral of period expense in our financial statements did not factor into the allocation of compensation among base salary, bonus and equity awards for 2018. Cash salary and bonuses are charged as an expense in the period in which the amounts are earned by the NEO.

Certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may affect compensation decisions. Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, which governs the form and timing of payment of deferred compensation, imposes sanctions, including a 20% penalty and an interest penalty, on the recipient of deferred compensation that does not comply with Section 409A. The Committee takes into account the implications of Section 409A in determining the form and timing of compensation awarded to our executives and strives to structure any nonqualified deferred compensation plans or arrangements to be exempt from or to comply with the requirements of Section 409A.
Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a company's tax deduction for payments received by certain individuals in connection with a change in control to the extent that the payments exceed an amount approximately equal to three times their average annual compensation, and Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a 20% excise tax on those payments. The Committee takes into account the implications of Section 280G in determining potential payments to be made to our executives in connection with a change in control. Nevertheless, to the extent that certain payments upon a change in control are classified as excess parachute payments, such payments may not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G.
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation over $1 million paid for any fiscal year to the corporation's chief executive officer and certain other executive officers. The Committee has not adopted a policy requiring all executive compensation to be fully deductible and has authorized compensation payments that may be subject to the Section 162(m) limitation.
PERQUISITES We offered or provided the following additional perquisites to our NEOs in 2018:
The Executive Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of Kimco Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), has reviewed and discussed with the Company's management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis that is required by Securities and Exchange Commission Rules to be included in the Proxy Statement.

(2) Represents performance share awards granted in 2017 and 2018 for which the applicable performance period has not been completed. Each performance share award granted in 2016 provides for the ability to earn and receive shares after the end of a three-year performance period based on the Company's total stockholder return in the applicable performance period compared to peers listed in the NAREIT Retail index. The Company's total stockholder return for the 2016-2018 performance period was in the eighteenth percentile of its peer group. Because this was below the threshold level for the award, no shares were issued in respect of the 2016 performance share awards. Each performance share award granted in 2017 and 2018 provides for the ability to earn and receive shares after the end of a three-year performance period based on the Company's total stockholder return in the applicable performance period compared to peers listed in the Bloomberg REIT Shopping Center Index. Shares of stock issued with respect to earned performance share awards are fully vested at issuance. (3) Messrs. Milton Cooper, Flynn, and Ross Cooper chose a four-year cliff vesting for their annual grant which vests in a single installment on the fourth anniversary of the grant date. Mr. Milton Cooper's grant on February 13, 2017 of 46,782 shares were issued a result of his election to receive his 2016 annual bonus payment in the form of shares of restricted stock. These shares are scheduled to vest in a single installment on February 13, 2021. (4) Messrs. Milton Cooper, Flynn, Ross Cooper and Cohen chose a five-year cliff vesting for their annual grant which vests on the fifth anniversary of the grant date. Mr. Milton Cooper's grant on February 22, 2018 of 79,780 shares were issued as a result of his election to receive his 2017 annual bonus payment in the form of shares of restricted stock. These shares are scheduled to vest in a single installment on February 13, 2023. (5) Messrs. Flynn's and Cohen's shares of restricted stock granted on February 16, 2012 vest in 20% increments annually beginning on February 16, 2018, subject to continued employment with the Company on the applicable vesting date.

Please see page 38 "Additional Compensation Considerations – Executive Severance Plan – 'Double-Trigger' Change in Control Severance Arrangement" above for a discussion of certain compensation and benefits which our NEOs would receive upon a termination or change in control. None of the NEOs have "single trigger" arrangements that entitle them to benefits solely due to a change in control. However, upon a change in control, our performance share awards would be evaluated based on a shortened performance period ending on the date of the change in control, and any resulting restricted stock as well as any other unvested shares of restricted stock would, if not assumed in the change in control, automatically vest in full.
The following table was prepared as though each of the NEOs had been terminated without Cause on December 31, 2018. The assumptions and valuations are noted in the footnotes to the table.
(1) In accordance with the Executive Severance Plan, Messrs. Flynn, Ross Cooper, Cohen and Jamieson are entitled to two times the sum of their (a) base salary plus (b) prior year's annual bonus upon a termination without Cause.

(3) In accordance with the Executive Severance Plan, Messrs. Flynn, Ross Cooper, Cohen and Jamieson are entitled to full vesting of annual restricted stock awards, with the exception of retention awards, upon a termination without Cause. In addition, Messrs. Milton Cooper, Flynn and Cohen would remain eligible to earn and be issued the portion of the 2016 performance shares that relate to the 2016-2018 performance period, would remain eligible to earn and be issued the portion of the 2017 performance shares that relate to the 2017-2019 performance period, and would remain eligible to earn and be issued the portion of the 2018 performance shares that relate to the 2018-2020 performance period. Messrs. Ross Cooper and Jamieson would remain eligible to earn and be issued the portion of 2018 performance shares that relate to the 2018-2020 performance period. The actual number of shares earned and issued would depend on the Company's total stockholder return during the performance periods. Assuming performance at maximum level and based on the market price of our stock on December 31, 2018 ($14.65), the total performance share values, disregarding any discount for the time-value of money, would be $2,532,985 for Mr. Milton Cooper, $5,276,637 for Mr. Flynn, $964,556 for Mr. Ross Cooper, $2,954,905 for Mr. Cohen and $964,556 for Mr. Jamieson. (4) Amounts are based on the cost of coverage during 2018. (5) In certain circumstances, these amounts may be reduced so as to avoid any potential issues relating to Section 280G or excise taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. See "Additional Compensation Considerations - Tax and Accounting Considerations" and "Additional Compensation Considerations – Executive Severance Plan – 'Double-Trigger' Change in Control Severance Arrangement."  (6) Mr. Milton Cooper does not participate in the Company's Executive Severance Plan.

Accordingly, all of his equity awards prior to 2018 may become fully vested upon the termination of his employment without Cause.

(1) The vesting of Mr. Milton Cooper's 187,230, Mr. Flynn's 311,881, Mr. Ross Cooper's 85,783, Mr. Cohen's 105,238 and Mr. Jamieson's 71,918 unvested time-based shares of restricted stock would accelerate as a result of termination due to death or disability. Messrs. Milton Cooper and Cohen would also be entitled to these amounts on qualifying retirement. For Mr. Cooper, he would be entitled to this amount only on equity grants awarded to him prior to 2018. In addition, Messrs. Milton Cooper, Flynn and Cohen would remain eligible to earn and be issued the portion of the 2016 performance shares that relate to the 2016-2018 performance period, would remain eligible to earn and be issued the portion of the 2017 performance shares that relate to the 2017-2019 performance period, and would remain eligible to earn and be issued the portion of the 2018 performance shares that relate to the 2018-2020 performance period. Messrs. Ross Cooper and Jamieson would remain eligible to earn and be issued the portion of the 2018 performance shares that relate to the 2018-2020 performance period. The actual number of shares earned and issued would depend on the Company's total stockholder return during the performance periods. Assuming performance at maximum level and based on the market price of our stock on December 31, 2018 ($14.65), the total performance share values, disregarding any discount for the time-value of money, would be $2,532,985 for Mr. Milton Cooper, $5,276,637 for Mr. Flynn, $964,556 for Mr. Ross Cooper, $2,954,905 for Mr. Cohen and $964,556 for Mr. Jamieson. (2) The vesting of the unvested portion of Mr. Flynn's retention award of 28,000 restricted shares and the unvested portion of Mr. Cohen's retention award of 40,000 restricted shares would accelerate as a result of termination due to death or disability only. As of December 31, 2018, the value of Mr. Flynn's and Mr. Cohen's retention awards was $410,200 and $586,000, respectively.

The Company reviews all relationships and transactions in which the Company and our directors and executive officers or their immediate family members are participants to determine whether such persons have a direct or indirect material interest. Our current written policies and procedures for review, approval or ratification of relationships or transactions with related persons are set forth in our:
Our Code of Conduct applies to all of our directors and employees. Review and approval of potential conflicts of interest involving our directors, executive officers or other principal officers may only be conducted by our Board of Directors. A copy of the Company's Code of Conduct is available through the Investors/Governance/Governance Documents section of the Company's website located at www.kimcorealty.com and is available in print to any stockholder who requests it.
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review annually the relationships that each director has with the Company (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company), in the course of making independence determinations under the Company's categorical independence standards for directors and the NYSE listing standards. Directors are expected to avoid any action, position or interest that conflicts with the interests of the Company or gives the appearance of a conflict. If an actual or potential conflict of interest develops, the director should immediately report the matter to the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Any significant conflict must be resolved or the director should resign. If a director has a personal interest in a matter before the Board of Directors, the director will disclose the interest to the Board of Directors, excuse himself or herself from discussion on the matter and not vote on the matter. The Corporate Governance Guidelines further provide that the Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and, where appropriate, approving major changes in and determinations under the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Conduct and other Company policies. The Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that the Board of Directors has the responsibility to ensure that the Company's business is conducted with the highest standards of ethical conduct and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations.
Company's legal staff, including its outside legal advisers, is primarily responsible for obtaining information through questionnaires and other procedures from the directors and executive officers with respect to related-person transactions and then determining whether the Company or a related person has a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction. As required under SEC rules, transactions that are determined to be directly or indirectly material to the Company or a related person are disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement.
Pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter and the Audit Committee's policy regarding related-person transactions, as recorded in its minutes, the Audit Committee reviews and approves or ratifies related-person transactions that are required to be disclosed as well as all other related-person transactions identified to the Audit Committee by management or the Company's internal audit function. In the course of its review and approval or ratification of a related-party transaction for which disclosure is required, the Audit Committee routinely considers: the nature of the related-person's interest in the transaction; the material terms of the transaction; the importance of the transaction to the related person and to the Company and the extent to which such transaction would impair the judgment of a director or executive officer to act in the best interest of the Company; and any other matters deemed appropriate by the Audit Committee. All related-party transactions described in this Proxy Statement have been reviewed in accordance with this policy.
JOINT VENTURES Mr. Milton Cooper has investments in certain real estate joint ventures and limited partnerships.

The Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors") of Kimco Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), is responsible for providing objective oversight of the Company's financial accounting and reporting functions, system of internal control and audit process. During 2018, all of the directors who served on the Audit Committee were independent as defined under the current listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is available on the Company's website located at www.kimcorealty.com and is available in print to any stockholder who requests it.
Management of the Company is responsible for the Company's system of internal control and its financial reporting process. The independent registered public accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are responsible for performing an independent integrated audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and its internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and to issue a report thereon. The Audit Committee is responsible for the monitoring and oversight of these processes.
In connection with these responsibilities, the Audit Committee met with management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to review and discuss the December 31, 2018 audited consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent registered public accountants the matters required by Auditing Standard No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees). The Audit Committee also received written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accountants required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accountants their independence.
Based upon the Audit Committee's discussions with management and the independent registered public accountants and the Audit Committee's review of the December 31, 2018 audited consolidated financial statements and the representations of management and required communications from the Company's independent registered public accountants, the Audit Committee recommended that the Board of Directors include the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

POLICY ON AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit the Company's financial statements. The Audit Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with the Company's retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The Audit Committee has established a policy regarding pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accountants.
On an ongoing basis, management communicates specific projects and categories of services for which the advance approval of the Audit Committee is requested. The Audit Committee reviews these requests and advises management if the Audit Committee approves the engagement of the independent registered public accountants. On a periodic basis, management reports to the Audit Committee regarding the actual spending for such projects and services as compared to the approved amounts. The Audit Committee may also delegate the ability to pre-approve audit and permitted non-audit services to a subcommittee consisting of one or more members, provided that such pre-approvals are reported on at a subsequent Audit Committee meeting. All services performed for 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

 PROPOSAL 3 RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has been retained as the Company's external auditor continuously since 1986. In order to assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm. Additionally, in conjunction with the mandated rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm's lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its chairperson are directly involved in the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's new lead engagement partner. The members of the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the continued retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company.
VOTE REQUIRED
The ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter. For purposes of this proposal, abstentions will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote. Because brokers have discretionary voting authority with regard to this proposal under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, we do not expect any broker non-votes.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019.
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors and officers and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports (Forms 3, 4 and 5) of the ownership and changes in the ownership of such equity securities with the SEC and the NYSE. Directors, officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of the Company's stock are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all such forms which they file.
Based solely on the Company's review of the copies of Forms 3, 4 and 5 and amendments thereto received by it for the year ended December 31, 2018, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no such forms were required to be filed by those persons, the Company believes that during the year ended December 31, 2018, all such filings under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act were filed on a timely basis by its directors, officers, beneficial owners of more than 10% of shares of Common Stock and other persons subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION
During 2018, Messrs. Grills, Coviello, Dooley, Lourenso and Saltzman and Mses. Nicholas, Hogan Preusse and Richardson served on the Executive Compensation Committee of the Company.

See the discussion of certain relationships and related transactions beginning on page 49, some of which involve members of the Executive Compensation Committee. During 2018, none of the Company's executive officers served on the board of directors or the compensation committee of any other entity that had one or more of its executive officers serving on the Company's Board of Directors or its Executive Compensation Committee.

We calculate funds from operations available to the Company's common shareholders ("FFO") (a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of the rules of the SEC) from net income available to the Company's common shareholders, as shown on our Consolidated Statements of Income, by excluding (i) gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and change in control of interests, plus (ii) depreciation and amortization of operating properties and (iii) impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments and (iv) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We present FFO as adjusted as an additional supplemental measure as we believe it is more reflective of the Company's core operating performance and provides investors and analysts an additional measure to compare the Company's performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. We calculate FFO as adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of the rules of the SEC) starting with the calculation of FFO as described previously and excluding the effects of certain transactional income and expenses and non-operating impairments.
Our method of calculating FFO and FFO as adjusted may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. We believe that FFO and FFO as adjusted, are important metrics in determining the success of our business as a real estate owner and operator. See the reconciliations to the applicable GAAP measure below.
(1) Related to gains, impairments and depreciation on depreciable real estate properties, where applicable.(2) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to Common Stock at the beginning of the period. FFO would be increased by $916 and $923 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Same property net operating income ("Same property NOI") is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure (within the meaning of the rules of the SEC) of real estate companies' operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The Company considers Same property NOI as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the Company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods. It excludes properties under redevelopment, development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a project's inclusion in operating real estate. Same property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the Company's properties.
Same property NOI is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees and amortization of above/below market rents) less charges for bad debt, operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense plus the Company's proportionate share of Same property NOI from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. The Company's method of calculating Same property NOI available to the Company's common shareholders may differ from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.
The following is a reconciliation of Net income available to the Company's common shareholders to Same property NOI (in thousands):

EBITDA (a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of the rules of the SEC) is calculated as net income before (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) gains from sales of operating properties and change in control of interests, (iv) impairments of depreciable real estate, (v) impairments of non-consolidated entities that are in-substance real estate investments and (vi) depreciation and amortization. EBITDA as adjusted excludes the effects of non-operating transactional income and expenses. We calculate EBITDA as adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of the rules of the SEC) starting with EBITDA as described in the previous sentence and excluding the effects of non-operating impairments and certain transactional income and expenses.
Our method of calculating EBITDA and EBITDA as adjusted may be different from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.
