 Compensation Actions in 2018  
 Base Salary   As part of the annual performance review process, the Committee authorized merit increases in base salary levels for Ms. Knutson and Mr. Lawlor of 2.5%. The Committee increased Mr. Symson's base salary by 8.0% and Mr. Appleton's base salary by 11.5% to better align their base salaries with market levels.   
 Annual Incentive   The Committee did not make any adjustments to the target annual incentive opportunities for our named executive officers, as the opportunities were consistent with market levels. In 2018, we exceeded our free cash flow and revenue targets for the year and our named executive officers received a payout under the annual incentive plan between 123.5% and 125.25% of their target annual incentive opportunity.  
 Long-Term Incentive Levels   As part of the annual performance review process, the Committee increased the long-term incentive opportunity levels for Mr. Symson by 133.3%, Ms. Knutson by 10.5%, Mr. Lawlor by 4.5%, and Mr. Appleton by 5.3% in order to better align their total direct compensation opportunities with market levels. The Committee increased Mr. Lyons' long-term incentive opportunity by 92.3% to reflect his increased responsibilities as Senior Vice President.

 What we do   
• Prohibit Hedging or Pledging Transactions. Our insider trading policy prohibits our employees, officers and directors from engaging in any hedging or pledging transactions with our stock.  
• Maintain a Clawback Policy. We maintain a clawback policy, under which we require the reimbursement of any incentive compensation if the payment was predicated upon financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement caused by the recipient's fraud or misconduct.  
• Impose Stock Ownership Guidelines. Our stock ownership policy requires our executive officers to hold a minimum level of our Class A Common Shares so that each executive has personal wealth tied to the long-term success of the Company and, therefore, has interests that are aligned with those of our shareholders.  
• Minimize Compensation Risks. We annually review our compensation program to confirm that our policies and practices are not creating excessive or inappropriate risks. We believe that our compensation program provides an appropriate balance between current and long-term performance objectives, cash and equity compensation, and risks and rewards associated with executive roles. Further, we provide annual incentive opportunities that are based on balanced performance metrics to promote disciplined progress toward advancing our business objectives. All payouts for named executive officers are capped at a pre-established percentage of base salary.  
• Review Share Utilization. We annually review overhang levels (the dilutive impact of equity awards on our shareholders) and run rates (the aggregate shares awarded as a percentage of total outstanding shares).  
• Retain an Independent Consultant. The Committee retains an independent consultant to provide advice in the development of our executive compensation strategy and program. The Committee, with the assistance of the independent consultant, regularly evaluates the compensation practices of our peer companies to confirm that our compensation programs are consistent with market practice.

 Feature   Description  
 Annual Limit on Awards to Directors   The Plan limits the aggregate grant date fair value of all awards granted to any non-employee director during any single calendar year for services as a director (excluding awards made at the election of the director in lieu of all or a portion of annual and committee cash retainers), taken together with any cash fees paid during such calendar year, to $300,000 with respect to any director who is serving in a capacity other than non-executive Chairman, and $500,000 with respect to a non-executive Chairman.  
 Responsible Share Counting Provisions   The Plan does not permit "liberal share counting," which means that only awards that are forfeited, terminated, or which are settled in cash can be added back to the Plan's Share reserve.  
 Minimum Vesting Requirements   Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, equity-based awards granted under the Plan will be subject to a minimum vesting period of at least one year, with an exception for awards covering up to five percent (5%) of the Shares available for issuance as of the Annual Meeting.  
 No Discounted Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs")   The Plan does not permit the use of "discounted" stock options or SARs, which means that such awards may not have an exercise or base price less than the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant.  
 No Re-Pricing of Stock Options or SARs   The Plan does not permit, without shareholder approval, the "repricing" of stock options and SARs.  
 Clawback and Forfeiture Provisions   Awards granted under the Plan will be subject to forfeiture as provided by the Compensation Committee if a participant engages in "detrimental activity" (such as a breach of a non-compete, non-solicitation, or confidentiality covenant). Awards granted under the Plan are also subject to recoupment under any compensation recovery policy adopted by the Company.  
 No Dividends or Dividend Equivalents on Unvested Performance Awards   To the extent dividends or dividend equivalents are paid with respect to awards that vest based on the achievement of performance goals, those amounts will be accumulated until such award is earned, and the dividends or dividend equivalents shall not be paid if the performance goals are not satisfied.  
 Administered by an Independent Committee   The Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee, each member of which qualifies as an "independent director" under the listing standards of the Nasdaq.
