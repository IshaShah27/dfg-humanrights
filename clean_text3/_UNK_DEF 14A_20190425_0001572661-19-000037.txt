INTRODUCTION
Each series of Principal Exchange-Traded Funds ("PETF" or "we"), Principal Funds, Inc. ("PFI"), and Principal Variable Contracts Funds, Inc. ("PVC") will hold a joint annual meeting of shareholders on April 25, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time, at 655 9th Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50392 (including any adjournments or postponements, the "Meeting"). This Proxy Statement and the accompanying form(s) of proxy card relate to PEFT only and are first being sent to PETF shareholders on or about March 11, 2019. Separate proxy materials for each of PFI and PVC are being sent to PFI and PVC shareholders.
PETF is a Delaware statutory trust and an open-end management investment company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").

 VOTING INFORMATION
Voting procedures. We are furnishing this Proxy Statement to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Board to be used at the Meeting. Please vote your shares by mailing the enclosed card(s) in the enclosed postage-paid envelope or by following the instructions on the card(s) for voting by telephone or via the Internet. Shareholders who wish to attend the Meeting in person may call 1-800-787-1621 if they have any questions.
If you complete and return the enclosed proxy card(s) (or if you give your proxy by telephone or via the Internet), the persons named on the card as proxies will vote your shares as you indicate on the proxy card(s) (or as you instruct by telephone or via the Internet) or for approval of each proposal for which there is no indication. You may change your vote and revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Meeting in any of the following ways: 
(i) by sending a written notice of revocation to the Meeting Secretary of Principal Exchange-Traded Funds in care of Principal Financial Group, 711 High Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50392; 
(ii) by submitting another properly signed proxy card at a later date to the Meeting Secretary of Principal Funds, Inc. in care of Principal Financial Group, 711 High Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50392; 
(iii) by submitting another proxy by telephone or via the Internet at a later date; or 
(iv) being present and voting in person at the Meeting after giving oral notice of the revocation to the Chair of the Meeting.
Voting rights. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on February 25, 2019 (the "Record Date") are entitled to vote. The shareholders of all Funds will vote together on Proposal 1 regarding the election of Trustees. The shareholders of each Fund subject to the proposal will vote together for Proposals 2 and 3. You are entitled to one vote on each proposal submitted to the shareholders of a Fund for each share of that Fund you hold, and fractional votes for fractional shares held. 
The affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares voted at the Meeting is required for the election of a Trustee under Proposal 1. This means that those nominees for Trustee receiving the highest number of votes cast at the Meeting will be elected. The nominees are running unopposed, so each nominee is expected to be elected as a Trustee because all nominees who receive votes in favor will be elected. Proposals 2 and 3 require for approval the vote of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities," which is defined in the 1940 Act to mean, with respect to a Fund, the affirmative vote of the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the voting securities of the Fund present in person or by proxy at the meeting of that Fund, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund are present in person or by proxy, or (2) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund (such lesser amount being a "Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities"). Under this definition, a proposal could be approved by as little as approximately one-third of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund to which that proposal applies. 
The number of votes eligible to be cast at the Meeting with respect to each Fund as of the Record Date and other share ownership information are set forth in Appendix A to this Proxy Statement.
Quorum requirements; abstentions and broker non-votes. A quorum must be present at the Meeting for the transaction of business by any Fund. For Proposal 1, the presence in person or by proxy of one-third of the shares of PETF outstanding at the close of business on the Record Date constitutes a quorum. For Proposals 2 and 3, the presence in person or by proxy of one-third of the shares of each applicable Fund outstanding at the close of business on the Record Date constitutes a quorum for a meeting of that Fund. 
Abstentions, if any, will be considered present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum but will be disregarded in determining the votes cast on a proposal. As a result, with respect to (i) Proposal 1 requiring the affirmative vote of a plurality of shares cast at the Meeting, abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of such proposal, and (ii) Proposals 2 and 3 requiring the affirmative vote of a Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities, as defined above, abstentions will have the effect of a vote against such proposals. Broker non-votes, if any, will also be considered present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum but will be disregarded in determining the votes cast on a proposal. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker or nominee indicates it has not received voting instructions from a shareholder and is barred from voting the shares without such shareholder instructions because the proposal is considered non-routine under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Proposals 2 and 3 may be considered non-routine, so your broker or nominee likely will not be permitted to vote your shares if it has not received instructions from you, resulting in broker non-votes. A broker non-vote on either Proposal 2 or 3 will have the same effect as a vote against such proposal.  Proposal 1 is considered routine under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, so if you do not give your broker or nominee voting instructions on this proposal, your broker or nominee may vote your shares in its discretion, resulting in no broker non-votes. However, if your broker or nominee does not exercise such discretion and a broker non-vote results, such broker non-vote will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 1.
If the necessary quorum to transact business or the vote required to approve a proposal is not obtained at the Meeting, the persons named as proxies or any shareholder present at the Meeting may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting as to one or more proposals in accordance with applicable law to permit further solicitation of proxies. Any such adjournment as to a proposal or any other matter with respect to a Fund will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Fund present in person or by proxy at the Meeting. The persons named as proxies and any shareholder present at the Meeting will vote for or against any adjournment in their discretion.
Solicitation procedures. We intend to solicit proxies by mail. Officers or employees of PETF, PGI, or their affiliates may make additional solicitations by telephone, Internet, or personal contact. They will not be specially compensated for these services. Brokerage houses, banks, and other fiduciaries may be requested to forward soliciting materials to their customers and to obtain authorization for the execution of proxies. For those services, PETF will reimburse them for their out-of-pocket expenses. PETF has retained the services of a professional proxy soliciting firm, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., to assist in soliciting proxies and provide other services in connection therewith and estimates that the aggregate cost of such services will be approximately $20,000. 
Expenses of the Meeting. PGI will pay the expenses of the Meeting, including those associated with the preparation and distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of proxies.  PROPOSAL 1
ELECTION OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES
(All Funds)
At its January 31, 2019 meeting, the Board named the twelve persons listed below as nominees for election as Trustees. Eleven of the nominees currently serve as Trustees. The other nominee, Timothy M. Dunbar, will become a Trustee immediately if he is elected as a Trustee at the Meeting. If elected, Mr. Dunbar will fill the vacancy on the Board created by the departure of Nora Everett, who on November 28, 2018 announced her intention to retire as Chair and member of the Board, effective March 12, 2019.
Each nominee has agreed to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected. The Board has no reason to believe that any of the nominees will become unavailable for election as a Trustee. However, if that should occur before the Meeting, your proxy will be voted for the individual(s) recommended by the Board to fill each resulting vacancy.
The following table presents certain information regarding PETF's Trustees and the new nominee, including their principal occupations and other directorships. Ms. Everett is not standing for re-election at the Meeting because she is retiring from the Board prior to the date of the Meeting. Information is listed separately for those Trustees and nominees who are "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of PETF (the "Interested Trustees") and those Trustees and nominees who are not interested persons of PETF (the "Independent Trustees"). Two of the nominees for Independent Trustee, Ms. Nickels and Ms. VanDeWeghe, have not previously been elected Trustees by PETF's shareholders. The Board's Nominating and Governance Committee, composed of two of PETF's Independent Trustees, selected and nominated Ms. Nickels and Ms. VanDeWeghe as candidates for Trustee upon the recommendations of one or more of the Trustees. Two of the nominees for Interested Trustee, Mr. Dunbar and Mr. Halter, have not previously been elected Trustees by PETF's shareholders, and both were selected and nominated as candidates for Trustee upon the recommendations of affiliated persons of PGI, PETF's investment advisor. 
All individuals who are current Trustees also serve as directors of PFI, a mutual fund sponsored by Principal Life, and as directors of PVC, another mutual fund sponsored by Principal Life. All individuals who are nominees as Trustees are also currently standing as nominees for election as directors of PFI and PVC and, if elected by those respective shareholders, will serve as directors of PFI and PVC. If the same individuals are not elected by the shareholders of each of PEFT, PFI, and PVC, the compositions of those boards will differ. PEFT, PFI, and PVC (collectively, the "Fund Complex") currently offer shares of a combined total of 131 funds.
Each Trustee will serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until a successor is elected and qualified.

 During the last fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Board of Trustees held eight meetings.  For that fiscal year, each then-serving Trustee attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and of each Board committee on which the Trustee served, held during the time the Trustee was a member of the Board.
  None of the Funds currently have a formal policy regarding Board members' attendance at shareholders' meetings. None of the Funds held, or were required to hold, a shareholders' meeting at which Board members were elected during its last fiscal year.

Leadership Structure of the Board of Trustees
Overall responsibility for directing PETF's business and affairs rests with the Board of Trustees, who are elected by PETF's shareholders. In addition to serving on the PETF Board, each Trustee serves on the PFI Board and PVC Board. The Board is responsible for overseeing PETF's operations in accordance with the 1940 Act, other applicable laws, and PETF's charter. The Board elects the officers of PETF to supervise its day-to-day operations. The Board meets in regularly scheduled meetings eight times throughout the year. Board meetings may occur in-person or by telephone. In addition, the Board holds special meetings or informal calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regularly meetings. Board members who are Independent Trustees meet annually to consider renewal of PETF's advisory contracts. Each Trustee and Trustee nominee has significant prior senior management and/or board experience.
As of the Record Date, the Board is composed of twelve members, nine of whom are Independent Trustees.  As stated above, on November 28, 2018, Ms. Everett announced her intention to retire as Chair and member of the Board, effective March 12, 2019. Mr. Dunbar will fill the Board vacancy created by Ms. Everett's retirement, effective immediately, if he is elected a Trustee at the Meeting. Following Ms. Everett's retirement and  if Mr. Dunbar is elected, the Board will continue to be composed of twelve members, nine of whom are Independent Trustees. 
     Currently, the Chair of the Board, Nora Everett, is an interested person of PETF.  The Independent Trustees of PETF have appointed a lead Independent Trustee whose role is to review and approve, with the Chair, the agenda for each Board meeting and facilitate communication among PETF's Independent Trustees as well as communication among the Independent Trustees, PETF management and the full Board.  PETF has determined that the Board's leadership structure is appropriate given the characteristics and circumstances of PETF, including such items as the number of series that comprise PETF, the variety of asset classes those series reflect, the net assets of PETF, the committee structure of the Board and the distribution arrangements of PETF.  The appropriateness of this structure is enhanced by PETF's Board committees, which are described below, and the allocation of responsibilities among them.  Following Ms. Everett's retirement on March 12, 2019, the Board will elect a new Chair based upon its assessment of an appropriate leadership structure for the Board. The Trustees were selected to serve, and continue to serve, on the Board based upon their skills, experience, judgment, analytical ability, diligence and ability to work effectively with other Board members, a commitment to the interests of shareholders, and, for each Independent Trustee, a demonstrated willingness to take an independent and questioning view of management. In addition to these general qualifications, the Board seeks members who will build upon the diversity of the Board. The following is a brief discussion of the specific education, experience, qualifications, or skills that led to the conclusion that each person identified below should serve as a Trustee. As required by rules the SEC has adopted under the 1940 Act, PETF's Independent Trustees select and nominate all candidates for Independent Trustee positions.

Board Committees
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee's primary purpose is to assist the Board in fulfilling certain of its responsibilities. The Audit Committee serves as an independent and objective party to monitor PETF's accounting policies, financial reporting, and internal control system, as well as the work of the independent registered public accountants. The Audit Committee assists Board oversight of (1) the integrity of PETF's financial statements; (2) PETF's compliance with certain legal and regulatory requirements; (3) the independent registered public accountants'  qualifications and independence; and (4) the performance of PETF'ss independent registered public accountants. The Audit Committee also provides an open avenue of communication among the independent registered public accountants, PGI's internal auditors, PETF management, and the Board. The Audit Committee held seven meetings during the last fiscal year. The Audit Committee is composed of Mr. Barnes, Mr. Damos, and Ms. Nickels.
A copy of the Audit Committee Charter of the Board is included as Appendix B to this Proxy Statement.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee's primary purpose is to exercise certain powers of the Board when the Board is not in session. When the Board is not in session, the Executive Committee may exercise all powers of the Board in the management of the business of PEFT except the power to (1) issue stock, except as permitted by law; (2) recommend to the shareholders any action that requires shareholder approval; (3) amend PETF's declaration of trust or bylaws; or (4) approve any merger or share exchange that does not require shareholder approval. The Executive Committee held no meetings during the last fiscal year. As of the Record Date, the Executive Committee is composed of Mr. Grimmett, Mr. Beer, and Ms. Everett. Following Ms. Everett's retirement on March 12, 2019, the Board will appoint a third Trustee to serve on this committee.
Nominating and Governance Committee
The Nominating and Governance Committee's primary purpose is to oversee the structure and efficiency of the Board and the committees established by the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee responsibilities include evaluating Board membership and functions, committee membership and functions, insurance coverage, and legal matters.
The nominating functions of the Nominating and Governance Committee include selecting and nominating all candidates who are not "interested persons" of PEFT for election to the Board. Generally, the Nominating and Governance Committee requests trustee nominee suggestions from the Board and management. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider trustee candidates recommended by PETF shareholders.
Trustee recommendations should be submitted in writing to Principal Funds, Inc. at 711 High Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50392. When evaluating a person as a potential nominee to serve as an Independent Trustee, the Nominating and Governance Committee will generally consider, among other factors: age; education; relevant business experience; geographical factors; whether the person is "independent" and otherwise qualified under applicable laws and regulations to serve as a trustee; and whether the person is willing to serve, and willing and able to commit the time necessary for attendance at meetings and the performance of the duties of an independent trustee. The Nominating and Governance Committee also meets personally with the nominees and conducts a reference check. The final decision regarding a nominee is based on a combination of factors, including the strengths and the experience a specific individual may bring to the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee believes the Board generally benefits from diversity of background, experience, and views among its members, and considers these factors in evaluating the composition of the Board. The Board does not use regularly the services of any professional search firms to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential candidates or nominees. The Nominating and Governance Committee held five meetings during the last fiscal year. The Nominating and Governance Committee is composed of Ms. Ballantine and Mr. Grimmett.
A copy of the Nominating and Governance Committee Charter of the Board is included as Appendix C to this Proxy Statement. 
Operations Committee
The Operations Committee's primary purpose is to oversee the provision of administrative and distribution services to PETF, communications with PETF's shareholders, and review and oversight of PETF's operations. The Operations Committee held four meetings during the last fiscal year. The Operations Committee is composed of Mr. Hirsch, Mr. Huang, Ms. McMillan, and Ms. VanDeWeghe.
15(c) Committee
     The 15(c) Committee's primary purpose is to assist the Board in performing the annual review of PETF's advisory and sub-advisory agreements pursuant to Section 15(c) of the 1940 Act. The 15(c) Committee's responsibilities include requesting and reviewing materials. The 15(c) Committee held five meetings during the last fiscal year. The 15(c) Committee is composed of Mr. Damos, Mr. Grimmett, Mr. Hirsch, and Mr. Huang.  Compensation
PETF does not pay any remuneration to its Trustees or officers who are employed by PGI or its affiliates. The Board annually considers a proposal to reimburse PGI for a portion of the Chief Compliance Officer's compensation. If the proposal is adopted, these amounts are allocated across all Funds based on relative net assets of each portfolio. Each Trustee who is not an "interested person" received compensation for service as a member of the Boards of PETF, PFI, and PVC based on a schedule that takes into account an annual retainer amount and the number of meetings attended. Responsibility for these fees and expenses are divided among the portfolios of PETF, PFI, and PVC based on their relative net assets.
      The following table provides information regarding the compensation received by the Independent Trustees from PETF and from the Fund Complex during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.  As stated above, the Fund Complex includes PETF, PFI, and PVC.  PETF does not provide retirement benefits to any Trustee.

The following tables set forth the dollar range of the equity securities of each Fund, and the aggregate dollar range of the equity securities of all funds within the Fund Complex, which the Trustees and Trustee nominee beneficially owned as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, each of the Trustees listed in the table did not beneficially own shares of funds that do not appear in the table.
As stated above, the Fund Complex includes PETF, PFI, and PVC. For the purpose of these tables, beneficial ownership means a direct or indirect pecuniary interest. Only the Trustees who are "interested persons" are eligible to participate in a PFG employee benefit program that invests PFI. Trustees who beneficially owned shares of a series of PVC did so through variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts issued by Principal Life. Ownership is listed based on the following dollar ranges:

Required vote. The shareholders of all Funds will vote together on the election of Trustees. The affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares voted at the Meeting a which a quorum is present is required for the election of a Trustee of PETF. If one or more nominee(s) for Trustee are not elected, the Board will determine what action, if any, should be taken.
The Board of Trustees recommends that shareholders vote "For" each nominee. APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT OF
CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS
Introduction
      PETF has adopted certain investment policies for each Fund, which it generally refers to as "investment restrictions," that can only be changed by a vote of shareholders. Such investment restrictions are considered "fundamental."  The 1940 Act requires that certain policies, including those dealing with the issuance of senior securities, purchasing or selling commodities or real estate, borrowing money and making loans, diversification, industry concentration, and underwriting securities of other issuers be fundamental, and the Board may elect to designate other policies as fundamental. 
Shareholders of certain Funds are being asked to approve amendments to certain fundamental investment restrictions. The amendment to each investment restriction is set forth in a separate proposal below (Proposals 2 and 3).
PGI has reviewed each of the current investment restrictions and has recommended to the Board that certain restrictions be amended. The proposed amendments are intended to clarify and simplify PETF's fundamental restrictions and to incorporate flexibility to accommodate future regulatory changes without the need for further shareholder action. Additionally, to reflect changes over time in industry practices and regulatory requirements, some of the proposed amendments update fundamental restrictions that are more restrictive than are required under the federal securities laws. 
The proposed amendments are not expected to have any material effect on the manner in which any Fund is managed or on any Fund's current principal investment objective(s). 
The Board has concluded that the proposed amendments to the investment restrictions are appropriate and will benefit the Funds and their shareholders. If approved by shareholders of a Fund, each amended investment restriction will become effective as to that Fund when PETF's Statement of Additional Information is revised or supplemented to reflect the amendment.
 Required vote. Shareholders of each Fund will vote separately on each proposed amendment that applies to that Fund. As to any Fund, approval of each of Proposals 2 and 3 will require the affirmative vote of a Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities (as defined above under "Voting Information - Voting rights") of that Fund. If a proposed amendment is not approved by shareholders of a Fund, the current investment restriction will remain in effect as to that Fund.
The Board recommends that the shareholders of each Fund vote "For"
each Proposal applicable to the Fund.
Organization of Proposals
    The amendment to each fundamental investment restriction is set forth in a separate proposal below (Proposals 2 and 3). The Funds that will vote on each proposal are identified under the caption for that proposal, and each proposal sets forth the proposed amended fundamental investment restriction as well as the restriction currently in effect. For each proposal, the term "Fund" or "Funds" refers to the Fund or Funds voting on the particular proposal.
PROPOSAL 2
APPROVAL OF AN AMENDED FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT RESTRICTION 
RELATING TO COMMODITIES FOR THE FUND
(Each Fund)
 Sections 8(b)(1)(F) and 13(a)(2) of the 1940 Act together require that each Fund have a fundamental restriction dealing with the purchase or sale of commodities. The 1940 Act does not prohibit a fund from investing in commodities.  Proposed restriction: The Board is proposing that the Funds indicated above adopt the following fundamental investment restriction relating to commodities:
 The Fund may not purchase or sell commodities, except as permitted by applicable law, regulation or regulatory authority having jurisdiction.
 Current Restriction: Currently, each Fund has a fundamental investment restriction relating to commodities that differs from the proposed restriction. The current restriction is set forth below.
    "Each Fund may not purchase or sell commodities, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, as amended, and as interpreted, modified or otherwise permitted by regulatory authority having jurisdiction, from time to time."
     Discussion of proposed amendment. The proposed amendment is intended to clarify that each Fund's ability to purchase or sell commodities is limited by all laws applicable to such Fund, not just the 1940 Act. Under the proposed restriction, if current applicable law changes, each Fund could conform to such new law without shareholders taking further action.
Approval by any Fund of the proposed amended restriction relating to commodities is not expected to increase the risk of an investment in the Fund or affect the way the Fund is currently managed or operated.
PROPOSAL 3
APPROVAL OF AN AMENDED FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT RESTRICTION 
RELATING TO CONCENTRATION FOR THE FUND
(Principal Active Global Dividend Income ETF, Principal EDGE Active Income ETF, and 
Principal Investment Grade Corporate Active ETF only)
     Under the 1940 Act, a fund's policy regarding concentration of investments in the securities of companies in any particular industry must be fundamental. The staff of the SEC takes the position that any fund that invests more than 25% of its total assets in a particular industry (excluding the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities) is deemed to be "concentrated" in that industry.
 Proposed restriction: The Board is proposing that the Funds indicated above adopt the following fundamental investment restriction relating to concentration:
 The Fund may not concentrate, as that term is used in the 1940 Act, as amended, and as interpreted, modified or otherwise permitted by regulatory authority having jurisdiction, from time to time, its investments in a particular industry or group of industries.
 Current Restriction: Currently, the Funds indicated above have a fundamental investment restriction relating to concentration that differs from the proposed restriction. The current restriction is set forth below.
     "Each Fund may not concentrate, as that term is used in the 1940 Act, its investments in a particular industry, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, as amended, and as interpreted, modified or otherwise permitted by regulatory authority having jurisdiction, from time to time."
     Discussion of proposed amendment. Because the 1940 Act does not otherwise permit concentration, the exception stated in the current restriction is not meaningful. The proposed amendment is intended to clarify the restriction by deleting such exception. Each Fund currently has, and will continue to have, a fundamental investment restriction that prohibits the Fund from concentrating its investments in any one industry.
Approval by a Fund of the proposed amended restriction relating to concentration is not expected to increase the risk of an investment in the Fund. INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The firm of Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") has been selected as the independent registered public accounting firm for PETF for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 and served as such for the last two fiscal years. The independent registered public accounting firm audits annual financial statements for PETF and reviews regulatory filings that include those financial statements. Representatives of Ernst & Young are expected to be present at the Meeting, have been given the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to answer appropriate questions. 
The Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") has adopted the following policy regarding approval and pre-approval of audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm (the "independent auditor").
* * *
The Principal Funds
Policy on Auditor Independence
The purpose of this policy is to ensure the independence of the Principal Funds' primary independent auditor.  This policy is established by the Audit Committee (the "Committee") of the Boards of Directors of Principal Funds, Inc. and Principal Variable Contracts Funds, Inc. and the Board of Trustees of Principal Exchange-Traded Funds (the "Funds") (the "Boards of the Funds") effective for all engagements of the primary independent auditor.
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. The primary independent auditor, its subsidiaries and affiliates shall not provide Prohibited Services to the Funds.  For the purposes of this policy, Prohibited Services are: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Services that are subject to audit procedure during a financial statement audit; 
• Services where the auditor would act on behalf of management; 
• Services where the auditor is an advocate to the client's position in an adversarial proceeding; 
• Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the Funds, its subsidiaries and affiliates; 
• Financial information systems design and implementation; 
• Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-in-kind reports; 
• Actuarial services; 
• Internal audit functions or human resources; 
• Broker or dealer, investment advisor, or investment banking services; 
• Legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit; 
• Tax planning services related to listed, confidential and aggressive transactions; 
• Personal tax planning services to individuals in a financial reporting oversight role with regard to the Funds (other than members of the Boards of the Funds who are not also officers of the Funds), including the immediate family members of such individuals; 
• Any other service that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) determines, by regulation, is impermissible. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2. (A) All services the primary independent auditor, its subsidiaries and affiliates provide to the Funds, and (B) Audit services, including audits of annual financial statements, audits of acquired or divested businesses or review of regulatory filings, any independent auditor provides, shall be approved by the Committee in advance in accordance with the following procedure: 
[END TABLE]
Each quarter, Management will present to the Committee for pre-approval, a detailed description of each particular service, excluding tax services, for which pre-approval is sought and a range of fees for such service.  The Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members provided such delegated member(s) shall present a report of any services approved to the full Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.  The Committee Chairperson shall have pre-approval authority for changes to any range of fees applicable to services the Committee previously approved and for new services and the range of fees for such services that arise between regularly scheduled Committee meetings. Similarly, the primary independent auditor will present to the Committee for pre-approval a written description of the nature and scope of all tax services not expressly prohibited, including the fee arrangements for such services, and the potential effects of such services on the audit firm's independence.
In considering whether to pre-approve the primary independent auditor's provision of non-audit services, the Committee will consider whether the services are compatible with the maintenance of such auditor's independence.  The Committee will also consider whether the primary independent auditor is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service, for reasons such as its familiarity with the Funds' business, people, culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance the Funds' ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality.
[BEGIN TABLE]
3. The provisions of this policy shall apply to all audit and non-audit services provided directly to the Funds.  Additionally, the provisions of this policy shall apply to non-audit services provided to Principal Global Investors, LLC ("PGI") or an affiliate of PGI that provides ongoing services to the Funds if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Funds. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4. Not less than annually, the primary independent auditor shall report to the Committee in writing all relationships that may reasonably be thought to bear on independence between the auditor and the Funds or persons in financial reporting oversight roles with respect to any services provided by the auditor, its subsidiaries or affiliates as of the date of the communication, pursuant to Rule 3526 of the PCAOB.  The primary independent auditor shall discuss with the Committee the potential effects of such relationships on the independence of the auditor.  In addition, the primary independent auditor shall affirm, in writing, that, as of the date of the communication, it is independent within the meaning of the federal securities laws and Rule 3520 of the PCAOB. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
5. The Committee shall ensure that the lead and concurring partners of the Funds' primary independent auditor are rotated at least every five years and subject upon rotation to a five year "time out" period.  All other partners of the primary independent auditor, excluding partners who simply consult with others on the audit engagement regarding technical issues, shall rotate after seven years and be subject upon rotation to a two year "time out" period. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
6. Neither the Funds nor PGI may hire or promote any former partner, principal, shareholder or professional employee (Former Employee) of the primary independent auditor into a financial reporting oversight role unless the Former Employee (1) has severed his/her economic interest in the independent audit firm, and (2) was not a member of the audit engagement team for the Funds during the one year period preceding the date that the audit procedures began for the fiscal period in which the Funds or PGI proposes to hire or promote the Former Employee.  Neither the Funds nor PGI shall, without prior written consent of the primary independent auditor, hire or promote any Former Employee into a role not prohibited above if the Former Employee had provided any services to the Funds or PGI during the 12 months preceding the date of filing of the Funds' most recent annual report with the SEC.  Upon termination of the primary independent auditor, the Funds or PGI shall not, without prior written consent of the former primary independent auditor, hire or promote any Former Employee for a period of up to 12 months from termination. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.  For persons recently promoted or hired into a financial reporting oversight role (other than members of the Boards of the Funds who are not also officers of the Funds), any personal tax planning services pursuant to an engagement that was in progress before the hiring or promotion and provided by the primary independent auditor must be completed on or before 180 days after the hiring or promotion. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
8.  The phrase "financial reporting oversight role" means a role in which a person is in a position to exercise influence over the contents of the financial statements or anyone who prepares them, such as a member of the board of directors or similar management or governing body, chief executive officer, president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, counsel, controller, chief internal auditor, or any equivalent positions. 
[END TABLE]

APPENDIX B
AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER
PRINCIPAL FUNDS1 
Audit Committee Charter (Amended March 13, 2018)
This charter sets forth the purpose, operating guidelines and responsibilities of the Audit Committee (the "Committee") of the Boards of Directors/Trustees of the Principal Funds (the "Funds"). The Committee reviews the charter at least annually.
Purpose
The primary purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling certain of its responsibilities. The Audit Committee serves as an independent and objective party to monitor the Funds' accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control system, as well as the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee assists Board oversight of (1) the integrity of the Funds' financial statements; (2) the Funds' compliance with certain legal and regulatory requirements;2 (3) the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence; and (4) the performance of the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also serves to provide an open avenue of communication among the independent registered public accounting firm, the Manager's internal auditors, Fund management, and the Board.
The Committee's role is limited to oversight. Fund management is responsible for preparing the Funds' financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and for establishing and maintaining appropriate systems for accounting, reporting and internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for conducting an audit of the Funds' financial statements in accordance with applicable legal and professional standards, including the standards set by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
Although the Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in this charter, it is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Funds' financial statements are complete and accurate and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Nothing in this charter shall be construed to reduce the responsibilities or liabilities of the Funds' service providers, including the independent registered public accounting firm. The independent registered public accounting firm is ultimately accountable to the Funds' Board and the Committee.
Operating Guidelines
The Board shall appoint the members of the Committee and the Committee's Chair. Members of the Committee may not be interested persons of the Funds, as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The number of Committee members shall satisfy each of the securities exchanges on which the Funds offers shares. In addition, a member of the Committee may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the Committee, the Board or any other board committee, accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the Funds or any affiliate of the Funds.
Each member of the Committee shall be financially literate, as such qualification is interpreted by the Funds' Board in its business judgment. At least one member of the Committee must have accounting or related financial management expertise, as the Board interprets such qualification in its business judgment. The Board will determine whether any member of the Committee is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR.
____________________
