[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
What if other matters come up at the annual meeting? 
The items listed on the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders are the only matters that we know will be voted on at the annual meeting. Your proxy gives discretionary authority to the persons named on the proxy card to vote on other matters. On such other business as may properly come before the meeting, your shares will be voted in the discretion and judgment of the proxy holder. 
Who has been nominated for election as directors at the annual meeting? 
The board of directors has nominated thirteen directors for election, all of whom are currently serving on our board of directors. The thirteen directors who have been nominated by the board of directors and agreed to serve as directors are Ms. Goodman and Messrs. Conn, Jacobson, Maffei, Markley, Merritt, Meyer, Miron, Newhouse, Nair, Ramos, Rutledge and Zinterhofer.  Who can vote at the annual meeting? 
As of the close of business on February 22, 2019 (the "Record Date"), a total of 224,971,942 shares of Class A common stock, including Charter Communications Holdings, LLC ("Charter Holdings") common and preferred units on an as-if-converted or exchanged basis, are entitled to be voted by our stockholders at the annual meeting. Each holder of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Advance/Newhouse Partnership ("A/N") holds one share of our Class B common stock, which is entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of shares of Class A common stock into which the Charter Holdings common and preferred held by A/N may be converted or exchanged. The enclosed proxy card indicates the number of Class A shares that our records show you are entitled to vote. There are no other classes of common stock outstanding. 
What is the difference between being a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner? 
You are a stockholder of record if at the close of business on the Record Date your shares were registered in your name with Computershare Shareowner Services, our transfer agent and registrar. 
You are a beneficial owner if at the close of business on the Record Date, your shares were held by a brokerage firm or other nominee and not directly in your name, but are held in "street name." As the beneficial owner of your shares, you have the right to direct your broker or other nominee how to vote your shares, i.e., for or against the proposals to be considered at the annual meeting. If you do not provide your broker or nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares, your broker or nominee will be able to vote your shares with respect to some of the proposals, but not all. See, "What if I do not provide instructions on how to vote my shares?" below. 
What do I do if my shares are held in "street name"? 
If your shares are held in the name of your broker or other nominee, you should return your proxy in the envelope provided by your broker or nominee or instruct the person responsible for holding your shares to execute a proxy on your behalf. In either case, your shares will be voted according to your instructions. 
What if I do not provide instructions on how to vote my shares? 
If you are a stockholder of record and you submit a proxy, but do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be voted for the election of the Company's director nominees, "FOR" the Company's proposals as described above and "AGAINST" each of the stockholder proposals. 
If you are a beneficial owner and you do not provide the broker or other nominee that holds your shares with voting instructions, the broker or nominee has discretionary authority to vote for certain proposals, but not others pursuant to the rules of NASDAQ and the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Brokers and other nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters such as Proposal 3, but not on non-routine matters such as Proposals 1, 2, 4 or 5. Therefore, if you do not provide voting instructions to the broker or nominee that holds your shares, the broker or nominee may only vote for Proposal 3 and any other routine matters properly presented for a vote at the annual meeting. 
What is the quorum required for the meeting? 
We will hold the annual meeting if holders of shares having a majority of the voting power of Charter's capital stock as of the Record Date either sign and return their proxy cards, vote via the Internet or attend the meeting. If you sign and return your proxy card or vote via the Internet, your shares will be counted to determine whether we have a quorum, even if you fail to indicate your vote. 
Abstentions and broker "non-votes" will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists at the annual meeting.  How are broker non-votes and abstentions treated? 
If an executed proxy is returned by a broker holding shares in street name that indicates that the broker does not have discretionary authority as to certain shares to vote on one or more matters (a broker non-vote), such shares will be considered present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum on all matters, but will not be considered to be votes cast with respect to such matters. 
A stockholder may vote to "abstain" on any of the proposals. If you vote to "abstain," your shares will be counted as present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum on all matters, but will not be considered to be votes cast with respect to such matters. Only "FOR" and "AGAINST" votes are counted for purposes of determining the votes cast in connection with each proposal. 
With respect to each of the proposals, broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on determining whether the affirmative vote constitutes a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the annual meeting. In addition, because they do not count as votes cast, assuming a quorum is present, abstentions from voting, broker non-votes or a stockholder's other failure to vote will have no effect on the applicable proposal. 
In order to minimize the number of broker non-votes, the Company encourages you to vote or to provide voting instructions to the organization that holds your shares by carefully following the instructions provided in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
What is the vote required for the proposals on the agenda? 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast is required for approval of the matters in Proposals 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast. Accordingly, assuming a quorum is present, abstentions, broker non-votes and a stockholder's other failure to vote will have no effect on the applicable proposal. 
What are my choices in the proposals on the agenda? 
On Proposal 1, for each of the director nominees you can vote your shares "FOR" a nominee, "AGAINST" a nominee or you can abstain from voting. On Proposals 2, 3, 4 and 5 you can vote "FOR" a proposal, vote "AGAINST" a proposal, or abstain from voting. 
How do I vote by proxy? 
Follow the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. Sign and date the proxy card and mail it back to us in the enclosed envelope. If you receive more than one proxy card it may mean that you hold shares in more than one account. Sign and return all proxy cards to ensure that all of your shares are voted. The proxy holder named on the proxy card will vote your shares as you instruct. If you sign and return the proxy card but do not indicate your vote, the proxy holder will vote on your behalf "FOR" each of the director nominees and the Company proposals as noted above and "AGAINST" each of the stockholder proposals and will also have discretionary authority to vote your shares on any other matter that is properly brought before the annual meeting. Stockholders may also vote their proxy by using the toll free number listed on the proxy card and following the instructions. 
Can I vote via the Internet? 
Stockholders with shares registered in their names with Computershare Shareowner Services, our transfer agent, may authorize a proxy via the Internet at the following address: www.proxyvote.com. A number of brokerage firms and banks participate in a program that permits Internet voting. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank that participates in such a program, you may direct the vote of those shares by following the instructions on the voting form enclosed with the proxy from the brokerage firm or bank.  Proxies submitted via the Internet must be received by 11:59 p.m. (EDT) on April 22, 2019. Please refer to your voting instruction form and/or your proxy card for specific voting instructions. If you vote this year's proxy via the Internet, you may also elect to receive future proxy and other materials electronically by following the instructions when you vote. Making this election will save the Company the cost of producing and mailing these documents. 
Can I change my vote after I return my proxy card? 
Yes. At any time before the vote at the annual meeting, you can change your vote either by giving our Corporate Secretary a written notice revoking your proxy card, or by signing, dating and submitting a new later- dated proxy card via the Internet, by telephone or by mail. We will honor the latest dated proxy card which has been received prior to the closing of the voting. You may also attend the meeting and vote in person. 
Can I vote in person at the annual meeting rather than by completing the proxy card? 
Although we encourage you to complete and return the proxy card to ensure that your vote is counted, you can attend the annual meeting and vote your shares in person. If you wish to attend the annual meeting and vote your shares in person and you are the beneficial owner of your shares, you must obtain the documents required to vote your shares in person at the annual meeting from your broker or nominee. 
Is my vote confidential? 
We will maintain the confidentiality of proxy cards and other votes that identify individual stockholders unless disclosure is required by law. 
Who will count the votes? 
Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. has been appointed to receive and tabulate stockholder votes and to act as the inspector of election and certify to the election results. 
Who is soliciting my vote? 
The board of directors is soliciting your vote. In addition, we retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated, a proxy solicitation firm, to solicit proxies in connection with our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders at a total cost of approximately $20,000 plus expenses. Charter expects to solicit proxies primarily by mail, but directors, officers and other employees of Charter may also solicit in person or by internet, telephone or mail. Contact information for the proxy solicitor appears below.

Who pays for this proxy solicitation? 
The Company pays for the proxy solicitation. We will ask banks, brokers and other nominees and fiduciaries to forward the proxy material to the beneficial owners of the Class A common stock and to obtain the authority of executed proxies. We will reimburse them for their reasonable expenses.  Where can I find the voting results of the annual meeting? 
We will report the voting results on a Current Report on Form 8-K that we will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days after the date of the meeting and that we will post on our website promptly after the meeting.  Proposal No. 1: Election of Directors 
(Item 1 on Proxy Card) 
The size of our board of directors is thirteen, and we currently have thirteen members standing as nominees for election. Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named. As set forth in more detail below, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the board of directors has determined that a majority of the thirteen current directors are independent. 
Each of our directors is elected on an annual basis. The board of directors is soliciting your vote for the directors to be elected at the annual meeting of stockholders. Once elected, each of the directors will hold office until his or her successor is elected, or he or she resigns or is otherwise removed. 
Under the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated May 23, 2015, among Charter, Liberty Broadband Corporation ("Liberty Broadband"), A/N and the former Charter Communications, Inc. (the "Stockholders Agreement"), and Charter's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the number of Charter's directors is fixed at thirteen, and includes its chief executive officer. Under the Stockholders Agreement, Liberty Broadband currently has the right to designate up to three directors as nominees for Charter's board of directors and A/N currently has the right to designate up to two directors as nominees for Charter's board of directors. Of our current directors, Messrs. Maffei, Meyer and Nair were appointed by Liberty Broadband and Messrs. Miron and Newhouse were appointed by A/N.

Mr. Markley received a B.A. degree from Washington & Lee University and an M.B.A. degree from Harvard Business School.

Board of Directors and Committees of the Board of Directors 
Our board of directors meets regularly throughout the year on an established schedule. The board also holds special meetings and executive sessions and acts by written consent from time to time as necessary. The Company held an annual stockholders' meeting in 2018, which ten of the directors attended. Members of the board of directors are encouraged to attend the annual meeting each year. In 2018, the full board of directors held ten meetings and acted two times by unanimous written consent. In 2018, the members of board of directors unaffiliated with Liberty or A/N also acted once by unanimous written consent. All directors attended 75% or more of the aggregate meetings of the board and of the board committees on which they served during 2018. 
The board of directors delegates authority to act with respect to certain matters to board committees whose members are appointed by the board of directors. The committees of the board of directors include the following: Audit Committee, Compensation and Benefits Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, Section 162(m) Committee and Finance Committee. The Audit, Compensation and Benefits, Nominating and Governance and Finance Committees each have a charter that is available on our website, www.charter.com. 
Charter's Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of the Company's financial statements, reviewing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm (including resolution of disagreements between management and the public accounting firm regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other audit, review or attest services and reviewing our risk management program. During 2018, the Audit Committee members consisted of Messrs. Merritt and Markley and Ms. Goodman. Mr. Merritt is Chairman of the Audit Committee. Charter's board of directors has determined that, in its judgment, Mr. Merritt is an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of the applicable federal regulations. All members of the Audit Committee were determined by the board of directors in 2018 to be independent in accordance with the listing standards of NASDAQ and Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Audit Committee met four times in 2018 and acted two times by unanimous written consent.  The Compensation and Benefits Committee reviews and approves the compensation of the senior management of the Company and its subsidiaries. During 2018, Messrs. Conn, Maffei, Miron, Ramos and Zinterhofer served on the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Mr. Conn served as the Chairman of the Compensation and Benefits Committee during 2018. All members of the Compensation and Benefits Committee were determined by the board of directors in 2018 to be independent in accordance with the listing standards of NASDAQ and Rule 10C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Compensation and Benefits Committee met five times in 2018. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees corporate governance, including recommending board and committee nominations and the Corporate Governance Guidelines and determining director independence. During 2018, Messrs. Markley, Jacobson, Newhouse and Zinterhofer served on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for the full year. Dr. Malone served on the committee until his appointment as director emeritus in July 2018. Mr. Meyer served on the committee from his appointment to the board in July 2018. Mr. Markley is the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. All members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee were determined by the board in 2018 to be independent in accordance with the listing standards of NASDAQ. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates proposed by stockholders if adequate information is submitted in a timely manner (see "Nomination and Qualifications of Directors" below). The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met four times in 2018. 
The Section 162(m) Committee reviews the Company's compensation for purposes of qualifying as performance-related compensation and thus meeting the provisions under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) for deductibility. In 2018, the Section 162(m) Committee was comprised of Messrs. Conn and Zinterhofer. In 2018, this committee acted one time by unanimous written consent. 
The Finance Committee reviews the Company's financing activities and approves the terms and conditions of certain financing transactions, in consultation with the Company's legal and financial advisors. During 2018, Messrs. Conn, Maffei, Merritt, Newhouse and Zinterhofer served on the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee met once and acted five times by unanimous written consent during 2018. 
From time to time, the board of directors may create "ad hoc" committees for specific projects or transactions. There were no ad hoc committees created in 2018. 
The Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the board of directors and the board of directors have determined that a majority of the thirteen current directors are independent. The Committee and the board of directors have specifically determined that Ms. Goodman and Messrs. Conn, Jacobson, Markley, Merritt, Meyer, Nair, Ramos and Zinterhofer are independent directors under NASDAQ rules. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the board of directors also determined that Mr. Maffei is independent under the NASDAQ rules; however, his status or relationship with Liberty Broadband, a stockholder of the Company, prohibits an independence finding under SEC rules for Audit Committee membership purposes. Similarly, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the board of directors determined that Messrs. Miron and Newhouse are independent under the NASDAQ rules; however, their status or relationship with A/N, a stockholder of the Company, prohibits an independence finding under SEC rules for Audit Committee membership purposes. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the board of directors further determined that Messrs. Maffei, Miron and Newhouse's status or relationship with a stockholder of the Company does not prohibit a finding of independence under SEC rules and NASDAQ Rule 5605(d)(2) for Compensation and Benefits Committee membership purposes. Mr. Rutledge is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and is thus not independent. 
Nomination and Qualifications of Directors 
Candidates for director are nominated by the board of directors, based on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and subject to certain requirements under the Stockholders   Agreement. Charter's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that, among other things, candidates for new board membership to be considered by Charter's board of directors should be individuals from diverse business and professional backgrounds with unquestioned high ethical standards and professional achievement, knowledge and experience. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a candidate's contribution of diversity to the board of directors (based on common factors associated with diversity such as gender and ethnicity) will be one of the many elements to be considered in evaluating candidates. Further, the board of directors and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believe that it is important that board members represent diverse viewpoints. In considering candidates for the board of directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the entirety of each candidate's credentials in the context of these standards. In addition, director candidates must be individuals with the time and commitment necessary to perform the duties of a board member and other special skills that complement or supplement the skill sets of current directors. 
We believe that the board of directors is comprised of an effective mix of experience, backgrounds, knowledge, and skills, including the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nine directors have experience and demonstrated expertise in managing large, complex organizations, such as serving as CEOs or next-level executives  of a significant company or organization;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Four directors have significant financial, accounting or other risk management expertise;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Two directors have significant technology and product development experience; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Eleven directors have experience on one or more boards of other significant public or nonprofit organizations.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, we believe that all of our directors have the following attributes that positively contribute to our board of directors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Experience with video, internet, telephone, wireless or media businesses;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Experience with significant transactions, including financings, investments and acquisitions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Judgment, skill, integrity and reputation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Diversity of life experiences and backgrounds, as well as gender and ethnic diversity.  
[END TABLE]
In January 2016, Charter entered into a memorandum of understanding (the "MOU") with leaders of several leading national civic organizations that took effect upon the closing of the Transactions (as defined below). The MOU identifies specific diversity initiatives and establishes a plan of action to guide the collaborative efforts of the Company and a wide array of diverse civic and leadership organizations. As part of the MOU, Charter committed to a number of concrete actions, including appointing at least one African American, one Asian American/Pacific Islander and one Latino American to its newly formed board of directors within two years of the close of the Transactions. Charter has met this commitment. 
Stockholders may nominate persons to be directors by following the procedures set forth in our Bylaws. These procedures require the stockholder to deliver timely notice to the Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices. That notice must contain the information required by the Bylaws about the stockholder proposing the nominee and about the nominee. No stockholder nominees have been proposed for this year's meeting. 
Stockholders also are free to suggest persons directly to the board of directors to consider as nominees. The board of directors will consider those individuals if adequate information is submitted in a timely manner (see "Stockholders Proposal for 2020 Annual Meeting" below for deadline requirements) in writing to the board of directors at the Company's principal executive offices, in care of the General Counsel.  In July 2018, Dr. John C. Malone retired from the board of directors, but continues to serve as a director emeritus. As a director emeritus, Dr. Malone continues to attend board of director meetings, but does not have a vote on matters presented. Dr. Malone previously served on the board of directors as a designee of Liberty Broadband under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement. 
Governance Impacts of TWC and Bright House Transactions 
On May 23, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Mergers (the "Merger Agreement") with the company formerly known as Charter Communications, Inc. ("Legacy Charter"), Time Warner Cable Inc. ("Legacy TWC"), and certain other subsidiary entities, pursuant to which the parties engaged in a series of transactions that resulted in Legacy Charter and Legacy TWC becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of Charter (the "TWC Transaction"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. After giving effect to the TWC Transaction, Charter became the new public company parent that holds the operations of the combined companies. 
On March 31, 2015, the Company entered into a definitive Contribution Agreement (the "Contribution Agreement"), which was amended on May 23, 2015 in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, with Advance/Newhouse Partnership ("A/N"), A/NPC Holdings LLC, Legacy Charter and Charter Communications Holdings, LLC ("Charter Holdings"), pursuant to which the Company became the owner of the membership interests in Bright House Networks, LLC ("Bright House") and any other assets (other than certain excluded assets and liabilities and non-operating cash) primarily related to Bright House (the "Bright House Transaction," and together with the TWC Transaction, the "Transactions"). 
In connection with Liberty Media Corporation's ("Liberty Media") investment in Charter, which was later transferred to Liberty Broadband Corporation ("Liberty Broadband"), the Company entered into a stockholders agreement dated as of March 19, 2013, between Charter and Liberty Media, which was amended by an Amendment to Stockholders Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2014, among Charter, Liberty Media and Liberty Broadband (the "Liberty Stockholders Agreement"). Messrs. Maffei, Meyer and Nair have been appointed to the board of directors pursuant to that agreement. In connection with the Transactions on May 23, 2015, Charter entered into the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement with Liberty Broadband Corporation, A/N and Legacy Charter (the "Stockholders Agreement") and the Charter Holdings Limited Liability Operating Agreement ("LLC Agreement") with Liberty Broadband and A/N. As of the closing of the Transactions on May 18, 2016, the Stockholders Agreement replaced the previous stockholders agreement with Liberty Broadband. Messrs. Miron and Newhouse were appointed to the board of directors pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement and the number of directors nominated by Liberty Broadband was reduced from four members to three members. 
Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement and Charter's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the number of Charter's directors is fixed at thirteen, and includes its chief executive officer. Under the Stockholders Agreement, Liberty Broadband currently has the right to designate up to three directors as nominees for Charter's board of directors and A/N currently has the right to designate up to two directors as nominees for Charter's board of directors. Upon the closing of the Transactions, two designees selected by A/N became members of the board of directors of Charter and three designees selected by Liberty Broadband continued as members of the board of directors of Charter. The remaining eight directors are not affiliated with either A/N or Liberty Broadband. Each of A/N and Liberty Broadband is entitled to nominate at least one director to each of the committees of Charter's board of directors, subject to applicable stock exchange listing rules and certain specified voting or equity ownership thresholds for each of A/N and Liberty Broadband, and provided that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation and Benefit Committee each have at least a majority of directors independent from A/N, Liberty Broadband and the Company (referred to as the "unaffiliated directors"). Each of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation and Benefits Committee is currently comprised of three unaffiliated directors and one designee of each of A/N and Liberty Broadband. Neither A/N nor Liberty Broadband has nominated a director to serve on the   Audit Committee that meets applicable stock exchange listing rules, but each has nominated a director to serve in an observer role on the Audit Committee. A/N and Liberty Broadband also have certain other committee designation and other governance rights. Upon the closing of the Transactions, Mr. Rutledge, the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), became the chairman of the board of Charter. 
Under the Stockholders Agreement, Liberty Broadband and A/N are required to vote (subject to the applicable voting cap) their respective shares of Charter Class A common stock and Charter Class B common stock for the director nominees nominated by the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors, including the respective designees of Liberty Broadband and A/N, and against any other nominees, except that, with respect to the unaffiliated directors, Liberty Broadband and A/N must instead vote in the same proportion as the voting securities are voted by stockholders other than A/N and Liberty Broadband or any group which includes any of them are voted, if doing so would cause a different outcome with respect to the unaffiliated directors. 
Board Leadership Structure, Company Strategy and Risk Oversight 
Mr. Rutledge is the Chairman of the board of directors and Mr. Zinterhofer is the Lead Independent Director. Although the Company previously separated the roles of CEO and Chairman of the board, in connection with the negotiation of the Transactions, the Company determined that it was in the best interest of the combined company to combine the roles. The Chairman and CEO is responsible for setting the strategic direction for the Company and the day to day leadership and performance of the Company, while the Lead Independent Director consults with the Chairman and CEO and presides over meetings of the board of directors when the Chairman and CEO is not present as well as providing leadership for the non- A/N and non- Liberty Broadband directors. 
Every year, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews and makes a recommendation on the appropriate governance framework for board leadership. The Committee takes into consideration governance best practices and the facts and circumstances of our board. In connection with this process, the Company determined that board leadership is best provided through the combination of a unified Chairman and CEO, a clearly defined and significant lead independent director role, active and strong committee chairs, and independent-minded, skilled, engaged, diverse and committed directors. The board believes that its current structure and governance allows it to provide effective challenge and oversight of management. 
The Board regularly discusses with management the Company's competitive positioning, strategic dynamics and business priorities. The Company is the second largest cable operator in the United States and a leading broadband communications services company providing video, Internet and voice services to approximately 28.1 million residential and small and medium business customers as of December 31, 2018. We also recently launched our Spectrum mobile service to residential customers. In addition, we sell video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and fiber-delivered communications solutions to large enterprise customers. We also own and operate regional sports networks and local sports, news and community channels. The Board advises management with respect to the Company's strategy with respect to each of these business areas. 
The Board also discusses with management the Company's strategies to effectively operate within each of our service areas. These discussions support our core strategy, which is to use our network to deliver high quality products at competitive prices, combined with outstanding service. This strategy, combined with simple, easy to understand pricing and packaging, is central to our goal of growing our customer base while selling more of our core connectivity services, which include both fixed and mobile Internet, video and voice services, to each individual customer. We execute this strategy by managing our operations in a consumer-friendly, efficient and cost-effective manner. Our operating strategy includes insourcing nearly all of our customer care and field operations workforces, which results in higher quality service delivery. The combination of offering high quality, competitively priced products and outstanding service, allows us to both increase the number of customers we   serve over our fully deployed network, and to increase the number of products we sell to each customer. That combination also reduces the number of service transactions we perform per relationship, yielding higher customer satisfaction and lower customer churn, resulting in lower costs to acquire and serve customers. 
In addition to discussions with management, our non-management directors meet regularly in executive sessions that are chaired by our Lead Independent Director with no member of management present. Non-management directors use these executive sessions to discuss matters of concern, as well as evaluations of the CEO and senior management, management and board successions, matters to be included on board agendas, and additional information the board would like management to provide to them. 
The chairs and all members of the board committees are independent directors. These chairs shape the agenda and information presented to their committees. Oversight of critical issues within these committees is owned by the independent directors. All directors have full access to all members of management and all employees on a confidential basis. 
The full board of directors oversees the various risks to the Company, delegating to the various committees specific responsibilities. The Audit Committee reviews our Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") Program on a regular basis, and the board of directors regularly reviews reports from management and the Audit Committee regarding the ERM Program. The Audit Committee meets regularly with members of management in executive session, as well as separately with each of the General Counsel, the Senior Vice President of Internal Audit Services and representatives of our independent registered public accounting firm. The Compensation and Benefits Committee oversees our succession planning and compensation policies and practices, including reviewing our incentive and equity-based compensation plans and benefits plans. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees corporate governance, including recommending board and committee nominations and the Corporate Governance Guidelines and determining director independence. 
Risk Assessment 
An independent consultant was engaged to perform a risk assessment of the Company's compensation programs and did not identify any material risks that might adversely impact the financial health or performance of the Company. After review of the work and conclusion of the independent consultant, the Compensation and Benefits Committee agreed with the conclusion reached by the independent consultant.

Executive Summary 
Fiscal 2018 Operational and Financial Highlights 
Charter achieved strong revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth in 2018 while engaged in the integration of Legacy TWC and Bright House and enhancing Charter's product offerings, including the rollout of faster Internet speeds and a Gigabit offering nationwide and the launch of Spectrum Mobile. Charter also continued to improve the quality, efficiency and value of our services while completing our all-digital initiative and the integration of Legacy TWC and Bright House, which was largely completed by the end of the year. For the 2018 fiscal year, total customer relationships grew by 942,000 or 3.5%, revenue increased by 4.9% to $43.6 billion, and Adjusted EBITDA rose 5.0% to $16.1 billion. Capital expenditures totaled $9.1 billion compared to $8.7 billion in 2017, completing a two year period of more intensive capital projects as Charter completed most of the capital intensive integration projects. Charter also purchased approximately 16.2 million shares of Charter Class A common stock and Charter Holdings common units for approximately $5.0 billion in 2018. In addition, in 2018 Charter conducted proactive shareholder engagement with our leading institutional stockholders to discuss topics of importance to both Charter and its stockholders.  The graph below tracks Charter's 5-year total shareholder return (TSR) against the S&P 500 and peer group companies ending with the closing stock price at December 31, 2018 for Charter's Class A common stock of $284.97 per share. 
Pay for Performance Alignment 
Charter's compensation programs are designed to create a strong linkage between the actual compensation earned by our NEOs and Company performance, rewarding both growth-oriented annual operating results as well as sustainable long-term shareholder returns. The following table summarizes the performance-focused nature of Charter's incentive designs in 2018 and the key outcomes demonstrating the alignment between compensation realized by our NEOs and results achieved by the Company. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   2018  Performance-Oriented Incentive Design Features   
   2018  Performance-Oriented Incentive Design Features   
   2018  Performance-Oriented Incentive Design Features   
 Annual Incentive Plan 
   Formulaic plan design with financial metrics that are key indicators of Charters success and measures of long-term value creation in a subscription business  metrics  reward top and bottom-line performance and the efficient use of capital: revenue (40% weighting), Adjusted EBITDA (50% weighting), and Capital Management (10% weighting). 
   Growth-based performance objectives  threshold, target and maximum performance levels all correspond to positive year-over-year growth in Revenue and Adjusted  EBITDA. 
   Maximum bonus payout level set at 150% of target incentives  provides upside potential to incentivize long-term, sustainable performance through Charters  growth-oriented strategy. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Long-Term Incentive Plan (Messrs. Rutledge, Bickham, Ellen and Winfrey*) 
   Five-year long-term incentive program  awards to participants were granted entirely in 2016. Additional equity awards are not currently intended to be granted to  participants in the program through fiscal year 2020, except in the case of promotion. 
   Award mix that emphasizes stock price appreciation  grants were delivered in a mix of 90% stock options and 10% RSUs. 
   Multi-year time-based vesting period  Eligibility for vesting ranges from 3 to 5 years after grant. 
   Performance-based vesting criteria tied to significant levels of stock price appreciation  in addition to time-based criteria, the vesting of all awards is further  contingent upon the attainment of stock price hurdles that represent price appreciation of approximately 30% to 155% from Charters stock price at the commencement of the program; vesting of each tranche does not occur until both the applicable  time-based and performance-based vesting criteria have been met; vesting may occur up to six years after grant and, if a given price hurdle is not met within that timeframe, the associated tranche of the award is forfeited. 
   No pay realizable by participants for non-performance  no value would be received by executives if stock price growth does not  exceed 30% within six years after grant. 
   Competitive award opportunities  individual grant sizes are calibrated such that, over the programs duration, a minimum of 70% stock price appreciation is required  for participants to realize value at the median of Charters peer group. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  Mr. Howard participates in Charter's standard long-term incentive program that provides grants annually in a mix of restricted  stock units and stock options, with all awards vesting in full upon the third anniversary of the date of grant. The Committee determined that this program continues to appropriately link Mr. Howard to Charter's long-term success.   
[END TABLE]
Compensation Actions in 2018 
The Committee's compensation decisions for the NEOs in 2018 were shaped by the compensation actions which occurred in 2016 at the time of the closing of the Transactions, in particular: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• New base salary, annual incentive and long-term incentive levels for our NEOs commensurate with the substantially expanded scope of their roles  following the Transactions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The establishment of a five-year long-term incentive program, as described in the discussion of Pay for Performance Alignment above, for all NEOs  except Mr. Howard.  
[END TABLE]
Within the context of these historical actions, the Committee determined the following in connection with its review of NEO compensation levels and incentive designs for the 2018 fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No changes to base salary, annual incentive or long-term incentive levels for Messrs. Rutledge, Bickham, Ellen and Winfrey. These NEOs have also not  received any equity awards since 2016 given their participation in the five-year long-term incentive program.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Howard's annual salary was increased as part of the Company's annual salary review process in February 2018, but no other changes  were made to his annual incentive or long-term incentive opportunities. As Mr. Howard participates in the Company's annual long-term incentive program, the Committee approved an equity award for him at the time of our annual grants in  January 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A formulaic annual incentive plan design was established for the full 2018 fiscal year, tied to the achievement of revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and  Capital Management objectives and comparable to what was in place for 2017.  
[END TABLE]
 Process for Determining Executive Compensation 
Role of the CEO and Compensation and Benefits Committee 
The Committee is responsible for overseeing our overall compensation structure, policies and programs and assessing whether our compensation structure results in appropriate compensation levels and incentives for executive management. 
Pay levels for our NEOs are determined by the Committee within the framework of the Company's compensation philosophy, as described below, and in consideration of a number of factors, including each individual's roles and responsibilities within Charter, the individual's experience and expertise, pay levels for comparable peer positions both within Charter and in the competitive marketplace, and performance of the individual and Charter as a whole. In determining these pay levels, the Compensation and Benefits Committee considers all forms of compensation and benefits. 
Each year, the CEO reviews the performance of each of the other NEOs and recommends both compensation adjustments based on overall competitiveness and effectiveness of the program as well as actual bonus payouts under the annual incentive plan in light of performance against the objectives approved by the Committee. The Committee regularly meets in executive session to consider these matters, and while the Committee considers the CEO's recommendations along with analysis provided by the Committee's compensation consultants, it retains full discretion to set all compensation for our NEOs other than the CEO. With respect to the CEO, the Committee recommends the CEO's compensation to Charter's full Board of Directors, with non-employee directors voting on the approval of any recommendations, subject to any employment agreements. 
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Committee has retained Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC ("Semler Brossy") to serve as its independent compensation consultant and assist in fulfilling its responsibilities. Semler Brossy is engaged by and reports directly to the Committee, providing recommendations and advice related to all aspects of Charter's executive compensation program. As necessary, Semler Brossy works with management to obtain information necessary to develop their recommendations. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, Semler Brossy provided no services to Charter other than those provided directly to or for the benefit of the Committee including: attending meetings; providing information, research and analysis pertaining to executive compensation programs; conducting a comprehensive assessment of our annual executive compensation program relative to our peer groups and broader industry data; updating the Committee on market trends and changing practices; and advising on the design of the executive compensation program and the reasonableness of individual compensation targets and awards. The Committee has determined that there was no conflict of interest between its compensation consultant and the Committee during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Compensation Philosophy and Competitive Positioning 
Since 2016, the Committee has applied the following pay philosophy for purposes of setting NEO compensation and designing annual and long-term incentive programs that motivate performance and retention of our NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  Base salary and target annual incentive opportunities positioned between the corresponding  50th and 75th percentile levels of the peer group  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  Annual incentive design that rewards the achievement of meaningful year-over-year growth in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA and the efficient  use of the Company's capital  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  Long-term equity compensation design that creates a strong linkage between pay and sustained stock price performance, tailored depending on  the level of the applicable NEO:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  a.  Executive Vice President (EVP) and above (Messrs. Rutledge, Bickham, Ellen and Winfrey):  
[END TABLE]
Structured to not deliver any value for performance below 30% stock price growth over a six-year period 
Potential value realizable by participants targeted at the median of the compensation peer group when stock price growth reaches approximately 70% over a six-year period 
Potential value realizable by participants targeted to reach or exceed the 75th percentile of the compensation peer group when stock price growth is at or above approximately 125% over a six-year period 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  b.  Senior Vice President (SVP) (Mr. Howard):  
[END TABLE]
Long-term incentive grant value targeted at or above the median of the peer group, delivered in a mix of RSUs and stock options, vesting 100% after a three-year period 
In adopting the equity compensation philosophy for our EVP and above NEOs, the Committee shifted from a traditional analysis of peer group grant date value (value of long-term incentive award on date of grant and as reported in the Summary Compensation Table) to a more dynamic approach that calibrates actual value received under particular stock price performance scenarios. With the completion of the Transactions, the Committee believed that a more robust model was required at this level based on the potential value that could be created by the Company over the next six years. The philosophy at the SVP level, which applies for Mr. Howard, continues to reflect the Company's traditional approach that sets long-term incentives based on the competitive grant values observed among peer companies. 
Compensation Peer Group 
The Committee examines Charter's peer group on an annual basis. The Committee approved the following criteria to identify peers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• North American publicly traded companies  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Size: Approximately $10 billion to $100 billion in annual revenue (0.33x to 2.5x the combined Company's revenue)   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Relevant Industries: Cable & Satellite, Integrated Telecommunication Services and Wireless Telecommunications, Movies &  Entertainment and Broadcast  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Committee did not identify any changes to the peer group since 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Peer Group 
[END TABLE]
 In addition to the peer group, the Committee also examines the executive compensation practices of other larger publicly traded, consumer-oriented companies, which compose the secondary peer group: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Secondary Peer  Group 
[END TABLE]
Elements of Compensation 
Base Salary 
We set base salaries with regard to the level of the individual's position with Charter and the individual's current and sustained performance results. The Committee annually reviews base salary levels for the NEOs and determines any necessary changes in those salary levels. Adjustments to base salary levels may be based on factors such as new roles and responsibilities assumed by the executive or the executive's impact on our then-current goals and business objectives. Salary adjustments may also be based on changes in market pay levels for comparable positions in the competitive market for executive talent. 
Charter does not apply specific weighting to any one factor in setting the level of salary, and the process ultimately relies on the Committee's judgment. Although we generally target salaries at market median compared to an industry peer group and other compensation survey data for experienced executives, the Committee may also take into account historical compensation, potential as a key contributor, and special recruiting or retention situations when deciding to set salaries for individual executives relative to market median pay levels. Consistent with our pay philosophy and taking into consideration the factors set forth above, salary increases are neither automatic nor the same for each individual. 
The Committee reviewed base salaries for our NEOs in 2018 and approved a 2.25% salary increase for Mr. Howard, effective February 16, 2018 as part of the Company's annual salary review process during which salary increase recommendations are reviewed and approved in consideration of employee performance and development over the year. Mr. Howard's increase therefore reflects the Committee's evaluation of his performance, contributions and development over the course of 2017. For our other NEOs, the Committee determined that no adjustments were necessary and that compensation packages established in 2016 continued to be appropriate. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Officer    2018 Base Salary      Change from Prior Year 
 Thomas M. Rutledge    $ 2,000,000      None 
 John Bickham    $ 1,500,000      None

Charter has established the Annual Incentive Plan for the NEOs to provide a cash-based incentive which rewards the achievement of strong annual operational and financial results. Each year, the actual amount of compensation earned by participants under the plan is dependent upon performance against pre-established  objectives which are set and approved by the Committee. The particular performance metrics under the plan are selected based on what the Committee believes to be the best annual financial and operational metrics that support long-term success and are most closely tied to the creation of shareholder value. When establishing the particular threshold, target and maximum performance objectives for each plan metric, the Committee seeks to set goals that represent challenging but attainable year-over-year improvement in Company performance. 
For fiscal year 2018, the Annual Incentive Plan for our NEOs was based on the achievement of both growth-based objectives with respect to Charter's consolidated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA (weighted 40% and 50%, respectively) as well as a discretionary evaluation of the Company's Capital Management over the year (weighted 10%). Payouts under the Annual Incentive Plan were set to range from 80% to 150% of each NEO's target annual incentive opportunity based on the actual performance achieved against the Committee-approved goals for each metric. 
The Committee also has the discretion to increase or decrease payouts under the Annual Incentive Plan based on organizational considerations, such as acquisitions or significant transactions and performance considerations, such as changes in products or markets and other unusual, unforeseen or exogenous situations. For 2018, the Committee approved one such adjustment – a $37 million reduction to the targeted revenue growth goal under the Annual Incentive Plan. This adjustment equaled the reduction in 2018 budgeted revenue due to Charter's non-consolidating participation in the New York Interconnect (NYI), a joint venture to sell advertising across a broad group of television and digital services in the New York market. As participating in the NYI provides a significant number of longer-term economic and margin-related benefits to the Company, the Committee determined that the reduction in 2018 revenue should not impact annual bonus calculations and therefore approved the adjustment to the targeted revenue growth goal. 
Charter's 2018 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA results represented strong year-over-year growth, falling between threshold and targeted performance levels, resulting in a payout of 90.73% of target for revenue growth and 94.69% of target for Adjusted EBITDA growth. The Committee also evaluated the Company's performance with respect to Capital Management – including considerations such as management's discipline in capital spending, successful completion of the most capital intensive integration projects and the successful completion of major capital projects such as the Charter's all-digital initiative under budget – and approved a payout of 120% of target for the corresponding component of annual incentives. The resulting overall annual incentive payout, as indicated in the table below, was 95.64% of the target annual incentive for all NEOs.

Note: Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net, other pension benefits, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger, acquisition and transition costs, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. Capital Management is an after-the-fact, objective evaluation of our capital spend by the Committee. 
In setting target annual incentive opportunities for our NEOs each year, the Committee reviews current opportunities relative to those among peer group companies and also evaluates criteria with respect to each NEO's particular role, including changes in scope and complexity, impact on Company strategy, and degree of enterprise-wide influence. The Committee determined that no annual incentive adjustments were necessary for our other NEOs as current opportunities continued to be competitive and appropriate for their roles. Target   annual incentive opportunities and actual incentive payouts, based on the performance achievement detailed above, are summarized below for each of our NEOs.

[END TABLE]
The CEO is also authorized by the Committee to make discretionary bonus awards of up to 5% of the total projected Annual Incentive Plan payout based on actual achievement against the approved performance objectives. Discretionary bonus awards are recommended by management based upon management's judgment of a participant's performance and contribution to the Company, and are in addition to payments made under the Annual Incentive Plan. For 2018, none of the NEOs received any portion of this 5% discretionary bonus allocation. 
Long-Term Incentives 
Charter's long-term incentive awards are designed to align the interests of the NEOs with those of our stockholders by linking a significant portion of NEO compensation to sustained growth in the Company's stock price over multi-year periods. Long-term incentive designs and opportunities are established by the Committee in consideration of each NEO's level within the organization, the nature of their particular role and job responsibilities, and their line-of-sight to our stock price performance. The Committee typically targets long-term incentive grant levels at the median to 75th percentile of competitive levels among peer group companies. Since 2016, the Committee has administered two long-term incentive program designs for our NEOs, based upon their corresponding level within Charter. 
For our NEOs at the EVP level and above, which includes Messrs. Rutledge, Bickham, Ellen and Winfrey, the Committee approved equity awards under a five-year long-term incentive program. Awards under this program were granted entirely in 2016 in a mix of 90% stock options and 10% restricted stock units, with potential time-based vesting over a minimum of 3 to 5 years after grant, contingent upon the achievement of pre-established stock price hurdles; if a stock price hurdle is not met within 6 years after grant, the associated award tranche is forfeited. The Committee currently intends for these awards to be the only equity compensation provided to these NEOs through fiscal year 2020, except in the case of promotion. As a result, none of these NEOs received any equity awards in 2018. 
As an employee at the SVP level, the Committee determined that Mr. Howard should participate in the Company's annual long-term incentive program. This program provides participants an annual long-term incentive award, the value of which is based on their level, delivered in a mix of stock options and restricted stock units that vest fully on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Mr. Howard's 2018 long-term incentive award, which represented the only equity award made to any of our NEOs in 2018, was granted in January 2018 based on the long-term incentive opportunity established for his role.

 Summary of 2016 Five-Year Long-Term Incentive Program 
Targeted grant values under the five-year long-term incentive program were determined by the Committee using an analysis of potential realizable compensation (i.e., actual value realized from awards upon vesting or exercise) from achieving certain levels of stock price appreciation over the duration of the program. The actual number of stock options and restricted stock units granted to participants were calculated based on (i) the target realizable compensation for the participant, (ii) stock price hurdles established for the program and (iii) a targeted mix of 90% stock options and 10% restricted stock units. The number of stock options and restricted stock units to be granted were then divided into a number of tranches, each with a combination of time-based and stock price performance vesting criteria. If the stock price vesting criteria are not achieved within six years after grant, the unvested awards will be forfeited, and the determination of whether a stock price hurdle is achieved is based on Charter's 60-day average closing stock price. The tranche-level vesting schedules for stock options and restricted stock units are provided in the schedules below.

2009 Stock Incentive Plan and 2019 Stock Incentive Plan 
Our long-term incentive awards are granted under the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2009 Plan"), which is an omnibus plan that provides for a range of compensation programs including the potential grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, performance units and performance shares, share awards, phantom stock, restricted stock units and restricted stock as each term is defined in the Stock Incentive Plan and in the discretion of the Committee. Unless terminated sooner, the Stock Incentive Plan will terminate on November 30, 2019, and no option or award can be granted thereafter under that plan. 
As of December 31, 2018, 4,108,291 shares remained available for future grants under the 2009 Plan. As of December 31, 2018, there were 3,292 participants in the 2009 Plan. 
The Committee considered and recommended to the Board of Directors the adoption of a new stock incentive plan. In January 2019, the Board approved the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2019 Plan" and together   with the 2009 Plan the "Stock Incentive Plans") subject to shareholder approval as proposed in this Proxy Statement. 
The Stock Incentive Plans authorize the repricing of options, which could include reducing the exercise price per share of any outstanding option, permitting the cancellation, forfeiture or tender of outstanding options in exchange for other awards or for new options with a lower exercise price per share, or repricing or replacing any outstanding options by any other method. While the Stock Incentive Plans authorize repricing, no repricing has occurred under the plan to date. 
Modifications to Certain Long-Term Awards 
In October 2017, the Committee approved the amendment of certain outstanding long-term incentive awards for the NEOs such that unvested RSUs and stock options would vest fully upon death or Disability (as defined under the 2009 Plan) and vested stock options following death, Disability or Retirement (as defined under the 2009 Plan) would remain exercisable until the earlier of eighteen months following such a termination or the expiration date of the stock option. These changes were made by the Committee in consideration of peer group practices as well as what was considered fair and appropriate for participants in our long-term incentive program upon such termination events. Prior to this amendment, all such awards vested on a pro rata basis upon death, Disability or Retirement and vested stock options expired upon the earlier of six months following such a termination or the original expiration date of the stock option. For Messrs. Rutledge, Bickham, Ellen and Winfrey, this amendment only applied to grants made on or before January 15, 2016 and did not apply to the performance-based RSU and stock option awards granted after this date in 2016. Under the performance-based RSU agreements, generally the RSUs are cancelled upon death or Disability and under the performance-based stock option agreements, the unvested portion of the options are cancelled and the vested portion is exercisable for one year following the death or Disability. In addition, for Mr. Bickham, if he terminates his employment without Good Reason before the expiration of his employment agreement or if his employment is terminated for any reason after the expiration of his employment agreement, the vested portion of his performance-based stock options will be exercisable for three years following the termination of employment. 
In October 2018, the Committee approved the amendment of Mr. Howard's long-term incentive award in 2018 to provide that vested options following Retirement would remain exercisable until the earlier of thirty-six months following Retirement or the expiration date of the stock option. The Committee made the change in consideration of peer group practices. 
Other Elements of Compensation 
The NEOs are eligible to participate in all other benefit programs offered to all employees generally. 
Employment Agreements 
The Company did not enter into new employment agreements with, or modify existing employment agreements for, any of our NEOs in the 2018 fiscal year. Messrs. Rutledge, Bickham, Ellen and Winfrey currently have employment agreements with the Company, while Mr. Howard does not have an employment agreement. A more detailed description of employment arrangements with our NEOs is set forth below under the section titled "Employment Agreements." 
Tax and Accounting 
Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code placed a $1 million limit on the amount of non-performance-based compensation the Company can deduct in any year for certain NEOs. The Committee had designed the compensation programs with the intention to qualify a majority of compensation as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m). Effective January 1, 2018,   performance-based compensation potentially no longer qualifies for exemption from the Section 162(m) limitation. Certain awards under the existing plans may be deductible, but future awards would be analyzed under the new laws and may not create a tax deduction. Once an individual has become an NEO, these individuals will remain subject to the limitation under Section 162(m) for all current and future compensation. These tax effects are only one factor considered by the Committee when entering into compensation arrangements, and the Committee maintains flexibility in compensating executive officers in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals, which may not be deductible under section 162(m). 
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). For stock options and restricted stock with market conditions, the cost is equal to the fair value of the option or restricted stock on the date of grant, estimated using Monte Carlo simulations. 
Additional Compensation Governance Policies 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The stock ownership guidelines are based on achievement of a certain specified multiple of the applicable officer's base salary or outside director's cash retainer. The guidelines do not apply to officers, directors or affiliates of any stockholder of the Company beneficially holding 10% or greater of the outstanding shares of the Company's stock. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Officer    Ownership Multiple of Salary (for employees) or Cash Retainer (for  directors) 
 CEO    5x 
 President and COO    3x 
 Executive Vice President    2x 
 Other Covered Individuals    1x 
 Outside Director    3x 
[END TABLE]
In determining whether a covered individual has met the applicable stock ownership level, management evaluates annually stock beneficially owned outright and 25% of the value of time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units that are only subject to time-based vesting (the performance-based restricted stock unit awards do not count toward the ownership guidelines). There is no time requirement to meet the guidelines. However, until the minimum level is reached, a covered individual is required to retain a minimum of 25% of the shares received when options to purchase stock are exercised or restricted stock vests (unless an exemption is granted). As of December 31, 2018 all covered directors and the NEOs met the applicable stock ownership guidelines (except for individuals appointed or hired after the closing of the Transactions who have had limited or no vesting events). 
Compensation Recovery Policy 
The Compensation Recovery Policy provides that all executive officers, including the NEOs, may, under certain circumstances, be required to repay or forfeit annual incentive or other performance-based compensation, including payments under our Executive Bonus Plan, received in the event of a restatement of Charter's financial statements filed with the SEC. Under this policy, there is a three-year look back period for compensation recovery and it applies regardless of whether or not the individual was at fault in the circumstances leading to the restatement. However, the Committee has been granted greater authority to recover any outstanding equity based awards, vested and unvested, if it determines that a covered executive was engaged in any fraud or intentional misconduct with regard to the circumstances leading to the restatement.  Hedging 
The Company prohibits any Named Executive Officer, as well as other senior members of management, from hedging transactions or similar arrangements with respect to Company securities. 
Stockholder Vote on Say on Pay 
At the Company's 2017 annual stockholders' meeting, the stockholders considered an advisory proposal on the frequency of holding a vote on executive compensation and, as the Board of Directors recommended, voted to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation every three (3) years with approximately 57% of the votes cast in favor of the frequency proposal. At this same meeting, the stockholders also considered an advisory vote on executive compensation for the NEOs and, as the Board of Directors recommended, the stockholders approved the 2017 executive compensation with approximately 70% of the votes cast voting in favor of the proposal. 
Charter's executive compensation program is designed to ensure management's interests are aligned with our investors' interests to support long-term value creation, while also maintaining the consistency over time that is imperative for motivating and retaining employees. After considering the stockholders' advisory votes, including the level of support received for each proposal, the Committee continues to believe that the Company's executive compensation structure – including the five-year long-term incentive program established in 2016 – best achieves the desired alignment. In addition, the Committee views a three-year period between advisory votes on executive compensation as the most effective approach, providing investors sufficient time to evaluate the effectiveness of both short and long-term compensation strategies and corresponding business outcomes of the Company. Although the Committee will continue to monitor the frequency of the vote, the Committee considers a triennial vote on executive pay to be the appropriate frequency to provide time to thoughtfully consider and implement appropriate changes to our executive compensation program. 
Proactive Stockholder Engagement 
Charter values and carefully considers the feedback we receive from our stockholders. In 2018, we engaged in constructive dialogue with our leading institutional stockholders as well as certain proxy advisory firms. We reached out to and offered to have discussions with stockholders holding approximately 64% of the shares of our outstanding stock. We engaged with each stockholder who accepted our offer, making our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, our Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and our Senior Vice President, Deputy General Counsel and Assistant Corporate Secretary available. Stockholder feedback, including through direct discussions and prior shareholder votes, as well as engagement with proxy advisory firms that represent the interests of a wide array of stockholders is reported to our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee periodically throughout the year. We also review our practices against guidelines published by stockholders and proxy advisory firms, among others. 
The engagements covered a variety of topics, including how executive compensation and incentives fit with Charter's long-term strategy, board structure and diversity, and considerations for enhanced disclosures of certain items. A topic frequently discussed was the Company's 5-year long-term equity incentive program for executives, including the criteria the Committee took into account in determining the time and performance-based vesting elements and how those criteria were tied to significant levels of stock price appreciation. Stockholders generally supported the long-term growth approach that Charter has taken to equity compensation. We take seriously the views of our stockholders and took into consideration all the various input we received, and intend to continue our stockholder engagement efforts in 2019.

  (a)  As set forth in more detail below under the section titled "Employment Agreements", Messrs. Rutledge, Bickham, Ellen and Winfrey  are allowed to use the Company's aircraft for a certain amount of hours of discretionary personal use every year in accordance with their respective employment agreements. Mr. Rutledge also has the authority to allow other executives to  use the Company's aircraft for personal use. Amounts reported above for Messrs. Rutledge, Bickham, Ellen and Winfrey are calculated as the aggregate incremental cost to the Company using a method that takes into account variable costs such as  aircraft fuel and oil expenses per hour of flight; crew travel expenses; landing and parking fees; and trip-related inspections, repairs and maintenance. The aggregate incremental costs reported above also take into account costs associated with  private aircraft for hire services. Because the Company's aircraft is used primarily for business travel, this methodology excludes fixed costs that do not change based on usage, such as salaries of pilots and crew or purchase or lease costs of  aircraft. For purposes of determining an executive's taxable income, personal use of our aircraft is valued using a method based on Standard Industry Fare Level ("SIFL") rates, as published by the Internal Revenue Service. The amount  determined using the SIFL rates is typically lower than the amount determined using the incremental cost method.

Retirement Benefits 
We sponsor a 401(k) plan, which is a qualified retirement plan offered to all eligible employees, including our NEOs, that permits eligible employees to elect to defer a portion of their compensation on a pre-tax basis. 
Legacy TWC Pension Benefits 
In connection with Mr. Rutledge's and Mr. Bickham's employment by a predecessor and/or affiliate of Legacy TWC, Mr. Rutledge and Mr. Bickham participated in the Time Warner Cable Pension Plan, a tax qualified defined benefit pension plan (the "Cable Plan"), and the Time Warner Cable Excess Benefit Pension Plan (the "Excess Benefit Plan"), a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan (collectively, the "Pension Plans") offered by those employers and accrued a benefit as a result. No other NEO is entitled to benefits under the Pension Plans. As of the closing of the Transactions, Charter is the sponsor of the Pension Plans. As of December 31, 2018, the present value of Mr. Rutledge's and Mr. Bickham's accrued benefit under the Pension Plans was $1,243,163, and $1,164,097, respectively, reflecting the assumptions that (i) the benefits will be payable at the earliest retirement age at which unreduced benefits are assumed to be payable (which is age 65) under the plans, valued as if paid as a life annuity, (b) 28.58 and 8.75 years, respectively, of benefit service to Legacy TWC during their tenure there, and (c) are consistent with the assumptions used in the calculation of the Company's benefit obligations as disclosed in Note 20 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. As shown above in the Summary Compensation Table, the actuarial present value of Mr. Bickham's accrued benefit under the Pension Plans increased by $1,859 during 2018 as a result of a required discontinuation of the payout status of their pension benefits prior to the Transactions and the required actuarial calculations pursuant to the Pension Plans.  Federal tax law limits both the amount of compensation that is eligible for the calculation of benefits and the amount of benefits that may be paid to participants under a tax-qualified plan, such as the Cable Plan. However, as permitted under Federal tax law, Legacy TWC designed the Excess Benefit Plan to provide for supplemental payments by Legacy TWC of an amount that eligible employees would have received under the Cable Plan if eligible compensation were subject to a higher limit and there were no payment restrictions. The amount of the payment under the Excess Benefit Plan is calculated based on the differences between (a) the annual benefit that would have been payable under the Cable Plan if the annual eligible compensation limit imposed by the tax laws was $350,000 (the maximum compensation limit imposed under the Excess Benefit Plan) and (b) the actual benefit payable under the Cable Plan. 
Benefit payments under the Pension Plans are calculated using the highest consecutive five-year average annual compensation (subject to federal law limits and the $350,000 limit referred to above), which is referred to as "average compensation." Compensation covered by the Pension Plans takes into account salary, bonus, some elective deferrals and other compensation paid, but excludes the payment of deferred or long-term incentive compensation and severance payments. The annual pension payment under the terms of the TWC Pension Plans, if the employee is vested, and if paid as a single life annuity, commencing at age 65, is an amount equal to the sum of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 1.25% of the portion of average compensation that does not exceed the average of the Social Security taxable wage base ending in the year the  employee reaches the Social Security retirement age, referred to as "covered compensation," multiplied by the number of years of benefit service up to 35 years, plus  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 1.67% of the portion of average compensation that exceeds covered compensation, multiplied by the number of years of benefit service up to  35 years, plus  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 0.5% of average compensation multiplied by the employee's number of years of benefit service in excess of 35 years, plus   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a supplemental benefit in the amount of $60 multiplied by the employee's number of years of benefit service up to 30 years, with a maximum  supplemental benefit of $1,800 per year.  
[END TABLE]
Reduced benefits are available in the case of retirement before age 65 and in other optional forms of benefits payouts, as described below. 
The benefits under the Pension Plan are payable as (i) a single life annuity, (ii) a 50%, 75% or 100% joint and survivor annuity, (iii) a life annuity that is guaranteed for 10 years, or (iv) as of January 1, 2015, a lump sum. Spousal consent is required in certain cases. The participant may elect the form of benefit payment at the time of retirement or termination of employment (in which case, benefits are payable as (i) a single life annuity, (ii) a 50% or 75% joint and survivor annuity or (iii) a lump sum). In the case of a single life annuity, the amount of the annuity is based on the applicable formulas described above. In the case of a joint and survivor annuity, the amount of the annuity is based on the single life annuity amount but is reduced to take into account the ages of the participant and beneficiary at the time the annuity payments begin and the percentage elected by the participant. In the case of a life annuity that is guaranteed for a period of time, the amount of the annuity is based on the single life annuity amount but is reduced to take into account the guaranteed period. Benefits under the Excess Benefit Plan are payable only as a lump sum, unless the participant elected to receive monthly installments over 10 years by the applicable deadline.

The mortality assumption is based on the RP-2015 Sex-Distinct Annuitant Mortality projected forward using generational Scale MP-2015. Lump sums are based on the 2019 417(e) mortality table and the September 2018 417(e)  interest rates. The calculations are based on the assumptions used in the calculation of the Company's benefit obligations as disclosed in Note 20 to the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the Company's  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 except that retirement is assumed to be at the earliest unreduced age and no pre-retirement  mortality.

Termination by Charter for Cause or a Voluntary Termination by the Executive without Good Reason 
Under the current employment agreements and Company policies applicable to our NEOs, we do not provide any severance in the event of a termination by the Company for cause or a voluntary termination by a NEO without good reason and all bonus awards and unvested equity will be forfeited and cancelled effective as of the date of termination. Under the long-term incentive award agreements with our NEOs, vested stock options generally may be exercised for a period of time not to exceed six months from the effective date of a for cause/voluntary termination or the option expiration date, if sooner. The performance-vesting options granted to Mr. Bickham in 2016 provide that he may exercise the options for up to three years following a voluntary termination without good reason. "For cause" is generally defined under our NEOs' employment agreements and applicable Company policies to include: willful breaches of material obligations, fiduciary duties, the Company's code of conduct or other material Company policies; acts of fraud or willful and material misrepresentations or concealments from the Company or board of directors; misappropriation of a material amount of Company property; criminal convictions, guilty or no contest pleas to felonies, or any crime expected to have a material negative impact or crimes related to fraud, embezzlement, dishonesty, breach of trust or moral turpitude; admission or finding of liability for knowing or deliberate breach of any securities laws; illegal possession of a controlled substance; excessive alcohol use in connection with duties or otherwise on the Company's premises or during a Company function; gross neglect of duty or willful misconduct related to duties; or willful or gross negligent commission of an act or failure to act which causes or is reasonably expected to cause substantial economic injury to the business reputation of the Company. Under our employment agreements with Messrs. Rutledge and Bickham, "for cause" includes the foregoing factors amended to read that breaches of material obligations and fiduciary duties, material misrepresentations and concealments and failure to adhere to Company policies must be willful and reasonably expected to cause substantial injury to the business or reputation of the Company. For a definition of "good reason", see the section below, titled "Termination by the Company without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason (other than for a Change in Control)".  Termination due to Death or Disability 
Under the employment agreements, equity award agreements and Company policies, as applicable, for each of our NEOs, we may be required to make certain payments to, or allow full equity vesting for, these executives or their estates or beneficiaries in the event that the executive is terminated as a result of death or "disability." 
An executive is deemed to have a "disability" if, due to illness or injury: the executive is unable to perform his or her duties without accommodation for a certain period of time; or the executive is considered disabled for the purposes of receiving long term disability benefits under a participating plan or policy. In the event there is a period of time during which a NEO is not being paid annual base salary and not receiving long-term disability insurance payments, the executive will receive interim payments equal to such unpaid disability insurance payments until commencement of disability insurance payments.

Termination by Charter Without Cause or by the Executive for Good Reason (other than for a Change in Control) 
In the event that Charter terminates a NEO's employment without cause or the executive terminates his or her employment with Charter for good reason other than in connection with a change in control, Charter may be required to make certain payments to the executive and the executive may be entitled to pro rata vesting of unvested equity awards granted to the executive. 
For a definition of a "for cause," see the prior section titled "Termination by Charter for Cause or a Voluntary Termination by the Executive without Good Reason." 
A NEO may generally only terminate his or her employment for "good reason" following thirty (30) days written notice to the Company of his or her intent to terminate, or, in certain circumstances, advance notice to the Company detailing the "good reason" and giving the Company an opportunity to cure prior to termination. As the term is used in the employment agreements of our NEOs, "good reason" includes: a reduction in base salary or bonus; a material reduction in authority, duties, or responsibilities of the executive or of the executive's reporting structure; a material failure by the Company to comply with provisions of the executive's employment agreement including paying compensation when due and the location of the executive's primary workplace; or any failure by a successor company to assume the executive's employment agreement following a change in control. For Mr. Howard, our equity grant agreements define "good reason" to include a reduction in base salary, a failure to pay compensation when due, and certain relocations of the executive's primary workplace.  For a definition of "change in control", see the section immediately following titled "Termination within 30 days before or 13 months after Change in Control for without Cause or Good Reason."

A "change in control" is defined to include: any person or entity acquires beneficial ownership of 35% (50% under Mr. Howard's long-term incentive grant agreements) or more of our outstanding common stock or combined voting power over our outstanding voting securities; the incumbent directors (as defined in the   employment agreements) cease to constitute a majority of the board of directors; the completion of certain corporate transactions including a reorganization or merger subject to certain exceptions; the complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company; and the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.

(1)  Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These rules generally provide that a person is  the beneficial owner of securities if such person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting thereof, or to dispose or direct the disposition thereof or has the right to acquire such powers within 60 days. Shares shown in the table above  include shares held in the beneficial owner's name or jointly with others, or in the name of a bank, nominee or trustee for the beneficial owner's account. Common stock subject to options that are currently exercisable or exercisable  within 60 days of February 22, 2019 are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding the options. These shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purposes of computing the percentage ownership of any other  person. Percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 224,971,942 shares of Class A common stock outstanding as of February 22, 2019, including Charter Communications Holdings, LLC ("Charter Holdings") common and preferred units  on an as-if-converted basis. Each holder of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Except as disclosed in the footnotes to this table, we believe  that each stockholder identified in the table possesses sole voting and investment power over all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by the stockholder. Unless otherwise indicated in the table or footnotes below, the address for each  beneficial owner is 400 Atlantic Street, Stamford, CT 06901. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote.

(2)  Based on the Schedule 13D/A filed by Liberty Broadband on December 29, 2017 (the most recent filing). For information on Liberty  Broadband's designees to Charter's board of directors and the Stockholders Agreement, see "Governance Impacts of TWC and Bright House Transactions" above and "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" below. Of  the shares reported in the Schedule 13D/A, Liberty Broadband reported that it had sole voting and dispositive power over 54,072,264 shares, that it shared voting and dispositive power with Liberty Interactive Corporation, now known as Qurate Retail,  Inc., with respect to 5,358,401 shares. The shared voting and dispositive power with Advance/Newhouse Partnership ("A/N") has been adjusted to 4,164,780 shares on an as-converted and as-exchanged basis pursuant to the terms of the proxy  granted by A/N to Liberty Broadband. John C. Malone, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Liberty Broadband and a director emeritus of Charter, may be deemed to have voting and dispositive control, pursuant to Rule 13d-3(a), over the shares of  Charter owned by Liberty Broadband as a result of the positions he holds with Liberty Broadband as well as his control of approximately 49% of the voting power of Liberty Broadband, among other factors. Mr. Malone, however, disclaims beneficial  ownership of any Charter shares owned by Liberty Broadband on the basis that he is not, individually, a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to the voting or disposition of any such shares. Decisions with respect to the  voting or disposition of any Charter shares owned by Liberty Broadband are made by Liberty Broadband's board of directors.

 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
We maintain written policies and procedures covering related party transactions. The Audit Committee reviews the material facts of related party transactions. Management has various procedures in place, e.g., our Code of Conduct, which requires annual certifications from employees that are designed to identify potential related party transactions. Management brings those to the Audit Committee for review as appropriate. Our Related Party Transaction Policy provides that a "Related Party Transaction" is any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) in which: (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year; (2) the Company is a participant; and (3) any Related Party has or will have a direct or indirect interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10 percent beneficial owner of another entity). A "Related Party" is any person: (a) who is or was (since the beginning of the last fiscal year for which the Company has filed a Form 10-K and proxy statement, even if they do not presently serve in that role) an executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director; (b) who is a greater than 5 percent beneficial owner of the Company's common stock; or (c) who is an immediate family member of any of the foregoing. Immediate family member includes a person's spouse, parents, stepparents, children, stepchildren, siblings, mothers- and fathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, and brothers- and sisters-in-law and anyone residing in such person's home (other than a tenant or employee). Open market purchases or privately-negotiated transactions, excluding any distributions by the Company, involving any securities of the Company or its subsidiaries, are not deemed to be a "Related Party Transaction" under our Related Party Transaction Policy. 
The following sets forth certain transactions in which we are involved and in which the directors, executive officers and affiliates of Charter have or may have a material interest. The indentures of our subsidiaries, CCO Holdings, LLC and CCO Holdings Capital Corp., require delivery of fairness opinions for transactions with affiliates involving more than $100 million. Such fairness opinions have been obtained whenever required. Charter has determined that all of our transactions entered into with affiliates are in Charter's best interest. Related Party Transactions are approved by the Audit Committee or another independent body of Charter's board of directors. 
On May 23, 2015, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement and the amendment of the Contribution Agreement, Charter entered into the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement with Liberty Broadband, A/N and Legacy Charter (the "Stockholders Agreement"). As of the closing of the Transactions on May 18, 2016, the Stockholders Agreement replaced Legacy Charter's existing stockholders agreement with Liberty Broadband, dated September 29, 2014, and superseded the amended and restated stockholders agreement among Legacy Charter, Charter, Liberty Broadband and A/N, dated March 31, 2015. 
Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, the number of Charter's directors is fixed at 13, and includes its chief executive officer. Upon the closing of the Transactions, two designees selected by A/N became members of the board of directors of Charter and three designees selected by Liberty Broadband continued as members of the board of directors of Charter. The remaining eight directors are not affiliated with either A/N or Liberty Broadband. Each of A/N and Liberty Broadband is entitled to nominate at least one director to each of the committees of Charter's board of directors, subject to applicable stock exchange listing rules and certain specified voting or equity ownership thresholds for each of A/N and Liberty Broadband, and provided that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation and Benefits Committee each have at least a majority of directors independent from A/N, Liberty Broadband and Charter (referred to as the "unaffiliated directors"). Each of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation and Benefits Committee is currently comprised of three unaffiliated directors and one designee of each of A/N and Liberty Broadband. A/N and Liberty Broadband also have certain other committee designation and other governance rights. Upon the closing of the Transactions, Mr. Rutledge became the chairman of the board of Charter. 
In connection with the closing of the Transactions, a number of agreements were entered into with Liberty Broadband and/or A/N, including the Charter Communications Holdings, LLC operating agreement, an exchange   agreement, a registration rights agreement, a tax receivables agreement, an amendment agreement (that amended the Stockholders Agreement and the Liberty Broadband investment agreement) and a transition services agreement. These agreements were approved by the board of directors. Under the LLC agreement, during 2018 Charter paid $150 million to A/N as dividends on the 25 million convertible preferred units held by it that are entitled to a 6% annual dividend. Charter also paid approximately $1.6 million to A/N as tax distributions under the LLC agreement. 
In December 2017, Charter and A/N entered into an amendment to the letter agreement dated December 23, 2016 (the "Letter Agreement") that requires A/N to sell to Charter or to Charter Holdings, on a monthly basis, a number of shares of Charter Class A common stock or Charter Holdings common units that represents a pro rata participation by A/N and its affiliates in any repurchases of shares of Charter Class A common stock from persons other than A/N effected by Charter during the immediately preceding calendar month, at a purchase price equal to the average price paid by Charter for the shares repurchased from persons other than A/N during such immediately preceding calendar month. A/N and Charter both have the right to terminate or suspend the pro rata repurchase arrangement on a prospective basis once Charter or Charter Holdings have repurchased shares of Class A common stock or Charter Holdings common units from A/N and its affiliates for an aggregate purchase price of $400 million, which threshold has been reached. Pursuant to the TRA between Charter and A/N, Charter must pay to A/N 50% of the tax benefit when realized by Charter from the step-up in tax basis resulting from any future exchange or sale of the preferred and common units. 
The Company is aware that Dr. John Malone, a director emeritus of Charter and Chairman of the board of directors and holder of 47.1% of voting interest in Liberty Broadband, may be deemed to have a 37.5% voting interest in Qurate Retail, Inc. ("Qurate," formerly known as Liberty Interactive Corporation) and is on the board of directors of Qurate. Qurate wholly owns HSN, Inc. ("HSN") and QVC, Inc. ("QVC"). The Company has programming relationships with HSN and QVC. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded revenue in aggregate of approximately $73 million from HSN and QVC as part of channel carriage fees and revenue sharing arrangements for home shopping sales made to customers in the Company's footprint. 
Dr. Malone and Mr. Steven Miron, each a member of Charter's board of directors, also serve on the board of directors of Discovery, Inc., ("Discovery"). The Company is aware that Dr. Malone owns 93.6% of the series B common stock of Discovery, 6% of the series C common stock of Discovery and has a 28% voting interest in Discovery for the election of directors. The Company is aware that Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership ("A/N PP"), an affiliate of A/N and in which Mr. Miron is the CEO, owns 100% of the Series A-1 preferred stock of Discovery and 100% of the Series C-1 preferred stock of Discovery and has a 24.2% voting interest for the election of directors. A/N PP has the right to appoint three directors out of a total of eleven directors to Discovery's board to be elected by the holders of Discovery's Series A-1 preferred stock. The Company purchases programming from Discovery pursuant to agreements entered into prior to Dr. Malone and Mr. Miron joining Charter's board of directors and a settlement agreement approved by the Audit Committee entered into in 2018. Based on publicly available information, the Company does not believe that Discovery would currently be considered a related party. The amounts paid in the aggregate to Discovery represent less than 3% of total operating costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Liberty Broadband and A/N each have a number of subsidiary or affiliated companies with which Charter has existing customer or vendor relationships, some of which involved amounts in excess of $120,000 for 2017 or may involve amounts in excess of $120,000 for 2018. The following summarizes each of these relationships with Liberty Broadband and A/N subsidiaries and affiliates: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Advance Digital Inc., an A/N company, provides search engine marketing services to Charter under a contract that was entered into prior to the  closing of the transactions. Charter paid approximately $7.1 million for these services in 2018.

• Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (Mr. Maffei is the Chairman of the Board; and Mr. Malone has a 47.6% voting interest in Liberty Media,  which owns 34% of the Live Nation equity) is a customer of Spectrum Enterprise and Spectrum Media and purchased approximately $2.1 million of services during 2018.

 Proposal No. 2: Approval of the Charter Communications, Inc. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan 
(Item 2 on Proxy Card) 
We are asking you to approve the Charter Communications, Inc. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2019 Plan"), which the Board adopted on January 29, 2019 upon the recommendation of the Compensation and Benefits Committee. The 2019 Plan will only become effective if approved by stockholders at the Annual Meeting. If approved, the effective date of the 2019 Plan will be April 23, 2019. 
The purposes of the 2019 Plan are to enable the Company to attract and retain the types of employees, consultants and directors who will contribute to the Company's long range success; provide incentives that align the interests of employees, consultants and directors with those of the stockholders of the Company; and promote the success of the Company's business. 
Reasons For Seeking Stockholder Approval 
The Board believes that equity-based compensation is a critical part of the Company's compensation program. Stockholder approval of the 2019 Plan would allow us to continue to attract and retain talented employees, consultants and directors with equity incentives. For more information on how the 2019 Plan fits within the Company's existing compensation program and the Company's past and current grant practices, see the executive compensation section of this Proxy Statement. 
In addition, the Company's 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2009 Plan") will expire in 2019. As a result, if the 2019 Plan is not approved, following the expiration of the 2009 Plan, we may be unable to maintain our current equity grant practices, and, therefore, may be at a significant competitive disadvantage in attracting, retaining and motivating talented individuals who contribute to our success. We may also be compelled to replace equity incentive awards with cash awards, which may not align the interests of our executives and employees with those of our stockholders as effectively as equity incentive awards. 
Material Terms of the 2019 Plan 
The following summary of the material terms of the 2019 Plan is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the 2019 Plan, a copy of which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex A. You also may obtain a copy of the 2019 Plan, free of charge, by writing to the Company, 400 Atlantic Street, Stamford, CT 06901, Attention: Investor Relations. 
Effective Date; Duration of the 2019 Plan 
The 2019 Plan will become effective upon approval by the Company's stockholders and no awards are expected to be granted under the 2019 Plan prior to such approval. Except with respect to awards then outstanding, unless sooner terminated, the 2019 Plan will expire on January 29, 2029, the tenth anniversary of the date it was adopted by the Board and no further awards may be granted after such date. 
2019 Plan Administration 
The 2019 Plan will be administered by the Compensation and Benefits Committee or, in the Board's discretion, by the Board. The Compensation and Benefits Committee will have the authority to, among other things, interpret the 2019 Plan, determine who will be granted awards under the 2019 Plan, prescribe the terms and conditions of each award, interpret, administer, reconcile any inconsistency in, correct any defect in and supply any omission in the 2019 Plan, and exercise discretion to make any and all other determinations which it determines to be necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2019 Plan.  Eligibility 
The Board in its discretion selects participants from among the employees, consultants and directors of the Company and its affiliates and other individuals designated by the Compensation and Benefits Committee who are reasonably expected to become employees, consultants and directors and who, in such capacities, are reasonably expected by the Board to contribute to the Company's success. Only employees are eligible to receive incentive stock options. Approximately 98,000 employees, twelve non-employee directors, and 46,000 consultants would be eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan if it were currently in place. Historically, however, the Company has limited awards to a select number of individuals. For example, as of December 31, 2018, only 3,292 eligible persons held awards issued under the 2009 Plan. We do not currently anticipate granting any awards under the 2019 Plan to independent contractors of our Company. 
Shares Available for Awards; Limits on Awards 
The Company has reserved an aggregate of 16,000,000 shares of Class A common stock to be awarded under the 2019 Plan, (the "Total Share Reserve"). The Total Share Reserve was determined after reviewing the comprehensive assessment of our annual executive compensation program relative to our peer groups and broader industry data prepared by Semler Brossy, which included advice regarding the design of the executive compensation program and the reasonableness of individual compensation targets and awards. The Total Share Reserve is intended to be sufficient to cover awards granted over a five-year period. Up to 16,000,000 of the Total Share Reserve may be issued under the 2019 Plan, in the aggregate, through the exercise of incentive stock options. No non-employee director may be granted awards under the 2019 Plan, during any fiscal year, that have a total value that exceeds $3,000,000 (calculating the value of any awards based on the grant date fair value for financial reporting purposes). 
If any outstanding award expires or is canceled, forfeited, or terminated without issuance of the full number of shares of common stock to which the award related, then the number of shares available under the 2019 Plan will be increased by the portion of the award that expired, or was canceled, forfeited or terminated. Shares tendered in payment of the option exercise price or delivered or withheld by the Company to satisfy any tax withholding obligation, or shares covered by a stock-settled stock appreciation right or other awards that were not issued upon the settlement of the award will also again become available for future grants under the 2019 Plan. Awards may be granted under the 2019 Plan in assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by an entity acquired by the Company or with which the Company combines. The Compensation and Benefits Committee may make appropriate adjustments to these limits to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of participants under the 2019 Plan (see Adjustments Upon Changes in Stock). 
Available Awards 
Awards that may be granted under the 2019 Plan include stock options (including both incentive stock options (ISOs) and nonqualified stock options), stock appreciation rights (SARs), dividend equivalent rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance awards and other stock-based awards. The terms of each award will be set forth in a written agreement. 
Stock Options 
A stock option is the right to purchase shares of Class A common stock at a future date at a specified price per share called the exercise price. An option may be either an ISO or a nonqualified stock option. ISOs and nonqualified stock options are taxed differently, as described under Federal Income Tax Treatment of Awards Under the 2019 Plan. Except in the case of options granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option, the exercise price of a stock option may not be less than the fair market value (or in the case of an ISO granted to a ten percent stockholder, 110% of the fair market value) of a share of common stock on the grant date. Full payment of the exercise price must be made at the time of such exercise in cash, shares of Class A common stock, withholding of shares of Class A common stock deliverable upon exercise or in another manner   approved by the Compensation and Benefits Committee. No stock option may be exercisable for a period of more than ten (10) years following the grant date of the stock option (or in the case of an ISO granted to a ten percent stockholder, for a period of more than five (5) years following the grant date). To date, no options have been granted under the Plan. 
Stock Appreciation Rights 
A SAR is the right to receive payment of an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise of the SAR over the exercise price. The exercise price of a SAR may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the grant date. SARs may be granted alone ("freestanding rights") or in tandem with options ("related rights"). 
Dividend Equivalent Rights 
Dividend Equivalent Rights represent the right to receive all or some portion of the dividends that are or would be payable with respect to shares of Class A common stock, payable in either cash or shares of Class A common stock. 
Restricted Stock 
A restricted stock award is an award of actual shares of common stock which are subject to certain restrictions for a period of time determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Restricted stock may be held by the Company in escrow or delivered to the participant pending the release of the restrictions. The participant generally has the rights and privileges of a stockholder as to such restricted stock during the restricted period, including the right to vote the restricted stock and the right to receive dividends 
Restricted Stock Units 
An RSU is an award of hypothetical common stock units having a value equal to the fair market value of an identical number of shares of common stock, which are subject to certain restrictions for a period of time determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee. No shares of common stock are issued at the time an RSU is granted, and the Company is not required to set aside any funds for the payment of any RSU award. Prior to settlement of an RSU award and the receipt of shares, the participant does not have any rights as a stockholder with respect to such shares. The Compensation and Benefits Committee may grant RSUs with a deferral feature, whereby settlement of the RSU is deferred beyond the vesting date until a future payment date or event set out in the participant's award agreement. The Compensation and Benefits Committee has the discretion to credit RSUs with dividend equivalents. 
Performance Awards 
A performance award is an award that is only earned if certain conditions are met. Performance awards may be denominated in shares of Class A common stock or in cash. The Compensation and Benefits Committee has the discretion to determine: the number of shares of common stock or stock-denominated units subject to a performance share award; the applicable performance period; the conditions that must be satisfied for a participant to earn an award; and the other terms, conditions and restrictions of the award. Whether a participant earns all or a portion of a performance award depends on the extent to which the performance goals established by the Compensation and Benefits Committee are attained within the applicable performance period. The Compensation and Benefits Committee has the discretion to determine whether the performance award is paid in shares of Class A common stock, cash or a combination of both. 
Other Stock-Based Awards 
The Compensation and Benefits Committee may grant other stock-based awards, either alone or in tandem with other awards, in amounts and subject to conditions as determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee as set out in an award agreement.  Vesting 
The 2019 Plan allows for awards subject to either time-based vesting or performance-based vesting, or both. The Compensation and Benefits Committee has the authority to determine the vesting schedule of each award, and to accelerate the vesting and exercisability of any award. The Company's practice with respect to employee grants over the last five years has been to grant awards with a minimum of three years before any part of the award vests. Please see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis for information regarding the Company's grant practices and outstanding awards for its Named Executive Officers. 
Adjustments Upon Changes in Stock 
In the event of changes in the outstanding common stock or in the capital structure of the Company by reason of any stock or extraordinary cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, an extraordinary corporate transaction such as any recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange, or other relevant change in capitalization occurring after the grant date of any award, awards granted under the 2019 Plan and any award agreements, the exercise price of options and SARs, the maximum number of shares of common stock subject to all awards may be equitably adjusted or substituted, as to the number, price or kind of a share of common stock or other consideration subject to such awards to the extent necessary to preserve the economic intent of the award. 
Unless the Compensation and Benefits Committee specifically determines that such adjustment is in the best interests of the Company or its affiliates, the Compensation and Benefits Committee will, in the case of non-qualified stock options, ensure that any adjustments will not constitute a modification of such non-qualified stock options within the meaning of Code Section 409A. Any adjustments will be made in a manner which does not adversely affect the exemption provided under Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. The Company will give participants notice of any adjustment. 
Change in Control 
Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, in the event of a participant's termination of service without cause or for good reason, in either case, during the 30-day period prior to or 13-month period following a change in control, the vesting of all awards will fully accelerate and all outstanding options and SARs will become immediately exercisable as of the date of the participant's termination of service. In the case of performance awards, in the event of a participant's termination of service without cause or for good reason, in either case, during the 30-day period prior to or 13-month period following a change in control, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels and all other terms and conditions will be deemed met as of the date of the participant's termination of service. 
In the event of a change in control, the Compensation and Benefits Committee may in its discretion cancel any outstanding awards and pay to the holders the value of the awards based upon the price per share of Class A common stock received or to be received by other stockholders of the Company in the event. In the case of any option or SAR with an exercise price that equals or exceeds the price paid for a share of common stock in connection with the change in control, the Compensation and Benefits Committee may cancel the option or SAR without the payment of any consideration. 
Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, a change in control is defined generally as (a) the acquisition by one person or more than one person acting as a group, of beneficial ownership of Class A common stock representing more than 50% of the total voting power of the Company's stock; (b) a majority of the members of the Board are replaced by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the Board; (c) a merger, consolidation, reorganization or similar transaction involving the Company or in which securities of the Company are issued unless the Company's stockholders before the transaction beneficially own at least 50% of the voting power of the resulting company's equity and at least a majority of the Board prior to the transaction represent a majority of the board of the resulting company; or (d) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company.  Amendment or Termination of the 2019 Plan 
The Board may amend or terminate the 2019 Plan. However, except in the case of adjustments upon changes in Class A common stock, no amendment will be effective unless approved by the stockholders of the Company to the extent stockholder approval is necessary to satisfy any applicable laws or stock exchange rules. The 2019 Plan shall terminate on January 29, 2029, unless previously terminated by the Board. 
Amendment of Awards 
The Board may amend the terms of any one or more awards. However, the Board may not affect any amendment which would otherwise constitute an impairment of the rights under any award unless the Company requests the consent of the participant and the participant consents in writing. 
Clawback and Recoupment 
The Company may cancel any award or require the participant to reimburse any previously paid compensation provided under the 2019 Plan or an award agreement in accordance with (a) any Company recoupment policy (including the Charter Communications Compensation Recovery Policy, as amended from time to time), (b) any other agreement or arrangement with a participant, or (c) any right or obligation that the Company may have regarding the clawback of "incentive-based compensation" under Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and any applicable rules and regulations promulgated under that act. 
Repricing 
The 2019 Plan authorizes the repricing of options, which could include reducing the exercise price per share of any outstanding option, permitting the cancellation, forfeiture or tender of outstanding options in exchange for other awards or for new options with a lower exercise price per share, or repricing or replacing any outstanding options by any other method. While the 2019 Plan authorizes repricing, no such repricing has occurred under our equity plans to date. 
Federal Income Tax Consequences of Awards 
The following is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of awards granted under the 2019 Plan. This summary is based on U.S. federal income tax laws and regulations in effect on the date of this Proxy Statement and is not a complete description of the U.S. federal income tax laws. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not constitute legal or tax advice. This summary does not address municipal, state or foreign income tax consequences of awards, or federal employment taxes. 
Nonqualified Stock Options 
The grant of a nonqualified stock option will not result in taxable income to the participant. The participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of exercise equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction for tax purposes. Gains or losses realized by the participant upon the sale of the shares acquired on exercise will be treated as capital gains or losses. 
Incentive Stock Options (ISOs) 
The grant of an ISO will not result in taxable income to the participant. The exercise of an ISO will not result in taxable income to the participant if at the time of exercise the participant has been employed by the Company or its subsidiaries at all times beginning on the date the ISO was granted and ending not more than 90 days before the date of exercise. However, the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price is an adjustment that is included in the calculation of the participant's alternative minimum tax liability for the year the shares are sold.  If the participant does not sell the shares acquired on exercise within two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise then on the sale of the shares any amount realized in excess of the exercise price will be taxed as capital gain. If the amount realized in the sale is less than the exercise price, then the participant will recognize a capital loss. If these holding requirements are not met, then the participant will generally recognize ordinary income at the time the shares are sold in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price, or (b) the excess, if any, of the amount realized on the sale of the shares over the exercise price, and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. 
SARs 
The grant of a SAR will not result in taxable income to the participant. The participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of exercise equal to the amount of cash received or the fair market value of the shares received and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction for tax purposes. If the SARs are settled in shares, then when the shares are sold the participant will recognize capital gain or loss on the difference between the sale price and the amount recognized at exercise. Whether it is a long-term or short-term gain or loss depends on how long the shares are held. 
Restricted Stock and Performance Awards 
Unless a participant makes an election to accelerate the recognition of income to the grant date (as described below), the grant of restricted stock or performance awards will not result in taxable income to the participant. When the restrictions lapse, the participant will recognize ordinary income on the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date over the amount paid for the shares, if any, or the amount received in the case of awards payed in cash and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. If the participant makes an election under Code Section 83(b) within thirty days after the grant date, the participant will recognize ordinary income as of the grant date equal to the fair market value of the shares on the grant date over the amount paid, if any, and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. Any future appreciation will be taxed at capital gains rates. However, if the shares are later forfeited, the participant will not be able to recover any taxes paid. 
RSUs 
The grant of an RSU will not result in taxable income to the participant. When the RSU vests, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares or the cash provided on settlement and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. Any future appreciation will be taxed at capital gains rates. 
Section 409A 
Code Section 409A imposes complex rules on nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements, including requirements with respect to elections to defer compensation and the timing of payment of deferred amounts. Depending on how they are structured, certain equity-based awards may be subject to Code Section 409A, while others are exempt. If an award is subject to Code Section 409A and a violation occurs, the compensation is includible in income when no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and the participant may be subject to a 20% penalty tax and, in some cases, interest penalties. The 2019 Plan and awards granted under the 2019 Plan are intended to be exempt from or conform to the requirements of Code Section 409A. 
Section 162(m) and the Company's Deduction 
Generally, whenever a participant recognizes ordinary income under the 2019 Plan, a corresponding deduction is available to the Company provided that the Company complies with certain reporting requirements. However, under Code Section 162(m), the Company will be denied a deduction for compensation paid to certain   senior executives that exceeds $1,000,000. Beginning January 1, 2018, with the passage and signing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"), this limitation will apply to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the Company's other named executive officers, and anyone who was a covered person after December 31, 2016. Prior to January 1, 2018, certain performance-based compensation was excluded from the $1,000,000 deduction limit. With the passage and signing of the Act, beginning January 1, 2018 (with an exception for certain grandfathered arrangements), the Company will be denied a deduction for any compensation exceeding $1,000,000 for such covered individuals, regardless of whether the compensation is performance-based compensation. 
New Plan Benefits 
As of the record date, the closing price of our common stock was $350.08. No determination has yet been made as to the awards, if any, that any eligible individuals will be granted in the future and, therefore, the benefits to be awarded under the 2019 Plan, which are subject to the discretion of the Committee, are not determinable at this time. The following table, however, sets forth the aggregate value of benefits or amounts that would have been received by or allocated to each of the following persons or groups, in each case, under the 2019 Plan with respect to fiscal year 2018 if the 2019 Plan had been in effect and the 2009 Plan had not been in effect, in each case, based on awards made under the 2009 Plan:

Required Vote 
Approval of this Proposal 2 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast at the stockholders meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast. Accordingly, assuming a quorum is present, abstentions, broker non-votes and a stockholder's other failure to vote will have no effect on the approval of the proposal. 
Board Recommendation 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF 2019 PLAN.  Proposal No. 3: Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered 
Public Accounting Firm 
(Item 3 on Proxy Card) 
The Audit Committee of the board of directors has appointed KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Stockholder ratification of the selection of KPMG as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is not required by the Company's Bylaws or other applicable requirement. However, as a matter of corporate responsibility, the Audit Committee decided to solicit stockholder ratification of this appointment. Ratification of the appointment of KPMG as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is not required for KPMG's retention; however, if the appointment is not ratified, the Audit Committee may consider re-evaluating the appointment. 
KPMG has been serving as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 2002. The Company has been advised that no member of KPMG had any direct financial interest or material indirect financial interest in the Company or any of its subsidiaries or, during the past three years, has had any connection with the Company or any of its subsidiaries in the capacity of promoter, underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer or employee. The Company has been advised that no other relationship exists between KPMG and the Company that impairs KPMG's status as the independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the Company within the meaning of the Federal securities laws and the requirements of the Independence Standards Board. 
Representatives of KPMG will be in attendance at the annual meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire. The representatives will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.  Accounting Matters 
Principal Accounting Firm 
KPMG acted as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 2002, and, subject to ratification by stockholders at the annual meeting, KPMG is expected to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures requiring the pre-approval of non-audit services that may be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. We have also complied and will continue to comply with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related SEC rules pertaining to auditor independence and audit committee pre-approval of audit and non-audit services. 
Audit Fees 
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred fees and related expenses for professional services rendered by KPMG for the audits of Charter and its subsidiaries' financial statements, for the review of Charter and its subsidiaries' interim financial statements, registration statement filings and offering memoranda filings totaling approximately $8 million and $9 million, respectively. 
Audit-Related Fees 
Charter incurred audit-related fees to KPMG of approximately $0.2 million during each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. These services were primarily related to diligence services in 2018 and accounting and reporting consultation in 2017. 
Tax Fees 
Charter incurred tax fees to KPMG of approximately $1 million and $2 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
All Other Fees 
None. 
The Audit Committee appoints, retains, compensates and oversees the independent registered public accounting firm (subject, if applicable, to board of director and/or stockholder ratification), and approves in advance all fees and terms for the audit engagement and non-audit engagements where non-audit services are not prohibited by Section 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended with respect to independent registered public accounting firms. Pre-approvals of non-audit services are sometimes delegated to a single member of the Audit Committee. However, any pre-approvals made by the Audit Committee's designee are presented at the Audit Committee's next regularly scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee has an obligation to consult with management on these matters. The Audit Committee approved 100% of the KPMG fees for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Audit Committee considered whether the provision of non-audit services was compatible with KPMG's independence. Each year, including 2018, with respect to the proposed audit engagement, the Audit Committee reviews the proposed risk assessment process in establishing the scope of examination and the reports to be rendered. 
In its capacity as a committee of the board, the Audit Committee oversees the work of the independent registered public accounting firm (including resolution of disagreements between management and the public accounting firm regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or   performing other audit, review or attest services. The independent registered public accounting firm reports directly to the Audit Committee. In performing its functions, the Audit Committee undertakes those tasks and responsibilities that, in its judgment, most effectively contribute to and implement the purposes of the Audit Committee charter. For more detail of the Audit Committee's authority and responsibilities, see the Company's Audit Committee charter on the Company's website, www.charter.com.  Report of the Audit Committee 
The following report does not constitute soliciting materials and is not considered filed or incorporated by reference into any other Company filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, unless we state otherwise. 
The Audit Committee was established to oversee the Company's accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of the Company's annual financial statements. In 2018 Ms. Goodman and Messrs. Merritt and Markley served on the Audit Committee for the entire year. All members were determined by the board to be independent in accordance with the applicable corporate governance listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The Company's board of directors has determined that, in its judgment, Mr. Merritt is an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of the applicable federal regulations. 
The Audit Committee's functions are detailed in a written amended and restated Audit Committee charter adopted by the board of directors, a copy of which is available on the Company's website at www.charter.com. As more fully described in its charter, the Audit Committee reviews the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the board of directors. Company management has the primary responsibility for the Company's financial statements and the reporting process. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and expressing an opinion on the conformity of the financial statements to generally accepted accounting principles. The internal auditors are responsible to the Audit Committee and the board of directors for testing the integrity of the financial accounting and reporting control systems and such other matters as the Audit Committee and board of directors determine. The Audit Committee held four meetings in 2018. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and the internal auditors the Company's audited financial statements and effectiveness of internal controls for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee has discussed the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, as amended (Communication with Audit Committees) with KPMG, the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
The Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed the independence of KPMG with that firm and has considered the compatibility of non-audit services with KPMG's independence. 
Based on the Audit Committee's review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the board of directors that the Company's audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. 
The Audit Committee evaluated KPMG's independence, performance, qualifications, tenure, partnership rotation and relationship management and based on that evaluation approved the appointment of KPMG as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2018.

KIM C. GOODMAN 
JOHN D. MARKLEY, JR.  Proposal No. 4: Stockholder Proposal Regarding Proxy Access 
(Item 4 on Proxy Card) 
This proposal was submitted by the custodian and a trustee of the New York City Employees' Retirement System, the New York City Teachers' Retirement System and the New York City Police Pension Fund, One Centre Street, 8th Floor North, New York, NY 10007, in each case the beneficial owners of at least $2,000 worth of shares of our Class A common stock. 
RESOLVED: Shareholders of Charter Communications, Inc. (the "Company") ask the board of directors (the "Board") to take the steps necessary to adopt a "proxy access" bylaw. Such a bylaw shall require the Company to include in proxy materials prepared for a shareholder meeting at which directors are to be elected the name, Disclosure and Statement (as defined herein) of any person nominated for election to the board by a shareholder or group (the "Nominator") that meets the criteria established below. The Company shall allow shareholders to vote on such nominee on the Company's proxy card. 
The number of shareholder-nominated candidates appearing in proxy materials shall not exceed the larger of two or one quarter of the directors then serving. This bylaw, which shall supplement existing rights under Company bylaws, should provide that a Nominator must: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  a)  have beneficially owned 3% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years before submitting  the nomination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  b)  give the Company, within the time period identified in its bylaws, written notice of the information required by the bylaws and any  Securities and Exchange Commission rules about (i) the nominee, including consent to being named in the proxy materials and to serving as director if elected; and (ii) the Nominator, including proof it owns the required shares (the  "Disclosure"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  c)  certify that (i) it will assume liability stemming from any legal or regulatory violation arising out of the Nominator's  communications with the Company shareholders, including the Disclosure and Statement; (ii) it will comply with all applicable laws and regulations if it uses soliciting material other than the Company's proxy materials; and (iii) to  the best of its knowledge, the required shares were acquired in the ordinary course of business and not to change or influence control at the Company.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominator may submit with the Disclosure a statement not exceeding 500 words in support of each nominee (the "Statement"). The Board shall adopt procedures for promptly resolving disputes over whether notice of a nomination was timely, whether the Disclosure and Statement satisfy the bylaw and applicable federal regulations, and the priority to be given to multiple nominations exceeding the one-quarter limit. 
Supporting Statement 
We believe proxy access will make directors more accountable and enhance shareholder value. A 2014 study by the CFA Institute concluded that proxy access could raise overall US market capitalization by up to $140.3 billion if adopted market-wide, "with little cost or disruption." (http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/Tdf/10.2469/ccb.v2014.n9.1) 
The proposed terms are similar to those in vacated SEC Rule 14a-11 (https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2010/33-9136.pdf). The SEC, following extensive analysis and input from market participants, determined that those terms struck the proper balance of providing shareholders with viable proxy access while containing appropriate safeguards. 
The proposed terms enjoy strong investor support and company acceptance. Between January 2015 and October 2017, 112 similar shareholder proposals received majority votes and at least 444 companies of various sizes across industries enacted bylaws with similar terms. 
We urge shareholders to vote FOR this proposal.  Statement Against Stockholder Proposal Regarding Proxy Access 
Our Company is committed to strong corporate governance practices including meaningful stockholder rights and robust engagement measures. Proxy access proposals are largely driven by a genuine and legitimate interest to find ways to ensure that boards are comprised of the right people to effectively represent stockholder interests. Although our board of directors understands that proxy access is a topic of interest among investors, the board believes that this particular proposal is fundamentally flawed for several reasons and is not in the best interest of our stockholders. 
The Company's corporate governance structure reflects our commitment to strong and effective governance practices and a willingness to be responsive and accountable to stockholders. We regularly assess our corporate governance policies to take into account evolving best practices and to address stockholder feedback. Our goals are to align the interests of stockholders, directors, and management; ensure accountability; encourage robust engagement with our key stakeholders; and provide our stockholders with a meaningful voice in both the nomination and the election of directors. The proposal disregards the many mechanisms the Company has instituted to ensure board accountability. The board is accountable to the Company's stockholders through protections that are embedded in our governing documents and corporate governance practices. These practices include having a Lead Independent Director and majority voting for directors. 
Proxy access would also bypass the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's process of identifying and recommending director nominees with a diverse and complementary blend of experiences, skills, qualifications and perspectives, to oversee our business and who can contribute to the overall effectiveness of the board. In undertaking this responsibility, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has a fiduciary duty to act in a manner the committee reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Company; proxy access stockholder proponents do not have a fiduciary duty when nominating directors. 
In addition to the foregoing, the proposal does not require nominating stockowners to disclaim any current intent to effect a change in control, but only requires nominating stockowners to certify that the required shares were originally acquired in the ordinary course and not to change or influence control at the Company. A nominating stockholder's current intentions would be unknown. In addition, the proposal permits an excessive number of stockholder access candidates, which could disenfranchise other stockholders. Each of our directors is elected annually for a one-year term. The proposal would allow stockholders, some motivated by special or short-term interests, to nominate access candidates for up to four of the board's seats. Our CEO currently serves as a director and our stockholders' agreement with Liberty and A/N provides for those stockholders to have up to six directors (currently five based on current stock ownership). Currently, if a stockholder's nominees were elected, only three out of the thirteen directors would have no connection to the Company or a large stockholder. If our ownership structure were to change, the board may reexamine the issue. 
The board believes the right thing to do now is what it has always done — continue to engage with our stockholders to ensure that we have as fulsome an understanding of their views as possible so that it can be incorporated into our approach on this issue. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "AGAINST" THIS PROPOSAL.  Proposal No. 5: Stockholder Proposal Regarding Sustainability Reporting 
(Item 5 on Proxy Card) 
This proposal was submitted by Walden Asset Management, One Beacon Street, Boston, MA 02108, as co-lead filers along with the New York State Common Retirement Fund and the Illinois State Treasurer's Office, in each case the beneficial owners of at least $2,000 worth of shares of our Class A common stock. 
Sustainability Reporting 
Resolved, Shareholders request that Charter Communications (Charter) issue an annual sustainability report describing the company's policies, performance, and improvement targets related to material environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities including greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets and goals. The report should be available to shareholders within a reasonable timeframe, prepared at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information. 
Supporting Statement 
Company performance on material ESG issues can influence long-term shareholder value. Strong management of material ESG risks has a positive effect on long-term shareholder value and value creation. Failure to adequately manage and disclose performance on material ESG factors can pose significant regulatory, legal, reputational, and financial risk to the company and its shareholders. 
The Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB)'s standards provide a framework for identifying material ESG issues and uniformly disclosing sustainability-related information to shareholders in cost-effective manner. The Global Reporting Initiative's Sustainability Reporting Standards may also provide useful assistance. 
SASB identifies Charter's material ESG issues as energy consumed by infrastructure; data privacy; data security; product end-of-life management; managing systemic risks from technology disruptions; and competitive behavior and open internet. Presently, Charter provides insufficient disclosure on these issues. For instance, Charter does not disclose energy use or GHG data to the public. The magnitude of energy use and the source of energy will become increasing material for Charter as the global regulatory focus on climate change increases including policy incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy as well as pricing of GHG. The absence of this information challenges investors' ability to comprehensively evaluate Charter's management of ESG risks and opportunities. 
Investors are increasingly calling for improved corporate disclosure of performance on material ESG issues: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Principles for Responsible Investment: 1,900 signatories that represent $81.7 trillion in assets who commit to: "seek appropriate disclosure on  ESG issues by the entities in which [they] invest."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• SASB Investor Advisory Group: 32 global asset owners and asset managers (including Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street Global Advisors) with $26  trillion in assets that seek consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosure of material, decision-useful sustainability-related information from corporate issuers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• CDP, representing 827 institutional investors globally with approximately $100 trillion in assets, calls for company disclosure on GHG emissions and  climate change management programs. 70% of the S&P 500 disclose to CDP.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), commissioned by the Financial Stability Board and supported by a cross section of  influential investors and business leaders, recommends companies adopt targets to manage climate-related risks and disclose related strategies.  
[END TABLE]
 In 2017, KPMG found that 75% of 4,900 global companies had ESG reports. By not reporting, Charter is falling behind its peers, including Sky PLC and Liberty Global, who provide comprehensive ESG reports that include GHG reduction goals. 
We recommend that the report include a company-wide review of policies, practices and metrics related to ESG performance. 
Statement Against Stockholder Proposal Regarding Sustainability Reporting 
We agree that environmental, social and governance-related ("ESG") matters are important and worthwhile areas of focus for the Company. We conduct our business with a compliance focus and have a strong corporate culture of "doing the right thing," including with respect to ESG matters. However, although the Company remains mindful and vigilant with respect to ESG matters as it hires employees, engages vendors and provides products and services to its customers, we do not believe that separate reporting with respect to our policies and improvement targets as proposed in the stockholder proposal represent an efficient or prudent use of our corporate resources. 
Throughout its operations, the Company adheres to ethical business standards, which are described in our Code of Conduct, which is available on our investor relations website along with other governance policies and procedures. We believe that the best use of the Company's resources is to continue to operate as efficiently as possible as it does now with a continued focus on ESG. For example, the Company has entered into a voluntary agreement regarding reducing the electricity used by consumer premises equipment provided by the Company, and the Company is focused on providing services in a manner that reduces the number of truck rolls thereby reducing associated energy consumption. The Company also has a robust diversity and inclusion program as well as various philanthropic community impact programs. These programs include a Spectrum Housing Assist initiative aimed at repairing tens of thousands of unsafe homes across the country and a Spectrum Digital Education Grant Program. Preparing a formal report of the type sought by the stockholder would require significant time and expense that we believe is better devoted to a continued focus on our operating strategy that also encapsulates ESG focuses. 
The Company believes that the Board should assess all risks and opportunities facing the Company, which includes oversight of relevant ESG matters, and our corporate governance practices already contemplates the Board's oversight of these areas. For example, the Audit Committee, as described in its charter, discusses and considers policies and guidelines to govern the process by which risk assessment and risk management are handled. Accordingly, in addition to its other duties, the Audit Committee periodically reviews the Company's risk assessment and management. In this role, the Audit Committee considers the nature of the material risks that the Company faces, and the adequacy of the Company's policies and procedures designed to respond to and mitigate these risks. It also receives reports, including periodic risk assessments covering a broad range of business, market environment, and operating risks. The Audit Committee regularly reports on these activities to the Board. 
Although we disagree with the specific proposal at issue, the Company agrees that management of ESG risks and opportunities is important. Our resistance to this proposal should not be interpreted as a lack of concern by the Board of Directors or the Company about ESG topics or implementing ESG practices, procedures or policies. Although we do not agree with the proposal at this time, the Company will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of its public disclosure related to its ESG practices. 
Our Board is responsible to the stockholders of the Company as a whole. In keeping with this mandate and for the reasons described above, we believe that preparing a sustainability report as requested by the proposal would not provide useful information to our stockholders and would not be an efficient use of our financial and human resources. As such, we urge our stockholders to vote against it. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "AGAINST" THIS PROPOSAL.  CEO Pay Ratio 
Charter's CEO to Median Employee pay ratio for 2018 was calculated pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, comparing total annual compensation for the CEO to that of the Median Employee. In 2017, for purposes of calculating the pay ratio, the Median Employee was selected based on an analysis of the median 2017 W-2 Box 1 income among all full and part-time U.S. employees, other than the CEO, who were actively employed by Charter as of December 31, 2017. No adjustments were applied to W-2 Box 1 income for purposes of determining the Median Employee, such as for employees who were employed for only part of the year or on unpaid leave of absence at some point during the year. Charter's employees outside of the U.S. were excluded from this analysis on the basis that they collectively represented less than 5% of Charter's total employee population – as of December 31, 2017, Charter had 95,064 active employees globally, with 403 located outside of the U.S., primarily in the U.K. and India. Charter's employee population as of December 31, 2018 was comparable, with 98,468 active employees globally, 384 of which were located outside of the U.S. 
In 2018, the Median Employee identified in 2017 for purposes of calculating our CEO Pay Ratio had a material change in compensation, resulting in the individual no longer being an appropriate Median Employee pursuant to Item 402(u). For purposes of calculating this year's pay ratio, a new Median Employee was therefore selected from the prior year's analysis, conditioned upon such employee still being actively employed by Charter as of December 31, 2018 with no material change to their role or compensation since the original analysis. Our CEO Pay Ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u). However, due to the flexibility afforded by Item 402(u) in calculating the CEO Pay Ratio, our CEO Pay Ratio may not be comparable to the CEO pay ratios presented by other companies. 
The Median Employee had total annual compensation of $55,560, calculated using the same methodology as applied for the CEO in the Summary Compensation Table. Full-time Charter employees in the U.S., including the Median Employee, are also eligible to participate in Company-sponsored retirement and health and welfare benefits programs and receive complimentary cable services, which provide significant additional value but are not included in the measure of total annual compensation used to calculate the pay ratio. 
The ratio of the CEO's total annual compensation to that of the Median Employee was as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO Total Annual Compensation    $ 8,156,151   
 Median Employee Total Annual Compensation    $ 55,560   
 Ratio of CEO to Median Employee Total Annual Compensation      146.8   
[END TABLE]
 Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirement 
Section 16 of the Exchange Act requires our directors and certain of our officers, and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and other of our equity securities with the SEC. Such persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required, we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were complied with during the 2018 fiscal year. 
Code of Ethics 
We have adopted a Financial Code of Ethics within the meaning of federal securities regulations for our employees, including all executive officers and directors. We also established a hotline and website for reporting alleged violations of the Financial Code of Ethics, established procedures for processing complaints and implemented educational programs to inform our employees regarding the Financial Code of Ethics. A copy of our Financial Code of Ethics is available on our website at www.charter.com. 
Stockholder Proposals for 2020 Annual Meeting 
If you want to include a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement for the 2020 annual meeting, it must be delivered to the Corporate Secretary at the Company's executive offices no later than November 15, 2019. The federal proxy rules specify what constitutes timely submission and whether a stockholder proposal is eligible to be included in the proxy statement. 
If a stockholder desires to bring business before the meeting that is not the subject of a proposal timely and properly submitted for inclusion in the proxy statement or to make a nomination of a person for election to the board of directors, the stockholder must follow procedures outlined in the Company's Bylaws. One of the procedural requirements in the Bylaws is timely notice in writing of the business the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting. To be timely with respect to the 2020 annual meeting, such a notice must be delivered to the Company's Corporate Secretary at the Company's executive offices no earlier than January 4, 2020 and no later than January 29, 2020. However, in the event that the Company elects to hold its next annual meeting more than 30 days before or after the anniversary of this annual meeting, such stockholder proposals would have to be received by the Company not earlier than 120 days prior to the next annual meeting date and not later than 90 days prior to the next annual meeting date. 
Such notice must include: (1) for a nomination for director, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in a proxy for election of directors; (2) as to any other business, a description of the proposed business, the text of the proposal, the reasons therefore, and any material interest the stockholder may have in that business; and (3) certain information regarding the stockholder making the proposal. These requirements are separate from the requirements a stockholder must meet to have a proposal included in the Company's proxy statement. The foregoing time limits also apply in determining whether notice is timely for purposes of rules adopted by the SEC relating to the exercise of discretionary voting authority. 
Any stockholder desiring a copy of the Company's Bylaws will be furnished one without charge upon written request to the Corporate Secretary. A copy of the amended and restated Bylaws was filed as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 19, 2016, together with the amendment filed as an exhibit to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on July 30, 2018, and is available at the SEC Internet site (http://www.sec.gov).  Other Matters 
At the date of mailing of this proxy statement, we are not aware of any business to be presented at the annual meeting other than the matters discussed above. If other proposals are properly brought before the meeting, any proxies returned to us will be voted as the proxyholder sees fit. 
Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 is available without charge by accessing the "Investor Relations" section of our website at ir.charter.com. You also may obtain a paper copy of the Form 10-K, without exhibits, at no charge by writing to the Company at 400 Atlantic Street, Stamford, CT 06901, Attention: Investor Relations. 
In addition, certain financial and other related information, which is required to be furnished to our stockholders, is provided to stockholders concurrently with this Proxy Statement in our 2018 Annual Report. The SEC has enacted a rule that allows the Company to deliver only one copy of our Proxy Statement and 2018 Annual Report to multiple security holders sharing an address if they so consent. This is known as "householding." The Householding Election, which appears on your proxy card, provides you with a means for you to notify us whether you consent to participate in householding. By marking "Yes" in the block provided, you will consent to participate in householding and by marking "no" you will withhold your consent to participate. If you do nothing, you will be deemed to have given your consent to participate in householding. Your consent to householding will be perpetual unless you withhold or revoke it. You may revoke your consent at any time by contacting Broadridge Financial Solutions ("Broadridge"), either by writing to Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717, or by calling (800) 542-1061. We will remove you from the householding program, following which you will promptly receive an individual copy of our Annual Report and this Proxy Statement. Even if your household receives only one Annual Report and one Proxy Statement, a separate proxy card will be provided for each stockholder. If you vote using the proxy card, please sign and return it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. If you vote by Internet or telephone, there is no need to mail the proxy card.  Annex A

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for 409A Awards that are settled or distributed upon a "Change in Control," the foregoing definition shall only apply to the extent the applicable event otherwise constituting a "Change in Control" would also constitute a "change in control event" under Code Section 409A. 
Unless otherwise provided in an Agreement or employment agreement between a Participant and the Company, notwithstanding the foregoing, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to occur solely because any Person (the "Subject Person") acquired Beneficial Ownership of more than the permitted amount of the then outstanding Shares or voting securities as a result of the acquisition of Shares or voting securities by the   Company which, by reducing the number of Shares or voting securities then outstanding, increases the proportional number of Shares Beneficially Owned by the Subject Persons, provided that if a Change in Control would occur (but for the operation of this sentence) as a result of the acquisition of Shares or voting securities by the Company, and after such share acquisition by the Company, the Subject Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of any additional Shares or voting securities which increases the percentage of the then outstanding Shares or voting securities Beneficially Owned by the Subject Person, then a Change in Control shall occur. 
Unless otherwise provided in an Agreement or employment agreement between the Participants and the Company, if a Participant's employment is terminated (A) by the Company without Cause within the thirty (30) day period immediately preceding a Change in Control or (B) by the Company without Cause preceding a Change in Control at the written request of a third party (or such third party's agent) who has indicated an intention or taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control, such termination shall be deemed to have occurred after a Change in Control for purposes of this Plan provided a Change in Control shall actually have occurred.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, if one or more members of the Committee is not a Nonemployee Director but recuses himself or herself or abstains from voting with respect to a particular action taken by the Committee, then the Committee, with respect to that action, shall be deemed to consist only of the members of the Committee who have not recused themselves or abstained from voting. 
3.2 Subject to applicable law, the Committee may delegate its authority under the Plan to any other person or persons, including but not limited to, a subcommittee comprised of one or more member(s) of the Committee, pursuant to such conditions or limitations as the Committee may establish, and may grant authority to officers or subcommittee members to grant Awards and/or execute agreements or other documents on behalf of the Committee; provided that (i) the Committee may not authorize any such officer or subcommittee member to designate himself or herself as a recipient of any Option or Award and (ii) the resolution authorizing any officer or subcommittee member to grant Options or Awards shall specify the total number of Options or Awards such officer may grant. In the event that the Committee's authority is delegated to officers or subcommittee members in accordance with the foregoing, all provisions of the Plan relating to the Committee shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the foregoing by treating any such reference as a reference to such individual for such purpose. Any action undertaken in accordance with the Committee's delegation of authority hereunder shall have the same force and effect as if such action was undertaken directly by the Committee and shall be deemed for all purposes of the Plan to have been taken by the Committee. 
3.3 No member of the Committee or the Board or any person designated pursuant to Section 3.2 shall be liable for any action, failure to act, determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to this Plan or any transaction hereunder. The Company hereby agrees to indemnify each member of the Committee for all costs and expenses and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any liability incurred in connection with defending against, responding to, negotiating for the settlement of or otherwise dealing with any claim, cause of action or dispute of any kind arising in connection with any actions in administering this Plan or in authorizing or denying authorization to any transaction hereunder. 
3.4 Subject to the express terms and conditions set forth herein, the Committee shall have the power and the discretion from time to time to: 
(a) determine those Eligible Individuals to whom Options shall be granted under the Plan and the number of such Options to be granted and to prescribe the terms and conditions (which need not be identical) of each such Option, (including, but not limited to, the exercise or purchase price (if any), the duration of each Option, any restriction or limitation, any vesting schedule or acceleration thereof, or any forfeiture restrictions or waiver thereof, regarding any Option and the Shares relating thereto, based on such factors, if any, as the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion), and make any amendment or modification to any Option Agreement consistent with the terms of the Plan; 
(b) select those Eligible Individuals to whom Awards shall be granted under the Plan and to determine the number of Shares in respect of which each Award is granted, the terms and conditions (which need not be identical) of each such Award (including, but not limited to, the exercise or purchase price (if any), the duration of each Award, any restriction or limitation, any vesting schedule or acceleration thereof, or any forfeiture restrictions or waiver thereof, regarding any Award and the Shares relating thereto, based on such factors, if any, as the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion), and make any amendment or modification to any Agreement consistent with the terms of the Plan; 
(c) to construe and interpret the Plan and the Options and Awards granted hereunder and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan, including, but not limited to, correcting any defect or supplying any omission, or reconciling any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Agreement, in the manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or advisable, including so that the Plan and the operation of the Plan complies with Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, the Code to the extent applicable   and other applicable law, and otherwise to make the Plan fully effective. All decisions and determinations by the Committee in the exercise of this power shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Optionees and Grantees, and all other persons having any interest therein; 
(d) to determine the duration and purposes for leaves of absence which may be granted to an Optionee or Grantee on an individual basis without constituting a termination of employment or service for purposes of the Plan; 
(e) to exercise its discretion with respect to the powers and rights granted to it as set forth in the Plan; 
(f) generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as are deemed necessary or advisable to promote the best interests of the Company with respect to the Plan; 
(g) engage an agent to (i) maintain records of Participants and holdings under the Plan, (ii) execute sales transactions in Shares at the direction of an Optionee or Grantee, (iii) deliver sales proceeds as directed by an Optionee or Grantee, (iv) hold Shares owned without restriction at the direction of the Optionee or Grantee and (v) engage in such other activities as the Committee determines from time to time necessary to administer the Plan; and 
(h) generally, to exercise such powers and to perform such acts as are deemed necessary or advisable to promote the best interests of the Company with respect to the Plan. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the participation of an Eligible Individual represented by a collective-bargaining representative shall also be governed by the results of good-faith collective bargaining and/or any collective bargaining agreement resulting therefrom. 
4. Stock Subject to the Plan; Grant Limitations. 
4.1 Awards under the Plan may be in the form of Nonqualified Stock Options, Incentive Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Dividend Equivalent Rights, Performance Units and Performance Shares, Share Awards, Phantom Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock, cash payments and such other forms as the Committee in its discretion deems appropriate, including any combination of the above. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, no fractional Shares shall be issued under the Plan nor shall any right be exercised under the Plan with respect to a fractional Share. 
4.2 Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 13, the maximum number of Shares that may be made the subject of Options and Awards granted under the Plan is 16,000,000. Following the effective date of this Plan (as described in Section 20.3 hereof), no additional awards shall be made under the Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended through May 18, 2016. The Company shall reserve for the purposes of the Plan, out of its authorized but unissued Shares or out of Shares held in the Company's treasury, or partly out of each, such number of Shares as shall be determined by the Board in its discretion. The aggregate number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options granted under this Plan shall not exceed 16,000,000 which number shall be calculated and adjusted pursuant to Section 13 only to the extent that such calculation or adjustment will not affect the status of any Option intended to qualify as an Incentive Stock Option under Code Section 422. 
4.3 In any calendar year, the maximum aggregate grant date fair value of all awards granted to an individual Nonemployee Director shall not exceed $3,000,000. 
4.4 Upon the granting of an Option or an Award, the number of Shares available under Section 4.2 for the granting of further Options and Awards shall be reduced as follows: in connection with the granting of an Option or an Award (other than the granting of a Performance Unit denominated in dollars), the number of Shares shall   be reduced by the number of Shares in respect of which the Option or Award is granted or denominated; provided, however, that (i) if any Option is exercised by tendering Shares, either actually or by attestation, to the Company as full or partial payment of the exercise price, the maximum number of Shares available under Section 4.2 shall be increased by the number of Shares so tendered and (ii) upon settlement of Stock Appreciation Rights, the maximum number of Shares available under Section 4.2 shall be increased by the excess of (x) the number of Shares covered by portion of the Stock Appreciation Right exercised, over (y) the number of Shares delivered in connection with the settlement of the Stock Appreciation Right. 
4.5 Whenever any outstanding Option or Award or portion thereof expires, is canceled, is settled in cash (including the settlement of tax withholding obligations using Shares) or is otherwise terminated for any reason without having been exercised or payment having been made by issuance of Shares in respect of the Option or Award, the Shares allocable to the expired, canceled, settled or otherwise terminated portion of the Option or Award may again be the subject of Options or Awards granted hereunder. 
5. Option Grants for Eligible Individuals. 
5.1 Authority of Committee. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have full and final authority to select those Eligible Individuals who will receive Options, and the terms and conditions of the grant to such Eligible Individuals shall be set forth in an Agreement. An Award of Options may include Incentive Stock Options, Non-Qualified Stock Options, or a combination thereof; provided, however, that an Incentive Stock Option may only be granted to an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary and no Incentive Stock Option shall be granted more than ten years after the earlier of (i) the date this Plan is adopted by the Board or (ii) the date this Plan is approved by the Company's shareholders. 
5.2 Exercise Price. Subject to Section 6.5, the purchase price or the manner in which the exercise price is to be determined for Shares under each Option shall be determined by the Committee in its discretion and set forth in the Agreement; provided, however, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the exercise price per Share under each Option shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Option is granted unless the Options are substituted for options issued by another company where the Company or a Subsidiary acquires (whether by purchase, merger, or otherwise) all or substantially all of outstanding capital stock or assets of another company or in the event of any reorganization or other transaction qualifying under Code Section 424. 
5.3 Maximum Duration. Options granted hereunder shall be for such term as the Committee shall determine in its discretion, provided that an Option shall not be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date it is granted. Unless the Committee provides otherwise in the Agreement or in an employment agreement between the Optionee and the Company, subject to the preceding sentence in this Section 5.3, an Option (i) may, upon the death, Disability or Retirement of the Optionee prior to the expiration of the Option, be exercised for up to two (2) years following the date of the Optionee's death, Disability or Retirement, as applicable, but in any event no later than the original expiration date, (ii) may, following the voluntary termination of service by the Optionee or a termination other than for Cause, be exercised for (a) up to sixty (60) days following the date of termination, or (b) if the Option continues to vest during the Severance Period (as defined below) pursuant to Section 4.3, sixty (60) days following the date the Option vests during such Severance Period, but, in any event, no later than the original expiration date, and (iii) shall, in the event of a termination of service for Cause, be terminated effective immediately prior to such termination, whether or not such Option was then exercisable and, provided further, that termination for this purpose is the later of (x) with respect to an Optionee who upon termination of employment as an employee remains an Eligible Individual shall occur only when the Optionee is no longer an Eligible Individual and (y) with respect to an Optionee who is receiving severance payments shall occur when such payments cease, provided Optionee enters into a release in the form acceptable to the Company. The Committee may, in its discretion, subsequent to the granting of any Option, extend the term thereof, but in no event shall the term as so extended exceed the maximum term provided for in the first sentence hereof.  5.4 Vesting. Subject to Section 6.4 addressing the effect of a Change in Control, each Option shall entitle the Eligible Individual to purchase, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of Shares covered by the Option as of the first anniversary of the date of grant and an additional twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of Shares covered by the Option after the expiration of each of the second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant while the Optionee is an Eligible Individual; provided however, that Options (i) may become exercisable in such other installments (which need not be equal) and at such times as may be designated by the Committee in its discretion and set forth in the Agreement and (ii) unless the Committee provides otherwise in the Agreement or in an employment agreement between the Optionee and the Company, shall continue to vest only while the Optionee is an Eligible Individual. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the vesting of any Option shall continue during the period the Optionee is receiving severance payments (the "Severance Period") provided Optionee enters into a release in the form acceptable to the Company. To the extent not exercised, installments shall accumulate and be exercisable, in whole or in part, at any time after becoming exercisable, but not later than the date the Option expires. The Committee may, in its discretion permit the continued vesting or, accelerate the exercisability of any Option or portion thereof at any time. 
5.5 Option Repricing. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the contrary, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, approve an Option repricing without stockholder approval. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, an "Option repricing" shall include reducing the exercise price per share of any outstanding Option, permitting the cancellation, forfeiture or tender of outstanding Options in exchange for other Awards or for new Options with a lower exercise price per Share, by any other method repricing or replacing any outstanding Option, or taking any other action deemed to be a "repricing" under the rules of the national securities exchange or other market on which the Shares are listed or admitted to trading. 
6. Terms and Conditions Applicable to All Options. 
6.1 Non-Transferability. 
(a) No Option shall be transferable by the Optionee other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order (within the meaning of Rule 16a-12 promulgated under the Exchange Act). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its discretion, set forth in the Agreement evidencing an Option at the time of grant or thereafter, that the Option may be transferred to (i) one or more members of the Optionee's family, (ii) a trust for the benefit of the Optionee and/or one or more members of the Optionee's family, (iii) a trust under the terms of which the Optionee has retained a "qualified interest" within the meaning of Section 2702(b)(1) of the Code and/or a reversionary interest, or (iv) a corporation, partnership or limited liability company in which the Optionee, a trust described in clauses (ii) or (iii), and/or one or more members of the Optionee's family own all of the outstanding shares, partnership interests or membership interests, as applicable (any such person or entity, a "Permitted Transferee"). For this purpose, members of the Optionee's family shall mean the Optionee's spouse, parents, children, stepchildren, grandchildren, and more remote descendants, the Optionee's siblings and descendants of such siblings, and the spouses of such persons. During the lifetime of the Optionee (or, following transfer, the Permitted Transferee), the Option shall be exercisable only by the Optionee (or, following transfer, the Permitted Transferee). The terms of an Option shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the beneficiaries, executors, administrators, heirs, successors and Permitted Transferees of the Optionee. 
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, including, without limitation, the provisions of Section 5.3, if an Option has been transferred in accordance with this Section 6.1, the Option shall be exercisable solely by the transferee. The Option shall remain subject to the provisions of the Plan, including that it shall be exercisable only to the extent that the Optionee or Optionee's estate would have been entitled to exercise it if the Optionee had not transferred the Option. Unless otherwise provided in the Optionee's Agreement, in the event of the death of the Optionee prior to the expiration of the right to exercise the transferred Option, the period during which the Option shall be exercisable shall terminate on the date one (1) year following the date of the   Optionee's death. In the event of the death of the transferee prior to the expiration of the right to exercise the Option, the period during which the Option shall be exercisable by the executors, administrators, legatees and distributees of the transferee's estate, as the case may be, shall terminate on the date one (1) year following the date of the transferee's death. In no event, however, shall the Option be exercisable after the expiration of the Option period set forth in the terms and conditions of the Agreement. The Option shall be subject to such other rules as the Committee shall determine in its discretion. 
6.2 Method of Exercise. The exercise of an Option shall be made only by a written notice delivered in person, electronically or by mail to the Company (or its designee) specifying the number of Shares to be exercised and, to the extent applicable, accompanied by payment therefor and otherwise in accordance with the Agreement pursuant to which the Option was granted; provided, however, that Options may not be exercised by an Optionee for six (6) months following a hardship distribution to the Optionee, to the extent such exercise is prohibited under Treasury Regulation § 1.401(k)-1(d)(3)(B)(2)(iv)(E)(2). The exercise price for any Shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Option shall be paid, in any of the following forms (or any combination thereof): (a) cash, (b) the transfer of Shares, either actually or by attestation, to the Company, such transfer to be upon such terms and conditions as determined by the Committee in its discretion, (c) withholding of Shares deliverable upon exercise or (d) a combination of any of the foregoing or such other methods as determined by the Committee in its discretion; provided, however, that the Committee may determine at any time in its discretion that the exercise price shall be paid only in cash. In addition, if Shares are regularly traded on an established securities market at the time of exercise, Options may be exercised through a registered broker-dealer pursuant to such "same day sale" procedures which are, from time to time, deemed acceptable by the Committee in its discretion. Any Shares transferred to or withheld by the Company as payment of the exercise price under an Option shall be valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise of such Option. If requested by the Committee in its discretion, the Optionee shall deliver the Agreement evidencing the Option to the Company (or its designee) who shall endorse thereon a notation of such exercise and return such Agreement to the Optionee. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its discretion, no fractional Shares (or cash in lieu thereof) shall be issued upon exercise of an Option and the number of Shares that may be purchased upon exercise shall be rounded to the nearest number of whole Shares. 
6.3 Rights of Optionees. No Optionee shall be deemed for any purpose to be the owner of any Shares subject to any Option unless and until (a) the Option shall have been exercised pursuant to the terms thereof, (b) the Company shall have issued and delivered Shares to the Optionee, and (c) the Optionee's name shall have been entered as a stockholder of record on the books of the Company. Thereupon, the Optionee shall have full voting, dividend and other ownership rights with respect to such Shares, subject to such terms and conditions as may be set forth in the applicable Agreement. 
6.4 Effect of Change in Control. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Plan, except as otherwise provided in an Agreement or employment agreement between the Optionee and the Company, in the event of a Change in Control, any unvested Options issued under this Plan to any Optionee shall vest and become fully exercisable, subject to the provisions of Section 12.2, upon (i) the termination by the Company, Subsidiary, or Affiliate of the Optionee's employment other than for Cause during the thirteen (13) month period following the Change in Control (taking into account the deemed termination provisions of the last paragraph of such definition) or (ii) the termination of the Optionee's employment for Good Reason, during the thirteen (13) month period following the Change in Control (taking into account the deemed termination provisions of the last paragraph of such definition). Except as otherwise provided in an Agreement or employment agreement between the Optionee and the Company, in the event of a Change in Control, the Committee may, in its discretion, do one or more of the following: (i) shorten the period during which Options are exercisable (provided they remain exercisable for at least thirty (30) days after the date on which notice of such shortening is given to the Optionees); (ii) arrange to have the surviving or successor entity assume the Options or grant replacement options with appropriate adjustments in the Option prices and adjustments in the number and kind of securities issuable upon exercise so that the options or their replacements either (A) represent the right to purchase the shares of stock, securities or other property (including cash) as may be issuable or payable as a result of a Change   in Control with respect to or in exchange for the number of Shares purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the Options had such exercise occurred in full prior to such Change in Control, or (B) represent the right to purchase equity securities of such surviving or successor entity, but only if such equity securities are actively traded on an established securities market or (iii) cancel the Options upon the payment to the Optionee in cash and/or securities of the surviving or successor entity (but only if such securities are actively traded on an established securities market) with respect to each Option to the extent then exercisable (including any Options as to which the exercise has been accelerated in accordance with this Section 6.4), of an amount that is equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Option or portion thereof over the aggregate exercise price for such Shares under the Option or portion thereof surrendered at the effective time of the Change in Control. The Committee may, in its discretion, also provide for one or more of the foregoing alternatives in any particular Option Agreement. 
6.5 ISOs. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5 and this Section 6, in the case of the grant of an Option intending to quality as an ISO: (i) if the Optionee is a Ten Percent Holder, the purchase price of such Option must be at least one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of the Shares on the date of grant and the Option must expire within a period of not more than five (5) years from the date of grant, and (ii) termination of employment will occur when the person to whom an ISO was granted ceases to be an employee (as determined in accordance with Code Section 3401(c) and the regulations promulgated thereunder) of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything in Section 5 and this Section 6 to the contrary, Options designated as ISOs shall not be eligible for treatment under the Code as ISOs to the extent that either (a) the aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares (determined as of the time of grant) with respect to which such Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted, or (b) such Options otherwise remain exercisable but are not exercised within three (3) months of termination of employment (or such other period of time provided in Code Section 422). Should any Option granted under this Plan be designated an "Incentive Stock Option," but fail, for any reason, to meet the requirements of the Code for such a designation, then such Option shall be deemed to be a Non-Qualified Stock Option and shall be valid as such according to its terms. 
7. Stock Appreciation Rights. 
The Committee may, in its discretion, either alone or in connection with the grant of an Option, grant Stock Appreciation Rights in accordance with the Plan, the terms and conditions of which shall be set forth in an Agreement. If granted in connection with an Option, a Stock Appreciation Right shall cover the same Shares covered by the Option (or such lesser number of Shares as the Committee may determine in its discretion) and shall, except as provided in this Section 7, be subject to the same terms and conditions as the related Option. 
7.1 Time of Grant. A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted (a) at any time if unrelated to an Option, or (b) if related to an Option, either at the time of grant or at any time thereafter during the term of the Option. 
7.2 Stock Appreciation Right Related to an Option. 
(a) Exercise. A Stock Appreciation Right granted in connection with an Option shall be exercisable at such time or times and only to the extent that the related Options are exercisable, and will not be transferable except to the extent the related Option may be transferable. 
(b) Amount Payable. Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right related to an Option, the Grantee shall be entitled to receive an amount determined by multiplying (i) the excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date preceding the date of exercise of such Stock Appreciation Right over the per Share exercise price under the related Option, by (ii) the number of Shares as to which such Stock Appreciation Right is being exercised. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its discretion, limit in any manner the amount payable with respect to any Stock Appreciation Right by including such a limit in the Agreement evidencing the Stock Appreciation Right at the time it is granted.  (c) Treatment of Related Options and Stock Appreciation Rights Upon Exercise. Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right granted in connection with an Option, the Option shall be canceled to the extent of the number of Shares as to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised, and upon the exercise of an Option granted in connection with a Stock Appreciation Right, the Stock Appreciation Right shall be canceled to the extent of the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised or surrendered. 
7.3 Stock Appreciation Right Unrelated to an Option. The Committee may, in its discretion, grant to Eligible Individuals Stock Appreciation Rights unrelated to Options. Stock Appreciation Rights unrelated to Options shall contain such terms and conditions as to exercisability (subject to Section 7.7), vesting and duration as the Committee shall determine in its discretion, but in no event shall they have a term of greater than ten (10) years. Unless the Committee provides otherwise in the Agreement or in an employment agreement between the Grantee and the Company, subject to the preceding sentence in this Section 7.3, a Stock Appreciation Right (i) may, upon the death, Disability or Retirement of the Grantee prior to the expiration of the Stock Appreciation Right, be exercised for up to two (2) years following the date of the Grantee's death, Disability or Retirement, but in any event no later than the expiration date, as applicable, (ii) may, following the voluntary termination of service by the Grantee or a termination other than for Cause, be exercised for up to sixty (60) days following the date of termination, but in any event no later than the expiration date, and (iii) shall, in the event of a termination of service for Cause, be terminated effective immediately prior to such termination, whether or not such Stock Appreciation Right was then exercisable. Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right unrelated to an Option, the Grantee shall be entitled to receive an amount determined by multiplying (a) the excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date preceding the date of exercise of such Stock Appreciation Right over the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Stock Appreciation Right was granted, by (b) the number of Shares as to which the Stock Appreciation Right is being exercised. 
7.4 Non-Transferability. No Stock Appreciation Right shall be transferable by the Grantee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order (within the meaning of Rule 16a-12 promulgated under the Exchange Act), and such Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable during the lifetime of such Grantee only by the Grantee or his or her guardian or legal representative. The terms of such Stock Appreciation Right shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the beneficiaries, executors, administrators, heirs and successors of the Grantee. 
7.5 Method of Exercise. Stock Appreciation Rights shall be exercised by a Grantee only by a written notice delivered in person, electronically or by mail to the Company (or its designee) specifying the number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is being exercised. If requested by the Committee in its discretion, the Grantee shall deliver the Agreement evidencing the Stock Appreciation Right being exercised and the Agreement evidencing any related Option to the Company (or its designee) who shall endorse thereon a notation of such exercise and return such Agreement to the Grantee. 
7.6 Form of Payment. Payment of the amount determined under Sections 7.2(b) or 7.3 may be made in the discretion of the Committee solely in whole Shares in a number determined at their Fair Market Value on the date preceding the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right, or solely in cash, or in a combination of cash and Shares. If the Committee, in its discretion, decides to make full payment in Shares and the amount payable results in a fractional Share, payment for the fractional Share will be made in cash. 
7.7 Effect of Change in Control. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Plan, except as otherwise provided in an Agreement or employment agreement between the Grantee and the Company, in the event of a Change in Control, any unvested Stock Appreciation Rights issued under this Plan to any Grantee shall vest and become fully exercisable, subject to the provisions of Section 12.2, upon (i) the termination by the Company, Subsidiary, or Affiliate of the Grantee's employment other than for Cause, during the thirteen (13) month period following the Change in Control (taking into account the deemed termination provisions of the last paragraph of such definition) or (ii) the termination of the Grantee's employment for Good Reason, during the thirteen (13) month period following the Change in Control (taking into account the deemed termination   provisions of the last paragraph of such definition). Except as otherwise provided in an Agreement or employment agreement between the Grantee and the Company, in the event of a Change in Control, the Committee may, in its discretion, do one or more of the following: (i) shorten the period during which Stock Appreciate Rights are exercisable (provided they remain exercisable for at least thirty (30) days after the date on which notice of such shortening is given to the Grantees); (ii) arrange to have the surviving or successor entity assume the Stock Appreciation Rights or grant replacement Stock Appreciation Rights with appropriate adjustments so that the Stock Appreciation Rights or their replacements represent the right to receive cash as may be payable as a result of a Change in Control with respect to the amount of cash receivable upon the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Rights had such exercise occurred in full prior to such Change in Control, or (iii) cancel Stock Appreciation Rights upon the payment to the Grantees in cash and/or securities of the surviving or successor entity (but only if such securities are actively traded on an established securities market) with respect to each Stock Appreciation Rights to the extent then exercisable (including any Stock Appreciation Rights as to which the exercise has been accelerated in accordance with this Section 7.7), of an amount that is equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Stock Appreciation Right or portion thereof over the aggregate exercise price for such Shares under the Stock Appreciation Right or portion thereof surrendered at the effective time of the Change in Control. The Committee may, in its discretion, also provide for one or more of the foregoing alternatives in any particular Agreement. 
8. Dividend Equivalent Rights. 
Dividend Equivalent Rights may be granted to Eligible Individuals in tandem with an Option or Award or as a separate Award. The terms and conditions applicable to each Dividend Equivalent Right shall be specified in the Agreement under which the Dividend Equivalent Right is granted. Amounts payable in respect of Dividend Equivalent Rights may be payable currently or deferred until the lapsing of restrictions on such Dividend Equivalent Rights or until the vesting, exercise, payment, settlement or other lapse of restrictions on the Option or Award to which the Dividend Equivalent Rights relate. In the event that the amount payable in respect of Dividend Equivalent Rights is to be deferred, the Committee shall, in its discretion, determine whether such amount is to be held in cash or reinvested in Shares or deemed (notionally) to be reinvested in Shares. If amounts payable in respect of Dividend Equivalent Rights are to be held in cash, there may be credited at the end of each year (or portion thereof) interest on the amount of the account at the beginning of the year at a rate per annum as the Committee may, in its discretion, determine. Dividend Equivalent Rights may be settled in cash or Shares or a combination thereof, in a single installment or multiple installments as the Committee, in its discretion, determines. 
9. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. 
9.1 Grant. The Committee may, in its discretion, grant Awards to Eligible Individuals of Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units, which shall be evidenced by an Agreement. Restricted Stock is a grant or issuance of Shares the retention, vesting and/or transferability of which is subject during specified periods of time to such conditions (including continued employment or performance conditions) and terms as the Committee deems appropriate. Restricted Stock Units are Awards denominated in units of Shares under which the issuance of Shares is subject to such conditions (including continued employment or performance conditions) and terms as the Committee deems appropriate. Each Agreement shall contain such restrictions, terms and conditions as the Committee may, in its discretion, determine and (without limiting the generality of the foregoing) such Agreements may require that an appropriate legend be placed on Share certificates of Restricted Stock. For example, the Committee may determine that some or all certificates representing Shares of Restricted Stock shall bear the following legend: "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO VESTING CONDITIONS AND CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER, SALE AND HYPOTHECATION AND CERTAIN REPURCHASE RIGHTS. A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS GOVERNING SUCH RESTRICTIONS IS SET FORTH IN THE CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. 2019 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN AND IN A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT. A COPY OF THE PLAN AND AWARD AGREEMENT ARE ON FILE AT THE   CORPORATION'S PRINCIPAL OFFICE." Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to the terms and provisions set forth below in this Section 9. 
9.2 Rights of Grantee. Shares of Restricted Stock granted pursuant to an Award hereunder shall be issued in the name of the Grantee as soon as reasonably practicable after the Award is granted provided that the Grantee, to the extent required by the Committee and in the manner specified by the Committee, has executed an Agreement evidencing the Award, the appropriate blank stock powers and, in the discretion of the Committee, an escrow agreement and any other documents which the Committee may, in its discretion, require as a condition to the issuance of such Shares. If a Grantee shall fail, to the extent required by the Committee, to execute the Agreement evidencing a Restricted Stock Award, or any documents which the Committee may, in its discretion, require within the time period prescribed by the Committee at the time the Award is granted, the Award shall be null and void. At the discretion of the Committee, Shares issued in connection with a Restricted Stock Award shall be deposited together with the stock powers with an escrow agent (which may be the Company) designated by the Committee. Unless the Committee in its discretion determines otherwise and as set forth in the Agreement, upon delivery of the Shares to the escrow agent, the Grantee shall have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to such Shares, including the right to vote the Shares and to receive all dividends or other distributions paid or made with respect to the Shares. Participants shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to Shares underlying Restricted Stock Units unless and until such Shares are reflected as issued and outstanding Shares on the Company's stock ledger. 
9.3 Non-Transferability. Until all restrictions upon the Shares of Restricted Stock awarded to a Grantee shall have lapsed in the manner set forth in Section 9.4, such Shares shall not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of and shall not be pledged or otherwise hypothecated. No Restricted Stock Unit shall be transferable by the Optionee otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a domestic relations order (within the meaning of Rule 16a-12 promulgated under the Exchange Act). 
9.4 Lapse of Restrictions. 
(a) Generally. Restrictions upon Shares of Restricted Stock awarded hereunder shall lapse, and Restricted Stock Units shall vest, at such time or times and on such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine in its discretion. The Agreement evidencing the Award shall set forth any such restrictions. 
(b) Effect of Change in Control. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Plan, except as otherwise provided in an Agreement or employment agreement between the Grantee and the Company, in the event of a Change in Control, any restrictions with respect to Restricted Stock issued under this Plan to any Grantee shall lapse and Restricted Stock Units issued under this Plan to any Grantee shall vest, subject to the provisions of Section 12.2, upon (i) the termination by the Company, Subsidiary, or Affiliate of the Optionee's employment other than for Cause, during the thirteen (13) month period following the Change in Control (taking into account the deemed termination provisions of the last paragraph of such definition) or (ii) the termination of the Optionee's employment for Good Reason, during the thirteen (13) month period following the Change in Control (taking into account the deemed termination provisions of the last paragraph of such definition). Except as otherwise provided in an Agreement or employment agreement between the Grantee and the Company, in the event of a Change in Control, the Committee may, in its discretion, do one or more of the following: (i) arrange to have the surviving or successor entity assume the Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units or grant replacement Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units with appropriate adjustments in the number and kind of securities so that the Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit Award or its replacement either (x) represents the right to receive cash or Shares as may be payable as a result of a Change in Control with respect to the amount of cash or Shares receivable upon the lapse of the restrictions on the Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units had such lapse occurred prior to such Change in Control, or (y) represents the right to the equity securities of the surviving or successor entity, but only if such equity securities are actively traded on an established securities market, or (ii) cancel the Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit Award upon the payment to the Grantees in cash and/or securities of the surviving or successor entity (but only if such securities are actively traded on an   established securities market), with respect to each Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Award to the extent then lapsed (including any Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units as to which the lapse of restrictions has been accelerated in accordance with this Section 9.4(b)), of an amount that is equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit Award surrendered at the effective time of the Change in Control. The Committee may, in its discretion, also provide for one or more of the foregoing alternatives in any particular Agreement. 
9.5 Treatment of Dividends. At the time an Award of Shares of Restricted Stock is granted, the Committee may, in its discretion, determine that the payment to the Grantee of dividends, or a specified portion thereof, declared or paid on such Shares by the Company shall be (a) deferred until the lapsing of the restrictions imposed upon such Shares and (b) held by the Company for the account of the Grantee until such time. In the event that dividends are to be deferred, the Committee shall, in its discretion, determine whether such dividends are to be reinvested in Shares (which shall be held as additional Shares of Restricted Stock) or held in cash, or, if such dividends are paid in Shares, whether the Shares shall be deposited with the Company and subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid. If deferred dividends are to be held in cash, there may be credited at the end of each year (or portion thereof) interest on the amount of the account at the beginning of the year at a rate per annum as the Committee may, in its discretion, determine. Payment of deferred dividends in respect of Shares of Restricted Stock (whether held in cash or as additional Shares of Restricted Stock), together with interest accrued thereon, if any, shall be made upon the lapsing of restrictions imposed on the Shares in respect of which the deferred dividends were paid, and any dividends deferred (together with any interest accrued thereon) in respect of any Shares of Restricted Stock shall be forfeited upon the forfeiture of such Shares. Shares underlying Restricted Stock Units shall be entitled to dividends or dividend equivalents only to the extent and under the terms provided by the Committee. 
9.6 Delivery of Shares. Upon the lapse of the restrictions on Shares of Restricted Stock and upon the vesting of Restricted Stock Units, the Committee shall cause a stock certificate to be promptly delivered to the Grantee with respect to such Shares, free of the restrictions set forth in this Section 9. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may impose such additional restrictions as it may deem advisable, including, but not limited to, restrictions related to applicable federal securities laws, the requirements of any national securities exchange or system upon which Shares are then listed or traded, or any blue sky or state securities laws. 
10. Performance Awards. 
10.1 Performance Units. The Committee may, in its discretion, grant Awards of Performance Units to Eligible Individuals, the terms and conditions of which shall be set forth in an Agreement. Performance Units may be denominated in Shares or a specified dollar amount and, contingent upon the attainment of specified Performance Objectives within the Performance Cycle, represent the right to receive payment as provided in Section 10.3(c) of (i) in the case of Share-denominated Performance Units, the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Performance Unit was granted, the date the Performance Unit became vested or any other date specified by the Committee in its discretion, (ii) in the case of dollar-denominated Performance Units, the specified dollar amount or (iii) a percentage (which may be more than one hundred percent (100%)) of the amount described in clause (i) or (ii) depending on the level of Performance Objective attainment; provided, however, that, the Committee may, in its discretion, at the time a Performance Unit is granted specify a maximum amount payable in respect of a vested Performance Unit. Each Agreement shall specify the number of Performance Units to which it relates, the Performance Objectives which must be satisfied in order for the Performance Units to vest and the Performance Cycle within which such Performance Objectives must be satisfied. 
(a) Vesting and Forfeiture. Subject to Sections 10.3(c) and 10.4, a Grantee shall become vested with respect to the Performance Units to the extent that the Performance Objectives set forth in the Agreement are satisfied for the Performance Cycle.  (b) Payment of Awards. Subject to Section 10.3(c), payment to Grantees in respect of vested Performance Units shall be made as soon as practicable after the last day of the Performance Cycle to which such Award relates unless the Agreement evidencing the Award provides for the deferral of payment, in which event the terms and conditions of the deferral shall be set forth in the Agreement. Subject to Section 10.4, such payments may be made entirely in Shares valued at their Fair Market Value, entirely in cash, or in such combination of Shares and cash as the Committee shall, in its discretion, determine at any time prior to such payment; provided, however, that if the Committee in its discretion determines to make such payment entirely or partially in Shares of Restricted Stock, the Committee must determine the extent to which such payment will be in Shares of Restricted Stock and the terms of such Restricted Stock at the time the Award is granted. 
10.2 Performance Shares. The Committee may, in its discretion, grant Awards of Performance Shares to Eligible Individuals, the terms and conditions of which shall be set forth in an Agreement. Each Agreement may require that an appropriate legend be placed on Share certificates. Awards of Performance Shares shall be subject to the following terms and provisions: 
(a) Rights of Grantee. The Committee shall provide at the time an Award of Performance Shares is made the time or times at which the actual Shares represented by such Award shall be issued in the name of the Grantee; provided, however, that no Performance Shares shall be issued until the Grantee has, to the extent required by the Committee and in the manner specified by the Committee, executed an Agreement evidencing the Award, the appropriate blank stock powers and, in the discretion of the Committee, an escrow agreement and any other documents which the Committee may require as a condition to the issuance of such Performance Shares. If a Grantee shall fail, to the extent required by the Committee, to execute the Agreement evidencing an Award of Performance Shares, the appropriate blank stock powers and, in the discretion of the Committee, an escrow agreement and any other documents which the Committee may require within the time period prescribed by the Committee at the time the Award is granted, the Award shall be null and void. At the discretion of the Committee, Shares issued in connection with an Award of Performance Shares shall be deposited together with the stock powers with an escrow agent (which may be the Company) designated by the Committee. Except as restricted by the terms of the Agreement, upon delivery of the Shares to the escrow agent, the Grantee shall have, in the discretion of the Committee, all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to such Shares, including the right to vote the Shares and to receive all dividends or other distributions paid or made with respect to the Shares. 
(b) Non-Transferability. Until any restrictions upon the Performance Shares awarded to a Grantee shall have lapsed in the manner set forth in Sections 10.2(c) or 10.4, such Performance Shares shall not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of and shall not be pledged or otherwise hypothecated, nor shall they be delivered to the Grantee. The Committee may, in its discretion, also impose such other restrictions and conditions on the Performance Shares, if any, as it deems appropriate. 
(c) Lapse of Restrictions. Subject to Section 10.3(c) and 10.4, restrictions upon Performance Shares awarded hereunder shall lapse and such Performance Shares shall become vested at such time or times and on such terms, conditions and satisfaction of Performance Objectives as the Committee may, in its discretion, determine at the time an Award is granted. 
(d) Treatment of Dividends. At the time the Award of Performance Shares is granted, the Committee may, in its discretion, determine that the payment to the Grantee of dividends, or a specified portion thereof, declared or paid on Shares represented by such Award which have been issued by the Company to the Grantee shall be (i) deferred until the lapsing of the restrictions imposed upon such Performance Shares and (ii) held by the Company for the account of the Grantee until such time. In the event that dividends are to be deferred, the Committee shall determine whether such dividends are to be reinvested in Shares (which shall be held as additional Performance Shares) or held in cash or, if such dividends are paid in Shares, whether the Shares shall be deposited with the Company and subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the Performance Shares with respect to which they were paid. If deferred dividends are to be held in cash, there may be credited at the end of each year (or portion thereof) interest on the amount of the account at the beginning of   the year at a rate per annum as the Committee may, in its discretion, determine. Payment of deferred dividends in respect of Performance Shares (whether held in cash or in additional Performance Shares), together with interest accrued thereon, if any, shall be made upon the lapsing of restrictions imposed on the Performance Shares in respect of which the deferred dividends were paid, and any dividends deferred (together with any interest accrued thereon) in respect of any Performance Shares shall be forfeited upon the forfeiture of such Performance Shares. 
(e) Delivery of Shares. Upon the lapse of the restrictions on Performance Shares awarded hereunder, the Committee shall cause a stock certificate to be delivered to the Grantee with respect to such Shares, free of all restrictions hereunder. 
10.3 Performance Objectives. 
(a) Establishment. Performance Objectives for Performance Awards may be based on and expressed in terms of one or more business criteria, including, without limitation, the following critiera: (i) revenue, (ii) net income, (iii) operating income, (iv) earnings, (v) net earnings, (vi) Share price, (vii) cash flow, (viii) EBITDA, (ix) total shareholder return, (x) total shareholder return relative to peers, (xi) financial returns (including, without limitation, return on assets, return on equity and return on investment), (xii) cost reduction targets, (xiii) customer satisfaction, (xiv) customer growth, (xv) employee satisfaction, (xvi) pre-tax profits, (xvii) net earnings, or (xiii) any combination of the foregoing. Performance Objectives (and underlying business criteria, as applicable) may be in respect of: (i) the performance of the Company, (ii) the performance of any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) the performance of any of its Divisions, (iv) a per Share basis, (v) a per subscriber basis, (vi) any other metric or measure determined by the Committee, or (vii) any combination of the foregoing. Performance Objectives may be absolute or relative (to prior performance of the Company or to the performance of one or more other entities or external indices) and may be expressed in terms of a progression within a specified range. The formula for determining Performance Objectives may include or exclude items to measure specific objectives, such as losses from discontinued operations, extraordinary, unusual or nonrecurring gains and losses, the cumulative effect of accounting changes, acquisitions or divestitures, core process redesigns, structural changes/outsourcing, and foreign exchange impacts. 
(b) Effect of Certain Events. At the time of the granting of a Performance Award, or at any time thereafter, the Committee may, in its discretion, provide for the manner in which performance will be measured against the Performance Objectives (or may adjust the Performance Objectives) to reflect the impact of specified corporate transactions, accounting or tax law changes and other extraordinary or nonrecurring events. 
10.4 Effect of Change in Control. In the event of a Change in Control, unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its discretion and set forth in the Agreement evidencing the Award or in an employment agreement between the Grantee and the Company, and subject to the provisions of Section 12.2, upon (i) the termination by the Company, Subsidiary, or Affiliate of the Optionee's employment other than for Cause, during the thirteen (13) month period following the Change in Control (taking into account the deemed termination provisions of the last paragraph of such definition) or (ii) the termination of the Optionee's employment for Good Reason, during the thirteen (13) month period following the Change in Control (taking into account the deemed termination provisions of the last paragraph of such definition). 
(a) With respect to Performance Units, the Grantee shall (i) become vested in all outstanding Performance Units as if all Performance Objectives had been satisfied at the maximum level and (ii) be entitled to receive in respect of all Performance Units which become vested as a result of a Change in Control a cash payment within ten (10) days after termination of employment. 
(b) With respect to Performance Shares, all restrictions shall lapse immediately on all outstanding Performance Shares as if all Performance Objectives had been satisfied at the maximum level. 
(c) The Agreements evidencing Performance Shares and Performance Units shall provide for the treatment of such Awards (or portions thereof), if any, which do not become vested as the result of a Change in Control, including, but not limited to, provisions for the adjustment of applicable Performance Objectives.  (d) Notwithstanding the above, except as otherwise provided in an Agreement or employment agreement between the Grantee and the Company, the Committee may, in its discretion, do one or more of the following: (i) arrange to have the surviving or successor entity assume the Performance Units or Performance Shares or grant replacement Performance Units or Performance Shares, as applicable, with appropriate adjustments so that such Awards or their replacements either (x) represent the right to receive cash or Shares as may be payable as a result of a Change in Control with respect to the amount of cash or Shares receivable upon the vesting of the Performance Units or Performance Shares had such vesting occurred in full prior to such Change in Control, or (y) represent the right to receive equity securities of the surviving or successor entity, but only if such equity securities are actively traded on an established securities market, or (ii) cancel the Performance Units or Performance Shares upon the payment to the Grantees in cash with respect to each such Award to the extent then otherwise payable in cash and/or securities of the surviving or successor entity (but only if such securities are actively traded on an established securities market) or in Shares (including any Awards as to which vesting or lapse of restrictions has taken place in accordance with (a) and (b) of this Section 10), of an amount, with respect to Performance Units, that is equal to the amount of cash payable as if all Performance Objectives had been satisfied at the maximum level, and, with respect to Performance Shares, that is equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares payable as if all Performance Objectives had been satisfied at the maximum level. 
10.5 Non-Transferability. Until the vesting of Performance Units or the lapsing of any restrictions on Performance Shares, as the case may be, such Performance Units or Performance Shares shall not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of and shall not be pledged or otherwise hypothecated. 
11. Other Share Based Awards. 
11.1 Share Awards. The Committee may, in its discretion, grant a Share Award to any Eligible Individual on such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion. Share Awards may be made as additional compensation for services rendered by the Eligible Individual or may be in lieu of cash or other compensation to which the Eligible Individual is entitled from the Company. 
11.2 Phantom Stock Awards. 
(a) Grant. The Committee may, in its discretion, grant shares of Phantom Stock to any Eligible Individual. Such Phantom Stock shall be subject to the terms and conditions established by the Committee in its discretion and set forth in the applicable Agreement. 
(b) Payment of Awards. Upon the vesting of a Phantom Stock Award, the Grantee shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in respect of each share of Phantom Stock which shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the date the Phantom Stock Award was granted, or such other date as determined by the Committee in its discretion at the time the Phantom Stock Award was granted. The Committee may, in its discretion, at the time a Phantom Stock Award is granted, provide a limitation on the amount payable in respect of each share of Phantom Stock. In lieu of a cash payment, the Committee may, in its discretion, settle Phantom Stock Awards with Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the cash payment to which the Grantee has become entitled. 
12. Effect of a Termination of Employment. 
12.1 The Agreement evidencing the grant of each Option and each Award shall set forth the terms and conditions applicable to such Option or Award upon a termination or change in the status of the employment of the Optionee or Grantee by the Company, a Subsidiary or a Division (including a termination or change by reason of the sale of a Subsidiary or a Division), which shall be as the Committee may, in its discretion, determine at the time the Option or Award is granted or thereafter. In addition, such terms and conditions may be set forth in an Agreement or employment agreement between the Eligible Individual and the Company.  12.2 Excise Tax Limitation. 
(a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the contrary, except as otherwise provided in an Agreement or employment agreement between the Eligible Individual and the Company, to the extent that any payment, distribution or acceleration of vesting to or for the benefit of the Optionee or Grantee by the Company (within the meaning of Code Section 280G and the regulations thereunder), whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Plan or otherwise (the "Total Payments") is or will be subject to the excise tax imposed under Code Section 4999 (the "Excise Tax"), then the Total Payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) if and to the extent that a reduction in the Total Payments would result in the Optionee or Grantee retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax basis (taking into account federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax), than if the Optionee or Grantee received the entire amount of such Total Payments. Unless the Optionee or Grantee shall have given prior written notice specifying a different order to the Company to effectuate the foregoing, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the Total Payments, by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the Total Payments which are payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating non-cash payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits which are to be paid the farthest in time from the Determination (as hereinafter defined). Any notice given by the Optionee or Grantee pursuant to the preceding sentence shall take precedence over the provisions of any other plan, arrangement or agreement governing the Executive's rights and entitlements to any benefits or compensation. 
(b) The determination of whether the Total Payments shall be reduced as provided in Section 12.2(a) and the amount of such reduction shall be made at the Company's expense by an accounting firm selected by the Optionee or Grantee from among the four largest accounting firms in the United States or at the Optionee's or Grantee's expense by an attorney selected by the Optionee or Grantee. Such accounting firm or attorney (the "Determining Party") shall provide its determination (the "Determination"), together with detailed supporting calculations and documentation to the Company and the Optionee or Grantee within ten (10) days of the termination of Optionee's or Grantee's employment. If the Determining Party determines that no Excise Tax is payable by the Optionee or Grantee with respect to the Total Payments, it shall furnish the Optionee or Grantee with an opinion reasonably acceptable to the Optionee or Grantee that no Excise Tax will be imposed with respect to any such payments and, absent manifest error, such Determination shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and the Optionee or Grantee. If the Determining Party determines that an Excise Tax would be payable, the Company shall have the right to accept the Determination of the Determining Party as to the extent of the reduction, if any, pursuant to Section 12.2(a), or to have such Determination reviewed by an accounting firm selected by the Company, at the Company's expense. If the Company's accounting firm and the Determining Party do not agree, a third accounting firm shall be jointly chosen by the Determining Party and the Company, at the Company's expense, in which case the determination of such third accounting firm shall be binding, final and conclusive upon the Company and the Optionee or Grantee. 
13. Adjustment Upon Changes in Capitalization. 
(a) In the event of a Change in Capitalization, the Committee shall conclusively determine the appropriate proportional adjustments to (i) the maximum number and class of Shares or other stock or securities with respect to which Options or Awards may be granted under the Plan, (ii) the maximum number and class of Shares or other stock or securities with respect to which Options or Awards may be granted to any Eligible Individual in any one calendar year period, (iii) the number and class of Shares or other stock or securities or other property (including cash) which are subject to outstanding Options or Awards granted under the Plan and the exercise price therefor, if applicable, (iv) for Stock Appreciation Rights unrelated to an Option, the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date the Stock Appreciation Right was granted, and (v) the Performance Objectives. 
(b) Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 13 in respect of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights that are Non-409A Awards shall be made only to the extent consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v) or a successor provision.  (c) If, by reason of a Change in Capitalization, a Grantee of an Award shall be entitled to, or an Optionee shall be entitled to exercise an Option with respect to, new, additional or different shares of stock or securities of the Company or any other corporation, such new, additional or different shares shall thereupon be subject to all of the conditions, restrictions and performance criteria which were applicable to the Shares subject to the Award or Option, as the case may be, prior to such Change in Capitalization. 
14. Effect of Certain Transactions. 
Subject to Sections 6.4, 7.7, 9.4(b), and 10.4 or as otherwise provided in an Agreement or employment agreement between the Eligible Individual and the Company, in the event of (a) the liquidation or dissolution of the Company or (b) a merger or consolidation of the Company (a "Transaction") that does not constitute a Change in Control, the Plan and each Option and Award issued hereunder shall continue in effect in accordance with their respective terms, except that the Committee may, in its discretion, do one or more of the following: (i) shorten the period during which Options and Awards are exercisable (provided they remain exercisable for at least thirty (30) days after the date on which notice of such shortening is given to the Optionees or Grantees); (ii) accelerate the vesting schedule or the lapse of any restrictions with respect to Options and Awards, (iii) arrange to have the surviving or successor entity assume the Options and Awards or grant replacement Options and Awards with appropriate adjustments in the exercise prices, and adjustments in the number and kind of securities issuable upon exercise or lapse of restrictions or adjustments so that the Options and Awards or their replacements represent the right to purchase or receive the stock, securities or other property (including cash) as may be issuable or payable as a result of such Transaction with respect to or in exchange for the number of Shares purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the Options and Awards had such exercise occurred in full prior to the Transaction, or (iv) with the prior written consent of the Optionee or Grantee (unless otherwise stated in the Agreement), cancel the Options and Awards upon the payment to the Grantees in cash (A) with respect to each Option and Award to the extent exercisable for or payable in Shares, of an amount that is equal to the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Award or portion thereof over the aggregate exercise price for such Shares under the Award or portion thereof surrendered at the effective time of the Transaction, or (B) with respect to each Award to the extent not exercisable for or payable in Shares, of an amount that is equal to the cash value of the Award or portion thereof surrendered at the effective time of the Transaction. The Committee may, in its discretion, also provide for one or more of the following alternatives in any particular Agreement. The treatment of any Option or Award as provided in this Section 14 shall be conclusively presumed to be appropriate for purposes of Section 10. 
15. Interpretation. 
The Plan is intended to comply with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and the Committee shall interpret and administer the provisions of the Plan or any Agreement in a manner consistent therewith. Any provisions inconsistent with such Rule shall be inoperative and shall not affect the validity of the Plan. 
16. Successors; Binding Agreement. 
This Plan shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Company, its Successors and Assigns, and the Company shall require any Successors and Assigns to expressly assume and agree to comply with the terms of the Plan in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession or assignment had taken place.  17. Termination and Amendment of the Plan or Modification of Options and Awards.
17.1 Plan Amendment or Termination. The Plan shall terminate as of the tenth (10th) anniversary of January 29, 2019 (the date of its adoption by the Board) and no Option or Award may be granted thereafter. The Board may sooner terminate the Plan and the Board may at any time and from time to time amend, modify or suspend the Plan; provided, however, that: 
(a) no such amendment, modification, suspension or termination shall impair or adversely alter in any material respect any Options or Awards theretofore granted under the Plan, except with the consent of the Optionee or Grantee, nor shall any amendment, modification, suspension or termination deprive any Optionee or Grantee of any Shares which he or she may have acquired through or as a result of the Plan; and 
(b) to the extent necessary under any applicable law, regulation or exchange requirement, no amendment shall be effective unless approved by the stockholders of the Company in accordance with applicable law, regulation or exchange requirement. 
17.2 Modification of Options and Awards. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, no modification of an Option or Award shall adversely alter or impair in any material respect any of the Participant's rights or the Company's obligations under the Option or Award without the consent of the Optionee or Grantee, as the case may be. 
18. Non-Exclusivity of the Plan. 
The adoption of the Plan by the Board shall not be construed as amending, modifying or rescinding any previously approved incentive arrangement or as creating any limitations on the power of the Board to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may deem desirable, including, without limitation, the granting of stock options otherwise than under the Plan, and such arrangements may be either applicable generally or only in specific cases. 
19. Regulations and Other Approvals; Governing Law; Jury Trial Waiver. 
19.1 Except as to matters of federal law, the Plan and the rights of all persons claiming hereunder shall be construed and determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles thereof. 
19.2 Unless otherwise specified in an applicable Agreement, any suit, action or proceeding with respect to this Plan or any Award Agreement, or any judgment entered by any court of competent jurisdiction in respect of any thereof, shall be brought in any Court in St. Louis County, Missouri, and the Company and each Participant shall submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of any such suit, action, proceeding or judgment. The Company and each Participant shall irrevocably waive any objections which he, she or it may have to the laying of the venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Plan or any Award Agreement brought in any Court in St. Louis County, Missouri, and shall further irrevocably waive any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in any inconvenient forum. The Company and each Participant shall waive any right he, she or it may have to trial by jury in respect of any litigation based on, arising out of, under or in connection with this Plan or any Award Agreement or any course of conduct, course of dealing, verbal or written statement or action of any party to any Award Agreement or relating to this Plan in any way. 
19.3 The obligation of the Company to sell or deliver Shares with respect to Options and Awards granted under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including all applicable federal and state securities laws, and the obtaining of all such approvals by governmental agencies as may be deemed necessary or appropriate by the Committee in its discretion. 
19.4 The Board may make such changes as may be necessary or appropriate to comply with the rules and regulations of any government authority.  19.5 Each Option and Award is subject to the requirement that, if at any time the Committee determines, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of Shares issuable pursuant to the Plan is required by any securities exchange or under any state or federal law, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the grant of an Option or Award or the issuance of Shares, no Options or Awards shall be granted or payment made or Shares issued, in whole or in part, unless listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval has been effected or obtained free of any conditions as acceptable to the Committee in its discretion. 
19.6 Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan or any Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the disposition of Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan is not covered by a then current registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and is not otherwise exempt from such registration, such Shares shall be restricted against transfer to the extent required by the Securities Act and Rule 144 or other regulations thereunder. The Committee may, in its discretion, require any individual receiving Shares pursuant to an Option or Award granted under the Plan, as a condition precedent to receipt of such Shares, to represent and warrant to the Company in writing that the Shares acquired by such individual are acquired without a view to any distribution thereof and will not be sold or transferred other than pursuant to an effective registration thereof under said Act or pursuant to an exemption applicable under the Securities Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The certificates evidencing any of such Shares shall be appropriately amended or have an appropriate legend placed thereon to reflect their status as restricted securities as aforesaid. 
20. Miscellaneous. 
20.1 Multiple Agreements. The terms of each Option or Award may differ from other Options or Awards granted under the Plan at the same time, or at some other time. The Committee may, in its discretion, also grant more than one Option or Award to a given Eligible Individual during the term of the Plan, either in addition to, or in substitution for, one or more Options or Awards previously granted to that Eligible Individual. 
20.2 Withholding of Taxes. 
(a) At such times as an Optionee or Grantee recognizes taxable income in connection with the receipt of Shares or cash hereunder (a "Taxable Event"), the Optionee or Grantee shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the federal, state and local income taxes and other amounts as may be required by law to be withheld by the Company in connection with the Taxable Event (the "Withholding Taxes") prior to the issuance, or release from escrow, of such Shares or the payment of such cash. The Company shall have the right to deduct from any payment of cash to an Optionee or Grantee an amount equal to the Withholding Taxes in satisfaction of the obligation to pay Withholding Taxes. In satisfaction of the obligation to pay Withholding Taxes to the Company, the Optionee or Grantee may make a written election, which may be accepted or rejected in the discretion of the Committee, to have withheld a portion of the Shares then issuable to him or her having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, in its discretion, provide that an Optionee or Grantee shall not be entitled to exercise or receive an Award, as applicable, for which cash has not been provided by the Optionee or Grantee with respect to the Withholding Taxes applicable to such Award. 
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Options have been transferred pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.1 the Optionee shall provide the Company with funds sufficient to pay such tax withholding when such withholding is due. Furthermore, if such Optionee does not satisfy the applicable tax withholding obligation, the transferee may provide the funds sufficient to enable the Company to pay the tax withholding. However, if Options have been transferred, the Company shall have no right to retain or sell without notice, or to demand surrender from the transferee of, Shares in order to pay such tax withholding. 
(c) Required Consent to and Notification of Code Section 83(b) Election. No election under Code Section 83(b) (to include in gross income in the year of transfer the amounts specified in Code Section 83(b) or   under a similar provision of the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States may be made unless expressly permitted by the terms of the Award document or by action of the Committee in writing prior to the making of such election. In any case in which a Participant is permitted to make such an election in connection with an Award, the Participant shall notify the Company of such election within ten (10) days of filing notice of the election with the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental authority, in addition to any filing and notification required pursuant to regulations issued under Code Section 83(b) or other applicable provision. 
(d) Requirement of Notification Upon Disqualifying Disposition Under Code Section 421(b). If any Participant shall make any disposition of Shares delivered pursuant to the exercise of an ISO under the circumstances described in Code Section 421(b) (i.e., a disqualifying disposition), such Participant shall notify the Company of such disposition within ten (10) days thereof. 
20.3 Effective Date. The effective date of this Plan shall be as determined by the Board in its discretion, subject only to the approval by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the securities of the Company (i) pursuant to a written consent or (ii) present, or represented, and entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders duly held, in either case in accordance with the applicable laws of the State of Delaware within thirteen (13) months of the adoption of the Plan by the Board. If any Awards are granted under the Plan before the date of such shareholder approval, such Awards automatically shall be granted subject to such approval. 
20.4 Certain Limitations on Awards to Ensure Compliance with Code Section 409A. For purposes of this Plan, references to an Option or Award term or event (including any authority or right of the Company or a Participant) being "permitted" under Code Section 409A mean, for a 409A Award, that the term or event will not cause the Participant to be liable for payment of interest or a tax penalty under Code Section 409A and, for a Non-409A Award, that the term or event will not cause the Award to be treated as subject to Code Section 490A. Other provisions of the Plan notwithstanding, the terms of any 409A Award and any Non-409A Award, including any authority of the Company and rights of the Participant with respect to the Award, shall be limited to those terms permitted under Code Section 409A, and any terms not permitted under Code Section 409A shall be automatically modified and limited to the extent necessary to conform with Code Section 409A. For this purpose, other provisions of the Plan notwithstanding, the Company shall have no authority to accelerate distributions relating to 409A Awards in excess of authority permitted under Code Section 409A, and any distribution subject to Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i)(separation from service) to a "specified employee" as defined under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i), shall not occur earlier than the earliest time permitted under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i). The Company shall have no liability to a Participant, or any other party, if an Award that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with, Code Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Committee or the Company and, in the event that any amount or benefit under the Plan becomes subject to penalties under Section 409A, responsibility for payment of such penalties shall rest solely with the affected Participant(s) and not with the Company. 
20.5 Certain Limitations Relating to Accounting Treatment of Awards. Other provisions of the Plan notwithstanding, the Committee's authority under the Plan is limited to the extent necessary to ensure that any Option or other Award of a type that the Committee has intended to be subject to fixed accounting with a measurement date at the date of grant or the date performance conditions are satisfied under FAS 123(R) shall not become subject to "variable" accounting solely due to the existence of such authority. 
20.6 Company Recoupment of Awards. A Participant's rights with respect to any Option or Award hereunder shall in all events be subject to (i) any right that the Company may have under any Company recoupment policy (including the Charter Communications Compensation Recovery Policy, as amended from time to time), or other agreement or arrangement with an individual, or (ii) any right or obligation that the Company may have regarding the clawback of "incentive-based compensation" under Section 10D of the Exchange Act and any applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder from time to time by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  20.7 Awards to Participants Outside the United States. The Committee may modify the terms of any Award under the Plan made to or held by a Participant who is then resident or primarily employed outside of the United States in any manner deemed by the Committee to be necessary or appropriate in order that such Award shall conform to laws, regulations, and customs of the country in which the Participant is then resident or primarily employed, or so that the value and other benefits of the Award to the Participant, as affected by foreign tax laws and other restrictions applicable as a result of the Participant's residence or employment abroad shall be comparable to the value of such an Award to a Participant who is resident or primarily employed in the United States. An Award may be modified under this Section 20.7 in a manner that is inconsistent with the express terms of the Plan, so long as such modifications will not contravene any applicable law or regulation or result in actual liability under Section 16(b) for the Participant whose Award is modified. 
20.8 Payments in the Event of Forfeitures; Fractional Shares. No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award. The Committee shall determine whether cash, other Awards or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of such fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated. 
20.9 Right of Setoff. The Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, deduct from and set off against any amounts the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate may owe to the Participant from time to time (including amounts payable in connection with any Award that are owed as wages, fringe benefits, or other compensation owed to the Participant), such amounts as may be owed by the Participant to the Company, although the Participant shall remain liable for any part of the Participant's payment obligation not satisfied through such deduction and setoff; provided, however, that no such setoff may be made if such setoff would result in the imposition of penalties under Code Section 409A. By accepting any Award granted hereunder, the Participant agrees to any deduction or setoff under this Section 20.9. 
20.10 Unfunded Status of Awards; Creation of Trusts. To the extent that any Award is deferred compensation, the Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for deferred compensation with respect to such Award. With respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant or obligation to deliver Stock pursuant to an Award, nothing contained in the Plan or any Agreement shall give any Participant the right to any specific assets or securities of the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate. 
20.11 Conditions and Restrictions Upon Securities Subject to Awards. Each Participant to whom an Award is made under the Plan shall (i) enter into an Agreement with the Company that shall contain such provisions consistent with the provisions of the Plan, as may be approved by the Committee and (ii) to the extent the Award is made at a time prior to the date Shares are not listed for trading on an established securities exchange, enter into a "Stockholder's Agreement" that is substantially similar in all material respect to any stockholder's agreement entered into by any other employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Award of any equity-based compensation. The Committee may provide that the Shares issued upon exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or otherwise subject to or issued under an Award shall be subject to such further agreements, restrictions, conditions or limitations as the Committee in its discretion may specify prior to the exercise of such Option or Stock Appreciation Right or the grant, vesting or settlement of such Award, including without limitation, conditions on vesting or transferability, forfeiture or repurchase provisions and method of payment for the Shares issued upon exercise, vesting or settlement of such Award (including the actual or constructive surrender of Shares already owned by the Participant) or payment of taxes arising in connection with an Award. Without limiting the foregoing, such restrictions may address the timing and manner of any resales by the Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any Shares issued under an Award, including without limitation (i) restrictions under an insider trading policy or pursuant to applicable law, (ii) restrictions designed to delay and/or coordinate the timing and manner of sales by Participant and holders of other Company equity compensation arrangements, (iii) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers and (iv) provisions requiring Shares to be sold on the open market or to the Company in order to satisfy tax withholding or other obligations.  20.12 Compliance with Laws and Regulations. This Plan, the grant, issuance, vesting, exercise and settlement of Options and Awards thereunder, and the obligation of the Company to sell, issue or deliver Shares under such Options and Awards, shall be subject to all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, stock exchange rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental or regulatory agency as may be required. The Company shall not be required to register in a Participant's name or deliver any Shares prior to the completion of any registration or qualification of such Shares under any foreign, federal, state or local law or any ruling or regulation of any government body which the Committee shall determine to be necessary or advisable. To the extent the Company is unable to or the Committee deems it infeasible to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, the Company and its Affiliates shall be relieved of any liability with respect to the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. No Option shall be exercisable and no Shares shall be issued and/or transferable under any Option or Award unless a registration statement with respect to the Shares underlying such Option or Award is effective and current or the Company has determined that such registration is unnecessary. References in this Plan to a particular law, rule or regulation shall be deemed to include all subsequent amendments, modifications and interpretations as well as any successor provision thereto. 
20.13 Deferral of Gains. The Committee may, in an Agreement or otherwise, provide for the deferred delivery of Shares upon settlement, vesting or other events with respect to an Award (other than an Option or Stock Appreciation Right). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event will any deferral of the delivery of Shares or any other payment with respect to any Award be allowed if the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the deferral would result in the imposition of the additional tax under Code Section 409A(a)(1)(B). 
20.14 No Effect on Employment or Service. Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate any Participant's employment or service at any time, for any reason and with or without cause. 
20.15 Participation. No person shall have the right to be selected to receive an Award under this Plan, or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive a future Award. The Committee's determination under the Plan (including, without limitation, determination of the Eligible Employees who shall be granted Awards, the form, amount and timing of such Awards, the terms and provisions of Awards and the Agreements and the establishment of Performance Objectives) need not be uniform and may be made by it selectively among Eligible Employees who receive or are eligible to receive Awards under the Plan, ether or not such Eligible Employees are similarly situated. 
20.16 No Rights as Stockholder. No Participant (nor any beneficiary) shall have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company with respect to any Shares issuable pursuant to an Award (or exercise thereof), unless and until certificates representing such Shares shall have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Participant (or beneficiary). 
20.17 Gender and Number. Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine; the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural. 
20.18 Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan or of any Award Agreement shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan or the Award Agreement, and the Plan and/or the Award Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. 
20.19 Captions. Captions are provided herein for convenience only, and shall not serve as a basis for interpretation or construction of the Plan.  20.20 Other Benefits. No Award granted or paid out under this Plan shall be deemed compensation for purposes of computing benefits under any retirement plan of the Company or its Affiliates nor affect any benefits under any other benefit plan now or subsequently in effect under which the availability or amount of benefits is related to the level of compensation. 
20.21 Costs. The Company shall bear all expenses associated with administering this Plan, including expenses of issuing Shares pursuant to any Awards hereunder.
