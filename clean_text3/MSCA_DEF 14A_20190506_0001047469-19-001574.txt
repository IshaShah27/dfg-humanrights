PROXY STATEMENT  2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS  
      GENERAL INFORMATION         
        This proxy statement and accompanying proxy card is being mailed to the stockholders of Main Street Capital Corporation ("Main Street," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") beginning on March 25, 2019. Our Board of Directors, or the Board, is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held on May 6, 2019 at Hotel Emma, Cellar K, 136 East Grayson, San Antonio, Texas 78215, at 9:00 AM local time. The Company will bear all expenses incurred in connection with this proxy solicitation, which we expect to conduct primarily by mail. In addition, our officers and regular employees may solicit your proxy by telephone, by electronic means or in person, for which they will not be separately compensated. If your shares are held through a broker or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), we have requested that your broker or nominee forward this proxy statement to you and obtain your voting instructions, for which the Company will reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.   
        The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. 
        Brokers may be householding our proxy materials by delivering a single proxy statement and annual report to multiple stockholders sharing an address, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If you did not respond that you did not want to participate in householding, you were deemed to have consented to the process. If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual report, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement and annual report and wish to receive only one, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or us if you are a stockholder of record. You can notify us by sending a written request to: Main Street Capital Corporation, Corporate Secretary's Office, 1300 Post Oak Blvd., 8th Floor, Houston, Texas 77056, or by calling (713) 350-6000. In addition, we will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the annual report and proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered. 
    VOTING INFORMATION         
      Record Date and Who May Vote         
        Our Board of Directors selected March 6, 2019 as the record date (the "Record Date") for determining stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. This means that if you were a registered stockholder with our transfer agent and registrar, American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, on the Record Date, you may vote your shares on the matters to be considered by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting. If your shares were held in street name on that date, the broker or other nominee that was the record holder of your shares has the authority to vote them at the  Table of Contents
Annual Meeting in accordance with your instructions. They have forwarded to you this proxy statement seeking your instructions on how you want your shares voted. 
        On the Record Date, 61,888,278 shares of our common stock were outstanding. Each outstanding share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote on each matter to be acted on at the Annual Meeting. 
      How to Vote         
        For shares held of record, you can vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting or vote now by giving us your proxy. You may give us your proxy by completing the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed U.S. postage-prepaid envelope, or by calling a toll-free telephone number or using the Internet as further described on the enclosed proxy card. Telephone and Internet voting procedures have been designed to verify your identity through a personal identification or control number and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote using either of these electronic means, you will save us return mail expense. 
        By giving us your proxy, you will be directing us on how to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan on attending the Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote now by giving us your proxy. This will ensure that your vote is represented at the Annual Meeting. If you do attend the Annual Meeting, you can change your vote at that time, if you then desire to do so. 
        If your shares are held in street name, the broker or nominee that holds your shares has the authority to vote them, absent your approval, only as to routine matters, which, in the case of the Annual Meeting, only applies to the proposal to ratify our appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm. For all other matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting, the broker or nominee that holds your shares will need to obtain your authorization to vote those shares and has enclosed a voting instruction form with this proxy statement. In either case, they will vote your shares as you direct on their voting instruction form. You can vote by completing the enclosed voting instruction form and returning it in the enclosed U.S. postage-prepaid envelope. If you want to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your broker or nominee. You should refer to the instructions provided in the enclosed voting instruction form for further information. Additionally, the availability of telephone or Internet voting depends on the voting process used by the broker or nominee that holds your shares. 
        You may receive more than one proxy statement and proxy card or voting instruction form if your shares are held through more than one account (e.g., through different brokers or nominees). Each proxy card or voting instruction form only covers those shares of common stock held in the applicable account. If you hold shares in more than one account, you will have to provide voting instructions as to all your accounts to vote all your shares. 
      How to Revoke or Change Your Vote         
        For shares held of record, you may revoke a proxy or change your vote at any time before it is exercised by written notice to our Corporate Secretary, granting a new proxy or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. Unless you attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person, you should change your vote using the same method (by telephone, Internet or mail) that you first used to vote your shares. That way, the inspectors of election for the meeting will be able to verify your latest vote. 
        For shares held in street name, you should follow the instructions in the voting instruction form provided by your broker or nominee to change your vote. If you want to change your vote as to shares held in street name by voting in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from the broker or nominee that holds those shares for you.  Table of Contents
      Quorum         
        The Annual Meeting will be held only if a quorum exists. The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock as of the Record Date will constitute a quorum. If you attend the meeting or vote your shares using the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form (including any telephone or Internet voting procedures provided), your shares will be counted toward a quorum, even if you abstain from voting on a particular matter. 
      Broker Non-Votes         
        If you are the beneficial owner of shares held through a broker or other nominee and do not vote your shares or provide voting instructions, your broker may vote for you on routine proposals but not on non-routine proposals. Therefore, if you do not vote on the non-routine proposals or provide voting instructions, your broker will not be allowed to vote your shares—this will result in a broker non-vote. At the Annual Meeting, brokers will have discretionary authority to vote shares on the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm (ITEM 2), which is the only routine proposal to be presented at the Annual Meeting. If brokers exercise this discretionary voting authority on ITEM 2, such shares will be considered present at the Annual Meeting for quorum purposes and broker non-votes will occur as to each of the other proposals presented at the Annual Meeting (ITEMS 1, 3 and 4), which are considered non-routine. 
      Proposals to Be Voted on; Vote Required; and How Votes Are Counted         
        We are asking you to vote on the following:
         Election of Directors.    Directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, with respect to each director in an uncontested election, such that a nominee for director will be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast FOR the nominee's election exceed the votes cast AGAINST such nominee's election. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes cast for purposes of the election of directors and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of such election. Even if a nominee is not re-elected, he or she will remain in office as a director until his or her earlier resignation or removal. Each of the current director nominees has signed a letter of resignation that will be effective if the nominee is not re-elected at the Annual Meeting and the Board of Directors accepts his or her resignation following the meeting. If a nominee is not re-elected, the Board of Directors will decide whether to accept the director's resignation in accordance with the procedures listed in our Corporate Governance and Stock Ownership Guidelines, which are available at  http://mainstcapital.com under "Corporate Governance—Governance Docs" in the "Investors" section of our website.  
         Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.    The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, is required to ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm. Abstentions will not be included in determining the number of votes cast and, as a result, will not have any effect on the result of the vote on this item.  Table of Contents
         Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation.    The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, is required for the approval of the resolution in this proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be included in determining the number of votes cast and, as a result, will not have any effect on the result of the vote on this item. Even though your vote is advisory and therefore not binding on us, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
         Amendment of Our Charter.    The affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter is required to amend our Charter to allow our stockholders to amend our bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. For purposes of the vote to amend our Charter, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against this item. 
        We are not aware of any other matters that may be presented or acted on at the Annual Meeting. If you vote by signing and returning the enclosed proxy card or using the telephone or Internet voting procedures, the individuals named as proxies on the card may vote your shares, in their discretion, on any other matter requiring a stockholder vote that comes before the Annual Meeting. 
      Confidential Voting         
        All voted proxies and ballots will be handled to protect your voting privacy as a stockholder. Your vote will not be disclosed except: Table of Contents 
    ELECTION OF DIRECTORS   (ITEM 1)         
        Pursuant to our Charter, each member of our Board of Directors serves until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until his or her respective successor is duly elected and qualifies. Currently, our Board of Directors has ten members, of whom eight are not "interested persons" of Main Street, as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). The 1940 Act requires that our Board of Directors be composed of a majority of members who are not "interested persons" of Main Street. In addition, the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual requires that we maintain a majority of independent directors on the Board of Directors and provides that a director of a business development company, like us, shall be considered to be independent if he or she is not an "interested person" of the business development company, as defined in the 1940 Act. 
        The term of office of all directors will expire at this year's Annual Meeting. On the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the nomination of our Board of Directors, Ms. Valerie L. Banner and Messrs. Michael Appling Jr., Joseph E. Canon, Arthur L. French, J. Kevin Griffin, John E. Jackson, Brian E. Lane, Stephen B. Solcher, Vincent D. Foster and Dwayne L. Hyzak will stand for reelection as directors at the Annual Meeting. 
        Unless otherwise directed, the persons named as proxies on the enclosed proxy card intend to vote "FOR" the election of the nominees. If any nominee should become unable to serve or, for good cause, will not serve as a director, the shares will be voted for such substitute nominee as may be proposed by our Board of Directors. However, we are not aware of any circumstances that would prevent any of the nominees from serving. 
        Set forth below is certain information (as of the Record Date) with respect to the nominees for election as directors. In addition to the information presented below regarding each nominee's specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led our Board of Directors to the conclusion that he or she should serve as a director, we also believe that all of our director nominees have a reputation for integrity, honesty and adherence to high ethical standards. They each have demonstrated business acumen and an ability to exercise sound judgment, as well as a commitment of service to Main Street and our Board of Directors. The business address of each nominee listed below is 1300 Post Oak Boulevard, 8th Floor, Houston, Texas 77056.  Table of Contents

        Since this is an uncontested election, directors will be elected by a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, such that a nominee for director will be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast FOR the nominee's election exceed the votes cast AGAINST such nominee's election. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes cast for purposes of the election of directors and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of such election. Even if a nominee is not re-elected, he or she will remain in office as a director until the earlier of the acceptance by the Board of Directors of his or her resignation or his or her removal. Each of the current director nominees has signed a letter of resignation that will be effective if the nominee is not re-elected at the Annual Meeting and the Board of Directors accepts his or her resignation following the meeting. If a nominee is not re-elected, the Board of Directors will decide whether to accept the director's resignation in accordance with the procedures listed in our Corporate Governance and Stock Ownership Guidelines, which are available at  http://mainstcapital.com under "Corporate Governance—Governance Docs" in the "Investors" section of our website.

        In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and our Corporate Governance and Stock Ownership Guidelines may be found at  http://mainstcapital.com under "Corporate Governance—Governance Docs" in the "Investors" section of our website and are available in print to any stockholder who requests a copy in writing. Our Board of Directors adopted the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics in order to establish policies, guidelines and procedures that promote ethical practices and conduct by Main Street and all its employees, officers and directors. All officers, directors and employees of Main Street are responsible for maintaining the level of integrity and for complying with the policies contained in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Each employee of Main Street is required to acknowledge that he or she has received, read and understands the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and agrees to observe the policies and procedures contained therein at the time of hire and annually thereafter. We intend to disclose any substantive amendments to, or waivers from, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics within four business days of the waiver or amendment through a posting on our website. The Corporate Governance and Stock Ownership Guidelines adopted by our Board of Directors establish our corporate governance principles and practices on a variety of topics, including the responsibilities, composition and functioning of the Board, responsibilities of management and interaction with the Board and stock ownership guidelines for management and Board members. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board assesses the Corporate Governance and Stock Ownership Guidelines periodically and makes recommendations to the Board on any changes to implement. 
      Director Independence         
        Our Board of Directors currently consists of ten members, eight of whom are classified under applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange as "independent" directors and under Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act as not "interested persons." Based on these independence standards and the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that the following directors are independent: 
Michael Appling Jr.  Valerie L. Banner  Joseph E. Canon  Arthur L. French  J. Kevin Griffin  John E. Jackson  Brian E. Lane  Stephen B. Solcher 
        Our Board of Directors considered certain portfolio investments and other transactions in which our independent directors may have had a direct or indirect interest, including the transactions, if any, described under the heading "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions" in evaluating each director's independence under the 1940 Act and applicable listing standards of the New York Stock  Table of Contents
Exchange, and the Board of Directors determined that no such transaction would impact the ability of any director to exercise independent judgment or impair his or her independence. 
      Communications with the Board         
        Stockholders or other interested persons may send written communications to the members of our Board of Directors, addressed to Board of Directors, c/o Main Street Capital Corporation, Corporate Secretary's Office, 1300 Post Oak Blvd., 8th Floor, Houston, Texas 77056. All communications received in this manner will be delivered to one or more members of our Board of Directors. 
      Board Leadership Structure         
        Mr. Foster currently serves as the Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors and, prior to November 2018, served as our Chief Executive Officer. In November 2018, in connection with a previously announced long-term succession plan, the Board of Directors elected Mr. Hyzak as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, succeeding Mr. Foster who continues to serve as Main Street's Executive Chairman. Mr. Foster is an "interested person" under Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act due to his current position with the Company as Executive Chairman. The Board believes that Mr. Foster is currently best situated to serve as Chairman of our Board of Directors given his history with the Company, his deep knowledge of the Company's business and his extensive experience in managing private debt and equity investments in lower middle market companies and debt investments in middle market companies. The Company's independent directors bring experience, oversight and expertise from outside the Company and industry, while Mr. Foster brings Company-specific and industry-specific experience and expertise. The Board believes that the current leadership structure with Mr. Foster serving as Executive Chairman of the Board promotes strategy development and execution while facilitating effective, timely communication between management and the Board and is optimum for effective corporate governance. 
        Our Board of Directors has designated Arthur L. French as Lead Independent Director to preside over all executive sessions of non-management directors. In the Lead Independent Director's absence, the remaining non-management directors may appoint a presiding director by majority vote. The non-management directors meet in executive session without management on a regular basis. The Lead Independent Director also has the responsibility of consulting with management on Board and committee meeting agendas, acting as a liaison between management and the non-management directors, including maintaining frequent contact with the Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer and facilitating collaboration and communication between the non-management directors and management. Stockholders or other interested persons may send written communications to Arthur L. French, addressed to Lead Independent Director, c/o Main Street Capital Corporation, Corporate Secretary's Office, 1300 Post Oak Blvd., 8th Floor, Houston, Texas 77056. 
      Board of Directors and its Committees

All directors attended 100% of the meetings of the Board of Directors and of the committees on which they served during 2018, and all ten directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in person.

      Board and Committee Evaluation Process         
        Each year, our Board of Directors conducts a thorough self-assessment evaluation process. Detailed questionnaires solicit anonymous input from directors regarding the performance and effectiveness of the Board, Board committees, individual directors and interaction with management  Table of Contents and provide an opportunity for Board members to identify areas for improvement. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the results and feedback from this process and makes recommendations for improvements as appropriate. The Board has successfully used this process to evaluate Board and Board committee effectiveness and identify opportunities to strengthen the Board. 
      Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation         
        Each member of the Compensation Committee is independent for purposes of the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. During the year ended December 31, 2018, no member of the Compensation Committee was an officer, former officer or employee of ours or had a relationship disclosable under "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions," except as disclosed therein. No interlocking relationship, as defined by the rules adopted by the SEC, existed during the year ended December 31, 2018 between any member of the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and an executive officer of Main Street. 
      Director Nomination Process         
        Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has determined that a candidate for election to our Board of Directors must satisfy certain general criteria, including, among other things:
        The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to identify potential director candidates who will strengthen the Board of Directors and will contribute to the overall mix of general criteria identified above.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity; however, the Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believe that it is essential that the Board members represent diverse experience and viewpoints and a diverse mix of the specific criteria above. The process of identifying potential director candidates includes establishing procedures for soliciting and reviewing potential nominees from directors and for advising those who suggest nominees of the outcome of such review. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also has the authority to retain and terminate any search firm used to identify director candidates. 
        Any stockholder may nominate one or more persons for election as one of our directors at an annual meeting of stockholders if the stockholder complies with the notice, information and consent  Table of Contents provisions contained in our bylaws and any other applicable law, rule or regulation regarding director nominations.

No director nominee named in this proxy statement was nominated by stockholders.

Solcher had 797 unvested shares of restricted stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Please see the discussion of the assumptions made in the valuation of these awards in Note J to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the annual report accompanying this proxy statement.  
        The compensation for non-employee directors for 2018 was comprised of cash compensation paid to or earned by directors in connection with their service as a director. That cash compensation consisted of an annual retainer of $175,000, and an additional $42,500 retainer for the Lead Independent Director. Non-employee directors do not receive fees based on meetings attended absent circumstances that require an exceptionally high number of meetings within an annual period. We also reimburse our non-employee directors for all reasonable expenses incurred in connection with their service on our Board. The chairpersons and members of our Board committees received additional annual retainers for 2018 as follows:
        The Non-Employee Director Plan provides a means through which we may attract and retain qualified non-employee directors to enter into and remain in service on our Board of Directors. Under the Non-Employee Director Plan, at the beginning of each one-year term of service on our Board of Directors, each non-employee director receives a number of shares equivalent to $30,000 based on the closing price of a share of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (or other exchange on which our shares are then listed) on the date of grant. These shares are subject to forfeiture provisions that will lapse as to an entire award at the end of the one-year term. 
        In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved and adopted the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan. The 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan became effective on January 1, 2016 and replaced the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors previously adopted and approved by the Board in 2013. Under the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee directors and certain key employees may defer receipt of some or all of their cash compensation, subject to certain limitations. Individuals participating in the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan receive distributions of their respective balances based on predetermined payout schedules or other events as defined by the plan and are also able to direct investments made on their behalf among investment alternatives permitted from time to time under the plan, including phantom Main Street stock units for which shares of Main Street common stock will be issued upon distribution.

    COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS         
        The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis, or CD&A, provides information relating to the compensation of Main Street's Named Executive Officers, or NEOs, for 2018, who were:
        In November 2018, Main Street announced that in connection with its long-term succession plans, Mr. Hyzak was promoted to Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Mr. Foster in that role. Mr. Foster continues to serve as Main Street's Executive Chairman. Main Street also announced the promotion of Mr. Magdol to President in November 2018, succeeding Mr. Hyzak in that role. 
      Compensation Philosophy and Objectives         
        The Main Street compensation system was developed by the Compensation Committee and approved by all independent directors. The system is designed to attract and retain key executives, motivate them to achieve the Company's business objectives and reward them for performance while aligning management's interests with those of the Company's stockholders. The structure of Main Street's incentive compensation programs is formulated to encourage and reward the following, among other things:
        The Compensation Committee has the primary authority to establish compensation for the NEOs and other key employees and administers all executive compensation arrangements and policies. Main Street's Chief Executive Officer assists the Committee by providing recommendations regarding the compensation of NEOs and other key employees, excluding himself. The Committee exercises its discretion by modifying or accepting these recommendations. The Chief Executive Officer routinely attends a portion of the Committee meetings. However, the Committee often meets in executive session without the Chief Executive Officer or other members of management when discussing compensation matters and on other occasions as determined by the Committee. 
        The compensation packages for Main Street NEOs and other key employees are structured to reflect the Compensation Committee's commitment to corporate governance best practices and performance-oriented executive compensation. Specifically, the Compensation Committee has implemented the following practices for NEOs and other key employees: Table of Contents
        The Compensation Committee believes the above practices are appropriate in light of the Company's current objectives and compensation philosophies but reserves the right to re-visit these practices in the future as may be appropriate. The Compensation Committee takes into account competitive market practices with respect to the salaries and total direct compensation of the NEOs and other key employees. Members of the Committee consider market practices by reviewing public and non-public information for executives at comparable companies and funds. The Committee also has the authority to utilize compensation consultants to better understand competitive pay practices and has retained such expertise in the past. 
      Independent Compensation Consultant         
        The Compensation Committee has from time to time engaged independent compensation consultants to assist the Committee and provide advice on a variety of compensation matters relating to NEO, other key employee and independent director compensation, incentive compensation plans and compensation trends, best practices and regulatory matters. Any such compensation consultants are hired by and report directly to the Compensation Committee. Although compensation consultants may work directly with management on behalf of the Compensation Committee, any such work is under the control and supervision of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee did not retain any independent compensation consultants or pay any fees for compensation consulting services for fiscal 2018. 
      Assessment of Market Data         
        In assessing the competitiveness of executive compensation levels, the Compensation Committee analyzes market data of certain companies, including internally managed business development companies, or BDCs, private equity firms and other asset management and financial services companies. This analysis focuses on key elements of compensation practices in general, and more specifically, the compensation practices at companies and funds reasonably comparable in asset size, typical investment size and type, market capitalization and general business scope as compared to the Company. 
        As regards other internally managed BDCs like Main Street, the Compensation Committee considers the compensation practices and policies pertaining to executive officers as detailed in their company's respective proxies, research analysts' reports and other publicly available information. However, there are relatively few internally managed BDCs and none that are directly comparable to the Company as regards business strategies, assets under management, typical investment size and type and market capitalization. Moreover, regarding the compensation and retention of executive talent, the Company also competes with private equity funds, private credit funds, hedge funds and other types of specialized investment funds. Since these funds are generally private companies that are not required to publicly disclose their executive compensation practices and policies, the Committee relies on third-party compensation surveys as well as other available information to compare compensation practices and policies. 
        Items taken into account from comparable companies and funds include, but are not necessarily limited to, base compensation, bonus compensation, stock option awards, restricted stock awards, carried interest and other compensation. In addition to actual levels of cash and equity related compensation, the Compensation Committee also considers other approaches comparable companies are taking with regard to overall executive compensation practices. Such items include, but are not  Table of Contents necessarily limited to, the use of employment agreements for certain employees, the mix of cash and equity compensation, the use of third-party compensation consultants and certain corporate and executive performance measures that are established to achieve longer term total return for stockholders. Finally, in addition to analyzing comparable companies and funds, the Committee also evaluates the relative cost structure of the Company as compared to the entire BDC sector, including internally and externally managed BDCs, as well as other private funds. 
      Assessment of Company Performance         
        The Compensation Committee believes that sustained financial performance coupled with consistent stockholders' returns as well as proportional employee compensation are essential components for Main Street's long-term business success. Main Street typically makes three to seven-year investments in its portfolio companies. However, the Company's business plan involves taking on investment risks over a range of time periods. Accordingly, much emphasis is focused on maintaining the stability of net asset values as well as the continuity of earnings to pass through to stockholders in the form of recurring dividends. The quality of the earnings supporting the dividends as well as the maintenance and growth of dividends are key metrics in the Committee's assessment of financial performance. 
        Main Street's primary strategy is to generate current income from debt investments and to realize capital gains from equity-related investments. This income supports the payment of dividends to stockholders. The recurring payment of dividends requires a methodical investment acquisition approach and active monitoring and management of the investment portfolio over time. A meaningful part of the Company's employee base is dedicated to the maintenance of asset values and expansion of this recurring income to sustain and grow dividends. The Committee believes that stability of the management team is critical to achieving successful implementation of the Company's strategies. Further, the Committee, in establishing and assessing executive salary and performance incentives, is more focused on Main Street results as compared to its business objectives rather than the performance of Main Street relative to other comparable companies or industry metrics. 
      Executive Compensation Components         
        For 2018, the components of Main Street's direct compensation program for NEOs included:
        The Compensation Committee designs each NEO's direct compensation package to appropriately reward the NEO for his or her contribution to the Company. The judgment and experience of the Committee are weighed with individual and Company performance metrics and consultation with the Chief Executive Officer (except with respect to himself) to determine the appropriate mix of compensation for each individual. The Compensation Committee does not target a specific level of compensation relative to market practice, and only uses such data as a reference point when establishing compensation levels for NEOs. Cash compensation consisting of base salary and discretionary bonuses tied to achievement of individual performance goals that are reviewed and approved by the Committee, as well as corporate objectives, are intended to motivate NEOs to remain with the Company and work to achieve expected business objectives. Stock-based compensation is awarded based on performance expectations approved by the Committee for each NEO. The blend of short-term and long-term compensation may be adjusted from time to time to balance the Committee's views regarding the benefits of current cash compensation and appropriate retention incentives.  Table of Contents
   Base Salary  
        Base salary is used to recognize the experience, skills, knowledge and responsibilities required of the NEOs in their roles. In connection with establishing the base salary of each NEO, the Compensation Committee and management consider a number of factors, including the seniority and experience level of the individual, the functional responsibilities of the position, the experience level of the individual, the Company's ability to replace the executive, the past base salary of the individual and the relative number of well-qualified candidates available in the area. In addition, the Committee considers publicly available information regarding the base salaries paid to similarly situated executive officers and other competitive market practices. 
        The salaries of the NEOs are reviewed on an annual basis, as well as at the time of promotion or any substantial change in responsibilities. The key factors in determining increases in salary level are relative performance and competitive pressures. 
   Annual Cash Bonuses  
        Annual cash bonuses are intended to reward individual performance on an annual basis and can therefore be variable from year to year. Cash bonus awards for the NEOs are determined by the Compensation Committee on a discretionary basis based on performance criteria, particularly the Company's dividend performance as well as corporate and individual performance goals and other measures established by the Committee with the Chief Executive Officer's input (except with respect to his own performance criteria). Should actual performance exceed expected performance criteria, the Committee may adjust individual cash bonuses to take such superior performance into account. 
   Long-Term Incentive Awards  
        Main Street's Board of Directors and stockholders approved the 2015 Equity and Incentive Plan in May 2015 to provide stock-based awards as long-term incentive compensation to employees, including the NEOs. The Company uses stock-based awards to (i) attract and retain key employees, (ii) motivate employees by means of performance-related incentives to achieve long-range performance goals, (iii) enable employees to participate in the Company's long-term growth in value and (iv) link employees' compensation to the long-term interests of stockholders. At the time of each award, the Compensation Committee will determine the terms of the award, including any performance period (or periods) and any performance objectives relating to vesting of the award. Prior to the adoption of the 2015 Equity and Incentive Plan, stock-based awards to employees were made under and are governed by the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan. Terms of the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan are substantially similar to the 2015 Equity and Incentive Plan. After adoption of the 2015 Equity and Incentive Plan no further awards have been, or will be, granted under the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan. 
         Restricted Stock.    Main Street has received exemptive relief from the SEC that permits the Company to grant restricted stock in exchange for or in recognition of services by its executive officers and employees. Pursuant to the 2015 Equity and Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee may award shares of restricted stock to plan participants in such amounts and on such terms as the Committee determines in its sole discretion, provided that such awards are consistent with the conditions set forth in the SEC's exemptive order. Each restricted stock grant will be for a fixed number of shares as set forth in an award agreement between the grantee and Main Street. Award agreements will set forth time and/or performance vesting schedules and other appropriate terms and/or restrictions with respect to awards, including rights to dividends and voting rights. Beginning in 2015, the Committee awarded restricted stock awards to employees, including NEOs, which vest in equal increments over a three-year time frame based on continued service during the vesting period. The Committee's previous practice had been to award restricted stock to employees which vested over  Table of Contents a four-year time frame. The change to the vesting period was made to be more closely aligned with comparable companies. 
         Options.    The Compensation Committee may also grant stock options to purchase Main Street's common stock (including incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options). The Committee expects that any options granted will represent a fixed number of shares of common stock, will have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of common stock on the date of grant, and will be exercisable, or "vested," at some later time after grant. Certain stock options may provide for vesting based on the grantee remaining employed by Main Street for a time certain and/or the grantee and/or the Company attaining specified performance criteria. To date, the Committee has not granted stock options to any NEO. 
        For a discussion of our policies related to employee and director hedging of economic risk of owning our securities, please see "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management" beginning on page 38. 
   Other Benefits  
        Main Street's NEOs generally participate in the same benefit plans and programs as the Company's other employees, including comprehensive medical, dental and vision insurance, short term and long term disability insurance and life insurance. 
        Main Street maintains a 401(k) plan for all full-time employees who are at least 21 years of age through which the Company makes non-discretionary matching contributions to each participant's plan account on the participant's behalf. For each participating employee, the Company's contribution is a 100% match of the employee's contributions up to a 3% contribution level and a 50% match of the employee's contributions from a 3% to a 6% contribution level, with a maximum annual regular matching contribution of $12,375 during 2018. All contributions to the plan, including those made by the Company, vest immediately. The Board of Directors may also, at its sole discretion, provide that the Company will make additional contributions to employee 401(k) plan accounts, which would also vest immediately. 
        In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved and adopted the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan to allow non-employee directors and certain key employees, including each of the NEOs, to defer receipt of some or all of their cash compensation, subject to certain limitations. Although not currently anticipated and subject to prior Compensation Committee approval, discretionary employer contributions are also permitted to the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan. Individuals participating in the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan receive distributions of their respective balances based on predetermined payout schedules or other events as defined by the plan and are also able to direct investments made on their behalf among investment alternatives permitted from time to time under the plan, including phantom Main Street stock units for which shares of Main Street common stock will be issued upon distribution. The 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan became effective on January 1, 2016. 
        In November 2018, our Board of Directors approved a policy to allow certain individuals, including members of our board of directors, certain senior officers and NEOs, to personally use Company aircraft when such aircraft is not being used by the Company. All such personal usage, as well as any request to bring a family member or guest on a business trip, is subject to approval by the Company's CEO or Chairman of the Board and reimbursement of the Company by the individual in an amount equal to the aggregate incremental cost to the Company for such usage. The Company retains authority to determine what flights may be scheduled based on the business needs of the Company, and the business needs of the Company take priority in any scheduling conflicts.  Table of Contents
   Perquisites  
        The Company provides no other material benefits, perquisites or retirement benefits to the NEOs. 
      Potential Payments Upon Change in Control or Termination of Employment         
        Unless the terms of an award provide otherwise, in the event of a specified transaction involving a "change in control" (as defined in the 2015 Equity and Incentive Plan) in which there is an acquiring or surviving entity, the Board of Directors may provide for the assumption of some or all outstanding awards, or for the grant of substitute awards, by the acquirer or survivor. In the event no such assumption or substitution occurs, each stock-based award, subject to its terms, will become fully vested or exercisable prior to the change in control on a basis that gives the holder of the award a reasonable opportunity, as determined by the Board of Directors, to participate as a stockholder in the change in control following vesting or exercise. The award will terminate upon consummation of the change in control. 
        Transactions involving a "change in control" under the 2015 Equity and Incentive Plan include the following, other than where Main Street's stockholders continue to have substantially the same proportionate ownership in an entity which owns substantially all of Main Street's assets immediately following such transaction:
        Our restricted stock awards also provide that upon a participant's death, disability, involuntary termination without cause or voluntary termination with good reason (each as defined in the award agreement), the unvested shares of restricted stock will fully vest. The number of shares and value of unvested restricted stock for each NEO as of December 31, 2018 that would have vested under the acceleration scenarios described above is shown under "Compensation of Executive Officers—Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End." 
        In addition, NEOs who participate in the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan could receive a distribution of their balances in that plan in connection with their death, disability or termination of employment, depending on their distribution elections under the plan. The aggregate balance in the  Table of Contents
2015 Deferred Compensation Plan of each NEO as of December 31, 2018 is shown under "Compensation of Executive Officers—Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
        Other than the accelerated vesting of restricted stock and amounts due under the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan, we currently would not incur any other payment obligations to our NEOs in the event of a change in control or any of the aforementioned causes of termination of employment. 
      1940 Act Restrictions on Company Performance Based Compensation         
        The 1940 Act provides that a BDC such as Main Street may maintain either an equity incentive plan or a "profit-sharing plan", but not both, for its NEOs and other employees. The Compensation Committee believes that equity incentives closely align the interests of NEOs and employees with those of the Company's stockholders. Accordingly, Main Street has adopted and maintained equity incentive plans for its NEOs and employees since 2008. As a result, the 1940 Act prohibits Main Street from having a "profit-sharing plan." 
        The term "profit-sharing plan" is very broadly defined in the 1940 Act but in this context is generally viewed as referring to incentive and other compensation being directly tied to a company's gross or net income or any other indicia of the company's overall financial performance, such as realized gains or losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. In this regard, the SEC has indicated that a compensation program possesses profit-sharing characteristics if a company is obligated to make payments under the program based on company performance metrics. 
        Due to these restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, the Compensation Committee is not permitted to use nondiscretionary or formulaic Company performance goals or criteria to determine executive incentive compensation. Instead, the Committee considers overall Company performance along with other factors, including individual performance criteria, and uses its discretion in determining the appropriate compensation for NEOs and other key employees. The Compensation Committee's objective is to work within the 1940 Act regulatory framework to establish appropriate compensation levels, maintain pay-for-performance alignment and implement compensation best practices. 
      Tax Deductibility of Compensation         
        Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally disallows a deduction to public companies to the extent of excess annual compensation over $1 million paid to certain executive officers. Section 162(m) was amended and expanded by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted at the end of 2017. For amounts paid in 2018 and later years, the Section 162(m) deduction limit applies to an expanded group of current and former executive officers with limited exceptions. In addition, the exception for performance-based compensation is no longer available starting in 2018. Accordingly, annual cash bonuses paid for 2018 performance as well as equity awards granted in 2018 and later years are subject to the deduction limit of Section 162(m). Therefore, to the extent any of the covered executive officers are paid compensation in excess of $1 million for any year after 2017, Main Street generally cannot deduct such excess compensation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
        While the Compensation Committee considers the deductibility of compensation as one factor in determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee also considers other factors in making compensation decisions as noted herein and retains the flexibility to authorize amounts and forms of compensation that it determines to be consistent with the goals of our executive compensation program even if such compensation is not deductible by the Company for tax purposes. 
      Stockholder Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation         
        At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders provided an advisory vote with 91% of the votes cast approving our compensation philosophy, policies and procedures and the 2017  Table of Contents fiscal year compensation of our NEOs (the "Advisory Vote"). Subsequently, the Compensation Committee considered the results of the Advisory Vote in determining compensation policies and decisions of the Company. The Advisory Vote affected the Company's executive compensation decisions and policies by reaffirming the Company's compensation philosophies, and the Compensation Committee will continue to use these philosophies and past practice in determining future compensation decisions. 
      2018 Compensation Determination         
        The Compensation Committee analyzed the competitiveness of the components of compensation described above on both an individual and aggregate basis. The Committee believes that the total compensation paid to the NEOs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, is consistent with the overall objectives of Main Street's executive compensation program. 
   Base Salary  
        The Compensation Committee annually reviews the base salary of each executive officer, including each NEO, and determines whether or not to increase it in its sole discretion. Increases to base salary can be awarded to recognize, among other things, relative performance, relative cost of living and competitive pressures. 
        In 2018, the Compensation Committee approved base salary increases for each NEO in recognition each NEO's and the Company's performance for the year and also to more closely align each NEO's compensation with similar executive officers of comparable companies. 
        The amount of annual base salary paid to each NEO for 2018 is presented under the caption entitled "Compensation of Executive Officers—Summary Compensation Table." The Committee believes that the salary changes and resulting base salaries were competitive in the market place and appropriate for Main Street executives as a key component of an overall compensation package. 
   Annual Cash Incentive Bonus  
        Cash bonuses are determined annually by the Compensation Committee and are based on individual and corporate performance objectives coupled with Committee discretion as appropriate. The 2018 performance criteria used for determining the cash bonuses for NEOs included, among other things, the following:
        The Company paid cash bonuses to NEOs for 2018 performance in recognition of Main Street's strong financial results. The NEOs contributed significantly to the Company's performance. Major achievements considered by the Compensation Committee included increased distributable net investment income per share, increased regular monthly dividends per share, increased net asset value per share, growth of the investment portfolio, continuation of the Company's low total operating cost  Table of Contents structure in comparison to peer organizations, maintaining an investment grade rating from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, use of our at-the-market equity offering to issue equity efficiently as needed while maintaining a conservative leverage ratio, low employee turnover and development of talented personnel. The Compensation Committee did not weight these achievements and used discretion in determining the cash bonus amount allocated to each executive. In summary, the performance of the NEO group and the management team overall was at a consistent high level in 2018 resulting in excellent financial results. As approved by the Compensation Committee, Mr. Foster's cash bonus related to 2018 performance was issued in the form of shares of restricted stock under the 2015 Equity and Incentive Plan instead of cash, as discussed further in "Compensation of Executive Officers—Summary Compensation Table". 
        The amount of cash bonus paid to each NEO for 2018 is presented under the caption entitled "Compensation of Executive Officers—Summary Compensation Table." The Committee believes that these cash bonus awards are individually appropriate based on 2018 performance. Such bonuses comprise a key component of the Company's overall compensation program. 
   Long-Term Incentive Awards  
        The Company granted restricted shares to our NEOs in 2018 to recognize individual contributions to corporate strategic priorities and to the long-term performance of the Company. Other objectives of restricted stock awards were to assist with retention, align NEO interests with stockholders' and to provide competitive total direct compensation. Contributions to the future success of the Company include expanded roles of NEOs within the Company, recruitment and development of personnel, advancement of strategic initiatives with benefits beyond the current year, development of appropriate capital structure alternatives and enhancement of the Company's reputation with key constituents. 
        The amount of restricted shares granted to each NEO in 2018 is presented under the caption entitled "Compensation of Executive Officers—Grants of Plan-Based Awards." The Committee is currently assessing the potential for long-term incentive compensation through grants of restricted shares to our NEOs for 2019, which are expected to be awarded in April 2019. 
      Risk Management and Compensation Policies and Practices         
        We believe that risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for our employees are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, the Compensation Committee believes that the mix and design of the elements of executive compensation do not encourage management to assume excessive risks. 
        The Compensation Committee has reviewed the elements of executive compensation to determine whether any portion of executive compensation encourages excessive risk taking and concluded: Table of Contents
        Finally, in addition to the factors described above, incentive compensation decisions include subjective considerations that restrain the influence of formulae or objective driven determinations that might lead to excessive risk taking.

        In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved and adopted the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan, an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan, to allow non-employee  Table of Contents directors and certain key employees, including each of the NEOs, to defer receipt of some or all of their cash compensation, subject to certain limitations. Pursuant to the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan, executives may contribute on a pre-tax basis up to 100% of their salary, bonus and dividends paid on shares of unvested Company stock. Although not currently anticipated and subject to prior Compensation Committee approval, discretionary employer contributions are also permitted to the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan. Individuals participating in the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan receive distributions of their respective balances based on predetermined payout schedules or other events as defined by the plan. Amounts deferred under the plan earn a return based on the returns on certain investment alternatives permitted under the plan, including phantom Main Street stock units, as designated by the participant. The 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan became effective on January 1, 2016. 
      Potential Payments Upon Change in Control or Termination of Employment         
        As described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our restricted stock awards to employees, including NEOs, provide that upon certain transactions involving a change in control, or upon a participant's death, disability, involuntary termination without cause or voluntary termination with good reason (each as defined in the award agreement), the unvested shares of restricted stock will fully vest. The number of shares and value of unvested restricted stock for each NEO as of December 31, 2018 that would have vested under the acceleration scenarios described above is shown under the heading "—Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End." 
        In addition, NEOs who participate in the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan could receive a distribution of their balances in that plan in connection with their death, disability or termination of employment, depending on their distribution elections under the plan. The aggregate balance in the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan of each NEO as of December 31, 2018 is shown under the heading "—Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
        Other than the accelerated vesting of restricted stock and amounts due under the 2015 Deferred Compensation Plan, we currently would not incur any other payment obligations to our NEOs in the event of a change in control or any of the aforementioned causes of termination of employment. 
      Chief Executive Officer Pay Ratio         
        For 2018, our last completed fiscal year, the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than Mr. Hyzak, our Chief Executive Officer (our "CEO")) was $154,426, and the annualized total compensation of our CEO was $3,952,209. Based on this information, our CEO's 2018 annual total compensation was approximately 26 times that of the median of the 2018 annual total compensation of all of our employees (the "CEO Pay Ratio").   
        We selected December 31, 2018 as the date used to identify our "median employee" whose annual total compensation was the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees (other than our CEO) for 2018. As of December 31, 2018, our employee population consisted of 66 individuals, all located in our Houston, Texas office. We compared the annual total compensation for our employee population in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, which included salary, bonus, stock awards and employer matching contributions to employee accounts in our 401(k) plan. In making this determination, we annualized the compensation of 17 employees who were hired in 2018 but did not work for us the entire fiscal year. 
           As discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement, the Company had two individuals serving in the role of CEO during 2018. We elected to use the compensation of Mr. Hyzak, the active CEO as of December 31, 2018, for purposes of determining the CEO Pay Ratio. Mr. Hyzak became CEO in November 2018. In determining Mr. Hyzak's compensation for purposes of the CEO Pay Ratio, we adjusted the compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table to reflect his compensation as if he were CEO for the full calendar year. For purposes of calculating the CEO Pay Ratio, this resulted in total annual compensation of $3,952,209 for the CEO as opposed to the amount shown on the Summary Compensation Table of $3,242,451.

    AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT         
        The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board of Directors to review Main Street's financial matters. Each member of the Audit Committee meets the independence requirements established by the 1940 Act and under the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. As the Audit Committee, we are responsible for the selection, engagement, compensation, retention and oversight of Main Street's independent registered public accounting firm. We are also responsible for recommending to the Board of Directors that Main Street's audited financial statements be included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year. 
        In making our recommendation that Main Street's financial statements be included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, we have taken the following steps:
        Based on the reviews and actions described above, we recommended to the Board of Directors that Main Street's audited financial statements be included in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

    RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED   PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019   (ITEM 2)         
        Our Board of Directors has ratified the decision of the Audit Committee to appoint Grant Thornton LLP to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019. No determination has been made as to what action the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors would take if our stockholders fail to ratify the appointment. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee retains discretion to appoint a new independent registered public accounting firm at any time if the Audit Committee concludes such a change would be in the best interests of Main Street. We expect that representatives of Grant Thornton LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and to respond to appropriate questions. 
        For the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Main Street incurred the following fees for services provided by Grant Thornton, including expenses:

 Total Fees      $ 691,417      $ 665,281   
[END TABLE]
         Audit Fees.    Audit fees include fees for services that normally would be provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements and that generally only the independent accountant can provide. In addition to fees for the audit of our annual financial statements, the audit of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and the review of our quarterly financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, this category contains fees for comfort letters, statutory audits, consents, and assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC. 
         Audit Related Fees.    Audit related fees are assurance related services that traditionally are performed by the independent accountant, such as attest services that are not required by statute or regulation. 
         Tax Fees.    Tax fees include corporate and subsidiary compliance and consulting. 
        All Other Fees.    Fees for other services would include fees for products and services other than the services reported above. 
        It is the policy of our Audit Committee to preapprove all audit, review or attest engagements and permissible non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm, subject to, and in compliance with, the de minimis exception for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. Our Audit Committee did not rely on the de minimis exception for any of the fees disclosed above. 
        The proxy holders will vote all proxies received for approval of this proposal unless instructed otherwise. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, is required to ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.

    ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION   (ITEM 3)         
        Our Board of Directors recognizes that executive compensation is an important matter for our stockholders. As described in detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" ("CD&A") section of this proxy statement, the Compensation Committee is tasked with the implementation of our executive compensation philosophy, and the core of that philosophy has been and continues to be to pay our executives based on our and their individual performance. In particular, the Compensation Committee strives to attract, retain and motivate exceptional executives, to reward past performance and provide incentives for future performance, and to align executives' long-term interests with the interests of our stockholders. To do so, the Compensation Committee uses a combination of short- and long-term incentive compensation to reward near-term excellent performance and to encourage executives' commitment to our long-range, strategic business goals. It is always the intention of the Compensation Committee that our executive officers be compensated competitively and consistently with our strategy, sound corporate governance principles, and stockholder interests and concerns. 
        As described in the CD&A, we believe our compensation program is effective, appropriate and strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders and that the total compensation package provided to our NEOs and other key employees is reasonable and not excessive. To this end, our Compensation Committee is advised from time to time by an independent compensation consultant. As you consider this proposal, we urge you to read the CD&A section of this proxy statement for additional details on executive compensation, including the more detailed information about our compensation philosophy and objectives and the past compensation of our NEOs, and to review the tabular disclosures regarding NEO compensation together with the accompanying narrative disclosures in the "Compensation of Executive Officers" section of this proxy statement. 
        In accordance with the results of the vote at our 2017 Annual Meeting, our Board of Directors has determined to implement an advisory vote on executive compensation each year until the next required advisory vote on the frequency of stockholder votes on the compensation of executives (scheduled to occur at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders). The annual non-binding advisory "Say on Pay" vote gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our NEOs' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the compensation philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. We welcome the opportunity to give our stockholders an opportunity to provide us with such a vote on executive compensation at the Annual Meeting. 
        As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on our Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, will not overrule any decisions made by our Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, or require our Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee to take any specific action. Although the vote is non-binding, our Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and will carefully consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for our NEOs and other key employees. In particular, to the extent there is any significant vote against our NEOs' compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, we will consider our stockholders' concerns, and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. 
      Text of the Resolution to be Adopted         
        We are asking stockholders to vote "For" the following advisory resolution: 
        "RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation philosophy, policies and procedures and the compensation of the NEOs as disclosed in the Proxy Statement for Main Street Capital Corporation's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation  Table of Contents disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including the CD&A, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosures." 
      Required Vote         
        The approval of this advisory resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be included in determining the number of votes cast and, as a result, will not have any effect on the result of the vote on this item.

    AMENDMENT OF CHARTER TO ALLOW STOCKHOLDERS TO AMEND OUR BYLAWS   (ITEM 4)         
        Our Board of Directors has adopted a resolution whereby it has declared advisable, and recommends for your approval, an amendment to Article V, Section 5.5 of our Charter to provide that our bylaws may be amended by the vote of a majority of our entire Board of Directors or by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Currently, Article V, Section 5.5 of our Charter provides that our Board of Directors has the exclusive power to make, alter, amend or repeal the bylaws. 
        Our Board is committed to strong and effective corporate governance and monitors regularly our corporate governance policies and practices. After careful consideration, our Board believes that allowing our stockholders to amend our bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter is in our best interests and in the best interests of our stockholders. A copy of the proposed amendment to our Charter is attached as Attachment A to this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into this proposal. If this Charter amendment is approved by our stockholders, we expect that our Board of Directors will similarly amend our bylaws. If this Charter amendment is not approved by our stockholders, then we will not amend our Charter to provide this right to our stockholders. 
      Required Vote         
        The affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter is required to amend our Charter to allow stockholders to amend our bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. For purposes of the vote on this proposal, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against this proposal.

As a BDC, the 1940 Act restricts us from participating in transactions with any persons affiliated with us, including our officers, directors and employees and any person controlling or under common control with us, subject to certain exceptions. 
        In the ordinary course of business, we enter into transactions with portfolio companies that may be considered related party transactions. We have implemented certain policies and procedures, both written and unwritten, to ensure that we do not engage in any prohibited transactions with any persons affiliated with us. If such affiliations are found to exist, we seek Board and/or appropriate Board committee review and approval or exemptive relief for such transactions, as appropriate. 
        In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which is applicable to all of our employees, officers and directors, requires that all employees, officers and directors avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between an individual's personal interests and our interests. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available at  http://mainstcapital.com under "Corporate Governance—Governance Docs" in the "Investors" section of our website. 
    INVESTMENT ADVISOR, ADMINISTRATOR AND PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER         
        Because we are internally managed, all of our executive officers and other employees are employed by Main Street. Therefore, Main Street does not have an investment advisor or an administrator. Set forth below are the names and addresses of firms that may be deemed to serve as a principal underwriter, as such term is defined under the 1940 Act, of Main Street as sales agents under our at-the-market offering program:

    SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE         
        Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of our voting stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of our equity securities with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. Directors, executive officers and greater-than-10% holders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on a review of the copies of those forms furnished to us, or written representations that no such forms were required, we believe that our directors, executive officers and greater-than-10% beneficial owners complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements during the year ended December 31, 2018.
