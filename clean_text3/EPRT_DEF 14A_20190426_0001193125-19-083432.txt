ABOUT THE PROXY MATERIALS AND ANNUAL MEETING 
Why am I receiving these materials? 
Essential Properties Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (collectively, the "Company," "we," "us" or "our"), has delivered these materials to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company for use at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"), which will take place on Friday, April 26, 2019, at 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time, at the Harvard Room of the Hyatt Regency Princeton, 102 Carnegie Center, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. This Proxy Statement describes the matters on which you, as a stockholder, are entitled to vote and provides the information that you need to make an informed decision on these matters. 
What is included in the proxy materials? 
The proxy materials include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• This Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2018 (the "Annual Report").  
[END TABLE]
The proxy materials also include a proxy card or a voting instruction form for the Annual Meeting. 
What am I voting on? 
At the Annual Meeting, you will be entitled to vote on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The election of seven (7) directors to the Company's Board of Directors, each to serve until the 2020  Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualify (Proposal No. 1); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting  firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 (Proposal No. 2).  
[END TABLE]
What are the Board's recommendations? 
The Board unanimously recommends you vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of each of the seven (7) nominees named in this Proxy Statement  as directors of the Company (Proposal No. 1); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our  independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 (Proposal No. 2).  
[END TABLE]
If I share an address with another stockholder, and we received only one paper copy of the proxy materials, how may I obtain an additional copy of the proxy materials? 
We have adopted a procedure called "householding," which the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") has approved. Under this procedure, we are delivering a single copy of this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report to multiple stockholders who share the same address unless we have received contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders. This procedure reduces our printing costs, mailing costs and fees. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to be able to access and receive separate proxy cards. Upon written or oral request, we will deliver promptly a separate copy of this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report to any stockholder at a shared address to which we delivered a single copy of any of these documents. To receive a separate copy of this Proxy Statement or the Annual Report, stockholders may write or call us at the following address and telephone number:  Essential Properties Realty Trust, Inc. 
Attention: Gregg A. Seibert 
Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Secretary 
902 Carnegie Center Boulevard, Suite 520 
Princeton, New Jersey 08540 
(609) 436-0619 
Stockholders who hold shares in "street name" (as described below) may contact their broker, bank or other similar nominee to request information about householding. 
How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials? 
Our proxy materials are available on the Internet at http://www.proxydocs.com/EPRT and on our investor relations website at http://investors.essentialproperties.com. 
Who is entitled to vote at the meeting? 
Holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on March 11, 2019, the record date for the Annual Meeting (the "Record Date"), are entitled to receive notice of the Annual Meeting and to vote their shares of common stock held on that date at the meeting or any postponements or adjournments of the Annual Meeting. On the Record Date, 43,795,460 shares of common stock of the Company were outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
How can I attend the Annual Meeting? 
In order to be admitted to the Annual Meeting, you must present photo identification (such as a driver's license) and proof of ownership of shares of our common stock as of the close of business on March 11, 2019, the Record Date. Proof of ownership can be accomplished through the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A brokerage statement or letter from your broker or custodian with respect to your ownership of shares of our  common stock as of the Record Date;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A proxy card;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A voting instruction form; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A legal proxy provided by your broker or custodian.  
[END TABLE]
For the safety and security of our stockholders, we will be unable to admit you to the Annual Meeting if you do not present photo identification and proof of ownership of shares of our common stock or if you otherwise refuse to comply with our security procedures. We note that receiving a legal proxy from your broker or custodian may take several days. 
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in street name? 
Stockholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and we sent the proxy materials directly to you. 
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank or other nominee, then you are the beneficial owner of those shares held in "street name," and the proxy materials were forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee who is considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote the shares held in your account. Those instructions are contained in a "voting instruction form."  How do I vote or authorize a proxy to vote on my behalf? 
Voting in Person during the Annual Meeting. You may vote your shares by attending the Annual Meeting in person and depositing your proxy card at the registration desk or completing a ballot that will be distributed at the Annual Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you will need to obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to vote in person during the Annual Meeting. Obtaining a legal proxy may take several days. 
Voting by Proxy for Shares Held by a Stockholder of Record. If your shares are held in your own name as a holder of record with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you may instruct the proxy holders named in the accompanying proxy card on how to vote your shares of common stock in one of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Internet. You may vote by proxy over the Internet by visiting http://www.proxypush.com/EPRT and  following the instructions provided with the proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Telephone. You may vote by proxy by calling the toll-free number found on the proxy card.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail. You may vote by signing, dating and mailing the proxy card in the prepaid enclosed envelope.   
[END TABLE]
Voting by Proxy for Beneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank or other nominee, you may instruct such organization on how to vote your shares of common stock in one of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Internet. You may vote by proxy over the Internet by visiting http://www.proxypush.com/EPRT and  following the instructions provided in the voting instruction form you received from the organization holding your shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Telephone. You may vote by proxy by calling the toll-free number found on the voting instruction form  you received from the organization holding your shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail. You may vote by proxy by filling out the voting instruction form you received from the  organization that holds your shares and sending it back in the envelope provided.  
[END TABLE]
What constitutes a quorum? 
The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on any matter at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum. If a quorum is established, each holder of common stock will be entitled to one vote on each director to be elected at the Annual Meeting and each other matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting for each issued and outstanding share of common stock owned on the Record Date. Proxies received but marked as abstentions and broker "non-votes" will be included in the calculation of the number of votes considered to be present at the meeting and will be counted for quorum purposes. 
How are proxies voted? 
All shares represented by valid proxies received prior to the Annual Meeting will be voted and, where a stockholder specifies by means of the proxy a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the shares will be voted in accordance with the stockholder's instructions. 
What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions? 
Stockholders of Record. If you are a stockholder of record and you sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then the proxy holders will vote your shares in the manner recommended by the Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting.  Beneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not provide the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares may generally vote on routine matters but cannot vote on non-routine matters. If the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote." 
Which ballot measures are considered "routine" or "non-routine"? 
The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 (Proposal No. 2) is a matter considered routine under applicable rules. A broker, bank or other nominee may generally vote on routine matters, and therefore no broker non-votes are expected to exist in connection with Proposal No. 2. 
The election of directors (Proposal No. 1) is a matter considered non-routine under applicable rules. A broker, bank or other nominee cannot vote without instructions on non-routine matters, and therefore broker non-votes may exist in connection with Proposal No. 1. 
How many votes are needed to approve each item? 
The affirmative vote of a plurality of all the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, is required for the election of directors (Proposal No. 1). This means the seven nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected. The affirmative vote of a majority of all votes cast at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, is required to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 (Proposal No. 2). 
How are abstentions, withhold votes and broker non-votes counted? 
Instructions to abstain or withhold votes and broker non-votes will be counted to determine whether there is a quorum present at the Annual Meeting, but will not be considered votes cast. Accordingly, withhold votes and broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of directors (Proposal No. 1), and abstentions will have no effect on the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 (Proposal No. 2). As stated above, broker non-votes are not expected to occur in connection with Proposal No. 2. 
Can I change my vote after I have authorized a proxy to vote on my behalf? 
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the final vote at the Annual Meeting. You may provide different voting instructions to a proxy on a later date through the Internet or by telephone (in which case only your latest Internet or telephone proxy submitted prior to the Annual Meeting will be counted), by signing and returning a new proxy card or voting instruction form with a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting in person and voting during the meeting. However, your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy unless you vote in person at the Annual Meeting. You may also specifically request that your prior proxy be revoked by delivering a written notice of revocation prior to the Annual Meeting to the Company at 902 Carnegie Center Boulevard, Suite 520, Princeton, New Jersey 08540, Attention: Corporate Secretary.  Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting? 
The Company intends to announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and disclose final results in a current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting. If final results are not yet known within that four business day period, the Company will disclose preliminary voting results in a Form 8-K and file an amendment to the Form 8-K to disclose the final results within four business days after such final results are known. 
Who pays the cost for soliciting proxies by the Board of Directors? 
The Company will bear the cost of soliciting proxies, including the cost of preparing, printing and mailing the materials in connection with the solicitation of proxies. The Company will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them in sending the proxy materials to the beneficial owners of the Company's common stock. In addition to solicitations by mail, directors, officers and employees of the Company may, on behalf of the Company, without being additionally compensated, solicit proxies personally and by mail, telephone, facsimile or electronic communication.  PROPOSAL NO. 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The number of directors that serve on the Board of Directors is currently set at seven and may be fixed from time to time by the Board in the manner provided in the Company's bylaws, subject to the requirements of the Stockholders Agreement described below. In accordance with the Company's bylaws and Maryland law, directors are elected to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified or until their earlier removal, resignation or death.

 Scott A. Estes      48       Director      2018   
[END TABLE]
Each of the seven director nominees listed above currently serves as a director of the Company and their biographies can be found below under "Corporate Governance Matters—Information Regarding the Board of Directors." Mr. Mavoides was elected to the Board in January 2018 in connection with our incorporation in Maryland. Each of our other directors were elected to the Board in June 2018 in connection with the Company's initial public offering ("IPO"). Each of the seven director nominees was recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and nominated by the Board of Directors to stand for election at the Annual Meeting. 
In selecting director nominees, the Board seeks to monitor the mix of specific experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills of its members in order to assure that the Board, as a whole, has the necessary tools to perform its oversight function effectively in light of the Company's business and structure. For more information about the qualifications and skills of each of the director nominees, see "Corporate Governance Matters—Background and Experience of Directors." Mr. Bossidy was originally elected to our Board based on his prior business experience, which includes, among other things, experience with our predecessor and its principal equity investor, and members of our senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Estes was introduced to our Chief Executive Officer by a participant in the financial services industry, who had professional relationships with each of Messrs. Estes and Mavoides. Ms. DeLucca was introduced to us by other members of our Board. In addition, Messrs. Gilbert, Minella and Sautel were identified by Eldridge Industries, LLC ("Eldridge"), our largest stockholder, as its designated nominees in accordance with the stockholders agreement between Eldridge and the Company (the "Stockholders Agreement"). For more information about the Stockholders Agreement, see "Corporate Governance Matters— Stockholders Agreement." 
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of a plurality of all the votes cast at the Annual Meeting is required for the election of a nominee as a director. This means the seven nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected. Stockholders of the Company are not permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors. Unless contrary instructions are given, shares represented by proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted for the election of each of the nominees named above. If any person named as nominee, other than any nominee of Eldridge, should be unable or unwilling to stand for election at the time of the Annual Meeting, proxies will be voted for a replacement nominee designated by the Board of Directors or, in the event no such designation is   made, proxies will be voted for a lesser number of nominees. If any person designated as nominee by Eldridge in accordance with the Stockholders Agreement should be unable or unwilling to stand for election at the time of the Annual Meeting, such replacement nominee will be a nominee designated by Eldridge. At this time, the Board knows of no reason why the nominees listed above may not be able to serve as a director if elected. 
Board Recommendation 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the election of each of the nominees named above.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
Set forth below is information regarding our corporate governance practices. We believe that effective corporate governance is critical to our ability to create long-term value for our stockholders. In that regard, we have opted-out of certain statutory takeover defense protections otherwise available to us under Maryland law, and we have adopted and implemented charters, policies, procedures and controls that we believe promote and enhance our corporate governance, accountability and responsibility. 
Information Regarding the Board of Directors 
Set forth below is biographical information for each director nominee, each of whom currently serves as a director of the Company. 
Paul T. Bossidy. Mr. Bossidy has served as the chairman of our Board of Directors since 2018. Mr. Bossidy is President and Chief Executive Officer of Patripabre Capital LLC, in Ridgefield, Connecticut, and provides consulting services to companies in the financial services industry. Mr. Bossidy also serves on the board of directors of Berkshire Hills Bancorp, Inc., a bank holding company that is the parent of Berkshire Bank with branches throughout New England. Mr. Bossidy previously served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Clayton Holdings LLC ("Clayton") from 2008 to 2014, when it was acquired by Radian Group, Inc. Prior to joining Clayton, Mr. Bossidy was a Senior Operations Executive at Cerberus Capital Management LP, a real estate investment fund, from 2006 to 2008. Prior to that, Mr. Bossidy served in various executive appointments for General Electric Company from 1993 to 2006, including General Manager of Corporate Business Development, President of the Refrigerator Product Line within GE Appliances Division, President and Chief Executive Officer of GE Lighting (North America), President and Chief Executive Officer of GE Vendor Financial Services, President and Chief Executive Officer of GE Commercial Equipment Financing and President and Chief Executive Officer of GE Capital Solutions Group. From 2001 to 2006, while Chief Executive Officer of GE Commercial Equipment Financing, Mr. Bossidy was also responsible for GE Franchise Finance, a lender for the franchise finance market, which operated a large triple-net lease real estate business. He is a Certified Public Accountant and a Certified Six Sigma Black Belt. Mr. Bossidy holds a B.A. from Williams College, a Masters in Accounting from New York University and an M.B.A. with concentrations in Finance and Marketing from Columbia University Graduate School of Business. 
Peter M. Mavoides. Mr. Mavoides has been our President and Chief Executive Officer since 2018, and he held similar positions at Essential Properties Realty Trust LLC ("EPRT LLC"), which became our operating partnership through the formation transactions, since March 2016. Previously, from September 2011 through February 2015, Mr. Mavoides was the President and Chief Operating Officer of Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. ("Spirit"), an NYSE-listed REIT that invests primarily in single-tenant, net leased real estate. While at Spirit, Mr. Mavoides was instrumental in transforming that company from a private enterprise, with approximately $3.2 billion of total assets and 37 employees at the time of its September 2012 initial public offering, to a public company with approximately $8.0 billion of total assets and over 70 employees at the time of his departure in February 2015. During his tenure at Spirit, Mr. Mavoides chaired the company's investment committee and led the team that created the infrastructure that acquired over 150 separate investments with an aggregate purchase price of nearly $2.0 billion and an average investment per property of $2.6 million over a period of approximately three years. Mr. Mavoides previously worked for Sovereign, as its President and Chief Executive Officer, from May 2003 to January 2011.

Background and Experience of Directors 
When considering whether directors have the experience, qualifications, attributes or skills, taken as a whole, to enable the Board to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of our business and structure, the Board focused primarily on each person's background and experience as reflected in the information discussed in each of the directors' individual biographies set forth above. The Board believes that the director nominees provide an appropriate mix of experience and skills relevant to the size and nature of our business. In particular, the Board considered the following important characteristics, among others, with respect to each director:

Stockholders Agreement 
Under the Stockholders Agreement, Eldridge has the power, subject to certain terms and conditions, to designate a certain number of nominees for election to the Board of Directors depending on its ownership of the Company, designate a member of certain board committees and approve certain actions, each as more fully described below. For so long as the Stockholders Agreement remains in effect, directors elected pursuant to Eldridge's nomination right may only be removed with Eldridge's consent. If there is a vacancy on the Board of Directors because of the resignation or removal of a director elected pursuant to Eldridge's nomination right   (other than due to a decrease in the number of nominees Eldridge is entitled to designate), the Stockholders Agreement requires us to nominate an individual designated by Eldridge for election to fill such vacancy. 
Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, Eldridge has the following nomination rights. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For so long as Eldridge and its affiliates (as such term is defined in the stockholders agreement) own shares  representing at least 15% or more of the voting power of our common stock, Eldridge is entitled to designate a number of nominees for election as directors equal to the lowest whole number that is at least 40% of the total number of directors;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• When Eldridge and its affiliates own shares representing less than 15% but greater than or equal to 10% of the  voting power of our common stock, Eldridge is entitled to designate a number of nominees for election as directors equal to the lowest whole number that is at least 25% of the total number of directors; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• When Eldridge and its affiliates own shares representing less than 10% but greater than or equal to 5% of the  voting power of our common stock, Eldridge is entitled to designate a number of nominees for election as directors equal to the lowest whole number that is at least 10% of the total number of directors.  
[END TABLE]
When Eldridge and its affiliates own shares representing at least 10% of the voting power of our common stock and a nominee designated by Eldridge is elected to the Board of Directors who qualifies as an independent director under NYSE standards, Eldridge has the power to designate one independent board member to be elected as a member of each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
For so long as Eldridge owns shares representing at least 5% of the voting power of our common stock, the Stockholders Agreement and our charter and bylaws provide that Eldridge must first approve: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any increase to the size of the Board of Directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any determination that we will no longer qualify, or attempt to qualify, as a REIT;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Amendments to our bylaws relating to the designation of director nominees by Eldridge, Eldridge's right to  consent to any increase in the size of the Board of Directors or Eldridge's right to consent to amendments to such provisions; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Amendments to the provision of our charter relating to Eldridge's right to consent to the removal of any  director nominated in accordance with Eldridge's nomination right, Eldridge's right to consent to any determination that we will no longer qualify or attempt to qualify as a REIT or Eldridge's right to consent to amendments to such  provisions.  
[END TABLE]
Director Independence 
After reviewing all relevant relationships and considering the NYSE requirements for independence, the Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. Bossidy, Sautel and Estes and Ms. DeLucca are each an "independent director" as such term is defined by the applicable rules and regulations of the NYSE. 
Directors' Attendance at Annual Meetings 
Although we do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board of Directors at annual meetings of stockholders, we expect that our directors will attend our annual meetings, absent a valid reason for not doing so. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our Board of Directors currently consists of seven members, each of whom are serving for a one-year term expiring at the Annual Meeting.  The Board of Directors has no fixed policy with respect to the separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. The Board retains the discretion to determine, at any time, whether to combine or separate the positions as it deems to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. However, the Board currently believes that separating the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman is an integral part of effective corporate governance and management of the Company and is the best structure for the Company at this time because it improves the ability of the Board of Directors to exercise its oversight role by having a director who is not an officer or member of management to serve in the role of Chairman. 
Board Executive Sessions 
The non-employee members of the Board meet in executive session without management present at the conclusion of each regular Board meeting. Mr.  Bossidy, the Chairman of our Board, acts as the Chair at all of these executive sessions. 
Board of Directors Role in Risk Oversight 
One of the key functions of our Board of Directors is informed oversight of our risk management process. Our Board of Directors administers this oversight function directly, with support from its three standing committees, the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, each of which addresses risks specific to its respective areas of oversight. In particular, as more fully described below, our Audit Committee has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures, including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken. The Audit Committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, in addition to oversight of the performance of our internal audit function. Our Compensation Committee assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation policies and programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking. See "Executive Compensation—Compensation Risk Assessment." Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee provides oversight with respect to corporate governance and ethical conduct and monitors the effectiveness of our corporate governance guidelines, including whether such guidelines are successful in preventing illegal or improper liability-creating conduct. 
Committees and Meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company met four times. No director attended fewer than 75% of the total number of Board meetings and committee meetings on which he or she served that were held during the year ended December 31, 2018 and that were held while such person was a director of the Company or member of such committee. The Board has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The charters for each of these committees are available on our investor relations website at http://investors.essentialproperties.com. The Board may establish other committees as it deems necessary or appropriate from time to time.

Compensation Committee 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a Compensation Committee charter, which defines the Compensation Committee's principal functions to include:

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee shall have the authority, in its sole discretion, to retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser as it deems appropriate. The committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more members when it deems appropriate. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee met three times. Our Compensation Committee is composed of Ms. DeLucca and Messrs. Bossidy, Estes and Sautel. Ms. DeLucca serves as chair of our Compensation Committee. Our Board of Directors has determined affirmatively that each member of our Compensation Committee meets the definition for "independence" for the purpose of serving on   our Compensation Committee under applicable rules of the NYSE and each member of our Compensation Committee meets the definition of a "non-employee director" for the purpose of serving on our Compensation Committee under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter, which defines the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's principal functions, to include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• identifying individuals qualified to become members of our Board of Directors and ensuring that our Board of  Directors has the requisite expertise and its membership consists of persons with sufficiently diverse and independent backgrounds;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met two times. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is comprised of Messrs. Bossidy, Estes and Sautel. Mr. Sautel serves as chair of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Our Board of Directors has determined affirmatively that each member of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets the definition of independence under NYSE listing standards. 
Subject to the requirements of the Stockholders Agreement, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates for director suggested by its members, as well as by management and stockholders, if such candidates meet the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's criteria for Board membership, evaluating them in the same manner in which the Committee evaluates other candidates. Such recommendations should be made in writing to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or the Corporate Secretary of the Company and should include a description of the qualifications of the proposed candidate. 
A stockholder who desires to nominate a prospective nominee for the Board should notify the Corporate Secretary of the Company, at 902 Carnegie Center Boulevard, Suite 520, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. As set forth in the Company's bylaws, the deadline for submission of stockholder nominations is not less than 120 calendar days nor more than 150 calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the date the Company's proxy statement was released to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has the authority and right to retain a search firm to identify or evaluate potential nominees if it so desires. 
In evaluating candidates to serve on the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's objective is to select individuals with skills and experience that can assist the Company and the Board in   achieving their objectives. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers (i) individual qualifications, including relevant career experience, strength of character, maturity of judgment, experience in, and familiarity with, the Company's business and industry and (ii) all other factors it considers appropriate, which may include age, diversity of background, existing commitments to other businesses, potential conflicts of interest, legal considerations, corporate governance background (including experience as a board member or officer of another publicly held company), financial and accounting background, executive compensation background and the size, composition and combined expertise of the existing Board. Though neither the Board nor the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has a formal policy concerning diversity, the Board of Directors values diversity on the Board, believes diversity should be considered in the director identification and nominating process, and seeks director nominees that have a diverse range of views, backgrounds and leadership, as well as business experience. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers the extent to which the candidate would fill a present need on the Board of Directors. 
Once the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has identified a prospective nominee, the Committee will make an initial determination as to whether to conduct a full evaluation of the candidate. This initial determination will be based on the information provided to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with the recommendation of the prospective candidate, as well as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's own knowledge of the prospective candidate, which may be supplemented by inquiries to the person making the recommendation or others. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

Overview 
This section provides a discussion of the compensation paid or awarded to our President and Chief Executive Officer and our two other most highly compensated executive officers as of December 31, 2018. We refer to these individuals as our "named executive officers." For 2018, our named executive officers and their positions were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Gregg A. Seibert, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and

[END TABLE]
We are an "emerging growth company" under the federal securities laws and, as such, we have elected to comply with certain reduced disclosure requirements, including in the area of executive compensation. 
Prior to our IPO in June 2018, our Board of Directors set the compensation for Messrs. Mavoides and Seibert and the board of directors of EPRT LLC set the compensation for Ms. Hai. Once we became an independent entity, our Board of Directors set the compensation for Ms. Hai. In connection with our IPO, the Compensation Committee was formed and, following the IPO, executive officer compensation decisions were determined by the Compensation Committee. 
Our executive compensation programs are intended to align executive compensation with our business objectives and to enable us to attract, retain and reward executive officers who contribute to our long-term success. The compensation paid or awarded to our executive officers is generally based on the assessment of each individual's performance compared against the business objectives established for the fiscal year as well as the competitive landscape and our historical compensation practices. For 2018, the material elements of our executive compensation program were base salary, annual cash bonus, and restricted share awards. 
Compensation of Named Executive Officers 
Base Salary 
Base salaries are intended to provide a level of compensation sufficient to attract and retain an effective management team, when considered in combination with the other components of our executive compensation program. The relative levels of base salary for our named executive officers are designed to reflect each executive officer's scope of responsibility and accountability with us. On June 25, 2018, we entered into employment agreements with each of our named executive officers, which provide for initial annual base salaries for Messrs. Mavoides and Seibert and Ms. Hai of $100,000, $100,000 and $250,000, respectively. Please see the "Salary" column in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table for the base salary amounts received by each named executive officer in 2018. 
Annual Cash Bonuses 
We provide our senior leadership team with short-term incentive compensation through an annual cash bonus plan. Annual bonus compensation holds executives accountable, rewards the executives based on actual business results and helps create a "pay for performance" culture. Our annual cash bonus plan provides cash incentive award opportunities based on a qualitative assessment by the Compensation Committee of the Company's performance and the named executive officer's individual performance and leadership. 
The payment of awards under the 2018 annual cash bonus plan applicable to the named executive officers was subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee. The 2018 bonus target for each of Messrs.   Mavoides and Seibert and Ms. Hai was 100% of base salary, with a maximum bonus opportunity equal to 150% of base salary for Ms. Hai. Based on a qualitative assessment of performance, Messrs. Mavoides and Seibert and Ms. Hai received bonuses with respect to 2018 performance in the amounts of $250,000, $200,000, and $337,500, respectively. Messrs. Mavoides and Seibert elected to receive half of their 2018 annual bonuses in equity rather than cash. The annual cash bonus paid to each named executive officer with respect to 2018 performance is set forth in the "Bonus" column in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. 
Restricted Share Awards 
To further align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders and to further focus our executive officers on our long-term performance, in 2018, we granted restricted shares to each our named executive officers following the consummation of the IPO. These restricted share awards vest in one-third annual increments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to the executive officer's continued employment through the applicable vesting date. Accordingly, on June 25, 2018, Messrs. Mavoides and Seibert and Ms. Hai received restricted share grants with respect to 290,323, 225,806 and 40,323 shares, respectively.

[END TABLE]
Employment Agreements 
On June 25, 2018, we entered into employment agreements with each of our named executive officers. The employment agreement for each of Messrs. Mavoides and Seibert and Ms. Hai has an initial four-year term, with automatic one-year renewals unless notice of non-renewal is provided by either party. Each of the employment agreements include non-competition and non-solicitation provisions that generally end one year after the executive's termination of employment.  The employment agreements for Messrs. Mavoides and Seibert and Ms. Hai provide for severance benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment. None of the employment agreements, however, provide for payments or benefits solely upon the occurrence of a change in control. Under the terms of each executive's employment agreement, in the event the executive's employment is terminated by us without "cause" (as defined in the agreements) or by the executive for "good reason" (as defined in the agreements), and subject to the executive's execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims the executive would become entitled to receive: (i) any annual performance bonus awarded for the year prior to termination, to the extent unpaid; (ii) continued payments equal to 12 months of base salary; (iii) monthly reimbursement for 12 months of COBRA premiums; and (iv) for terminations of employment occurring after March 31 in a given year, a pro rata bonus for the year of termination based on actual performance, provided that the Company is on plan with respect to the budget approved by the Board of Directors for such year and the Compensation Committee approves the payment of such bonus. In the event of the executive's termination of employment due to death or disability, the executive or the executive's beneficiary, as applicable, would be entitled to receive: (i) any annual performance bonus awarded for the year prior to termination, to the extent unpaid; (ii) a pro rata bonus for the year of termination; and (iii) monthly reimbursement for 12 months of COBRA premiums. In the event of the non-renewal of the employment agreement, the executive would be entitled to receive any annual performance bonus awarded for the year prior to termination, to the extent unpaid. 
Restricted Share Agreements 
Under the June 2018 restricted share agreements, the restricted shares will vest in full upon the named executive officer's termination of employment due to death, disability or a termination by us without cause, each as defined under the restricted share agreement. In addition, under our 2018 Incentive Plan, in the event of a change in control of us (as defined in the 2018 Incentive Plan), the Board of Directors retains discretion to determine the treatment of outstanding equity awards, which may include acceleration of the vesting of awards upon a change in control. 
401(k) Plan 
We maintain a qualified 401(k) savings plan for the benefit of our employees, including our named executive officers. The 401(k) plan allows participants to contribute up to 100% of his or her pre-tax cash compensation, up to the annual maximum statutory limit allowed under Internal Revenue Service guidelines. Our 401(k) plan allows for discretionary matching of employee contributions. We make matching contributions equal to 100% of the first 3% of eligible compensation contributed by participants and 50% of the next 2% of eligible compensation contributed by participants. Participants are always vested in both their own contributions to the plan and in our matching contributions to the plan. 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
The Company and the Compensation Committee consider many factors in making compensation decisions for our named executive officers. One factor is the risk associated with our compensation programs. We have concluded that our compensation programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company for, among others, the following reasons: we engage an independent, external compensation consultant to assist with developing our executive compensation program; we use time-based restricted stock and, beginning in 2019, performance-based restricted stock units that provide our named executive officers with a significant interest in the long-term performance of our stock, are subject to forfeiture upon certain employment termination events and are capped; we base short-term cash incentive awards on metrics related to our financial and operational goals; and we generally do not base incentive awards on a single performance metric.  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
In connection with its function to oversee and monitor the Company's financial reporting process, the Audit Committee has (1) reviewed and discussed with management the Company's audited financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018; (2) discussed with Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company, the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the SEC; (3) received the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst & Young LLP required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence; and (4) has discussed with Ernst & Young LLP its independence, and considered whether the provision of non-audit services to the Company was compatible with such independence. Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. 
Members of the Audit Committee  
Scott A. Estes, Chairman 
Joyce DeLucca 
Stephen D. Sautel  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a written policy regarding transactions with related parties, which we refer to as our "related party policy." Our related party policy requires that a "related person" (as defined in Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K) must promptly disclose all transactions with related parties (as described in Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K) to the person designated by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company as the compliance officer. All related party transactions must be approved or ratified by either the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board or the full Board. As a general rule, directors interested in a related party transaction will recuse themselves from any vote on a related party transaction in which they have an interest. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or Board will consider all relevant facts and circumstances when deliberating such transactions, including whether such transactions are in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company. 
The following is a summary of related party transactions since January 1, 2018. The related party transactions listed below were all approved by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and/or the Board of Directors. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Concurrently with the completion of our IPO, Eldridge invested $125 million in 7,785,611 shares of common  stock and in 1,142,960 units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership ("OP Units"), which are redeemable for cash, or, at our election, shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis, beginning one year after the issuance of such units, through transactions exempt from the registration requirement of the Securities Act. In connection with our IPO, we repaid short-term  notes, with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $334.0 million, issued to an affiliate of Eldridge. This indebtedness was incurred to acquire properties, and the notes accrued interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of  between 2.14% and 2.55%.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In connection with our IPO, we entered into a registration rights agreement with Eldridge pursuant to which we  agreed to provide certain "demand" registration rights and customary "piggyback" registration rights. The registration rights agreement also provides that we will pay certain expenses relating to such registrations and indemnify  the registration rights holders against certain liabilities which may arise under the Securities Act.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We are party to the Stockholders Agreement with Eldridge. The Stockholders Agreement contains provisions related  to the composition of our Board of Directors and the committees of the Board of Directors. See "Corporate Governance Matters—Stockholders Agreement." The Stockholders Agreement provides, among other things, that so long as Eldridge  owns shares representing 5% of the voting power of our common stock, certain amendments to our charter and our bylaws will require Eldridge's prior approval. Concurrently with the completion of the IPO, we granted a waiver from the ownership  limit contained in our charter to Eldridge to own up to 19.0% of the outstanding shares of our common stock in the aggregate. We also agreed to provide transferees of Eldridge, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, any necessary waivers  from our ownership limits provided that any such waivers are consistent with our compliance with the ownership requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, we  have agreed, upon Eldridge's request, subject to the delivery by Eldridge of any additional information requested by our Board of Directors, to increase the percentage of our outstanding common stock that may be owned by Eldridge, unless the  Board concludes that any such increase could jeopardize our ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In connection with our IPO, the underwriters reserved up to 5.0% of the offered shares for sale to some of our  directors, officers, employees and certain related parties as part of a directed share program. The directed share program does not limit the ability of such directors, officers and their family members, or holders of more than 5% of our capital  stock, to purchase more than $120,000 in value of our common stock.

 PROPOSAL NO. 2—RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF AUDITORS 
The Audit Committee of the Company appointed Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. Stockholders are asked to ratify the appointment of EY at the Annual Meeting. Representatives of EY are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders. 
Accounting Fees and Services 
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed to us by EY for professional services rendered in 2018 and 2017.

 Total    $ 1,633      $ 1,075   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Audit fees consist of fees incurred in connection with the audit of our annual financial statements, as well as  services related to SEC matters, including review of registration statements filed and related issuances of comfort letters, consents and other services.  
(2)  Audit-related fees consist of fees for attestation services rendered by EY related to our Master Trust Funding  Program.  
(3)  Tax fees consist of fees for professional services rendered by EY for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax  planning.  
[END TABLE]
The charter of the Audit Committee provides that the Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of our independent auditor and must pre-approve all audit, audit-related and non-audit services to be provided by our independent auditor, other than certain de minimis non-audit services. In connection with our IPO, the Audit Committee adopted a policy pursuant to which it pre-approves all services to be provided by and fees to be paid to our independent auditor. Following consummation of our IPO, all services provided by EY were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. All non-audit services were reviewed by the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee concluded that the provision of such services by EY was compatible with the maintenance of that firm's independence in the conduct of its auditing functions. The Audit Committee may form and delegate authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit and tax services to subcommittees consisting of one or more members when it deems appropriate, provided that decisions of such subcommittee to grant pre-approvals and take any other actions shall be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. In its review of these services and related fees and terms, the Audit Committee considers, among other things, the possible effect of the performance of such services on the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm. 
None of the services described above were approved pursuant to the de minimis exception provided in Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC. 
Vote Required 
Approval of the ratification of the appointment of EY as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter at the meeting. If the appointment of EY is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its sole discretion,   may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company. Conversely, if stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee may investigate the reasons for stockholder rejection and may consider whether to retain EY or to appoint another independent registered public accounting firm. 
Board Recommendation 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of EY as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.  SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of the Company's common stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. The Company currently knows of no person, other than Eldridge, who owns 10% or more of the Company's common stock. 
Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms furnished to the Company, or written representations from its officers and directors, the Company believes that during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company's officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders satisfied the reporting requirements promulgated under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, with the exception of the following: one late Form 4 filing for each of Messrs. Bossidy and Sautel and Ms. Hai, each of which covered one transaction.  BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK BY CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock, including shares of our common stock into which OP Units are exchangeable, as of March 11, 2019, unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to the table below, for (1) each person who is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock, (2) each of our directors and named executive officers and (3) all of our directors and executive officers as a group. Each person named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to all of the shares of our common stock shown as beneficially owned by such person, except as otherwise set forth in the notes to the table. 
The SEC has defined "beneficial ownership" of a security to mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of voting power and/or investment power over such security. A stockholder is also deemed to be, as of any date, the beneficial owner of all securities that such stockholder has the right to acquire within 60 days after that date through (1) the exercise of any option, warrant or right, (2) the conversion of a security, (3) the power to revoke a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement or (4) the automatic termination of a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of our common stock subject to options or other rights (as set forth above) held by that person that are exercisable as of the date hereof or will become exercisable within 60 days thereafter, are deemed outstanding, while such shares are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing percentage ownership of any other person. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each named person is c/o Essential Properties Realty Trust, Inc., 902 Carnegie Center Boulevard, Suite 520, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. No shares beneficially owned by any executive officer or director have been pledged as security.
