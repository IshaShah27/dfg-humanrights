EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
We ask that you approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers. The named executive officers are those executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table. The advisory approval of named executive officer compensation is required by federal law, and while the vote is not binding, the Compensation Committee considers the vote as part of its evaluation of executive compensation programs. 
2018 Executive Compensation Highlights 
In 2018, our management team continued to execute on its strategy of helping our clients – individual investors, registered investment advisors and employers – to achieve their financial goals. This "Through Clients' Eyes" strategy, combined with ongoing expense discipline, aided us in producing record core net new assets of $227.8 billion, total client assets of $3.25 trillion, and a record pre-tax profit margin of 45.0%. Earnings per share (EPS) was $2.45 (up 52% over the prior year), and return on common equity (ROCE) was 19%, the highest since 2008. 
The company's compensation programs are designed to link pay to the long-term performance of the company. Key elements of 2018 compensation included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Base Salary·  Cash·  Reviewed  annually·  Attract,  motivate and retain executives 
 Annual Incentives·  Cash·  Subject to  satisfaction of performance criteria·  Attract, motivate and retain executives·  Reward executives for individual performance·  Link pay with company financial performance 
 Annual Incentives·  Cash·  Subject to  satisfaction of performance criteria·  Attract, motivate and retain executives·  Reward executives for individual performance·  Link pay with company financial performance 
 Long-term Incentives·  Performance-based   restricted stock units·  Restricted  stock units with cliff-vesting based on a three-year performance period, subject to satisfaction of performance criteria·  Attract, motivate and retain executives·  Reward executives for individual performance 
 Long-term Incentives·  Performance-based   restricted stock units·  Restricted  stock units with cliff-vesting based on a three-year performance period, subject to satisfaction of performance criteria·  Attract, motivate and retain executives·  Reward executives for individual performance 
·  Stock  options·  Stock  options generally vest 25% per year and have a ten-year term·  Link pay with company financial performance·  Align with long-term interests of stockholders 
[END TABLE]
Given the company's financial performance in 2018, the Compensation Committee approved funding at 111.6% of the target award for the named executive officers for annual cash incentives. The performance goal for performance-based restricted stock units (PBRSUs) granted in 2018 was based on ROCE divided by cost of equity capital (COE) to align the executives' incentives with the long-term interests of stockholders. The PBRSUs have cliff-vesting based on a three-year performance period. 
Summary compensation information for the named executive officers is contained in the following table. As discussed in the proxy statement, these amounts are presented in accordance with accounting assumptions and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, and the amount that the executive actually receives may vary substantially from what is reported in the equity columns of the table.

PROXY STATEMENT 
The Board of Directors is sending these proxy materials to you on or about March 29, 2019. Stockholders who owned the company's common stock at the close of business on March 18, 2019 may attend and vote at the annual meeting. Each share is entitled to one vote. There were 1,334,221,067 shares of common stock outstanding on March 18, 2019. 
VOTING YOUR SHARES 
Please vote as promptly as possible by following the instructions on your proxy card or voting instruction form. You may vote by internet, telephone or mail in advance of the meeting by following the instructions on your proxy card or voting instruction form. 
If you do not vote in advance and plan to submit your vote at the annual meeting, you will need a legal proxy to vote your shares if your shares are held in "street name" (e.g., through a bank or broker). You may obtain a legal proxy from your bank or broker. If you plan to vote at the virtual meeting, please send your legal proxy to our transfer agent, Equiniti Trust Company, by fax to (651) 450-4026 or email to wfssproxyteam@eq-us.com. If you plan to vote at the in-person meeting, please bring the legal proxy with you. If you hold shares registered in your name (e.g., in certificate form), you will not need a legal proxy to vote your shares at the annual meeting. 
ATTENDING THE ANNUAL MEETING 
You must register in advance to attend the annual meeting virtually via the internet or in person. To register, please go to: 
www.schwabevents.com/corporation. 
You will be asked to provide your name, mailing address, email address and proof that you own Schwab shares (such as the Schwab account number in which you hold the shares, or the name of the broker and number of shares that you hold in an account outside of Schwab). You also may write the Assistant Corporate Secretary at the address in the "Corporate Governance" section of this proxy statement or call the Assistant Corporate Secretary at (415) 667-9979 if you plan to attend the in-person meeting. 
If you register in advance to attend the virtual annual meeting, we will email you information on how to access the area of www.schwabevents.com where you will be able to submit questions and vote. While you may watch the webcast without registering in advance, you will not be able to access the area of the website where you can ask questions and vote. 
If you plan to attend the in-person meeting, in accordance with our security procedures, you will be asked to present picture identification to enter the meeting. Attendance at the annual meeting is limited to stockholders or one named representative of a stockholder. Seating is limited and, therefore, admission to the in-person annual meeting is on a first-come, first-served basis. If you will be naming a representative to attend the meeting on your behalf, the name, address and telephone number of that individual also must be provided.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The Company 
The Charles Schwab Corporation is a savings and loan holding company that engages, through its subsidiaries, in wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services. At December 31, 2018, the company had $3.25 trillion in client assets, 11.6 million active brokerage accounts, 1.7 million corporate retirement plan participants, and 1.3 million banking accounts. 
The company was founded on the belief that all Americans deserve access to a better investing experience. Although much has changed in the intervening years, our purpose remains clear – to champion every client's goals with passion and integrity. Guided by this purpose and our vision of creating the most trusted leader in investment services, management has adopted a strategy described as "Through Clients' Eyes." 
Board Leadership 
The Chairman of the Board is Mr. Schwab. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles are split, and Mr. Bettinger serves as Chief Executive Officer. The Chairman of the Board approves the agenda for board meetings and leads the board in its discussions. Mr. Schwab and Mr. Bettinger, as the only two management directors, do not participate in sessions of non-management directors. As provided in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, non-management directors meet regularly in executive session without management. The Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, Mr. Herringer, presides over the executive sessions of non-management directors.  
The board has four standing committees (Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance, and Risk) composed entirely of independent directors and chaired by independent directors. Given the role and scope of authority of these committees, and that over 85% of the board is composed of independent directors, the board believes that its leadership structure, with the Chairman of the Board leading board discussions, and the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee leading non-management executive sessions, is appropriate. 
Risk Oversight 
As part of its oversight functions, the board is responsible for oversight of risk management at the company. The Risk Committee assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the company's risk management program and provides reports to the board and the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews reports from management and the Risk Committee concerning the company's risk assessment and major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Compensation Committee oversees incentive compensation risk and reviews the compensation program with respect to the potential impact of risk-taking by employees. For further discussion of risk management at the company, please see "Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Risk Management" of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Board Structure and Committees 
The authorized number of directors is currently fourteen and the company has fourteen directors. There are five nominees for election this year and nine directors will continue to serve the terms described in their biographies. 
Directors currently serve staggered terms. Each director who is elected at an annual meeting of stockholders serves a three-year term, and the directors are divided into three classes.  The board held seven meetings in 2018. Each director attended at least 75% of all applicable board and committee meetings during 2018. As provided in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, we expect directors to attend the annual meeting of stockholders. In 2018, fourteen of the then fifteen directors attended the annual meeting. 
Each of our four standing committees is composed entirely of "independent directors" as determined by the board in accordance with its independence guidelines and New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards. In addition to these standing committees, the board may from time to time establish ad hoc committees to assist in various matters. 
Each standing committee conducts its own self-assessment annually and reports the results to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or to the full board. The board also conducts its self-assessment on an annual basis. 
The board and its committees are currently comprised of the following individuals:

The Audit Committee held twelve meetings in 2018. None of the directors on the Audit Committee is, or during the past three years, has been an employee of The Charles Schwab Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. None of the Audit Committee members simultaneously serves on the audit committees of more than three public companies, including ours. The board has determined that all of the members of the Audit Committee are financially literate in accordance with New York Stock Exchange listing standards and that Mr. Goldfarb, Mr. Adams, Jr., Mr. Dodds, Mr. Ellis, and Mr. Haraf are Audit Committee financial experts in accordance with SEC rules. The Audit Committee:

 BOARD QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly assesses the board's composition in light of our business operations, strategic direction and risk profile to assure appropriate succession, and our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the board should be composed of directors who have the qualifications necessary for effective service as determined in this assessment. Set forth below are some of the experience, skills and competencies that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee views as important for these purposes and believes that the board as a whole should possess.

We have considered the independence of each member of the board in accordance with New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards. To assist us in our determination, we have general guidelines for independence. The guidelines for independence are available on the company's website at www.aboutschwab.com/governance. 
Based on our guidelines and New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards, we have determined that each of the company's directors, except Mr. Bettinger and Mr. Schwab, is independent. We have determined that Mr. Wilson, who retired from the board during 2019, was independent during the time he served on the board in 2018 and 2019. In addition, each of the board's standing committees is composed entirely of independent directors as determined by the board. 
In determining independence, the board considers broadly all relevant facts and circumstances regarding a director's relationships with the company. All non-employee directors receive compensation from the company for their service as directors, as disclosed in the section "Director Compensation," and are entitled to receive reimbursement for their expenses in traveling to and participating in board and committee meetings. As disclosed in the "Transactions with Related Persons" section of this proxy statement, some directors and entities with which they are affiliated have credit transactions with the company's banking and brokerage subsidiaries, such as mortgage loans, revolving lines of credit, or other extensions of credit. These transactions with directors and their affiliates are made in the ordinary course of business and as permitted by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such transactions are on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the lender and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. 
In addition to the relationships outlined above, the board considered the following as part of its determination of independence: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Joan T. Dea: The director's spouse serves as a trustee of a nonprofit organization to which the company, its affiliates or its charitable  foundation have made donations.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

 DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommended all of the nominees for election included in this year's proxy statement. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has a policy to consider candidates recommended by stockholders. The policy requires written stockholder recommendations that include the following information: (i) the name, address and contact information of the recommending stockholder; (ii) proof of the stockholder's share ownership; (iii) a resume or statement of the candidate's qualifications; and (iv) a statement of the stockholder's relationship with the proposed candidate or interest in the proposed candidacy. The written recommendation must be addressed to the Assistant Corporate Secretary at the address provided in the "Corporate Governance" section of this proxy statement. 
Diversity 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the qualifications and experience represented on the board when identifying director nominees and assessing the composition of the board. As discussed in the "Director Qualifications" section below, the board's evaluation encompasses the diversity of experience and background of directors. This consideration includes diversity of skill sets and experience as well as background, including race and gender. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers these qualifications and regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of the board in maintaining a balance of perspectives important to the company's business. 
Director Qualifications 
The qualifications for directors are described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are available on the company's website at www.aboutschwab.com/governance. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that the following specific, minimum qualifications must be met by a nominee for the position of director: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the ability to work together with other directors, with full and open discussion and debate as an effective group,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· current knowledge of and experience in the company's business or operations, or contacts in the community in which the company does business and  in the industries relevant to the company's business, or substantial business, financial or industry-related experience commensurate with the size, complexity and risk profile of the company, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the willingness and ability to devote adequate time to the company's business.  
[END TABLE]
The committee also considers the following qualities and skills when making its determination whether a nominee is qualified for the position of director: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· relationships that may affect the independence of the director or conflicts of interest that may affect the director's ability to discharge his or  her duties,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· diversity of experience, including the need for financial, business, academic, public sector and other expertise on the board or board committees, and  diversity of background, including race and gender, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the fit of the individual's skills and experience with those of the other directors and potential directors in comparison to the needs of the  company.  
[END TABLE]
When evaluating a candidate for nomination, the committee does not assign specific weight to any of these factors or believe that all of the criteria necessarily apply to every candidate.  Identifying and Evaluating Candidates for Director 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics required of board members in the context of the current composition of the board, as well as director qualifications as determined by the board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates capabilities valuable to the company's business and commensurate with the size, complexity and risk profile of the company and, as needed, to bring fresh perspective to the board. Candidates considered for nomination to the Board of Directors may come from several sources, including current and former directors, professional search firms and stockholder recommendations. Nominees for director are evaluated, in consultation with the company's Chairman, by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which may retain the services of a professional search firm to assist it in identifying or evaluating potential candidates. 
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
If you wish to communicate with the board, the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, or the independent directors as a group, you may send your communication in writing to the Assistant Corporate Secretary at the address provided in the "Corporate Governance" section of this proxy statement. You must include your name and address in the written communication and indicate whether you are a stockholder of the company. 
The Assistant Corporate Secretary will compile all communications, summarize lengthy, repetitive or duplicative communications and forward them to the appropriate director or directors. The Assistant Corporate Secretary will not forward non-substantive communications or communications that pertain to personal grievances, but instead will forward them to the appropriate department within the company for resolution. In such cases, the Assistant Corporate Secretary will retain a copy of such communication for review by any director upon his or her request. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Mr. Schwab and Mr. Bettinger, who are employed by the company, receive no additional compensation for their service as directors. In 2018, non-employee directors received the following cash retainers and equity grants: 
Cash Retainers 
Each non-employee director received an annual cash retainer in the amount of $100,000. In addition, the Chairs of the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee each received an annual cash retainer of $40,000, and the other members of the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee each received an annual cash retainer of $15,000. The Chair of the Compensation Committee received an annual cash retainer of $30,000, and the other members of the Compensation Committee each received an annual cash retainer of $10,000. The Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee received an annual cash retainer of $25,000, and the other members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee each received an annual cash retainer of $10,000. 
There are no fees for attendance at board or committee meetings, but the board retains the discretion to establish special committees and to pay a special retainer to the Chair and the members of any special committee. 
Equity Grants 
Each non-employee director received an annual equity grant under the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan with an aggregate value of $160,000. Non-employee directors received this equity grant 50% in stock options and 50% in restricted stock units (RSUs).  Terms and Conditions 
Non-employee directors receive the annual grants of options and RSUs on the second business day after the annual meeting of stockholders. In the event a new non-employee director is elected to the board during the year, a pro-rata amount of cash retainers and equity awards is granted to that individual for the first calendar year in lieu of the full amount. The non-employee director equity grants are subject to the following terms and conditions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The annual grants of options and RSUs vest over the three-year period following the grant date, with 25% vesting on each of the first and second  anniversary of the grant date and the remaining 50% on the third anniversary of the grant date. The options and RSUs become 100% vested in the event of the non-employee director's death, disability or  retirement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The number of RSUs for the annual grant is determined by dividing 50% of the aggregate value of the annual equity grant by the average of the high and  low market price of the company's common stock on the grant date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The number of options for the annual grant of stock options is determined by dividing 50% of the aggregate value of the annual equity grant by the fair  value of an option on the grant date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Each stock option is designated as a nonqualified stock option and has an exercise price equal to the fair market value of common stock on the grant  date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Each stock option expires on the earliest of (1) the date ten years after the grant date, (2) the date three months after termination of  service for any reason other than death, disability or retirement, or (3) the date one year after termination of service because of death or disability.  
[END TABLE]
The company also has stock ownership guidelines for non-employee directors. Under our guidelines, each non-employee director should own company stock with a fair market value equal to or exceeding $400,000. A new director should reach this target level upon completing five years of service. Once this target level is reached, the director is deemed to meet this target so long as he or she continues to hold an equivalent number of shares as on the date the target level was met. Shares owned outright, deferred shares and RSUs are counted in determining the threshold under our stock ownership guidelines, but stock options are not. 
Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan 
Non-employee directors also may participate in the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan II. This plan allows them to defer receipt of all or a portion of their cash retainers and, at their election, either to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· have a fair value equal to the amounts deferred (as determined under the valuation method used by the company to value stock options at the time of the  deferral),  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· have an option exercise price equal to the closing price of common stock on the date the deferred amount would have been paid, and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· vest immediately upon grant and generally expire ten years after the grant date,  
[END TABLE]
– or –  The company does not provide any non-equity incentive plans, defined benefit and actuarial pension plans, or other defined contribution retirement plans for non-employee directors. The company does not offer above-market or preferential earnings under its nonqualified deferred compensation plans for directors. The following table shows compensation paid to each of our non-employee directors during 2018.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
No member of the Compensation Committee is or has been an officer or employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries. There were no Compensation Committee interlocks as defined under SEC rules during 2018.  PROPOSAL TWO: 
RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 
The Audit Committee has the sole authority to hire, retain and terminate the independent auditors. The independent auditors report directly to the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee is directly responsible for oversight of the work of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee oversees fees paid to the independent auditors and pre-approves all audit, internal control-related and permitted non-audit services to be performed by the independent auditors. The Audit Committee evaluates the qualifications, performance and independence of the independent auditors, including the rotation and selection of the lead audit partner and whether it is appropriate to rotate the audit firm itself. 
The Audit Committee has selected Deloitte & Touche LLP and the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (collectively referred to as Deloitte) as the company's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year. Deloitte has served in this capacity since the company's inception. The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the retention of Deloitte for the 2019 fiscal year is in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. Although we are not required to submit the selection of the independent auditors to stockholders, we are asking for your ratification as part of the Audit Committee's evaluation process of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next fiscal year. 
We expect representatives of Deloitte to attend the annual meeting of stockholders, where they will respond to appropriate questions from stockholders and have the opportunity to make a statement. 
AUDITOR FEES 
Fees for services provided by Deloitte in the last two fiscal years were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

In addition to the services listed above, Deloitte provides audit and tax return review, preparation and compliance services to certain unconsolidated charitable trusts and foundations. The fees for such services are included in the expenses of the charitable trusts and foundations and borne by the stockholders of the funds and foundations.   Amounts billed by Deloitte for these services were $0.2 million in 2018 and $0.2 million in 2017. These amounts are not included in the expenses of The Charles Schwab Corporation. 
Non-Audit Services Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy regarding non-audit services performed by Deloitte. The Audit Committee's policy prohibits engaging Deloitte to perform the following services: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· any contingent fee arrangement,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· bookkeeping or other services relating to accounting records or financial statements of the audit client,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· broker-dealer services,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· actuarial services,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· management and human resource functions (including executive search services),  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· appraisal and valuation services, fairness opinions or  contribution-in-kind reports,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· internal audit outsourcing,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· financial information systems design and implementation,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· tax consulting or advice or a tax opinion on an "aggressive" tax position or on a "listed transaction" or a "confidential  transaction" as defined by U.S. Department of Treasury regulations, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· tax services to employees who have a financial reporting oversight role.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee may approve other non-audit services in advance of their performance as part of its review and approval of Deloitte's audit service plan. In addition, the Audit Committee has pre-approved three separate categories of non-audit services under the policy subject to an annual aggregate dollar limit for each category. Once the dollar limit in each of these three categories is reached, the Audit Committee will decide whether to establish an additional spending limit for the category or specifically pre-approve each additional service in the category for the remainder of the year. The three categories are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· accounting theory consultation (includes services such as guidance on the application of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to various  transactions and guidance on the effects of new accounting pronouncements),  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· assurance and due diligence (includes services such as certain service auditor reports over internal controls, review of Securities and Exchange  Commission filings, merger and acquisition due diligence, employee benefit plan audits, and foreign statutory audits and regulatory reports), and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· tax return review, preparation and compliance.  
[END TABLE]
Services not subject to pre-approval limits in one of the three categories above require specific pre-approval from the Audit Committee. Fees related to services requiring specific pre-approval are limited, on an annual basis, to 50% of the combination of audit fees, audit-related fees and tax fees. 
The policy permits the Audit Committee to delegate pre-approval authority to one or more members of the Audit Committee, provided that the member or members report to the entire Audit Committee pre-approval actions taken since the last Audit Committee meeting. The policy expressly prohibits delegation of pre-approval authority to management. 
In fiscal years 2018 and 2017, the Audit Committee approved 100% of the services performed by Deloitte relating to "audit-related fees."

 PROPOSAL THREE: 
ADVISORY APPROVAL OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
This proxy statement contains detailed information in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and executive compensation tables regarding compensation of the named executive officers. The "named executive officers" are those executive officers who are listed in the Summary Compensation Table. We ask that you provide an advisory vote to approve the following, non-binding resolution on named executive officer compensation: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of The Charles Schwab Corporation approve the compensation paid to the named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and related footnotes, and narrative disclosures. 
The advisory approval of named executive officer compensation is required by federal law, and the company currently conducts annual advisory votes on that compensation. Although the vote is not binding on the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee intends to consider the vote as part of its evaluation of executive compensation programs. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This section describes the company's executive compensation program, policies and practices and how executive compensation is designed to support the company's strategic objectives. 
Key Business Results 
The company's strategy is to put clients' perspectives, needs, and desires at the forefront by seeing business "Through Clients' Eyes." Because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security, the company strives to deliver a better investing experience for its clients – individual investors and the people and institutions who serve them – by disrupting longstanding industry practices on their behalf and providing superior service. In pursuing this strategy, the company: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Offers a broad range of products and solutions to meet client needs with a focus on transparency and value,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Combines its scale and resources with ongoing expense discipline to keep costs low and ensure that products and solutions are affordable as well as  responsive to client needs, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Seeks to maximize its market valuation and stockholder returns over time.  
[END TABLE]
Effective execution of this strategy in 2018, bolstered by strength in the equity markets for much of the year, was reflected in key client metrics: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Core net new assets of $227.8 billion marked the sixth consecutive year at or above $125 billion and a 7% annual organic growth rate.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· 11.6 million active brokerage accounts and 1.3 million banking accounts at year end, up 8% and 9% respectively, over year-end 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Total client assets reaching a peak of $3.56 trillion during the year before fourth quarter market value effects resulted in a total of  $3.25 trillion as of December 31, 2018, down 3% from year-end 2017. Of these assets, more than half ($1.71 trillion) were receiving some form of ongoing advisory service, up 1%: $1.44 trillion were  under the guidance of an independent advisor and $272 billion were enrolled in a retail advisory solution.  
[END TABLE]
 Success with clients combined with a generally favorable environment and ongoing expense discipline in 2018 led to record financial performance: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Net revenues of $10.1 billion were up 18% over 2017, and net income of $3.5 billion was up 49% – both amounts are records for the firm.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Revenue growth was approximately 550 basis points higher than our 12% expense growth during the year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Pre-tax profit margin of 45.0% was up 260 basis points over the prior year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Earnings per share (EPS) of $2.45 was up 52% over the prior year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Return on common equity (ROCE) was 19%, the highest in 10 years.  
[END TABLE]
A more thorough discussion of the company's business, business strategy and results is provided in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Executive Compensation Program 
The executive compensation program is intended to support the company's strategic objectives by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· attracting, motivating and retaining talented, highly capable executive officers,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· rewarding executives for individual performance,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· linking executive pay with the company's financial performance, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· aligning incentives for executive officers with the interests of the company and its stockholders by linking pay with longer-term performance.

 The compensation program uses three elements – base salary, annual cash incentives and long-term incentive awards (LTI) – to achieve these objectives. As illustrated by the charts below, the majority of compensation is delivered through variable performance-based incentives. This approach maintains a strong link between executive pay and the company's financial performance, rewards executives only when value has been created for stockholders, and drives long-term performance. 
Key Compensation Decisions 
The company's "Through Clients' Eyes" strategy is based on the principle that developing trusted relationships will translate into more assets from new and existing clients, ultimately driving more revenue and, along with expense discipline, generating earnings growth and building long-term stockholder value. 
The Compensation Committee's decisions for 2018 aligned with this disciplined focus on financial results. In 2018, the Compensation Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Continued to use EPS as the performance criterion for the Corporate Executive Bonus Plan because it measures profitability and focuses executive  officers on operating performance and decisions around capital structure.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Set the target EPS goal for 100% payout upon achieving the company's financial plan approved by the board.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Approved annual cash incentive payouts under the Corporate Executive Bonus Plan of 111.6% of the target set by the Compensation Committee based on the  company's financial performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Awarded PBRSUs with cliff-vesting based on a three-year performance period to ensure continued focus on long-term performance and retention.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Continued to use ROCE equaling or exceeding COE as the performance goal for the 2018 PBRSUs, because it reflects the creation of financial value for  stockholders in all phases of the business cycle and measures the earnings power of the company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Expanded retirement eligibility for equity awards, the Corporate Executive Bonus Plan and the Deferred Compensation Plan II to include individuals who  are at least age 65 with at least 5 years of service in addition to individuals who are at least age 55 with 10 years of service to attract late-career talent.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee continuously reviews and evaluates the company's compensation program and policies and considers stockholder views regarding executive compensation. For the 2019 program, the Compensation Committee made decisions that maintain the strong relationship between compensation opportunity and the management team's success in executing on the business strategy. For 2019, the Compensation Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Selected EPS as the performance criterion for the Corporate Executive Bonus Plan and set the target EPS goal for 100% payout upon achieving the  company's financial plan approved by the board.

COMPENSATION PLANNING AND THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS 
The Compensation Committee reviews and approves compensation for the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, executive officers, and other senior officers, and it reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors compensation for the non-employee directors.  The Compensation Committee evaluates as a committee, or together with the other independent directors and the Chairman, the performance and compensation of the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee also considers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· recommendations from the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer regarding compensation for the other executive officers and performance criteria for  annual and long-term incentives, developed in consultation with the Executive Vice President – Human Resources,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· recommendations from the Chief Financial Officer regarding performance criteria and goals for annual and long-term incentives,   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· advice from the Executive Vice President – Corporate Risk regarding the design and results of incentive compensation programs to ensure  consistency with the company's financial plan, strategic objectives and risk profile, and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· guidance and advice of its independent compensation consultant, Semler Brossy Consulting Group (Semler Brossy).  
[END TABLE]
While the Compensation Committee considers the information provided by management and its independent compensation consultant, it does not delegate authority to management for executive compensation decisions. 
The Compensation Committee's review of named executive officer compensation in 2018 included consideration of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the economic environment, market trends, and proposed regulations,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a competitive pay analysis of peer companies with data from proxy statements and the McLagan 2017 Top Management Survey,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· each executive's experience, responsibilities, individual performance, and pay relative to internal peers, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· reports prepared by the independent compensation consultant and the company's Human Resources Department on each executive's pay history  with:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· actual total compensation from 2014 to 2017,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· proposed 2018 total compensation,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· option exercises, equity vesting amounts, dividend equivalents, 401(k) balances, deferred compensation balances, and other cash compensation (e.g.,  company match for the 401(k) plan),  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the value and vesting schedule of outstanding long-term awards, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· each component of pay as a percentage of total compensation.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee does not use a formula or assign a weighting to various factors considered in setting compensation. It does not target a specific percentage mix between cash compensation and long-term incentives or any specific percentage of total compensation for each compensation component. 
The Compensation Committee uses a peer group as a source of market data to assess the competitiveness of compensation and pay practices for executive officers and non-employee directors. The data is not used to set compensation targets. Peers were selected considering the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Quantitative: revenue, market capitalization, and number of employees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Qualitative: business model, geographic coverage, and competition for customers and/or employees.  
[END TABLE]
 Because the company has few competitors comparable in terms of business model and geographic coverage, the peer group includes a mix of brokerage firms, banking and asset management companies, and companies that provide custody services and process a significant daily volume of consumer financial transactions. The peer group of 24 companies used for compensation for 2018 was: 
Compensation Consultant 
Under its charter, the Compensation Committee is authorized to retain compensation consultants and to approve the terms of the engagement. In 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Semler Brossy to review pay trends across the financial services industry and in the peer group, advise directly on Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and non-employee director compensation, provide competitive assessments of executive compensation, review long-term incentives as well as the long-term incentives used by companies in the peer group, assist with the review and analysis of the peer group, and provide general advice and counsel with respect to executive compensation programs, market practices and trends. Semler Brossy was engaged by the Compensation Committee directly and does not provide other services to the company. In 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed information regarding potential conflicts of interest with Semler Brossy, including: other services it might provide to the company, fees received from the company as a percentage of its total revenue, policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest, any business and/or personal relationships with members of the Compensation Committee, company stock owned, and any business and/or personal relationships between Semler Brossy consultants and any executive officer of the company.  ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION 
Base salary, annual cash incentives and long-term incentives are the key compensation elements for achieving the company's objectives. The following adjustments were made to base salary, annual cash incentives and long-term incentives of the named executive officers in 2018:

Base salaries are established at levels intended to attract, motivate and retain highly capable executive officers. As illustrated by the pay mix charts in the Executive Summary above, executive officers receive a small percentage of their overall compensation in base salary. The Compensation Committee approved the following base salaries effective March 1, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Joseph R. Martinetto      $ 700,000  
 Terri R. Kallsen      $ 550,000  
[END TABLE]
 Annual Cash Incentives 
Annual cash incentive awards for the named executive officers were made pursuant to the Corporate Executive Bonus Plan. In the first quarter of 2018, the Compensation Committee established the performance criterion, set performance goals and approved a target bonus award, expressed as a percentage of salary, for each named executive officer. In March 2018, the Compensation Committee increased Mr. Martinetto's bonus target for 2018 by 10% in recognition of his promotion to Chief Operating Officer and the increase in his responsibilities. 
The Compensation Committee approved the following annual incentives for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Walter W. Bettinger II        375%      $ 4,781,250       $ 5,335,875  
 Peter B. Crawford        150%      $ 706,250        $ 788,175  
 Charles R. Schwab        250%      $ 1,708,333       $ 1,906,500  
 Joseph R. Martinetto        210%      $ 1,443,750        $ 1,611,225  
 Terri R. Kallsen        175%      $ 955,208       $ 1,066,012  
[END TABLE]
EPS was established as the performance criterion for all named executive officers. The Compensation Committee believes EPS provides a comprehensive measure of the company's profitability and focuses executive officers on operating performance and decisions around capital structure. For purposes of the Corporate Executive Bonus Plan, EPS is calculated as fully diluted EPS calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, subject to categories of adjustments and exclusions approved by the Compensation Committee at the time the performance criterion was established. EPS goals were summarized in a matrix with potential payouts ranging from 50% to 200% of the target bonus award, with a 100% payout assigned to the EPS goal set by the Compensation Committee. Achieving EPS of less than 50% of the target EPS goal would result in no bonus payment; achieving EPS between 50% and 100% of the target EPS goal would result in a payout of between 50% and 100% of the target bonus award; and achieving EPS of more than the target EPS goal would result in a payout of between 100% and 200% of the target bonus award. The threshold of 50% of target EPS was adopted to establish the minimum level of achievement for a bonus payment, and a cap on bonus payout was set at 200% of the target award. When determining whether the performance goals have been achieved, the Compensation Committee reviews unusual gains and losses and whether results have been achieved in a manner consistent with the company's risk profile. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee may exercise discretion to reduce payouts.  In 2018, the target EPS goal was set at $2.20; the maximum payment was 200% of the target bonus award for EPS of $4.40 or higher; and the minimum payment was 50% of the target bonus award for EPS of $1.10. The target EPS goal of $2.20 was set to result in a payout of 100% of the target bonus award for performance in line with the company's financial plans approved by the board. For 2018, the Compensation Committee approved payouts based on EPS of $2.45. The Compensation Committee determined that the company achieved these results while maintaining a low credit risk profile and remaining within its parameters for interest rate risk. The Compensation Committee did not reduce the cash incentive award for any individual named executive officer and approved funding at 111.6% of target for each of the named executive officers. 
Long-Term Incentives 
At its January 2018 meeting, the Compensation Committee approved equity awards to be granted on March 1, 2018 for the named executive officers pursuant to the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan. Of the total target equity awards granted, 50% was granted in stock options and 50% was granted in PBRSUs to align the incentives of executives with the long-term interests of stockholders. 
The Compensation Committee increased the value of the awards granted to Mr. Martinetto by $250,000 in January in recognition of his individual performance, pay relative to internal peers and pay relative to external compensation data. In March 2018, in recognition of his promotion to Chief Operating Officer and the increase in his responsibilities, the Compensation Committee approved a one-time grant to Mr. Martinetto of $375,000 in stock options and $375,000 in PBRSUs with a grant date of April 2, 2018 with the terms and conditions noted below for the March 1, 2018 grants. 
The Compensation Committee approved the following equity awards for 2018:

Stock Options 
The Compensation Committee approved stock options to be granted on March 1, 2018 vesting 25% annually over four years. The stock options provide for accelerated vesting due to a change in control, death or disability, or retirement, and the amounts associated with accelerated vesting are included in the Termination and Change in Control Benefits Table.  Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units 
The Compensation Committee approved PBRSUs with cliff-vesting based on the three-year performance period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020. The main features of the 2018 PBRSUs are summarized below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

   Performance Criteria·   ROCE·   COE 
   Performance Criteria·   ROCE·   COE 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee approved performance goals based on ROCE and COE with potential payouts ranging from 100% to 200% of the target shares granted. Where ROCE divided by COE equals between 1 and 2, 100% of target shares are paid. Where ROCE divided by COE equals less than 1, the target shares are forfeited. Where ROCE divided by COE equals more than 2, the target shares are paid out in a range from 100% to 200% of target. 
The Compensation Committee approved performance criteria based on ROCE and COE because it reflects the creation of financial value for stockholders in all phases of the business cycle and measures the earnings power of the company. The opportunity for a payout up to 200% of the target award incents executives to exceed target performance and directly links the magnitude of the payout to the company's performance up to a cap of 200%. If the Compensation Committee certifies that the goal has been met for the performance period, then the award for that performance period will vest. If the goal has not been met, then the PBRSUs and associated dividend equivalent payments will be forfeited. 
ROCE is calculated as net income available to common stockholders divided by average common stockholders' equity, for the performance period, subject to categories of adjustments and exclusions approved by the Compensation Committee at the time the performance criteria were established. 
COE is calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAP-M), which is a commonly used financial metric that incorporates the risk-free interest rate (the company uses the six-month average of the five-year Treasury rate), the beta of the company's equity (a measure of the volatility of the company's common stock relative to the broader equity market), and a market equity risk premium (an estimate of the expected excess return required for holding equities instead of a risk-free asset). 
In determining whether the performance goals have been met, the Compensation Committee excludes losses from any unusual or non-recurring items, including, but not limited to: discontinued operations; the cumulative negative effects   of changes in accounting principles and laws; losses on divestitures; losses on foreign exchange transactions; impairment of goodwill, intangible or long-lived assets; litigation-related charges; restructuring charges; and any other unusual or non-recurring losses. 
The PBRSUs provide for accelerated vesting and payment of target awards due to a change in control, death or disability. The PBRSUs also provide for continued vesting following termination under the Charles Schwab Severance Pay Plan (Severance Plan) or retirement, subject to achievement of performance goals established at the time such awards were granted. The values of awards subject to these accelerated vesting and continued vesting provisions are included in the Termination and Change in Control Benefits Table. 
Vesting of Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units for the Performance Period Ending December 31, 2018 
In January 2016 the Compensation Committee granted performance-based equity awards with cliff-vesting and a three-year performance period ending December 31, 2018. These awards only vest if the Compensation Committee certifies that the applicable performance goals have been achieved. The Compensation Committee chose ROCE compared to COE as the performance criterion for these equity awards, because it reflects the creation of financial value for stockholders in all phases of the business cycle and measures the earnings power of the company. Shares are earned at target when ROCE divided by COE equals at least 1 and no more than 2. Shares are earned above target when ROCE divided by COE is greater than 2. For PBRSUs vesting based on the three-year performance period ending December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee determined the performance goal was met and approved payouts based on ROCE of 16.0% and COE of 8.8%, achieving target performance and resulting in a payout at target. The Compensation Committee determined the achievement of the performance goals excluding 2017 charges related to tax reform and location strategy and a gain related to a tax benefit associated with equity compensation. The Compensation Committee certified achievement of the following performance goal for awards with the performance period ending in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Changes to Retirement Eligibility 
At its December 2017 meeting, the Compensation Committee expanded retirement eligibility for retirements on or after March 1, 2018 for equity awards, the Corporate Executive Bonus Plan, and the Deferred Compensation Plan II to include individuals who terminate employment after attaining age 65, with at least 5 years of service, in addition to individuals who terminate employment after attaining age 55, with 10 years of service. For individuals who are retirement eligible, RSUs and non-qualified stock options vest at termination, while PBRSUs continue to vest following retirement and are payable on the original payment schedule subject to the company's attainment of the performance goals. Under the Corporate Executive Bonus Plan, the Compensation Committee may award a bonus to employees who retire prior to the end of the performance period based on the achievement of the performance criteria. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan II, deferral elections are honored for employees who are retirement eligible, while accounts of employees who are not retirement eligible are paid out in the year following termination.  Other Compensation 
Executive Benefits and Perquisites 
The company provides limited executive perquisites. The Compensation Committee previously approved certain benefits for Mr. Bettinger, including a car service for commuting purposes, which he has not used, parking, and use of fractionally-owned aircraft consistent with company policies. 
For named executive officers, the company: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· does not provide financial planning assistance,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· does not gross up payments to cover executives' personal tax liability,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· does not offer executive retirement or medical plans, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· does not match contributions to the deferred compensation plan.  
[END TABLE]
Employee Benefit Plans 
The company offers no defined benefit plan, special retirement plan for executives or other nonqualified excess plans to named executive officers. Executive officers may participate in the company's 401(k) plan and employee stock purchase plan available to all eligible employees subject to Internal Revenue Service limits (except Mr. Schwab, who is excluded from the employee stock purchase plan because he owns more than 5% of the company's stock), and a deferred compensation plan available to officers and other key employees. 
Severance 
All employees, including executive officers other than Mr. Schwab, are eligible to receive severance benefits under the Severance Plan, which is described in the narrative following the Termination and Change in Control Benefits Table. Benefits are available under this plan only in the event of termination of employment on account of job elimination. Under the severance program, executive officers are eligible to receive 15 days of base salary for each year of service with a minimum of seven months and a maximum of 12 months of severance pay. Mr. Schwab is entitled to severance benefits pursuant to his employment agreement, as described in the narrative to the Summary Compensation Table. 
Compensation Policies 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board of Directors has adopted stock ownership guidelines to promote significant equity ownership by executives and further align their long-term financial interests with those of other stockholders. Under the guidelines: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· The Chief Executive Officer is expected to maintain an investment position in company stock equal to at least five times base salary.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· All other executive officers are expected to maintain an investment position equal to at least three times base salary. 
[END TABLE]
Shares owned directly, shares beneficially owned under company benefit plans, restricted stock, RSUs, and PBRSUs are included in determining ownership levels, but stock options are not. The stock ownership guidelines allow the Compensation Committee to take action if the target ownership levels are not met within five years. For 2018, all of the named executive officers had stock ownership exceeding the guidelines.  Prohibition on Speculative Trading in Company Stock 
Speculative trading in the company's stock is prohibited. Prohibited speculative trading includes short-term trading, selling short, buying options to open a position and selling uncovered options. 
Guidelines for Equity Awards 
The company has no program, plan or practice to time the grant of stock-based awards relative to the release of material non-public information or other corporate events. All equity grants to directors and executive officers are approved by the Compensation Committee or the independent directors at regularly scheduled meetings or, in limited cases involving key recruits or promotions, by a special meeting or unanimous written consent. The grant date is the meeting date or a fixed, future date specified at the time the Compensation Committee or the independent directors take action. Under the terms of the company's stock incentive plan, the exercise price of options cannot be less than the closing price of company stock on the grant date. 
Recoupment Policies 
The company has a recoupment policy to recover incentive awards granted to executive officers in the event of a significant restatement of financial results from material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements due to misconduct. 
In addition, in the event of certain securities law violations, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to reduce or cancel equity awards or require executives to disgorge any profit realized from equity awards. 
The company also reserves the right to cancel equity awards of employees who are terminated for cause. 
Response to Advisory Vote on Say-on-Pay and Stockholder Engagement 
The Compensation Committee considers the result of the stockholders' advisory say-on-pay vote when reviewing and evaluating the executive compensation program throughout the year. The Compensation Committee noted the strong support of the stockholders, who approved the company's advisory say-on-pay proposal by approximately 96% at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and believes this vote reflects broad support of our compensation program and policies. 
The Compensation Committee continues to review and evaluate the company's compensation program and policies in the context of our business, regulatory requirements, and evolving best practices. As part of this process, the Compensation Committee takes into consideration stockholder views regarding executive compensation that the company receives from time to time. 
Given the positive feedback received through stockholder engagement and the results of our 2018 say-on-pay vote, the Compensation Committee determined that the 2018 executive compensation program should remain consistent with the 2017 program. In addition, members of our investor relations and legal teams met with stockholders who provided feedback on a variety of topics, including executive compensation, corporate governance, and environmental and social goals. 
Risk Assessment 
The Compensation Committee reviewed a report by the company's Corporate Risk Management and Human Resources Departments on incentive compensation practices and policies throughout the company and the potential   impact on risk-taking by employees. The report reviewed payouts, risk ratings and balancing methods for all employee incentive compensation plans, changes in incentive compensation plans and programs made in 2018, bank product incentives, and enhancements to the incentive compensation risk management program. The annual report identified the following risk-mitigating factors currently in place:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· review of plan design and performance results for all executive incentive plans by the corporate risk officer,

Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) 
Historically, the company's compensation plans were structured so that compensation would be performance-based and deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (Section 162(m)), with the Compensation Committee approving compensatory arrangements that were not deductible under Section 162(m) based on business needs. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 eliminated the performance-based compensation exemption from the Section 162(m) one million dollar deduction limit, with an exception for certain agreements in effect on November 2, 2017 (the 162(m) Grandfather). The company intends to administer outstanding arrangements and plans to the extent compatible with business needs to preserve potential deductions that may be available under the 162(m) Grandfather. 
COMPENSATION DECISIONS MADE FOR 2019 
2019 Compensation for the Chief Executive Officer 
In January 2019, the Compensation Committee approved a $1,000,000 increase in long-term incentives for Mr. Bettinger to reward and recognize his accomplishments as CEO. The Compensation Committee believes that Mr. Bettinger's leadership is a key factor in growing the long-term strength of our franchise by focusing on serving clients, operating in a disciplined manner and building a leadership team for the future.  2019 Annual Cash Incentives 
In January 2019, the Compensation Committee considered performance criteria for 2019 annual cash incentive awards under the Corporate Executive Bonus Plan. The Compensation Committee selected overall corporate performance as measured by EPS. 
2019 Long-Term Incentives 
In January 2019, the Compensation Committee approved long-term equity awards of 50% stock options and 50% PBRSUs under the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan to align the long-term incentives of the executives with the long-term interests of the stockholders. These equity awards were granted on March 1, 2019. The stock options will vest 25% annually over four years. The PBRSUs will have cliff-vesting based on the three-year performance period from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021. The main features of the 2019 PBRSUs are summarized below.

 2018 CEO PAY RATIO 
The following is a reasonable estimate, calculated in accordance with SEC rules, of the ratio of the 2018 annual total compensation of the company's median employee to the 2018 annual total compensation of Mr. Bettinger, the President and Chief Executive Officer: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the annual total compensation of the median employee, calculated in accordance with Summary Compensation Table rules, was $104,281;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the annual total compensation of the CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, was $15,627,607; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the ratio of the annual total compensation of the CEO to the annual total compensation of the median employee was 150 to 1.   
[END TABLE]
The same median employee was used for 2018 as was used in 2017 as there was no material change in the employee population or compensation arrangements that would have significantly impacted the pay ratio disclosure. 
In order to identify the company's median employee in 2017, the employee population as of October 1, 2017, which equaled 16,623 individuals, including full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees, was determined based on the company's internal records. Of those 16,623 individuals, 16,570 were in the United States and 53 outside the United States. The company's 53 non-U.S. employees, which accounted for less than 5% of the total employee population, were excluded from the analysis. Such employees were located in: Australia (16 employees); Hong Kong (24 employees); Singapore (five employees); and the United Kingdom (eight employees). 
The company's payroll records were used to calculate total cash compensation for each employee, other than the CEO and non-U.S. employees identified as excluded above, based on such employee's annual rate of salary as of October 1, 2017 and actual bonus paid for performance in 2016, including quarterly advances paid in 2016 and the final 2016 bonus payment on March 3, 2017. The median employee was identified by consistently applying this compensation measure to all employees included in the analysis.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
The following tables show compensation information for the named executive officers: Walter W. Bettinger II, President and Chief Executive Officer, Peter B. Crawford, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and the next three most highly compensated executive officers as of December 31, 2018.

Defined Benefits and Deferred Compensation 
The company does not offer defined benefit and actuarial pension plans, special retirement plans or other nonqualified excess plans for executives. The company does not offer above-market or preferential earnings under nonqualified deferred compensation plans or defined contribution plans. 
Employment Agreement for Mr. Schwab 
The company and Mr. Schwab entered into an amended employment agreement, effective March 31, 2003, and stockholders approved the annual bonus provision contained in the employment agreement. The amended agreement has an initial term of five years, and provides that as of each March 31, the term of the employment agreement is automatically extended by an additional year, under the same terms and conditions, unless beforehand either party provides notice to the other of an intention not to extend it. To address potential penalty taxes on deferred compensation pursuant to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and associated regulations, the Board of Directors and Mr. Schwab agreed to amendments to his employment agreement in 2008 to specify the timing of payments, establish definitions of triggering events that are consistent with the Internal Revenue Service's guidance under Section 409A, and delay certain payments until six months after Mr. Schwab terminates employment, as required by Section 409A for certain employees. The amendments do not impact the amount of the payments. 
The amended employment agreement provides for an annual base salary of $900,000, subject to annual review by the board, and provides that Mr. Schwab will be entitled to participate in all compensation and fringe benefit programs made available to other executive officers, including stock-based incentive plans. Mr. Schwab's bonus is determined under the Corporate Executive Bonus Plan, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. 
The employment agreement also provides that certain compensation and benefits will be paid or provided to Mr. Schwab (or his immediate family or estate) if his employment is terminated involuntarily, except for cause. "Cause" is defined as the commission of a felony, or willful and gross negligence, or misconduct that results in material harm to the company. "Involuntary termination" includes a material change in Mr. Schwab's capacities or duties at the company. 
If an involuntary termination is not due to death, disability or cause: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Mr. Schwab will be entitled to receive for a period of 36 months all compensation to which he would have been entitled had he not been terminated,  including his then current base salary and participation in all bonus, incentive and other compensation and benefits for which he was or would have been eligible (but excluding additional grants under stock incentive plans), and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· all his outstanding, unvested shares and options under stock incentive plans will vest fully on the termination date.  
[END TABLE]
If an involuntary termination is due to disability, Mr. Schwab will be entitled to receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· his base salary and benefits, less any payments under the long-term disability plan, for a period of 36 months from the termination date, and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a prorated portion of any bonus or incentive payments for the year in which the disability occurs.  
[END TABLE]
 If an involuntary termination is due to death, a lump sum payment will be made to Mr. Schwab's estate equal to five times his then base salary. 
If Mr. Schwab voluntarily resigns his employment within 24 months of a change in control of the company, he will be entitled to receive his base salary up to the date of resignation, plus a prorated portion of any bonus or incentive payments payable for the year in which the resignation occurs. In addition, Mr. Schwab has the right (but not the obligation) to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company if he voluntarily resigns his employment upon 6 months' written notice to the company, or within 24 months of a change in control of the company if he voluntarily resigns or his employment is involuntarily terminated. Under that arrangement, Mr. Schwab would provide certain consulting services to the company for a period of five years for an annual payment equal to $1 million or 75% of his then base salary, whichever is less. 
For estimated termination and change in control payments and benefits to Mr. Schwab, please refer to the Termination and Change in Control Benefits Table. 
The employment agreement prohibits Mr. Schwab from becoming associated with any business competing with the company during the term of the agreement and for a period of five years following a voluntary resignation of employment. (However, that restriction does not apply if Mr. Schwab resigns his employment within 24 months of a change in control of the company.) 
License Agreement for Mr. Schwab 
The company and Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. also are parties to an assignment and license agreement with Mr. Schwab that was approved in July 1987 by the company's non-employee directors. Under the agreement, Mr. Schwab has assigned to the company all service mark, trademark, and trade name rights to Mr. Schwab's name (and variations on the name) and likeness. However, Mr. Schwab has the perpetual, exclusive, irrevocable right to use his name and likeness for any activity other than the financial services business, so long as Mr. Schwab's use of his name does not cause confusion about whether the company is involved with goods or services actually created, endorsed, marketed or sold by Mr. Schwab or by third parties unrelated to the company. The assignment and license agreement defines the "financial services business" as the business in which Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. is currently engaged and any additional and related business in which that firm or the company is permitted to engage under rules and regulations of applicable regulatory agencies. 
Beginning immediately after any termination of his employment, Mr. Schwab will be entitled to use his likeness in the financial services business for some purposes (specifically, the sale, distribution, broadcast and promotion of books, videotapes, lectures, radio and television programs, and also any financial planning services that do not directly compete with any business in which the company or its subsidiaries are then engaged or plan to enter within three months). Beginning two years after any termination of his employment, Mr. Schwab may use his likeness for all other purposes, including in the financial services business, as long as that use does not cause confusion as described above. 
No cash consideration is to be paid to Mr. Schwab for the name assignment while he is employed by the company or, after his employment terminates, while he is receiving compensation under an employment agreement with the company. Beginning when all such compensation ceases, and continuing for a period of 15 years, Mr. Schwab or his estate will receive three-tenths of one percent (0.3%) of the aggregate net revenues of the company (on a consolidated basis) and those of its unconsolidated assignees and licensees that use the name or likeness. These payments may not, however, exceed $2 million per year, adjusted up or down to reflect changes from the cost of living prevailing in the   San Francisco Bay Area in May 1987, and they will terminate if the company and its subsidiaries cease using Mr. Schwab's name and likeness. For estimated payments to Mr. Schwab under his license agreement, please refer to the Termination and Change in Control Benefits Table below. 
The license agreement permits the company to continue using Mr. Schwab's name and likeness even after he is no longer affiliated with the company and, under most circumstances, limits Mr. Schwab's separate use of his name and likeness in the financial services business. However, the company's ability to assign the license agreement, or to permit others to use Mr. Schwab's name and likeness, is limited during Mr. Schwab's lifetime. Thus, without Mr. Schwab's consent, the company may not transfer the license, or any of the company's rights under the license, to a third party, including by means of mergers or reorganizations in which the stockholders who held shares prior to the transaction do not retain the ability to elect the majority of the board immediately following such transaction (among other circumstances).  2018 Termination and Change in Control Benefits Table

Charles Schwab Severance Pay Plan 
Employees other than Mr. Schwab are eligible for benefits under the Severance Plan in the event of job elimination, as defined in the plan. 
Under the Severance Plan, an executive officer is eligible to receive a lump-sum severance pay benefit of base salary equal to 15 business days multiplied by his or her full years of service, with a minimum of seven months and maximum of 12 months of the base salary that would have been payable to the executive officer. Prorated benefits will be provided for partial years of service. The lump-sum amount is in addition to base salary for the 60-day notice period. 
An executive officer who becomes entitled to severance benefits under the plan is also eligible to receive a lump-sum payment to cover a portion of the cost of group health plan coverage. The amount of the payment is based upon the period of time for which he or she is eligible to receive severance pay and current COBRA rates for group health plan coverage. In addition, the portion of the executive officer's long-term awards, except PBRSUs or similar performance-based awards, which would have vested had the officer remained employed during the severance period will vest following his or her termination date. Executive officers are treated as employees during their severance period for purposes of determining their vesting in PBRSUs to the extent performance goals are met or exceeded for the period.

[END TABLE]
 The Charles Schwab Corporation Deferred Compensation Plans 
In December 2004, the Compensation Committee adopted the DCP2. Deferrals for income earned prior to January 1, 2005 were made under the DCP1, and all deferrals for income earned after January 1, 2005 were made pursuant to the DCP2. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the plans, each eligible participant may elect to defer a portion of amounts earned under the company's non-equity incentive plans (and in some cases, participants can elect to defer a portion of their base salary). All of a participant's compensation deferrals are credited to a deferral account maintained for each participant. Amounts credited to deferral accounts are adjusted periodically to reflect earnings and losses (calculated based on the market return of investment options selected by participants that the company makes available under the plans). Investment options available under the plans are listed mutual funds and the Schwab Managed Retirement Trust Funds. Participants may make investment changes at any time. With certain exceptions, deferral accounts are paid or commence payment upon a fixed payment date, as elected by the participant, or upon the participant's retirement. Participants generally may elect that payments be made in a single lump sum or in annual installments over a period of four, five, ten or fifteen years. However, payment will be made in a lump sum after a change in control of the company or upon a termination of a participant's employment for any reason other than retirement.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Based on its records and other information, the company believes that during 2018 all filings with the SEC by its officers, directors and 10% stockholders timely complied with requirements for reporting ownership and changes in ownership of common stock under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS 
Charles R. Schwab, the company's Chairman, has a daughter, Carolyn (Carrie) Schwab-Pomerantz, who was employed as President of the Charles Schwab Foundation during 2018 (and presently). Ms. Schwab-Pomerantz earned approximately $815,000 in salary, bonus and benefits during 2018, including a grant of 2,850 RSUs and 6,462 stock options. Ms. Schwab-Pomerantz has been employed by the company for 36 years. 
Stephen T. McLin, a director of the company, has a son, Stephen D. McLin, who was employed by the company in a non-executive officer, non-managerial capacity during 2018 (and presently). Mr. McLin earned approximately $146,000 in salary, bonus and benefits during 2018, including a grant of 44 RSUs. Mr. McLin has been employed by the company for 25 years. 
Some directors, executive officers and entities with which they are affiliated have credit transactions with the company's banking and brokerage subsidiaries, such as mortgage loans, revolving lines of credit or other extensions of credit. These transactions with directors, executive officers and their affiliates are made in the ordinary course of business and as permitted by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Such transactions are on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the lender and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. 
The company has policies and procedures regarding the review and approval of related-person transactions. Such policies and procedures are in writing and have been approved by the Audit Committee. The transactions covered by the company's policies and procedures include any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships in which the company participates and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a director or executive officer of the company has a direct or indirect material interest. The policies and procedures include transactions where the directors' or executive officers' children, stepchildren, parents, stepparents, spouse, siblings, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law or members of their household (other than a tenant or employee) have a personal interest. 
Any director or executive officer proposing a transaction covered by the company's related-party transaction policies and procedures must notify the company's compliance department as soon as practicable after becoming aware of the transaction or proposed transaction and must provide a description of all material details and his or her interest in the transaction. The Audit Committee will consider the transaction at its next meeting. The Audit Committee may authorize or ratify the transaction only if the Audit Committee determines that the transaction is fair as to the company as of the time of authorization and in the best interests of the company. The transaction must be approved in good faith by a majority of the disinterested directors on the Audit Committee. 
Notice to and approval by the Audit Committee as described above is not required if the transaction involves compensation to an immediate family member of a director or executive officer, and the employment relationship has been approved in good faith by a majority of disinterested members of the Compensation Committee. As in the case of Ms. Schwab-Pomerantz and Mr. McLin, after initial approval, further approval of the Compensation Committee is not required if the immediate family member is not an executive officer and all compensation and benefits to him or her, including salary increases, bonuses, incentive awards, perquisites, benefits, severance payments, and all other forms of compensation, are made in accordance with the company's compensation programs, policies and plans.  PROPOSAL FOUR: 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL 
Scott M. Stringer, Comptroller of the City of New York, on behalf of the New York City Employees' Retirement System, the New York City Teachers' Retirement System, the New York City Police Pension Fund, and the New York City Board of Education Retirement System, 1 Centre Street, New York, New York 10007, which hold, in the aggregate, approximately 1,423,300 shares of company stock, has submitted the following proposal for consideration at the annual meeting: 
RESOLVED: Shareholders request that the Board of Directors adopt and enforce a policy requiring The Charles Schwab Corporation (the "Company") to disclose annually its EEO-1 data – a comprehensive breakdown of its workforce by race and gender according to 10 employment categories – on its website or in its corporate responsibility report, beginning in 2019. 
Stockholder Supporting Statement 
Diversity matters. Numerous studies suggest that companies with comprehensive diversity policies and programs, and strong leadership commitment to implement and fully integrate diversity into their culture and practices, enhance long-term shareholder value. A McKinsey & Company global study (Diversity Matters, February 2015), for example, found that "companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity are 35 percent more likely to have financial returns above their respective national industry median." 
Workplace diversity provides competitive advantage by generating diverse, valuable perspectives, creativity, innovation and adaptation, increased productivity and morale, while eliminating the limitations of "groupthink." It also reduces potential legal and reputational risks associated with workplace discrimination and builds corporate reputations as fair employers. 
The financial services industry, of which the company is a part, is characterized by persistent and pervasive underrepresentation of minorities and women, particularly in senior positions.  Overall, the number of minorities and women holding management-level jobs in the financial sector did not substantially change over the 18 years from 1993 to 2011, according to 2010 and 2013 reports by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
(http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/653814.pdf; http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10736t.pdf). 
In 2011, minority men and women together held only 10% of senior positions at financial firms, with African-Americans holding 2.7%, Hispanics 3.3%, and Asians 4.1%. Additionally, in 2008, the most recent such data provided by the GAO, white men held 64% of senior jobs, more than twice as many as white women, who held only 27%. 
Charles Schwab discloses little or no workforce diversity data or even information about its diversity policies and initiatives. It discusses awards and gives anecdotal stories. These do not allow investors to fully evaluate the company's diversity initiatives and their impact, especially across job categories and particularly in more senior roles. Without more detailed quantitative information on a comparable basis, shareholders have no way to evaluate and benchmark the effectiveness of these efforts over time and relative to peers. 
Federal law requires companies with 100 or more employees to annually submit an EEO-1 Report to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The report profiles a company's workforce by race and gender in 10 job categories, including senior management. 
Over two-thirds of S&P 100 companies now disclose EEO-1 data, including financial peers such as Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley. The proposal received 35.8% support at Schwab last year. 
The proposal does not limit the company from providing more detailed quantitative and qualitative disclosures where appropriate. We also encourage the company to describe the steps it is taking and the challenges it faces in moving forward to achieve its diversity plans and goals.

 Board of Directors' Recommendation  Against and Statement of Opposition to the Stockholder Proposal   The company's commitment to diversity and inclusion and efforts to support this commitment are outlined on our website at  www.aboutschwab.com/work-at-schwab/diversity. The company's non-discrimination policy, contained in our Code of  Business Conduct and Ethics (www.aboutschwab.com/governance), strengthens our commitment to recognize the diversity of our workforce, our clients, and the communities that we serve. We are proud that this commitment to diversity and inclusion  has been recognized, including being named by Forbes to its list of America's Best Employers for Diversity, achieving a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index since 2004, and being identified as a Top 50 Employer by  both Equal Opportunity magazine and Careers & the disABLED magazine.   This commitment to diversity means building and maintaining an environment where everyone feels valued. Our clients and employees represent a wide range of perspectives and experience, and success on our  commitment is measured by how well we integrate each individual's unique self-understanding into our business, workforce, and relationships with our clients and employees. EEO-1 data neither reflects our  view of diversity nor measures success in achieving our vision of a diverse workplace.   Our Vision of Diversity & Inclusion   We value an inclusive culture that reflects the individual strengths of every employee. Through diversity, we gain a broader range of perspectives and  experiences that enable us to see the world through clients' eyes. Our ability to mirror the understanding and experiences of our clients is key to our continued success.

   EEO-1 data is limited by a government form that categorizes our U.S. workforce into certain generic and EEOC-mandated job categories that fail to account for  company or industry-specific roles. It is a backward-looking snapshot of limited categories, has little bearing on our business or the clients that we serve, and is not an accurate measure of progress toward our goal of developing an inclusive  environment. The data is captured confidentially and voluntarily, based on each individual's interpretation of the form's limited categories. It omits many elements of diversity that are valuable to us and our workplace, including  disability, age, sexual orientation, and military status, among others. As a result, the EEO-1 data is not reflective of Schwab's diversity and could be misconstrued in ways that could encumber our  efforts to achieve greater diversity and inclusion.   Putting our Vision into Action   Our commitment to developing an inclusive workforce includes a range of initiatives in hiring, talent development, and workplace support. These  initiatives are not a "one size fits all" approach, which is why we work with each region and business unit to define their own unique priorities and action plans. We have a team of full-time diversity and inclusion professionals, led by a  Vice President of Diversity & Inclusion. The team focuses on building and strengthening our culture of inclusion, integrating diversity and inclusion in hiring, corporate culture programs, and the talent and leadership development process,  and cultivating stronger ties with the communities that we serve. We have forged multiple partnerships with universities and organizations in our hiring and recruiting process that help us improve our ability to attract women, people of color,  people with disabilities and those with military backgrounds to a career in financial services.   We support a culture of diversity among our business leaders and have integrated inclusive leadership skills into our leadership development programs. We are committed to identifying and developing  diversity among leadership and send leaders and employees from our diverse communities to external leadership development programs. Educating our leaders and workforce on how they can actively support inclusion at Schwab reinforces our culture of  inclusion. These educational efforts include workshops on diversity and inclusion as well as mandatory Code of Conduct and anti-harassment training for all employees.   We provide continuous workplace support and group based  inclusion programs to foster organic diverse relationships pivotal to our corporate culture. Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are employee-driven networks that provide support, mentorship, leadership development opportunities and connection to our  diverse client base. Nearly 20% of our employees belong to at least one of our 72 ERG chapters that have been created to date, and we have recently added the Charles Schwab Abilities Network for people with disabilities and an Intersectional ERG for  multi-dimensional identities. In addition to these new ERGs, some of our current ERGs include: Asian Pacific Islander Network at Schwab; Black Professionals at Charles Schwab; Military Veterans Network; Schwab Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and  Allies Pride Network; Schwab Organization of Latinos; and the Women's Interactive Network at Schwab.   Schwab's commitment to diversity and inclusion is vital to our success as a company, our unique culture and our purpose of serving every client with  passion and integrity. EEO-1 data neither informs nor accurately measures that commitment. Stockholders defeated this proposal in each of the last five years.   For these reasons, we recommend a vote  against this stockholder proposal.

We have forged multiple partnerships with universities and organizations in our hiring and recruiting process that help us improve our ability to attract women, people of color,  people with disabilities and those with military backgrounds to a career in financial services.   We support a culture of diversity among our business leaders and have integrated inclusive leadership skills into our leadership development programs. We are committed to identifying and developing  diversity among leadership and send leaders and employees from our diverse communities to external leadership development programs. Educating our leaders and workforce on how they can actively support inclusion at Schwab reinforces our culture of  inclusion. These educational efforts include workshops on diversity and inclusion as well as mandatory Code of Conduct and anti-harassment training for all employees.   We provide continuous workplace support and group based  inclusion programs to foster organic diverse relationships pivotal to our corporate culture. Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are employee-driven networks that provide support, mentorship, leadership development opportunities and connection to our  diverse client base. Nearly 20% of our employees belong to at least one of our 72 ERG chapters that have been created to date, and we have recently added the Charles Schwab Abilities Network for people with disabilities and an Intersectional ERG for  multi-dimensional identities. In addition to these new ERGs, some of our current ERGs include: Asian Pacific Islander Network at Schwab; Black Professionals at Charles Schwab; Military Veterans Network; Schwab Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and  Allies Pride Network; Schwab Organization of Latinos; and the Women's Interactive Network at Schwab.   Schwab's commitment to diversity and inclusion is vital to our success as a company, our unique culture and our purpose of serving every client with  passion and integrity. EEO-1 data neither informs nor accurately measures that commitment. Stockholders defeated this proposal in each of the last five years.   For these reasons, we recommend a vote  against this stockholder proposal. 
   EEO-1 data is limited by a government form that categorizes our U.S. workforce into certain generic and EEOC-mandated job categories that fail to account for  company or industry-specific roles. It is a backward-looking snapshot of limited categories, has little bearing on our business or the clients that we serve, and is not an accurate measure of progress toward our goal of developing an inclusive  environment. The data is captured confidentially and voluntarily, based on each individual's interpretation of the form's limited categories. It omits many elements of diversity that are valuable to us and our workplace, including  disability, age, sexual orientation, and military status, among others. As a result, the EEO-1 data is not reflective of Schwab's diversity and could be misconstrued in ways that could encumber our  efforts to achieve greater diversity and inclusion.   Putting our Vision into Action   Our commitment to developing an inclusive workforce includes a range of initiatives in hiring, talent development, and workplace support. These  initiatives are not a "one size fits all" approach, which is why we work with each region and business unit to define their own unique priorities and action plans.

 INFORMATION ABOUT VOTING PROCEDURES AND PROXIES 
How is my vote counted? 
You may vote either "for" or "against" or "abstain" from voting on each director nominee, the ratification of the selection of independent auditors, the advisory approval of named executive officer compensation, and on the stockholder proposal. If you abstain from voting on any director nominee, the abstention will not count as a vote cast on the proposal to elect that director. If you abstain from voting on the ratification of the selection of independent auditors, the advisory approval of named executive officer compensation, or the stockholder proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote "against" that proposal. 
If you provide your voting instructions on your proxy, your shares will be voted as you instruct, and according to the best judgment of Charles R. Schwab, Walter W. Bettinger II and David R. Garfield if a proposal comes up for a vote at the meeting that is not on the proxy. 
If you do not indicate a specific choice on the proxy you submit for one or more proposals, your shares will be voted (with respect to the proposal or proposals on which you do not vote): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· for the five named nominees for directors,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· for the ratification of the selection of independent auditors,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· for the advisory approval of named executive officer compensation,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· against the stockholder proposal on annual disclosure of EEO-1 data, and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· according to the best judgment of Mr. Schwab, Mr. Bettinger and Mr. Garfield if a proposal comes up for a vote at the meeting that is  not on the proxy.  
[END TABLE]
How will my shares be voted if other business is presented at the annual meeting? 
We know of no business other than the proposals contained in the proxy statement to be considered at the meeting. However, if other matters are properly presented at the meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement of the meeting, and you have properly submitted your proxy, then Mr. Schwab, Mr. Bettinger and Mr. Garfield will vote your shares on those matters according to their best judgment. 
What if I change my mind after I submit my proxy? 
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· signing a proxy card with a later date and returning it before the polls close at the meeting,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· voting by telephone or on the internet before 11:59 p.m., Central Time, on May 14, 2019, or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· voting at the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
How many votes must the director nominees receive to be elected as directors? 
A director must receive more "for" than "against" votes to be elected as a director. If a director does not receive more "for" than "against" votes, the director may be eligible under Delaware law to continue to serve a "holdover" term until the next annual meeting of stockholders. However, in the event that a director does not receive more "for" than "against" votes, our corporate governance guidelines provide that the Nominating and Corporate Governance   Committee shall meet within 90 days after the final certification of the vote and evaluate the director's continued service for a holdover term. Under the guidelines, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee should consider the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the reasons for the director's failure to receive an affirmative majority of votes,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the director's qualifications and skills and contributions to the board and board committees,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the effect on board composition without the director's continued service during the holdover term on the board or board committees,   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· whether there are qualified candidates to fill a vacancy if the affected director immediately resigned from the board or board committees, and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the guidelines for considering director candidates established by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  
[END TABLE]
In making its evaluation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may determine that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the director should continue to serve a holdover term on the board,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the director should continue service on the board for a predetermined period (but less than a full holdover term),  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the director should continue service on the board for a holdover term or predetermined period but resign from one or more board committees, or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the director should immediately resign from the board.  
[END TABLE]
If the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines that the affected director should resign from the board or one or more board committees, the director will be expected to submit his or her resignation immediately upon such determination. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's determination, including the reasons for such determination, will be publicly disclosed on a Form 8-K filed with the SEC. 
What happens if a director nominee is unable to stand for election? 
The board may reduce the number of directors or select a substitute nominee. In the latter case, if you have submitted your proxy, Mr. Schwab, Mr. Bettinger and Mr. Garfield can vote your shares for a substitute nominee. They cannot vote for more than five nominees. 
How many votes are needed for the ratification of independent auditors and the advisory approval of named executive officer compensation? 
The ratification of independent auditors and the advisory approval of named executive officer compensation will be approved if a majority of the shares present at the meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal vote for approval. 
How many votes are needed for approval of the stockholder proposal? 
The stockholder proposal will be approved if a majority of the shares present at the meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal vote for approval.  What is a "broker non-vote"?
A broker non-vote occurs when a brokerage firm holding shares in street name for a beneficial owner does not vote on a proposal because the broker has not received instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have discretionary voting power with respect to the proposal. 
What is the effect of not providing voting instructions if my shares are held in street name? 
Brokerage firms have authority to vote clients' unvoted shares on some "routine" matters. When a brokerage firm votes its clients' unvoted shares on routine matters, these shares are counted to determine if a quorum exists to conduct business at the meeting. A brokerage firm cannot vote clients' unvoted shares on non-routine matters, which results in a broker non-vote. A broker non-vote will be treated as not being entitled to vote on the proposal and will not be counted for purposes of determining whether the proposal has been approved. 
The company's proposal to ratify the selection of independent auditors is considered a routine matter, but the election of directors, the advisory approval of named executive officer compensation, and the stockholder proposal are not. 
As a brokerage firm, Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. may vote its clients' unvoted shares on routine matters. However, as the company's subsidiary, when it is voting on company proposals, it can vote unvoted company shares held in brokerage accounts only in the same proportion as all other stockholders vote. 
If you have a stockbroker or investment advisor, they may be able to vote your shares depending on the terms of the agreement you have with them. 
What is the effect of not submitting my proxy if my shares are held in a retirement plan? 
A trustee under a retirement plan may be able to vote a participant's unvoted shares. For example, if you are a participant in The SchwabPlan Retirement Savings and Investment Plan, the trustee, under certain circumstances, can vote your shares. Specifically, the trustee will vote shares you hold under the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) component of The SchwabPlan Retirement Savings and Investment Plan if the trustee does not receive voting instructions from you. The trustee will vote your unvoted shares held under the ESOP component of the overall plan in the same proportion as all other plan participants vote their shares held under the ESOP component of the overall plan. 
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card? 
It means that you have multiple accounts at the transfer agent or with stockbrokers. Please complete and submit all proxies to ensure that all your shares are voted. 
Unless you need multiple accounts for specific purposes, it may be less confusing if you consolidate as many of your transfer agent or brokerage accounts as possible under the same name and address. 
Is my vote kept confidential? 
Proxies, ballots and voting tabulations identifying stockholders are kept confidential by our transfer agent and will not be disclosed except as may be necessary to meet legal requirements.  Where do I find voting results of the meeting? 
We will announce preliminary voting results at the annual meeting. We will announce the final results on a Form 8-K following the annual meeting. You may access a copy electronically on our website at www.aboutschwab.com/investor-relations by clicking on "Financial Reports & Presentations" or through the SEC's electronic data system at www.sec.gov. You also may obtain a copy by contacting investor.relations@schwab.com. 
Voting results are tabulated and certified by our transfer agent, Equiniti Trust Company. 
Who pays the cost for proxy solicitation? 
The company is paying for distributing and soliciting proxies. As a part of this process, the company reimburses brokers, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians for reasonable fees and expenses in forwarding proxy materials to stockholders. 
The company has retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. to act as proxy solicitor in conjunction with the annual meeting at an estimated fee of $14,000 plus reasonable out of pocket expenses. Employees of the company or its subsidiaries may solicit proxies through mail, telephone, the internet or other means. Employees do not receive additional compensation for soliciting proxies. 
What is "householding"? 
"Householding" means that we deliver a single set of proxy materials to households with multiple stockholders, provided such stockholders give their affirmative or implied consent and certain other conditions are met. 
Some households with multiple stockholders already may have provided the company with their affirmative consent or given a general consent to householding. We will provide only one set of proxy materials to each such household, unless we receive contrary instructions. 
We will promptly deliver separate copies of our proxy statement and annual report at the request of any stockholder who is in a household that participates in the householding of the company's proxy materials. You may call the Assistant Corporate Secretary at (415) 667-9979 or send your request to the Assistant Corporate Secretary at the address in the "Corporate Governance Information" section of this proxy statement. 
If you currently receive multiple copies of the company's proxy materials and would like to participate in householding, please contact the Assistant Corporate Secretary.
