2018 was a year of significant progress in the maturity of Callon's Permian operations as we continued to grow cash margins, production and reserves while transitioning to scaled development of our high quality asset base. The Company also added approximately 35,000 highly complementary net surface acres to our Delaware Basin operating area that promote efficiencies through increased operational scale, longer laterals and integration of infrastructure. Key operational and financial highlights include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Increased daily production approximately 44% year-over-year to 32,900 barrels of oil equivalent ("Boe") per day in 2018, with a sustained oil content of 79%. Completed the acquisition of 34,523 net working interest acres and 1,530 net mineral acres and traded 4,420 net acres to further longer-lateral development. 
Increased estimated net proved reserves by nearly 74% year-over-year to 238.5 million barrels of oil equivalent ("MMBoe"), which replaced 690% of 2018 production. Divested 3,540 net acres as part of ongoing asset rationalization initiatives.  
Achieved a "drill bit" finding and development ("F&D") cost(i) of $7.03 per Boe and provided developed finding and development cost(i) of $13.40 per Boe. Expanded our dual-basin recycling program that utilized 4.2 million barrels of produced water, significantly reducing freshwater needs and our environmental footprint. 
Generated operating margins of $40.16 per Boe, among the highest within the industry. Improved safety and environmental performance including reductions of over 40% for recordable incident rates and spills to the environment. 
Decreased lease operating expense ("LOE") per Boe by 3% versus 2017, representing the fifth consecutive year of cost reduction. Increased liquidity by expanding the borrowing base to $1.1 billion with an elected commitment of $850 million. 
Realized net income of $300.4 million and generated Adjusted EBITDA(i) of $432.5 million relative to cash drilling and completion capital expenditures of $403.5 million. Issued $400MM of Senior Notes at an effective yield of 6.4%, contributing to an improved cost of capital. 
(i)  See Appendix A for a reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures 
[END TABLE]
Coming off a strong 2018, Callon remains driven by a long-term value focus, and our progress in maturing our operations and production base in recent years now allows us to drive continued improvements in our cash flow profile and corporate-level returns. In 2019 and beyond, the Company is well-positioned to progress efficiencies in our development program through larger pad developments, increased lateral lengths, reduced leasehold obligations and leveraging of established infrastructure for the benefit of our shareholders.

Board of Directors
Process for Selecting Directors
Director Identification and Selection
Criteria. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has established guidelines for considering nominations to our Board. The Committee evaluates potential nominees based on the contribution such nominee's background and skills could have upon achieving the goal of a well-rounded, diverse Board that functions collegially as a unit. While not an exhaustive list, key criteria include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Relevant oil and gas exploration and production industry knowledge and experience; 
• Complimentary mix of backgrounds and experience in areas including business, finance, accounting, technology,  and strategy; 
• Personal qualities of leadership, character, judgment and personal and professional integrity and high ethical standards; 
• The candidate's ability to exercise independent and informed business judgment; 
• Whether the candidate is free of conflicts and has the time required for preparation, participation, and attendance at meetings; 
• Diversity, including differences in viewpoints, background, education, gender, race or ethnicity, age, and other individual qualifications and attributes; 
• The ability to work with other members of the Board, the CEO and senior officers of the Company in a constructive and collaborative fashion to achieve the Company's goals and implement its strategy; and 
• In the case of an incumbent director, such director's past performance on the Board. 
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board may also consider other qualifications and attributes that they believe are appropriate in evaluating the ability of an individual to serve as a member of the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's goal is to assemble a Board that brings to us a variety of perspectives and skills derived from high quality business and professional experience to perform its oversight role satisfactorily for our shareholders. In making its determinations, the Committee evaluates each individual in the context of the Board as a whole, with the objective of assembling a group that can best represent shareholder interests through the active, objective, and constructive participation in meetings and the strategic decision-making processes. 
Diversity. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth our policy with respect to Board diversity. We are committed to building a diverse Board comprised of individuals from different backgrounds, including differences in viewpoints, education, gender, race or ethnicity, age, and other individual qualifications and attributes. To accomplish this, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will continue to require that search firms engaged by the Company seek to present a robust selection of women and ethnically diverse candidates in all prospective director candidate pools.
Nominating Process. In making its nominations, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies nominees by first evaluating the current members of the Board willing to continue their service and any potential need to expand the Board to include additional expertise. Current members with a record of quality contribution to the Board whose experience contributes to a complementary mix of backgrounds that enhance the Board are renominated. When vacancies become available, the Committee may seek input from industry experts or engage third-party search firms to help source particular areas of expertise or backgrounds.
CALLON PETROLEUM      7
PROPOSAL 1
Over time, the Board refreshes its membership through a combination of adding or replacing directors to achieve the appropriate balance between maintaining longer-term directors with deep institutional knowledge of the Company and adding directors who bring a diversity of perspectives and experience. As a reflection of this philosophy, if all of the nominees are elected to the Board, following the Annual Meeting:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 5/8 directors will have tenures of five or fewer years. 7/8 directors will be independent.
 5/8 directors will have tenures of five or fewer years. 7/8 directors will be independent.
[END TABLE]
If a director nominee receives a Majority Withheld Vote, then promptly following the certification of the election results, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider any factors it deems relevant to the best interests of the Company and our shareholders in determining whether to accept the director's resignation and recommend to the Board that action to be taken with respect to the tendered resignation. Within 120 days following certification of the shareholder vote, the Board shall consider the recommendation and make a determination as to whether to accept or reject such director's resignation and shall notify the director concerned of its decision. We will also promptly publicly disclose the Board's decision and process in a periodic or current report filed with or furnished to the SEC.
If you hold your shares through a broker and you do not instruct the broker how to vote, your broker will not have the authority to vote your shares. Abstentions and broker non-votes will each be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum but will have no effect upon the outcome of the vote. All shares of common stock represented by proxies will be voted "FOR" the election of the director nominees, except where authority to vote in the election of directors has been withheld.  Should the nominees become unable or unwilling to serve as a director at the time of the 2019 Annual Meeting, the person or persons exercising the proxies will vote for the election of substitute nominees designated by the Board, or the Board may choose to reduce the number of members of the Board to be elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting in order to eliminate the vacancy. Your proxy cannot be otherwise voted for a person who is not named in this Proxy as a candidate for director or for a greater number of persons than the number of director nominees named. The Board has no reason to believe that the nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected.

The Board recommends a vote FOR each of the two Class I director nominees.

Director Compensation
The compensation of our non-employee directors is reviewed by the Compensation Committee and is approved by the Board. We use a combination of cash and stock-based incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on our Board. In determining director compensation, we consider the responsibilities of our directors, the significant amount of time the directors spend fulfilling their duties, and the competitive market for skilled directors. 
Annually the Compensation Committee directly engages Meridian to conduct an analysis of director compensation and recommend any adjustments to the total annual compensation of the non-employee directors. Specifically, Meridian evaluates competitive market data, utilizing the same Peer Group used for executive compensation market data (see page 36). The Compensation Committee generally targets total compensation near the median of this Peer Group. The Company's director compensation program generally consists of cash retainers and an annual grant of Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") awarded under the Company's 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2018 Plan"). The RSU grants are awarded to match competitive practices and encourage a long-term alignment with shareholders.
In March 2018, with input from compensation advisor Meridian, the Compensation Committee reviewed the competitiveness of the director compensation package. Relative to the Initial 2018 Peer Group (page 36), the director compensation package fell below the 25th percentile. Accordingly, upon recommendation from the Compensation Committee, in May 2018 the Board approved a market-based increase in the annual cash retainer to $80,000 and the annual restricted stock unit grant to $165,000. With these increases, the average total compensation for Callon directors is at approximately the median of the Peer Group.
For 2018, the Company's non-employee director compensation consisted of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board member cash retainer $80,000 
Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Grant Value $165,000 
Chairmen Fees   
Non-Executive Chair $120,000 
Audit Committee Chair $20,000 
Compensation Committee Chair $15,000 
Nominating and Corporative Governance Committee Chair $10,000 
Strategic Planning and Reserves Committee Chair $10,000 
[END TABLE]
Each non-employee director is reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred to attend Board and Committee meetings. If a member of our Board is an officer or employee of the Company, they do not receive compensation for their service as a director.
The RSUs granted to directors in 2018 will vest on the first anniversary date following the grant, or on the date of the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, whichever occurs first.
Directors have the opportunity to make an annual election to defer some or all of their cash retainer or annual stock award pursuant to the terms of a Deferred Compensation Plan for non-employee directors until separation from service as a director. All deferrals under the plan are credited as phantom stock units of Callon stock. Callon's directors are subject to stock ownership guidelines of five times the annual cash retainer of $80,000. For more information on the stock ownership guidelines see page 42.

Director Independence
To minimize potential conflicts, it is a policy of the Board that a majority of the Board be independent. In accordance with the standards for companies listed on the NYSE and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, as well as our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board considers a director to be independent if it has affirmatively determined that the director has no material relationship with the Company that could compromise his or her ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities. The Board revisits the independence of each director on an annual basis and makes independence determinations when a newly appointed director joins the Board between annual meetings. The Board reviewed the independence of its directors and nominees in accordance with the standards described above and affirmatively determined that each of the directors (other than Mr. Gatto) and nominees is independent.

[END TABLE]
General Information
Our Board is responsible for determining the ultimate direction of our business strategy, overseeing our governance policies and culture and promoting the long-term interests of the Company. The Board possesses and exercises oversight authority over our business but, subject to our governing documents and applicable law, delegates day-to-day management of the Company to our CEO and senior management. The Board generally fulfills its responsibilities through regular meetings to review significant developments affecting the Company and to act on matters requiring Board approval. Between regularly scheduled meetings, the Board may also hold special meetings, execute written consents, and participate in telephonic conference calls when an important matter requires Board action. During 2018, our Board met formally six times and transacted business on twelve occasions during the year by unanimous written consent. All of our directors attended at least 75% of Board and committee meetings either in person or by telephone. In addition, to promote open discussion, the non-employee directors meet in executive session without management regularly. L. Richard Flury, the Chairman of the Board, was selected to preside over all executive sessions during 2018. It is the policy of the Board that, to the extent possible, all directors attend the Company's Annual Meeting of shareholders. 
The Board, in consultation with the Nominating and Governance Committee, has determined that a classified board structure continues to be appropriate for us, particularly in an industry where a long-term strategic planning outlook is critical for the successful development of oil and natural gas resources through commodity price cycles. Our future success depends in significant part on the in-depth knowledge of our business and operations by our directors. We believe that a classified board promotes stability, continuity and experience among our directors, which is essential to developing and implementing long-term strategies, while resisting the pressure to focus on short-term results at the expense of enhancing long-term value and success.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board Leadership Structure
One of the Board's key responsibilities is determining the appropriate leadership structure for the Board, which helps ensure its effective and independent oversight of management on behalf of our shareholders. Our Board believes that there is no one generally accepted approach to providing board leadership and given the dynamic and competitive environment in which we operate, the optimal board leadership structure may vary as circumstances warrant. Accordingly, the Board has no policy mandating the separation or combination of the roles of Chairman of the Board and CEO, but periodically discusses and considers the structure as circumstances change. As such, the Board believes that it is in the best position to evaluate the needs of the Company and to determine how best to organize the Company's leadership structure to meet those needs.
Currently, the Board has separated the roles of CEO and Chairman and appointed independent director Mr. Flury as Chairman of the Board and Mr. Gatto as CEO.
The Board is currently comprised of eight directors, of whom seven out of eight are independent. Mr. Gatto, the Company's President and CEO, serves as an executive member of the Board. Independent directors and management generally have different perspectives and roles in strategy development. Our independent directors have backgrounds in the oil and gas industry or other relevant experiences which complement the CEO's comprehensive, company-specific perspective. As the officer having primary responsibility for managing our daily operations and identifying strategic priorities, the CEO is best positioned to lead the Board through reviews of key business and strategy decisions. This dynamic effectively promotes the opportunity for a successful blend of our independent directors' perspectives and oversight responsibilities and facilitates information flow and communication between senior management and the Board, which are both essential to effective governance.
The role of our Chairman is to oversee and ensure Board effectiveness.  As Chairman, Mr. Flury has the following responsibilities:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Establishes Board meeting agendas and ensures critical issues are included. 
• Chairs meetings of the Board and the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
• Ensures that the flow of information provided to the Board is timely, complete, and accurate. 
• Communicates with all directors on key issues and concerns outside of Board meetings. 
• Assists the Board and executive officers in assuring compliance with and implementation of our governance principles.

Areas of Board Oversight
Board Risk Oversight
As an independent oil and gas company, we face a number of risks. Assessing and managing material risk is the responsibility of our management team, while our Board, as a whole and through its committees, generally oversees risk management and our long-term strategic direction, ensuring that risks undertaken by the Company are consistent with the Board's risk tolerance. Our Board leadership structure and our practice of a high degree of interaction between our directors and members of senior management facilitate this oversight function. Our executive officers regularly attend the Board meetings and are available to address any questions or concerns raised by the Board on risk management-related and any other matters. Other members of our management team periodically attend the Board meetings or are otherwise available to confer with the Board to the extent their expertise is required to address risk management matters. The information flow and communication throughout the year between our Board and senior management regarding long-term strategic planning and short-term operational reporting includes matters of material risk inherent in our business of developing oil and natural gas assets. The Board realizes, however, that it is not possible or prudent to eliminate all risk and that appropriate risk-taking is essential in order to achieve our near and longer-term objectives.
While the Board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight, the Board exercises additional risk oversight responsibilities through its committees, which are comprised solely of independent directors. Each such committee has primary risk oversight responsibility with respect to matters within the scope of its duties as contemplated by its charter and as described below.
Standing Committees of the Board of Directors
The Board has four stading committees, each of which is comprised entirely of independent directors.  Each committee, discussed below in greater detail, has a written charter that establishes the responsibilities and scope of the committee and its Chairman. Each committee charter was reviewed in November 2018 and revised as deemed necessary by the Board.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  BOARD OF DIRECTORS   
The Audit Committee, among other duties, is charged with overseeing material risk exposures in the areas of financial reporting, internal controls, compliance, hedging and cybersecurity. This Committee also oversees responses to any alleged violations of our Code of Business Conduct.     The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee focuses on issues relating to corporate governance and Board and Board committee composition. This Committee also assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to succession planning for our directors and executive officers. 
The Compensation Committee oversees the Company's compensation programs and the reviews the potential risks that may result from our compensation policies in order that they do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking by management.     The Strategic Planning & Reserves Committee oversees the development and implementation of our strategic plan and the integrity of our reserve estimation reporting process and related disclosures.

Corporate Governance Matters
Corporate Governance Principles
The Board believes that sound corporate governance practices and policies provide an important framework to assist in fulfilling its duty to shareholders. The framework for our corporate governance can be found in our governance documents, which include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Corporate Governance Guidelines; 
• Code of Business Conduct and Ethics; and 
• Charters for the Audit, Compensation, Nominating & Corporate Governance, and Strategic Planning & Reserves Committees. 
[END TABLE]
In keeping with sound corporate governance practices, each of these documents is reviewed annually and is available on our website www.callon.com under the "About Callon - Governance" menu. Shareholders may obtain a printed copy, free of charge, by sending a written request to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive office in Houston, Texas. Any amendments to these documents are promptly posted on our website.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") sets forth the policies and expectations for Callon's officers, employees and directors as well as consultants, representatives, agents, and contractors while acting on Callon's behalf. The Code addresses a number of topics including conflicts of interest, compliance with laws, insider trading, prohibitions on discrimination and harassment, workplace safety and protection of the environment, and fair disclosure. In addition, the Code explicitly prohibits directors, officers and employees from engaging in hedging transactions in Callon stock. It also states that no corporate funds may be used for political contributions.
The Code meets the NYSE's requirements for a code of business conduct and ethics and also includes a code of ethics applicable to our senior financial officers consistent with the requirements of the SEC. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirements regarding any amendment to, or any waiver of, a provision of the Code by promptly posting such information on our website. Concerns about potential violations of the Code can be anonymously reported to our ethics hotline by calling 1-844-471-7637 or accessing the following website: callon.ethicspoint.com.
Environmental, Social and Governance
Callon's mission is to build trust, create value and drive sustainable growth responsibly for our investors, our employees and the communities in which we operate. Consistent with this mission, the Board oversees the Company's environmental, social and governance programs with a focus on a long-term, sustainable investments in our operations, team member development, and protecting the environment in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. The Board regularly addresses the Company's efforts to continuously improve outcomes regarding workplace safety, environmental impact, team member diversity and workforce development. As described in more detail above beginning on page 17, the Board is also committed to effective and sustainable corporate governance, which we believe strengthens Board and management accountability, promotes the long-term interests of our shareholders, and helps build public trust in our Company.
Communication with Directors
Shareholders or other interested parties who wish to communicate with the full Board, independent directors as a group, or individual directors, may do so by sending a letter in care of the Corporate Secretary to our principal executive office located at 1401 Enclave Parkway, Suite 600, Houston, Texas 77077. Our Corporate Secretary has the authority to discard any solicitations, job inquiries, advertisements, surveys or other inappropriate communications, but will forward any other mail to the named director or group of directors. Our Corporate Secretary will forward approved mail addressed to the full Board to the Chairman of the Board who, if appropriate, will share the item with the full Board.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board Evaluations
The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, in consultation with the Chairman of the Board, annually leads the performance review of the Board and its Committees. The self-evaluation process seeks to obtain each director's assessment of the effectiveness of the Board, the Committees and their leadership, Board and Committee composition and Board and management dynamics. In 2018, the Board self-evaluation process included a survey completed by each director about the Board and the Committees on which the director served. The Board Chairman also conducted interviews with each director for feedback and insights. The results were discussed by the full Board and within each Committee.
Director Education
The Company sponsors an ongoing director education program that assists Board members in fulfilling their responsibilities. Training commences with an orientation program when a new director joins the Board. Ongoing education is provided through written materials, presentations in Board meetings, and training outside the boardroom. All Callon directors are members of the National Association of Corporate Directors and are provided an annual training allowance to pursue relevant director education programs.

Proposal 2 Approve, on an Advisory Basis,  the Compensation of the Company's NEOs The Board of Directors Recommends a vote FOR the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.• Provides performance-based and market-aligned pay opportunities that are intended to foster motivation, engagement, and retention of key talent to drive Company performance and long-term shareholder value.
Proposal 2 Approve, on an Advisory Basis,  the Compensation of the Company's NEOs The Board of Directors Recommends a vote FOR the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.• Provides performance-based and market-aligned pay opportunities that are intended to foster motivation, engagement, and retention of key talent to drive Company performance and long-term shareholder value.
[END TABLE]
The Board recognizes that executive compensation is an important matter for our shareholders. The Compensation Committee is tasked with the implementation of our executive compensation philosophy and, as described in detail in the CD&A below, the design of our executive compensation programs. Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain a qualified executive management team and to appropriately reward our executive officers for their contributions to the achievement of our short-term and long-term business goals and the creation and enhancement of shareholder value.
As described in the CD&A, we believe our compensation program is effective, appropriate and aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders and that the total compensation package provided to the NEOs is reasonable and not excessive. As you consider this Proposal 2, we urge you to read the CD&A for additional details on executive compensation. Further, in determining whether to approve this proposal, we believe that shareholders should also consider the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independent Compensation Committee. Executive compensation is reviewed and established by a Compensation Committee of the Board consisting solely of independent directors. The Compensation Committee meets in executive session, without executive officers present, in determining annual compensation. The Compensation Committee receives data, analysis and input from a compensation consultant that is independent of management and free of conflicts of interest with us. 
• Performance-based incentive compensation. Our executive compensation program seeks to align executive compensation with shareholder value on an annual and long-term basis through a combination of base pay, annual incentives and long-term incentives. Please review the CD&A for more information on how our 2018 compensation was tied to results. 
• Long-term incentive plans. Our long-term incentive awards generally include three-year minimum vesting periods. 
• "Double trigger" severance agreements with fixed term. Change in control severance agreements with our executive officers require an actual or constructive termination of employment before benefits are paid following any change in control. 
• Stock ownership guidelines. Each of the NEOs has been granted equity to provide the officer a stake in our long-term success. The purpose of the ownership requirement is to further our goal of increasing shareholder value by aligning the interests of our NEOs with the interests of our shareholders. 
• Hedging policy. Our directors and executive officers are prohibited from entering into transactions in puts, calls and other derivative securities with respect to our securities and from engaging in short sales of our securities. We believe these activities are often perceived as involving insider trading and may focus the holder's attention on our short-term performance rather than our long-term objectives. 
[END TABLE]
CALLON PETROLEUM      29
PROPOSAL 2
In light of the above and as more fully described in the CD&A, we believe that the compensation of our NEOs for 2018 was appropriate and reasonable and that our compensation programs and practices are sound and in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. We therefore respectfully request that shareholders vote on the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Callon's NEOs, as disclosed in Callon's 2019 Proxy Statement (including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and related footnotes and narrative disclosures) is hereby approved."
The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and our compensation-related policies and practices as described in this Proxy Statement. As noted above, the vote solicited by this proposal is advisory in nature and its outcome will not be binding on the Company, the Board or the Compensation Committee, nor will the outcome of the vote require the Board or the Compensation Committee to take any action. The outcome of the vote will not be construed as overruling any decision of the Board or the Compensation Committee or creating or implying any additional fiduciary duty of the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee will carefully consider the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. For a review of the results of the previous year's vote, which reflects overwhelming validation from our shareholders of our pay philosophy and approach, please see the "Role of Shareholder Say-on-Pay Advisory Vote" on page 35.
Notwithstanding the advisory nature of this vote, the foregoing resolution will be deemed approved with the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes present and entitled to vote on the proposal at the Annual Meeting. If you hold your shares through a broker and you do not instruct the broker how to vote, your broker will not have the authority to vote your shares. Abstentions will have the effect as a vote cast against the proposal. Broker non-votes will not be counted as shares present and entitled to vote, and so will have no effect upon the outcome of the vote.

Role of Shareholder Say-on-Pay Advisory Vote
We have historically received strong support from our shareholders for our executive compensation practices. In the advisory vote held at the 2018 Annual Meeting, approximately 96% of the votes cast were in favor of our 2017 executive compensation programs. The Committee acknowledged the support received from our shareholders and viewed the results as an affirmation of our existing executive compensation policies and programs. Accordingly, based on the Committee's analysis of this support, it generally maintained our executive compensation policies for 2018 and into 2019. However, based on feedback received during shareholder engagement, the Committee modified the 2019 annual bonus to include a performance-based, formulaic assessment component as described below. The Committee will continue to review shareholder votes and conduct shareholder engagement on our executive compensation programs to ensure alignment with shareholder interests.
Role of Independent Compensation Consultant
For 2018, the Committee continued its engagement of Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian" or the "Consultant") as its independent compensation consultant to provide information and objective advice regarding executive officer and director compensation. The Committee retained Meridian because of its extensive familiarity with executive compensation programs in our industry. Importantly, the Committee makes all of the decisions with respect to our executive compensation, and in setting compensation for our NEOs, considers Meridian's advice as only one factor among many other factors discussed within this CD&A. Other factors include our overall performance; individual NEO performance, experience, skills and tenure with the Company; and industry trends.
Meridian reports solely to the Committee, and the Committee determines the scope of Meridian's engagement. In an effort to ensure that our NEO compensation programs are competitive and consistent with our compensation philosophy, Meridian assisted the Committee as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Regularly attending meetings of the Compensation Committee and meeting privately in executive session with the Compensation Committee to discuss its recommendations; 
• Providing recommendations on executive compensation matters to align the Committee's actions with shareholder interests, our business strategy and pay philosophy, prevailing market practices and relevant legal and regulatory requirements; 
• Periodically evaluating the peer group and providing peer company data for the Committee to use in its decision-making process, including assessment of pay and performance relative to peers; 
• Providing competitive market data to consider in evaluating the competitiveness of the executive base salaries and short and long-term incentive plans and awards; 
• Reviewing data in connection with the Committee's determination of annual cash incentive performance objectives and performance-based incentive vesting levels for completed performance periods; 
• Advising on the Company's compensation arrangements for its non-employee directors, including providing peer group data; 
• Reviewing and providing feedback on our SEC filings relating to executive compensation disclosures, including our CD&A disclosures; and 
• Informing the Committee about compensation trends in the industry, best practices and other general trends and developments affecting executive compensation. 
[END TABLE]
The Committee did not direct Meridian to perform its services in any particular manner or under any particular method. The Committee has the final authority to hire and terminate Meridian, and the Committee evaluates Meridian annually. Pursuant to applicable SEC and NYSE rules, the Committee has determined that no conflicts of interest exist related to Meridian's engagement by the Committee. The Committee has retained Meridian as its consultant on NEO and director compensation for 2019.
From time to time, Meridian contacts our NEOs for information needed to fulfill the objectives established by the Committee. However, the Committee established procedures that it considers adequate to ensure that Meridian's advice to the Committee remains objective and is not influenced by our NEOs or other management.
CALLON PETROLEUM      35
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Role of Management
The Committee considers input from our CEO in making determinations regarding our executive compensation program and the individual compensation of each of his direct reports and other select officers of Callon. The officer team makes recommendations to the Committee regarding potential objectives for the annual cash bonus incentive program and provides information to the Committee regarding the performance of the Company for the Committee's determination of annual cash bonuses. The Committee makes the final determination of all elements of NEO compensation. Our CEO makes no recommendations regarding, and does not participate in discussions about, his own compensation.
Role of Market Data
The Compensation Committee of the Board strives to ensure that our executives are compensated in a manner that is fair, equitable, performance-based and guided by the long-term interests of investors. In order to attract, motivate and retain talented executive officers, the Committee must also ensure that our executive compensation program remains competitive with the types and ranges of compensation paid by our peer companies who compete for the same executive talent. On an annual basis, the Committee reviews and discusses compensation data for our CEO and other executive officers as compared with compensation data for similarly situated executive officers at peer companies recommended by Meridian and approved by the Committee.
The Committee engages Meridian to conduct annual assessments of our industry peer group ("Peer Group") in order to ensure each peer remains appropriate year-over-year. The Peer Group is selected based on multiple factors, such as:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Size, including enterprise value and market capitalization; 
• Similar geographic footprint and operational focus, particularly in the Permian Basin; 
• Comparability of asset portfolio; and 
• Availability of compensation data. 
[END TABLE]
The Committee believes this Peer Group provides a reasonable point of reference for comparing the compensation of our executive officers to others holding similar positions and having similar responsibilities. The Committee considers Peer Group data relevant to, but not determinative of, the Committee's consideration of overall executive compensation matters.
The Peer Group used by the Committee in evaluating the competitiveness of executive compensation and making 2018 compensation decisions consisted of the companies in the first column of the following table. The Committee also reviewed data from proprietary E&P benchmarking surveys provided by Meridian for additional market perspective and to validate the Peer Group data.
Due to industry volatility and merger activity, the Committee re-evaluated the Peer Group in preparation for making the May 2018 grants of long-term incentives, resulting in the Peer Group in the second column of the following table. The changes reflect recent transactions in the peer group and better align the Peer Group based on size, geography and ownership. The Committee also revisits the Peer Group as needed to reflect business combinations among peer companies. This Peer Group is being used to measure the Company's relative total shareholder return ("TSR") performance for the May 2018 grant of PSUs and to evaluate the competitiveness of executive compensation beginning in May 2018.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Committee understands the inherent limitations in using any peer group or data set including fluctuations in survey participation and competition for executive talent by companies potentially much larger than Callon. Accordingly, the Committee does not consider data collected from any of these sources to be prescriptive. Rather, the Committee relies upon this and similar data as reference points around which to make informed decisions about the appropriate level and form of compensation for each NEO.
Risk Assessment Related to Our Compensation Structure
The Committee believes our compensation plans and policies are appropriately structured to encourage and reward prudent business judgment and avoid excessive risk-taking. The Committee, with the assistance of Meridian, reviewed the compensation programs maintained by the Company during 2018 to determine whether they encouraged excessive risk taking. Upon evaluation of the assessment, the Committee concluded that our compensation policies and practices for our employees do not present risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Committee's risk review identified the following risk mitigating features of our compensation programs:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A balance of short-term and long-term programs to focus management on both elements of Callon's performance; 
• Annual grants of long-term incentives designed to be the largest component of each NEO's compensation package, with typical vesting periods of three years that are based on the value of our common stock and not on any particular metric that could encourage excessive risk-taking; 
• Performance criteria and targets for our annual bonus program designed to encourage performance, but not excessive risk taking, and discretion to decrease payouts if it is believed management exercised excessive risk taking; 
• Performance targets measured at the corporate level, rather than at the individual or business unit level; 
• Reasonable change in control severance protections; and 
• Significant executive stock ownership requirements. 
[END TABLE]
Determination of Each Element of Compensation
Base Salaries
We provide all of our employees, including the NEOs, with an annual base salary to compensate them for their services throughout the year. Our Committee recognizes that a substantial amount of competition exists in the oil and gas industry for attracting and retaining qualified management teams, particularly in the Permian Basin. Accordingly, the Committee evaluates our NEOs' salaries together with other components of their compensation to ensure that the NEOs' total compensation is competitive relative to market practices in our Peer Group and our industry in general and is consistent with the Committee's compensation philosophy.
Annually, generally in the first quarter of each year, the Committee reviews the base salaries of our NEOs. Individual salary amounts reflect the Committee's subjective analysis of a number of factors, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Individual officer's experience, skills, contributions and tenure with Callon; 
• Changes to the individual's position within Callon; 
• Trends in compensation practices within our Peer Group and industry; and 
• The NEO's roles, responsibilities and expected future contributions to Callon's success. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Committee also considers the input and recommendations of Meridian regarding base salaries, as well as the input of the CEO, when evaluating base salaries for the other NEOs.
After considering the market analysis and advice of Meridian, at its March 2018 meeting, the Committee increased Mr. Gatto's salary from $575,000 to $700,000 to reflect the growth and performance of the Company and his continued development in the CEO role. This increase brought Mr. Gatto's salary closer to a competitive level relative to peers.
CALLON PETROLEUM      37
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Performance-Based Annual Cash Bonus Incentive
A core component of our NEO compensation philosophy is to emphasize pay-for-performance by structuring a significant portion of total annual compensation as "at risk." Each year, the Compensation Committee establishes an annual performance bonus program, which is designed to promote the achievement of annual financial, operating and strategic goals that are aligned with the creation of shareholder value. Performance is judged at the end of the year, or shortly thereafter, based on evaluation of performance against these specified objectives and the Committee's views of corporate and individual performance.
To motivate employees to pursue our annual business goals in a way most beneficial to our shareholders, NEOs, senior management and other non-management technical personnel have the potential to receive a significant portion of their annual cash compensation as a bonus. The Committee set 2018 annual bonus award opportunities for each NEO as a percentage of the NEO's annual base salary as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
NEO Target Bonus Opportunity  (% of Base Salary) 
Joseph C. Gatto, Jr. 100% 
Gary A. Newberry 100% 
James P. Ulm, II 90% 
Other NEOs 60% - 70% 
[END TABLE]
For purposes of evaluating performance, the Committee, in collaboration with management and Meridian, oversees a rigorous process to set performance objectives for the annual bonus program that reflects shareholder and corporate priorities for the upcoming year and provides appropriate incentives for meeting or exceeding our annual corporate plan.
To better align our executive compensation with shareholder priorities including a focus on cash flow and capital efficiency, the Committee modified the performance metrics for the annual bonus program during the first quarter of 2018.  The Committee established both quantitative objectives, which measure operational and financial performance, and qualitative objectives, which evaluate progress on safety and environmental performance and key strategic initiatives. The objectives for 2018 and the Committee's assessment of performance against each are set forth below:
[BEGIN TABLE]

 QUALITATIVE OBJECTIVES 
Objective Assessment and Commentary 
Improve Health, Safety & Environmental Performance Exceeded Target. The Company made meaningful improvements in HES performance in 2018, including improvements of 40% or more in recordable incident rates, proactive safety observations, spill occurrences and spill volumes, while supporting increased production and activity levels. 
Enhance Talent and Organizational Developmental Activities Exceeded Target. The management team added and integrated critical skill sets in subsurface technology, IT, supply chain, risk management and other disciplines. The Company also established an enhanced talent readiness initiative to support employee development. 
Strategic Initiatives Exceeded Target. The Company advanced its longer-term resource capture model through the refinement of larger pad development concepts, completion designs and landing zones.  We also acquired an additional 35,000 net surface acres at competitive prices as strategic "bolt on" assets complementary to our existing footprint.  Management also enhanced financial flexibility through capital markets transactions and an increase in the borrowing base to $1.1B with an elected commitment of $850 million. 
[END TABLE]
The Committee evaluated the NEOs' performance against the 2018 performance criteria described above and determined that overall the management team exceeded the qualitative and quantitative objectives for the year and did so significantly in several areas. Based on the results set forth above and relevant market survey data, the Committee determined actual bonus amounts paid for 2018 performance at approximately 140% of target, as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]

Mitzi P. Conn $240,100 
Gary A. Newberry $665,000 
[END TABLE]
2019 Annual Cash Bonus Program
In March 2019, the Committee established the annual bonus program for 2019 to include a performance-based formulaic assessment for 60% of the bonus and a discretionary assessment linked to qualitative strategic objectives for 40% of the bonus.  Under the program, each officer's bonus is capped at 200% of target. The formulaic portion of the bonus is designed to align executive officers' interests with shareholder priorities of corporate returns on capital and progress towards free cash flow generation and is based on achievement of defined performance levels and weightings related to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Quantitative Objective Weighting 
Oil Production 10% 
(LOE + Cash G&A)/BOE 12.5% 
Proved Developed F&D/BOE 10% 
Net Debt/EBITDA 15% 
Cash Return on Cash Invested 12.5% 
[END TABLE]
The Committee also established strategic qualitative objectives for the 2019 annual cash bonus program related to the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Health, safety and environmental performance 
• Organizational and talent development 
• Advancement of "life of field" development plans and associated well productivity initiatives 
• Other strategic initiatives, including selective divestitures of non-core assets to reduce capital intensity. 
[END TABLE]
Collectively, these qualitative factors will carry a weighting of 40% in the bonus calculation for 2019.

Annual Award of Long-Term Incentives
We believe that a long-term incentive program that includes awards of both restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance stock units ("PSUs") provides appropriate retention incentives and effectively aligns our executive officers' interests with the interests of our shareholders on a long-term basis. Our PSUs have a performance-based component that compares our total shareholder return ("TSR") with that of the Peer Group over a defined performance period. We believe this combination of LTI awards provides appropriate incentives that capture absolute performance of our common stock as well as comparative returns relative to other oil and gas companies. The Committee believes that granting LTI awards is an effective means to provide substantial forward-looking incentives to our executive officers that emphasize:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term value creation by linking compensation with long-term operational success; 
• Alignment of the long-term interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders by directly linking rewards to shareholder return; 
• Retention incentives for our executive officers; and 
• Meaningful equity participation by our executive officers. 
[END TABLE]
The Committee administers our long-term incentive programs, approves award recipients and amounts, and determines the vesting and performance criteria. For the grant of LTI compensation to executive officers, the Committee will typically consider market information provided by Meridian related to the program design and award amounts. We have no program, plan or obligation that requires us to grant LTI compensation on specified dates.
For the 2018 LTI grants, the Committee approved a 40%/60% mix for our executive officers of time-based RSUs and performance based awards tied to relative TSR, respectively. The performance awards are granted as PSUs that settle 50% in cash and 50% in stock. The following table sets forth the number of RSUs and PSUs awarded to the executive officers at our normal annual grant in May 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
NEO Total Value  $ RSUs Payable in  Common Stock(a) PSUs Payable in  50% Stock and 50% cash(b) 
Joseph C. Gatto, Jr. $3,899,990 110,169 165,254

Gary A. Newberry $2,099,999 59,321 88,984 
(a)  Amounts represent RSUs that are subject to three-year ratable vesting with one-third vesting each year subsequent to the award year. The first tranche will vest on June 1, 2019; the second on June 1, 2020; and the third on June 1, 2021 and each tranche will settle in Company common stock on the vesting date. 
(b)  Amounts represent PSUs that are scheduled to vest on December 31, 2020 and settled in 50% Company common stock and 50% cash at a variable rate between 0% and 200% based on our TSR when compared to pre-determined peer companies.

In 2018, the Committee awarded NEOs with time-based RSUs that will vest in one-third increments annually beginning June 1, 2019, provided the executive officer continues to be employed on the vesting dates, and will be paid in shares of the Company's common stock.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
PSU program
In 2018, the Committee awarded PSUs to the NEOs that will vest at the end of the 32-month performance period based on the Company's TSR ranking relative to the "New 2018 Peer Group" listed on page 36. TSR is the change in the common stock price plus dividends over the defined performance period using a 20-day average at the beginning and end of the performance period. The Committee believes relative TSR is an appropriate long-term performance metric because it provides a strong alignment of the interests of management and the Company's shareholders. The Committee also believes that the PSU program provides a good balance to the restricted stock unit program. PSUs are eligible for vesting if the employee continues to be employed until the vesting date on December 31, 2020. PSUs will vest at the percentage set forth below based on the Company's relative TSR ranking for the performance period. Vesting will be interpolated for percentile ranks between the percentiles described:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Callon's TSR Percentile Rank Among the Peer Companies PSUs Vesting as a Percentage of Target   
>=90th Percentile 200% 
70th Percentile 150% 
50th Percentile 100% 
30th Percentile 50% 
<30th Percentile 0% 
[END TABLE]
If the Company's TSR is negative during the performance period the payout will be capped at 100% of target. The vested PSUs will pay out 50% in cash and 50% in shares of the Company's common stock.
Vesting of 2016-2018 Performance Awards
In May 2016, our Compensation Committee granted PSUs to the executive officers that vested on December 31, 2018. Under the provisions of these awards, the awards were subject to our relative TSR performance compared with the TSR of the peer companies specified in the award agreement. The Company's TSR during the performance period ranked fifth relative to the 13 peer companies, resulting in vesting of 142% of the target PSUs awarded. Vested units were paid 50% in cash and 50% in Company common stock.
The table below summarizes the PSUs earned by the executive officers for the 2016-2018 performance period:

Benefits represent a relatively small part of our overall compensation package; however, these benefits help attract and retain senior level executives. We review these benefits annually to ensure that they are competitive with industry norms. We provide benefits commonly offered in the oil and gas E&P industry to all of our employees. These benefits consist of:

• Group medical and dental insurance program for employees and their qualified dependents; 
• Group life insurance for employees and their spouses; 
• Accidental death and dismemberment coverage for employees; 
• Long-term disability coverage; 
• Callon's sponsored cafeteria plan; and 
• 401(k) employee savings and protection plan.

We pay the full costs of these benefits, including the 401(k) plan administration, for all employees. Employee life insurance amounts that surpass the Internal Revenue Service maximum are treated as additional compensation to all employees.
Under our 401(k) plan, employees may elect to defer a portion of their compensation up to the statutorily prescribed limit. The Company provides contributions for qualified employees, including NEOs, of 5% of the employee's IRS eligible salary. We also match employee deferral amounts, including amounts deferred by NEOs, up to a maximum of 5% of IRS eligible salary.
Our NEOs are entitled to certain benefits, or perquisites, that are not otherwise available to all of our employees. We provide our executive officers with use of a Company automobile. We purchase the automobile and pay for all maintenance, repairs, insurance and fuel. The employee is required to recognize taxable income using the Internal Revenue Service's annual lease value method for personal use of the vehicle. The costs associated with these benefits for the NEOs are reported as "Other Compensation" in the Summary Compensation Table. The Committee believes these perquisites are modest, yet competitive with the perquisites provided to similarly situated oil and gas industry executives.
Change in Control Severance Protection
We have no employment agreements with our executive officers, but we do provide change in control severance compensation agreements ("SCAs") with each of our executive officers that provide certain protections upon a change in control. The Committee believes that SCAs serve shareholders' best interests by diminishing potential distractions for our executive officers in the event of a potential corporate restructuring or change in control transaction. These protections also help ensure continuity of management in the event of certain corporate transactions. However, the Committee believes that executives should not be unduly enriched, and all benefits under the SCAs require a "double trigger." For a more detailed explanation of the SCAs, including amendments adopted as of January 1, 2019, please see "Employment Agreements, Termination of Employment and Change in Control ("CIC") Arrangements" on page 50.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
Consistent with its goal of driving long-term value creation for our shareholders, the Committee's stock ownership guidelines require significant stock ownership by the executive officers and directors. The Committee believes that requiring meaningful stock ownership by our executive officers and directors is an important way to further align their interests with the interests of our shareholders and discourage undue risk taking. Accordingly, the Committee has adopted a stock ownership policy which applies to the CEO, the other executive officers and outside directors as described below. The guidelines require the executive officers and directors to hold the following amounts of our stock:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Executive Officers/Directors Required Common Stock Ownership as a Multiple of Annual Base Salary / Annual Retainer 
CEO 6x 
Directors 5x 
Other Executive Officers 2x 
[END TABLE]
The Committee evaluates compliance with these guidelines on an annual basis. For purposes of the guidelines, shares owned indirectly, shares in the executive officer's 401(k) plan and any unvested time-based RSUs are included. The value of unvested PSUs is excluded.
Each executive officer has a transition period of five years from the date the individual becomes subject to the guidelines to attain the required investment position. If an executive officer becomes subject to a greater ownership requirement due to a promotion or an increase in salary, the executive officer will be expected to attain the higher level within three years of the change.
Each outside director is required to achieve the ownership requirement within five years following their election as a director.
All participants are currently in compliance with the stock ownership policy, either through meeting the ownership requirement or by being within the transition period.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Internal Revenue Service Limitations
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code places a limit of $1.0 million on the amount of compensation that we may deduct in any one year with respect to compensation paid to each covered employee. For years prior to 2018, an exception to the deduction limit for compensation qualified as "performance-based." The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017 repealed the "performance-based" exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit. In addition, the limitation on deductibility was expanded to include any individual who is an NEO in 2017 or any later calendar year. As a result, compensation paid to our NEOs in excess of $1 million will not be deductible for years subsequent to 2017, subject to limited transition relief for arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. Despite the change in law, the Committee intends to continue to consider the deductibility of compensation and to implement compensation programs that it believes are competitive and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Insider Trading Policy
The Company's Board has adopted a comprehensive Insider Trading Policy for employees and directors to promote compliance with federal and state securities laws. The policy prohibits certain persons who are aware of material non-public information about a company from: (i) trading in securities of that company; or (ii) providing material non-public information to other persons who may trade on the basis of that information. When material non-public information about us may exist and may have an influence on the marketplace, a trading blackout period is placed in effect by management. In addition, this Insider Trading Policy also applies to family members, other members of a person's household, and entities controlled by a person covered by this Insider Trading Policy. Officers, directors, and designated employees, as well as the family members and controlled entities of such persons, may not engage in any transaction in Company securities without first obtaining pre-clearance of the transaction from our General Counsel.
Under the Insider Trading Policy, directors, executive officers and other employees are prohibited from entering into any hedging or monetization transactions relating to Callon's securities or otherwise trading in any instrument relating to the future securities' price. This Insider Trading Policy also prevents directors and executive officers from pledging Callon common stock as collateral for loans or holding Callon securities in a margin account.
Recoupment Policy
We have no recoupment policy applicable to annual incentive bonuses or LTI awards other than those required under Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, though the Committee regularly evaluates the need to adopt such a policy.
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the CD&A required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act, and based on such review and discussions, the Committee has recommended to the Board that the CD&A be included in this Proxy Statement relating to the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

Employment Agreements, Termination of Employment and Change in Control Arrangements
Employment Agreements
We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers.
Severance Compensation Agreements
We entered into amended Change in Control Severance Compensation Agreements ("SCA") with each of our NEOs effective as of January 1, 2019. The SCA will terminate, except to the extent that any obligation of Callon thereunder remains unpaid as of such time, upon the earliest of (i) December 31, 2019, except that, on each anniversary date thereafter, the expiration date will automatically be extended for one additional year unless, as of such date and prior to such anniversary date, either party has given proper written notice that it does not wish to extend the SCA, but in no event will the expiration date be earlier than the second anniversary of the effective date of a change in control; (ii) the termination of the NEOs employment with Callon based on death, disability (as defined in the SCA), or cause (as defined in the SCA); (iii) the voluntary resignation of the NEOs for any reason other than a post-change in control resignation for good reason (as defined in the SCA); and (iv) any resignation of the NEO prior to a change in control.
Pursuant to the SCA, if the executive is terminated without cause by Callon or for good reason by him within two years following a change in control of Callon (or in certain cases, prior to a change in control), then the executive is entitled to a single lump-sum cash payment equal to an SCA multiple times the sum of (i) the annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the change in control or, if higher, in effect immediately prior to the separation from service, and (ii) the greater of the average bonus earned with respect to the three most recently completed full fiscal years or the target bonus for the fiscal year in which the change in control or termination occurs. For Mr. Gatto, the SCA multiple is three times. For the other NEOs, the SCA multiple is two times. The SCAs also provide that in the event an NEO is eligible for benefits due to a "double trigger" termination, any outstanding equity awards then held by the NEO shall vest in full with any performance-based awards earned at the level specified in the applicable award agreement or, if not specified, at the target level. In addition, we must maintain at our expense until twenty-four months after a separation from service all medical, dental, and health insurance coverage. A change in control as generally defined in the SCA occurs when (i) any person or group of persons acting in concert becomes the beneficial owner of more than 50% of our outstanding common stock; (ii) our shareholders cause a change in the majority of the members of the Board within a thirty-six month period; (iii) there is a change in control in ownership of at least 40% of Company assets; or (iv) a third party acquires more than 30% of the voting power of our common stock in a twelve month period.
The SCAs incorporate a provision to provide for the possible impact of the federal excise tax on excess parachute payments. If any SCA payment is subject to any excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the payment will be reduced so that no portion of the payment is subject to such excise tax if the net benefit payable would be at least as much as it would have been if no reduction was made. The so-called "golden parachute" tax rules subject "excess parachute payments" to a dual penalty: the imposition of a 20 percent excise tax upon the recipient and non-deductibility of such payments by the paying corporation. While the excise tax is seemingly evenhanded, the excise tax can discriminate against long-serving employees in favor of new hires, against individuals who do not exercise stock options in favor of those who do and against those who elect to defer compensation in favor of those who do not. For these reasons, we believe that the "net-best" provision included in the SCA is appropriate.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
The following table shows the estimated gross taxable compensation payable upon termination following a change in control or upon death, disability or retirement. No amounts would be payable upon termination for other causes. The information assumes, in each case, that the officer's termination was effective as of December 31, 2018. In presenting this disclosure, we describe amounts earned through December 31, 2018 and, in those cases where the actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of such executive's separation from us, the estimates are of the amounts which would be paid out to the executives upon their termination.

See "Employment Agreements, Termination of Employment and Change in Control Arrangements."  
(b)  The amounts are calculated based on unvested stock awards at December 31, 2018 using the closing price of $6.49 per share of our common stock on the last trading day of 2018. 
(c)  Benefits consist of twenty-four months of employer provided family medical and dental insurance and disability and life insurance for the NEOs in the table. 
(d)  We entered into a Severance Compensation Agreement with each of the NEOs listed in the table above. See "Employment Agreements, Termination of Employment and Change in Control Arrangements."  
(e)  "Disability" is generally defined as the employee's inability to carry out the normal and usual duties of his employment on a full-time basis for an entire period of six continuous months together with the reasonable likelihood, as determined by the Board after consultation of a qualified physician, he will be unable to carry out his normal and usual duties of employment. "Retirement" is generally defined as the employee's attainment of age 55 with at least 10 years of service.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
CEO Pay Ratio
Pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are disclosing here that the ratio of our median employee's compensation to the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is 40:1.
In order to find the median employee, we used the sum of the base salary and bonus, including any overtime or commission that was paid to the employee. Furthermore, we annualized the bonus, base salary, and any overtime for employees that were not employed the entire 2018 year, other than for temporary and seasonal employees. We identified the median employee from the employee population as of December 31, 2018.
In accordance with SEC rules, we then determined the annual total compensation of our median employee for 2018, which was $137,712. This amount represents the total compensation that would have been reported in the Summary Compensation Table in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(x) of Regulation S-K for the median employee if the employee had been a Named Executive Officer for fiscal year 2018. For purposes of calculating the ratio, an additional value of $2,789 was included in the annual compensation for non-discriminatory benefits bringing the annual total compensation to $140,501.
We determined the amount of the CEO's annual total compensation was $5,577,766 which represents the amount reported for the CEO in the "Total" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table. For purposes of the ratio, an additional value of $23,882 was included in the annual total compensation for non-discriminatory benefits to bring the value to $5,601,148.
Based on the foregoing, for 2018 the ratio of the median of the annual total compensation of all employees to the annual total compensation of our CEO is 40:1.
Callon's CEO Pay Ratio increased from 2017 to 2018 due to several contributing factors. The 2018 Pay Ratio reflects increases in the salary and target long-term incentive value for the CEO that were approved by the Compensation Committee in 2018 in order to better align his compensation with the competitive market, reflect his tenure in the role, and reward performance. In addition, the employee selected as our median employee for the ratio comparison did not receive a long-term incentive award from the Company in 2018 because she commenced employment in the middle of the 2018 calendar year. For this reason, we have calculated an additional pay ratio that includes an estimated amount of long-term incentive value that the median employee would have been awarded for calendar year 2018 had she been employed on the long-term incentive award grant date. If the estimated long-term incentive amount had been included in the median employee's total compensation, then the pay ratio would have been 32:1.
The pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records.

Based solely on our review of these reports received by us during fiscal year 2018, and representations from certain reporting persons that they have complied with the relevant filing requirements, we believe that all such filing requirements were complied with in 2018 and 2019 to date with the exception that Mr. L. Richard Flury had a delinquent Form 5 filing on January 3, 2019 reporting PSUs inadvertently excluded in prior filings that were awarded in 2014-2017.
Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions
The Board's Audit Committee charter provides that the Audit Committee shall review and approve all related party transactions. A transaction will be considered a "related party transaction" if the transaction would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics provides that an officer's or a director's conflict of interest with Callon may only be waived if the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee approves the waiver and the full Board ratifies the waiver.
For the fiscal year ended 2018, David Newberry, who is the son of Gary Newberry, our former Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, received $213,500 in total compensation as an employee of the Company, which is consistent with market compensation for his services. In addition, David Newberry was eligible to participate in all benefit plans and programs available generally to the Company's employees.
For the fiscal year ended 2018, Austin Weant, who is the son of Jerry Weant, our Vice President of Land, received $159,366 in total compensation as an employee of the Company, which is consistent with market compensation for his services. In addition, Austin Weant was eligible to participate in all benefit plans and programs available generally to the Company's employees. 
Except for the foregoing, as of December 31, 2018, we are not aware of any related party transactions with our executive officers that require disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K.

OTHER MATTERS
Shareholders' Proposals and Director Nominations for the 2020 Annual Meeting
In order for a proposal to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "2020 Annual Meeting") pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, such proposal must be received by the Secretary of the Company at our principal executive offices no later than November 29, 2019, and must otherwise be in compliance with the requirements of the SEC's proxy rules. 
For a shareholder proposal to be introduced for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting but not intended to be considered for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy relating to such meeting (i.e. not pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act), including shareholder nominations for candidates for election as directors, a shareholder must provide written notice of such proposal to Company not later than 120 days nor earlier than 150 days before the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting. Any such notice must describe the shareholder proposal in reasonable detail and otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in our Bylaws.
Nominating Process
In accordance with our Certificate of Incorporation, any shareholder may nominate a person for election to the Board upon delivery of written notice to us of such nomination. Such notice must be sent as provided in our Certificate of Incorporation on or before the deadline set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation, and must otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation. For nominations at the 2019 Annual Meeting, the Board will consider individuals identified by shareholders on the same basis as nominees identified from other sources. A submission recommending a nominee should include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sufficient biographical information to allow the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to evaluate the qualifications of a potential nominee in light of the director nomination procedures and criteria and any other information that would be required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of directors; 
• An indication as to whether the proposed nominee will meet the requirements for independence under New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") guidelines; 
• A description of all direct and indirect compensation and other material monetary agreements, arrangements, and understandings during the past three years, and any other material relationships, between or among the nominating shareholder or beneficial owner and each proposed nominee; 
• A completed and signed questionnaire, representation, and agreement, pursuant to the amended and restated bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws"), with respect to each nominee for election or re-election to the Board; and

ANNUAL MEETING INFORMATION
Information Concerning Solicitation and Voting
We are providing you this Proxy Statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting of shareholders of Callon Petroleum Company. The Annual Meeting will be held on Thursday, May 9, 2019 at 9:00 a.m. CDT in the Wishmaker Ballroom of the Hotel Zaza, 9787 Katy Freeway, Houston, Texas. This Proxy Statement contains important information for you to consider when deciding how to vote on the matters brought before the meeting. Please read it carefully.
The Board will primarily solicit proxies by mail, and we will bear all costs incurred in the solicitation of proxies, including the preparation, printing and mailing of these proxy materials. In addition to solicitation by mail, our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies personally or by telephone, email, facsimile or other means, without additional compensation. We may also make arrangements with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for the forwarding of solicitation material to the beneficial owners of the common stock held by such persons, and we may reimburse those brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred in connection therewith. In addition, to assist us with our solicitation efforts, we have retained the services of Innisfree M&A Incorporated for a fee of approximately $20,000, plus out-of-pocket expenses.
Information About Voting and the Annual Meeting
Who may vote
You may vote if you are the record holder of our common stock as of the close of business on the Record Date. On that date, 227,884,091 shares of our common stock were outstanding and are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter considered at this meeting.  A list of shareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available at our office at 1401 Enclave Parkway, Suite 600, Houston, TX 77077 during normal business hours for a period of ten days prior to the meeting and will also be available for inspection at the Annual Meeting.
Attending the Annual Meeting
If you meet the above criteria to vote at our Annual Meeting, you may attend the Annual Meeting. If you wish to attend the Annual Meeting in person, you must present valid, government-issued picture identification. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee and you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, in order to be admitted you must present proof of your beneficial ownership of the common stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, or copy of your Voting Instruction Form or Notice, indicating that you owned shares of our common stock at the close of business on the Record Date.
For safety and security reasons, no cameras, recording equipment, cellular telephones, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in the Annual Meeting. No banners, signs, firearms or weapons will be allowed in the meeting room. We reserve the right to inspect all items entering the meeting room.
Proposals
Qualifying shareholders will vote on the following three proposals at the meeting:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1) The election of directors; 
2) Advisory approval of our executive compensation; and 
3) The ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP. 
[END TABLE]
Notice and access
The Company is furnishing proxy materials to its shareholders through the Internet as permitted under the rules of the SEC. Under these rules, the Company's shareholders will receive a Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of the Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement, our proxy card, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K, often referred to as "notice and access." We believe this process gives us the opportunity to serve you more efficiently by making the proxy materials available quickly online and reducing costs associated with printing and distributing our proxy materials. This Notice includes instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a paper 
CALLON PETROLEUM      60
ANNUAL MEETING INFORMATION
copy of proxy materials, including a proxy card or voting instruction form. In addition and as described in the Notice, shareholders may request to receive future proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email. A shareholder's election to receive proxy materials by mail or email will remain in effect until terminated by the shareholder.
The Company's proxy materials were made available by our Board on the Internet on or about March 28, 2019 at https://www.viewproxy.com/CallonPetroleum/2019, which is the cookies-free website described in the Notice. Accordingly, we are sending the Notice to our shareholders of record and beneficial owners of our stock, and filing the Notice with the SEC, on or about March 28, 2019. Please note that the Notice identifies the Proposals on which shareholders will vote at the meeting, but shareholders cannot vote by marking the Notice and returning it. The Notice provides instructions on how to vote via the Internet, by telephone or by requesting and returning a paper proxy card, or by submitting a ballot in person at the meeting.
In addition to the proxy materials being available for review at https://www.viewproxy.com/CallonPetroleum/2019, the site contains instructions on how to access the proxy materials on a website or to request free of charge printed materials, including a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as filed with the SEC. On an ongoing basis, shareholders may contact our Corporate Secretary at our principal offices in Houston, Texas to request proxy materials by mail or by e-mail.
Casting your vote
There are three methods for registered shareholders to vote by proxy without attending the Annual Meeting:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. By Internet You can vote via the Internet by going to the website address provided on your Notice or proxy card. You will need to use the control and request ID appearing on your proxy card to vote via the Internet. You can use the Internet to transmit your voting instructions up until 11:59 p.m. CDT on May 8, 2019. If you vote via the Internet, you do NOT need to vote by telephone or return a proxy card. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day. 
2. By Telephone You can also vote by telephone by calling the toll-free telephone number provided on your proxy card. You will need to use the control and request ID appearing on your proxy card to vote by telephone. You may transmit your voting instructions from any touch-tone telephone up until 11:59 p.m. CDT on May 8, 2019. Voting by telephone is available 24 hours a day. 
3. By Mail If you received a printed copy of the proxy card, you can vote by marking, dating and signing it, and returning it in the reply envelope provided. Please promptly mail your proxy card to ensure that we receive it prior to the closing of the polls at the Annual Meeting. 
[END TABLE]
If you receive more than one Notice and/or Proxy Statement then it means that your shares are likely registered in more than one account. Please provide voting instructions for all Notices, proxy and voting instruction cards you receive. If you send us a signed proxy card without marking your voting selections, your shares will be voted on each proposal as recommended by our Board, and in the discretion of the proxy holders as to any other matters that may properly come before the meeting or any postponement or adjournment of the meeting. The Board is not presently aware of any other proposals or any other business to be considered at the Annual Meeting.
Difference between a "holder of record" and a "street name" holder
If your shares are registered directly in your name, you are considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank, trust or other nominee, then the broker, bank, trust or other nominee is considered to be the shareholder of record with respect to those shares. However, you are still considered to be the beneficial owner of those shares, and your shares are said to be held in "street name." Street name holders generally cannot submit a proxy or vote their shares directly and must instead instruct the broker, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote their shares. You will receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee that you must follow in order for your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares per your instructions. Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for their beneficial holders to provide instructions via the Internet or over the telephone. If Internet or telephone voting is unavailable from your broker, bank or other nominee, please complete and return the enclosed voting instruction card in the addressed, postage paid envelope provided.
In the event you do not provide instructions on how to vote shares held in street name, your broker may have authority to vote your shares. Under the rules that govern brokers who are voting with respect to shares that are held in street name, brokers have the discretion to vote such shares on routine matters, but they are not permitted to vote (a "broker non-vote") on non-routine or non-discretionary items absent instructions from the beneficial owner. With respect to the Annual Meeting, brokers are prohibited from exercising discretionary authority in the election of directors and the non-binding advisory proposal on 
CALLON PETROLEUM      61
ANNUAL MEETING INFORMATION
executive compensation, but such brokers may exercise discretionary authority with respect to the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm. Your vote is especially important. Therefore, please promptly instruct your broker regarding how to vote your shares on these matters.
If you hold shares through a broker, bank or other nominee and wish to be able to vote in person at the meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee and present it to the inspector of election with your ballot at the meeting. If you need have questions about how to obtain a legal proxy, please call Innisfree M&A Incorporated toll-free at (888)-750-5834. Submitting your proxy by mail will not affect your right to vote in person if you decide to attend the Annual Meeting.
Revoking a proxy
You may revoke or change a previously delivered proxy at any time before the meeting by delivering another proxy with a later date, by voting again via the Internet or by telephone, or by delivering written notice of revocation of your proxy to our Corporate Secretary at our principal offices in Houston, Texas before the beginning of the meeting. You may also revoke your proxy by attending the meeting and voting in person, although attendance at the meeting will not necessarily revoke a valid proxy that was previously delivered. If you hold shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must contact that nominee to revoke any prior voting instructions. You also may revoke any prior voting instructions by voting in person at the meeting if you obtain a legal proxy as described above.
Recommendation of the Board
The Board unanimously recommends you vote "FOR" each of the proposals. A proxy that is properly completed and submitted will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions on the proxy. If you properly complete and submit a proxy, but do not indicate any contrary voting instructions, your shares will be voted as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of each of the nominees named in this Proxy Statement to our Board of Directors; 
• "FOR" the approval, on an advisory basis, of our executive compensation; and 
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
Counting the vote
We have appointed Alliance Advisors to tabulate and certify the vote.
Quorum
A quorum is the number of shares that must be present to hold the meeting. The quorum requirement for the meeting is a majority of the outstanding shares as of the Record Date, present in person or represented by proxy. We will count your shares for purposes of determining if there is a quorum if either you are present and vote in person at the meeting or have voted on the Internet, by telephone or by properly submitting a proxy card or voting instruction card by mail. Abstentions and broker non-votes also count toward the quorum.
Required Vote
Proposal 1 - Election of directors
The nominees for election as directors will be elected by a plurality of all votes cast, subject to the Company's majority voting policy. Because the number of director nominees equals the number of directors to be elected at this Annual Meeting, to be elected, each director must receive a majority of the votes cast. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of shares voted "withheld." Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be included in determining the number of votes cast in the election of directors and will not have any effect on the outcome. This majority voting standard is discussed further under "Proposal 1 - Election of directors - Majority Vote Standard."
Proposal 2 - Advisory vote to approve NEO compensation
The advisory vote on our executive compensation is non-binding, so no specific vote is required. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal, and broker non-votes will not be counted as shares present and entitled to vote, and, accordingly, will not affect the outcome of the vote on this proposal. While the law requires this advisory vote, the vote will neither be binding on us or our Board, nor will it create or imply any change in the fiduciary duties of, or impose any additional 
62      CALLON PETROLEUM
ANNUAL MEETING INFORMATION
fiduciary duty on, us or our Board. However, the views of our shareholders are important to us, and our Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. We urge you to read the section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," which discusses in detail how our executive compensation program implements our compensation philosophy.
Proposal 3 - Ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm
The advisory vote on the ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year is non-binding, so no specific vote is required. If you hold your shares through a broker and you do not instruct the broker how to vote, your broker will have the authority to vote your shares in its discretion on this proposal. An abstention will have the effect of a vote against this proposal. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board or the Company. However, the Board and the Audit Committee will consider the outcome of the vote in determining the selection of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
Voting Results
We will announce the preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and will publish the final voting results in a current report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four business days of the meeting.
Householding Information
The SEC permits companies and intermediaries (such as brokers and banks) to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement and annual report to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," is intended to reduce the volume of duplicate information shareholders receive and reduce expenses for companies. Both we and some of our intermediaries may be householding our proxy materials and annual report. Once you have received notice from your broker or another intermediary that they will be householding materials sent to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. Should you wish to receive separate copies of our Annual Report and Proxy Statement in the future, we will promptly deliver a separate copy of each of these documents to you if you send a written request to us at our address appearing on the cover of this proxy statement, to the attention of the Corporate Secretary. If you hold your shares through an intermediary that is householding and you want to receive separate copies of our Annual Report and Proxy Statement in the future, you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee record holder.
Financial Statements and Other Available Documents
Financial statements for our most recent fiscal year are contained in the 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders and our Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2019. Our Annual Report, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Charters of Board Committees may be accessed by shareholders on our website at www.callon.com or printed copies are available upon written request to Michol Ecklund, Corporate Secretary at our principal executive office in Houston, Texas.
Other Business
The Board is not aware of any matter to be acted upon at the 2019 Annual Meeting other than those described above. If other business properly comes before the 2019 Annual Meeting, the persons named on the proxy will vote the proxy in accordance with what they consider to be in the best interests of us and our shareholders. Please sign, date, and return your proxy promptly to avoid unnecessary expense. All shareholders are urged, regardless of the number of shares owned, to participate in the 2019 Annual Meeting by voting their shares.
