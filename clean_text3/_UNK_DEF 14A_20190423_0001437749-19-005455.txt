PROXY STATEMENT
This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are being furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc. (the "Company") of proxies to be voted at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on April 23, 2019, at 3:00 P.M. at Piney Branch Golf & Country Club, 5301 Trenton Mill Road, Upperco, Maryland 21155, and any adjournment or postponements thereof. The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. In addition to solicitation by mail, proxies may be solicited by officers, directors and regular employees of the Company personally or by telephone, electronic mail and/or facsimile. No additional remuneration will be paid to officers, directors or regular employees who solicit proxies. The Company may reimburse brokers, banks, custodians, nominees and other fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in forwarding proxy materials to their principals. The approximate date on which this proxy statement and the related proxy card will be sent or given to stockholders is March 22, 2019.
When used in this proxy statement, the terms "the Company", "we", "us", and "our" refer to Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc. and, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, its consolidated subsidiaries.
OUTSTANDING SHARES; VOTING RIGHTS; QUORUM AND REQUIRED VOTE
Stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22, 2019 (the "Record Date") of issued and outstanding shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, 1,682,997 shares of the Common Stock were issued and outstanding. Each share is entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to stockholders.
The presence, in person or by proxy, of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. Withheld votes (in the case of the election of directors), abstentions and broker non-votes will all be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
Directors are elected by a plurality of all votes cast. Accordingly, the withholding of votes, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no impact on the outcome of the vote on Proposal 1, as described in this proxy statement. The ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, as described in Proposal 2, require the affirmative vote of a majority of all shares of Common Stock voted at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, an abstention or a broker non-vote with respect to Proposal 2 will have no impact on the outcome of that proposal. Except in cases of certain extraordinary matters for which the Company's governing instruments or applicable law require a different proportion, the affirmative vote of a majority of all shares of Common Stock voted at the Annual Meeting is sufficient to approve any motion that comes before the meeting pursuant to Proposal 3, as described in this proxy statement. Abstentions and broker non-votes with respect to any motion that comes before the meeting pursuant to Proposal 3 (other than certain extraordinary matters as discussed above) will have no impact on the outcome of the vote on such motion.
All properly executed proxy cards received pursuant to this solicitation will be voted as directed by the stockholders in those proxy cards. If no direction is given in your proxy card, then, subject to the procedures governing broker non-votes (see the following paragraph), your shares will be voted FOR ALL NOMINEES named in Proposal 1, FOR ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm named in Proposal 2, and in the discretion of the proxies as to any other matters that may properly come before the meeting, as described in Proposal 3.
Please note that if you hold your shares in a stock brokerage account or if your shares are held by a bank or other nominee (that is, in "street name"), your broker, bank or other nominee will not vote your shares of common stock (a "broker non-vote") unless you provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee. You should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares by following the instructions provided by the broker, bank or other nominee when it sends this proxy statement to you. You may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to the Company or by voting in person at the annual meeting unless you provide a "legal proxy", which you must obtain from your bank, broker or other nominee.
A stockholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time before its use by execution of another proxy card bearing a later date, or by written notice delivered to the Corporate Secretary at the Company's address listed above or at the meeting.
Stockholders do not have dissenters' rights of appraisal or similar rights with respect to any of the proposals to be presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE STOCKHOLDER MEETING TO BE HELD ON April 23, 2019

Generally, a person "beneficially owns" shares as of a given date if he or she has or shares with others the right to vote those shares or to invest (or dispose of) those shares, or if he or she has the right to acquire such voting or investment rights, within 60 days of such date (such as by exercising stock options or similar rights). The percentages were calculated based on 1,682,997 issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of the Record Date, plus, for each named person, any shares that such person may acquire within 60 days of such date.

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS (Proposal 1)
The number of directors constituting the Company's Board of Directors is currently set at 11. The Board of Directors, by resolution approved by a majority vote thereof, may alter the number of directors from time to time. The Company's directors are divided into four classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with respect to the time for which the directors may hold office. Each director is elected to hold office for a term of four years, and the terms of one class of directors expire each year. A director who is elected by the Board, rather than by stockholders, to fill a vacancy in a class of directors is elected to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders. In all cases, directors serve until their successors are duly elected and qualify.
The current Class I Directors, whose terms expire at the conclusion of the 2019 Annual Meeting, are Roger D. Cassell, John J. Schuster, Jr., and Paul F. Wooden, Jr. The Board of Directors, at the recommendation of the Nominating Committee, has nominated each of these incumbent Class I Directors to stand for re-election. Accordingly, stockholders will be asked to vote for the election of the above-named directors to serve on the Board for a new four-year term and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. Each of these directors was previously elected by stockholders. Information about the principal occupations, business experience and qualifications of these nominees is provided below under the heading "QUALIFICATIONS OF DIRECTOR NOMINEES AND CONTINUING DIRECTORS". In the event a nominee declines or is unable to serve as a director, which is not anticipated, the proxies will vote in their discretion with respect to a substitute nominee named by the Board.
Stockholders may not vote their shares for a greater number of persons than the three director nominees named in this proxy statement and on the proxy card.
The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR ALL NOMINEES named above.
CONTINUING DIRECTORS

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS
Committees of the Board of Directors
The Company's Board of Directors and the Bank's Board of Directors are composed of the same individuals. These boards have appointed from their members a joint Executive Committee, a joint Audit Committee, a joint Compensation Committee, and a joint Nominating Committee.
Executive Committee. The function of the Executive Committee is to direct and transact any business which may properly come before the Board of Directors, except for such business that only the Board of Directors is authorized by law to perform. The members of the Executive Committee are Paul F. Wooden, Jr., Chairman, John J. Schuster, Jr., Vice Chairman, Roger D. Cassell and J. Lawrence Mekulski. James R. Bosley, Jr., who is a director and the CEO of the Bank, is invited to attend all meetings of the Executive Committee and to participate in its discussions, but he is not entitled to vote on any matter before the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee met 12 times in 2018.
Audit Committee – The Audit Committee, which met seven times in 2018, was established to perform the duties of an "audit committee" as defined in Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and consists of Paul F. Wooden, Jr., Chairman, Edward A. Halle, Jr., Steven W. Eline, and Bruce L. Schindler. The committee is responsible for hiring, setting the compensation of and overseeing the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and it also assists the Board in monitoring the integrity of the financial statements, in monitoring the performance of the Company's internal audit function, and in monitoring the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. In carrying out its duties, the committee meets with the internal and independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the overall scope and plans for their respective audits, the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. The Board has determined that all audit committee members are financially literate and that Paul F. Wooden, Jr. qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined by the Securities Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in Item 407 of Regulation S-K. The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, a copy of which is available on our website, www.fmb1919.com, and may be accessed by clicking on "Investor Relations", then "Committee Charting" and then "Audit Committee".
Compensation Committee – The Compensation Committee, which met two times in 2018, consists of Bruce L. Schindler, Chairman, Steven W. Eline, Edward A. Halle, Jr., and Paul F. Wooden, Jr. The committee is responsible for developing policies for executive and director compensation, recommending to the Board the amounts and forms of compensation that should be paid to executive officers and directors, and overseeing the Company's various compensation plans. The committee develops its recommendations for executive compensation based on the principles discussed below under the heading "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION". The Board reviews and approves or ratifies committee recommendations. The Compensation Committee has adopted a written charter, a copy of which is available on our website, www.fmb1919.com, and may be accessed by clicking on "Investor Relations", then "Committee Charting" and then "Compensation Committee".
Nominating Committee – The Nominating Committee consists of Paul F. Wooden, Jr., Chairman, Ronald W. Hux, Louna S. Primm, Bruce L. Schindler, and John J. Schuster, Jr. The committee is responsible for developing qualification criteria for directors, reviewing director candidates recommended by stockholders (see "Director Recommendations and Nominations" below), actively seeking, interviewing and screening individuals qualified to become directors, recommending to the Board those candidates who should be nominated to serve as directors, and developing and recommending to the Board the Corporate Governance Guidelines applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. This committee met one time in 2018. The Nominating Committee has a written charter, a copy of which is available on our website, www.fmb1919.com, and may be accessed by clicking on "Investor Relations", then "Committee Charting" and then "Nominating Committee".
In addition to the foregoing committees, the Bank's board of directors has appointed a Loan Committee, a Facilities Committee, an Asset Liability Committee; and a Marketing Steering Committee. The Loan Committee, which met 23 times in 2018, reviews and approves certain loan transactions, and its members are James R. Bosley, Jr., Roger D. Cassell, Edward A. Halle, Jr., J. Lawrence Mekulski, Louna S. Primm, and John J. Schuster, Jr. The Facilities Committee, which met three times in 2018, oversees the maintenance of the Bank's facilities and is composed of John J. Schuster, Jr., Chairman, James R. Bosley, Jr., Steven W. Eline, J. Lawrence Mekulski, Teresa L. Smack. Ronald W. Hux is an alternate.

Wooden, Jr. The Marketing Steering Committee, which met one time in 2018, oversees the Bank's marketing strategies and assists the Board with strategic development and is composed of Bruce L. Schindler, Chairman, James R. Bosley, Jr., Roger D. Cassell, Ronald W. Hux, and Teresa L. Smack
Director Independence
To determine whether each of the directors is independent, the Board has adopted the independence standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market Rules (the "NASDAQ Rules"). The Board has determined that each of Roger D. Cassell, Steve W. Eline, Edward A. Halle, Jr., Ronald W. Hux, J. Lawrence Mekulski, Louna S. Primm, Bruce L. Schindler, John J. Schuster, Jr., Teresa L. Smack, Paul F. Wooden, Jr., is an "independent director" as that term is defined by Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Rules. Each member of the Compensation Committee and of the Nominating Committee is an "independent director". Each member of the Audit Committee satisfies the audit committee independence requirements of NASDAQ Rule 5605(c)(2)(A). In making these independence determinations, the Board considered, in addition to the transactions described in the "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS" section of this proxy statement, the Bank's purchase of services from a company in which Mr. Cassell has a controlling interest; products purchased from a company in which Mr. Eline has a controlling interest, products purchased from a company in which Mr. Hux has a controlling interest, and products purchased from a company in which Mr. Schindler has a controlling interest.
Board Leadership and Role in Risk Oversight
The Board has separated the positions of Chairman of the Board and CEO in an effort to maintain independent oversight of management. The Board elects from its members a Chairman who it believes will be an effective leader and who satisfies the "independent director" standards of NASDAQ Rule 5605(b)(1). The Board believes that this bifurcated structure best suits the Company because it helps to ensure that the Board has a strong, independent leader who can objectively review operations and the performance of management. In addition, the Board believes that it is important to allow the CEO to concentrate on running the day-to-day operations of the Company and the implementation of the Board's policies and procedures without the added burden of also managing the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors administers risk oversight by assigning various organizational risk oversight functions to its committees, which report to the full Board on a regular basis.
The Bank's Loan Committee monitors the Bank's credit risk in accordance with guidelines established by the Bank's board of directors and bank regulatory agencies, and is charged with approving loans made by the Bank within acceptable guidelines. The Bank's Loan Committee also monitors the Bank's concentrations of commercial real estate loans and the risk rating of loans.
The Audit Committee monitors compliance risk, risks related to our reputation, our internal control over financial reporting, including the internal audit function, and the performance of and reports by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
The Executive Committee monitors the Bank's market and strategic risks through its oversight of marketing and strategic initiatives, and regularly meets with the CEO, the Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO"), and the Chief Operations Officer (the "COO") so that it may be kept apprised of the Bank's general operating environment. The Executive Committee also helps ensure director independence through its nominating authority, and it manages compensation risk through its authority to review and recommend the Bank's executive compensation practices and policies.
Interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and valuation risk are monitored by the Bank's Asset Liability Committee. Credit risk and transaction risk are monitored by the Bank's Loan Committee.
Attendance at Board Meetings
The Board of Directors held 13 meetings in 2018. Each director who served as such during 2018 attended at least 75% of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors (held during the period served) and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which that person served (held during the period served), except that Teresa L. Smack attended 63% of such meetings.
Director Recommendations and Nominations
The Nominating Committee will from time to time review and consider candidates recommended by stockholders. Stockholder recommendations should be labeled "Recommendation of Director Candidate" and be submitted in writing to: Corporate Secretary, Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc., 4510 Lower Beckleysville Road, Suite H, Hampstead, Maryland 21074; and must specify (i) the recommending stockholder's contact information, (ii) the class and number of shares of the Company's capital stock beneficially owned by the recommending stockholder, (iii) the name, address and credentials of the candidate for nomination, (v) the number of shares of the Company's capital stock beneficially owned by the candidate, and (iv) the candidate's written consent to be considered as a candidate. Such recommendation must be received by the Corporate Secretary no less than 150 days nor more than 180 days before the date of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders for which the candidate is being recommended. For purposes of this requirement, the date of the meeting shall be deemed to be on the same day and month as the Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the preceding year.
Candidates may come to the attention of the Nominating Committee from current directors, executive officers, stockholders, or other persons. The Nominating Committee does not have a formal policy under which it considers the diversity of candidates for directorship when making nomination recommendations. The Nominating Committee periodically reviews its list of candidates available to fill Board vacancies and researches the talent, skills, expertise, and general background of these candidates. In evaluating candidates for nomination, the Nominating Committee uses a variety of methods and regularly assesses the size of the Board, whether any vacancies are expected due to retirement or otherwise, the need for particular expertise on the Board, and whether the Company's market areas are adequately represented by Board members. In nominating director candidates, the Nominating Committee generally seeks to choose individuals that have skills, education, experience and other attributes that will complement and/or broaden the strengths of the existing directors.
Whether recommended by a stockholder or another third party, or recommended independently by the Nominating Committee, a candidate will be selected for nomination based on his or her talents and the needs of the Board. The Nominating Committee's goal in selecting nominees is to identify persons that possess complementary skills and that can work well together with existing Board members at the highest level of integrity and effectiveness. A candidate, whether recommended by a Corporation stockholder or otherwise, will not be considered for nomination unless he or she maintains strong professional and personal ethics and values, has relevant management experience, and is committed to enhancing financial performance. Certain Board positions, such as Audit Committee membership, may require other special skills, expertise or independence from the Company.
It should be noted that a stockholder recommendation is not a nomination, and there is no guarantee that a candidate recommended by a stockholder will be approved by the Nominating Committee or nominated by the Board of Directors. A stockholder who is entitled to vote for the election of directors and who desires to nominate a candidate for election to be voted on at a Meeting of Stockholders may do so only in accordance with Section 4 of Article II of the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws, which provides that a stockholder may nominate a director candidate by written notice to the Chairman of the Board or the President not less than 150 days nor more than 180 days prior to the date of the meeting of stockholders called for the election of directors which, for purposes of this requirement, shall be deemed to be on the same day and month as the Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the preceding year. Such notice must contain the following information to the extent known by the notifying stockholder: (i) the name and address of each proposed nominee; (ii) the principal occupation of each proposed nominee; (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company which are owned beneficially or of record by each proposed nominee; (iv) the name and residence address of the notifying stockholder; (v) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company which are owned beneficially or of record by the notifying stockholder; (vi) the consent in writing of the proposed nominee as to the proposed nominee's name being placed in nomination for director; and (vii) all information relating to such proposed nominee that would be required to be disclosed by Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-11 promulgated thereunder, assuming such provisions would be applicable to the solicitation of proxies for such proposed nominee (and regardless of whether they do apply). Accordingly, a stockholder who desires to nominate a person for election to the Board at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must submit such nomination as provided above no earlier than October 26, 2019 and no later than November 25, 2019.
It should be further noted that the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws specify that no person, including an incumbent director, is eligible to serve on the Board after the annual meeting of stockholders that immediately follows his or her 75th birthday except for an incumbent director of the Bank who was (i) serving as such on August 8, 2016 (i.e., the date on which the Company was incorporated) and (ii) at least 75 years old as of July 1, 2006.
Stockholder Communications with the Board of Directors
Stockholders may communicate with the Board of Directors, including the non-employee directors, by sending a letter to the Board of Directors, c/o Corporate Secretary, Farmers and Merchants Bancshares, Inc., 4510 Lower Beckleyville Road, Suite H, Hampstead, Maryland 21074. The Corporate Secretary will deliver all stockholder communications directly to the Board of Directors for consideration.
The Company believes that the Annual Meeting of Stockholders is an opportunity for stockholders to communicate directly with directors and, accordingly, expects that all directors will attend each Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If you would like an opportunity to discuss issues directly with our Directors, please consider attending this year's Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders was attended by nine persons who were then serving on the Board of Directors.
Family Relationships Among Directors, Nominees and Executive Officers
There are no family relationship between any of the directors, director nominees or executive officers.

In 2018, non-employee directors received $675 for each board meeting attended and $430 for each committee meeting attended. Director compensation is set by the entire board of directors of the Bank. Each year, the Bank's board of directors reviews one or more independently conducted director compensation surveys provided by the Bank's independent registered public accounting firm. The Board did not retain a compensation consultant to provide advice with respect to the compensation paid to directors in 2018.
From time to time, the boards of the Company and the Bank may choose to appoint a person to serve as a director emeritus, where the boards believe that they may benefit from such person's experience, insight and other attributes. A director emeritus is invited to attend all board meetings and to participate in board discussions, but he or she is not entitled to vote on any matter that may come before the board or any of its committees. A director emeritus is entitled to receive a cash fee for each meeting attended. For 2018, the fee amount was $675. These fees are paid by the Bank.
Upon his retirement from the Board of Directors in April 2017, the Board appointed Kenneth W. Hoffmeyer to serve as a director emeritus for a two-year term.  Mr. Hoffmeyer served on the Board of Directors for 29 years, including as Chairman of the Board from 2010 - 2015.  He was also Chairman of the Audit Committee for many years where his Certified Public Accountant designation and outside accounting experience were utilized.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Officers do not receive remuneration for their service to the Company. All compensation is paid by the Bank.
The Bank's board of directors, upon the recommendation of its Compensation Committee, establishes executive compensation each year. In recommending compensation levels, the Compensation Committee reviews annual evaluations that measure performance against previously established goals for the year. In addition, the board reviews one or more independently conducted surveys. In 2018, the Board reviewed two surveys. One was a general publication that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm provided at no cost to all of its clients, and the other was a general survey prepared by the American Bankers Association for which the Bank paid $300. The Bank's CEO makes compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee for executive officers other than himself. From time to time, the Compensation Committee retains outside compensation consultants to evaluate the Bank's executive compensation practices and plans. The Compensation Committee did not retain a compensation consultant to provide advice with respect to the compensation paid to executive officers in 2018.
The following table sets forth, for each of the last two calendar years (which were also the Company's last two fiscal years), the total remuneration awarded to, earned by, or paid to (i) any person who served as the Company's principal executive officer at any time during 2018, (ii) the Company's two most highly compensated executive officers other than the principal executive officer who were serving as such as of December 31, 2018 and whose total compensation (excluding above-market and preferential earnings on nonqualified deferred compensation) exceeded $100,000 during 2018, and (iii) up to two additional individuals for whom disclosure would have been provided pursuant to the foregoing item (ii) had they been serving as executive officers of the Company as of December 31, 2018 (the principal executive officer(s) and such other persons are referred to as the "named executive officers"). For this purpose, the term "executive officer" includes any executive officers of the Company or the Bank who performs a policy making function for the Company. The Company has determined that the named executive officers for purposes of this proxy statement include James R. Bosley, Jr., and Christopher T. Oswald and Mark C. Krebs. In calendar years 2018 and 2017, executive compensation included annual base salary, income from a bonus plan, and income related to the Bank's employee benefit plans.

Employment Arrangements
Executive officers are appointed by the board of directors annually and are employed on an at-will basis. No executive officer is a party to any written employment agreement with the Company or the Bank. Each executive officer is paid a base salary, participates in a bonus program, and participates in various employee benefit plans and programs to the extent the executive officer qualifies for such participation under the terms and conditions of the benefit plans, including the Bank's 401(k) profit sharing plan. Any employee, including an executive officer, may elect to waive coverage under the Bank's health insurance plan, in which case he or she will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to 40% of the net annual cost to the Bank of the insurance coverage. Messrs. Bosley and Oswald are additionally eligible to receive benefits under the Bank's bank-owned life insurance ("BOLI") plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan Agreements ("SERP Agreements"), as described below. Mr. Krebs is eligible to receive benefits under the Performance Driven Plan, as described below.
Base salary for each executive is set annually by the Bank's board of directors, upon the recommendation of its Compensation Committee. The salaries for 2019 for the Bank's named executive officers are as follows: Mr. Bosley, $260,763; Mr. Oswald, $183,575; and Mr. Krebs, $188,226.
Bonus Programs
The Bank's board of directors has implemented a bonus program under which certain officers are entitled to share each year in a bonus pool the amount of which is based on the Bank's net income for that year. Participation is available to the President/CEO, Executive Vice Presidents, Senior Vice Presidents and Vice Presidents, other than Senior Vice Presidents and Vice Presidents who are involved in lending activities. The bonus pool amount is determined as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Net Income   Bonus Pool  
 Less than $3.00 million   0.0% of Net Income  
 $3.00 million to $3.75 million   3.5% of Net Income  
 Over $4.50 million   4.5% of Net Income  
[END TABLE]
There is no formula for determining how much of the pool is paid to a particular officer. Rather, the amount for each officer is recommended by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board. Historically, the percentages of the pool paid to Messrs. Bosley, Oswald, and Krebs have been 29%, 17% and 17%, respectively, and these were the amounts awarded in 2018 and 2017. These bonus amounts are shown in the Summary Compensation Table above under the heading "Nonequity incentive plan compensation".
Profit Sharing Plan
The Bank has a profit sharing plan that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "IRC"). All employees age 21 or older with six months of service are eligible to participate in the plan. The Bank matches employee contributions up to 4% of total compensation and may make additional optional contributions. Employee and employer contributions are 100% vested when made.
Bank-Owned Life Insurance Plan Benefits
To attract and retain key employees, the Bank implemented a BOLI plan in 2002 to provide benefits to the named beneficiaries of certain officers of the Bank, including Messrs. Bosley and Oswald. Mr. Krebs is not a participant in the BOLI plan.
In 2002 and 2004, the Bank invested $3,500,000 in life insurance policies covering 18 officers, including Messrs. Bosley and Oswald.  Although the Bank owns these policies, including the cash surrender values of the policies, the Bank currently intends to assign a portion of the death benefits payable under these policies to the covered executive's estate at the time of his or her death, whether or not he or she is employed at the time of his death, unless the covered executive's employment was terminated for cause prior to his death.  The amount of the portion to be assigned to a particular executive's estate will depend on the reason that such executive's employment was terminated at or prior to death.  The aggregate cash surrender value of these policies at December 31, 2018 is $7,053,354.
The amounts of the benefits that could have been paid to the beneficiaries of Messrs. Bosley and Oswald in connection with these policies as of December 31, 2018 are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Name     Reason for Termination     Estimated BOLI Benefits    
   Name     Reason for Termination     Estimated BOLI Benefits    
 Mr. Bosley   Death    $ 1,033,210   
   Other than death or disability      283,210   
 Mr. Oswald   Death    $ 572,691   
   Other than death or disability      272,691   
[END TABLE]
Group Term Life Insurance
The Bank provides group term life insurance coverage to all Bank employees, including each of the named executive officers. For federal tax purposes, employees recognize imputed income each year on the amount of premiums paid by the Bank for the portion of insurance in excess of $50,000.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan Agreements
The Bank entered into SERP Agreements with Mr. Bosley and Mr. Oswald in December 2010, which were amended in February 2011. The SERP Agreements, which are administered by the Board of Directors or one of its committees, are intended to provide deferred cash compensation to each of the executive officers under certain circumstances, including upon a Separation from Service. The term "Separation from Service" is defined as the termination of the executive's employment with the Bank for reasons other than death, determined in accordance with Section 409A of the IRC. Under the SERP Agreements, benefits will be paid as follows:

Mr. Bosley will be entitled to the annual cash benefit described below (the "Retirement Benefit") for 20 years if he suffers a Separation from Service after reaching the retirement age of 57, and Mr. Oswald will be entitled to the Retirement Benefit for 20 years after attaining the retirement age of 63. The Retirement Benefit will be an amount equal to 35% of the average of the executives' three highest base salaries for the three-year period preceding the date on which the payment obligation is triggered, including the year in which the triggering event occurs (the "Average Salary"). Each annual Retirement Benefit will be paid in 12 equal monthly installments commencing within 90 days following the triggering event.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Early Involuntary Termination Benefit. If, after reaching age 48 but prior to reaching his specified retirement age, an executive suffers a Separation from Service that constitutes an Early Involuntary Termination, then the executive will be entitled to receive an annual benefit (the "Involuntary Termination Benefit") for 20 years equal to a percentage of the executive's Average Salary, determined as of the end of the Plan Year (as defined in the SERP Agreement). The percentage is based on the executive's age at the time of the Separation from Service, starting at 20% for Mr. Oswald. Until age 62 for Mr. Oswald, the percentage increases by 1% for each additional year after age 48. Each annual Involuntary Termination Benefit will be paid in 12 equal monthly installments commencing within 90 days following the Separation from Service. The term "Early Involuntary Termination" means a Separation from Service (other than a termination for cause, as defined in the SERP Agreement) due to the independent exercise of the unilateral authority of the Bank to terminate the executive's employment where the executive was willing and able to continue performing services. This benefit does not apply to Mr. Bosley since he has reached the retirement age.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Early Voluntary Termination Benefit. If an executive experiences a Separation from Service prior to reaching his specified retirement age that constitutes an Early Voluntary Termination (as defined in the SERP Agreement), then the executive will be entitled to receive cash equal to 100% of the Accrual Balance determined as of the end of the month prior to the Separation from Service. The Accrual Balance will be paid over 20 years in equal monthly installments commencing within 90 days following the Separation from Service, provided that the executive is entitled to receive minimum annual payments of $2,547 for Mr. Oswald. The term "Accrual Balance" means the liability that the Bank is required to accrue, under GAAP, for the Bank's obligation to the executive under the SERP Agreement, by applying Accounting Principles Board Opinion Number 12, as amended, and the Discount Rate. Interest will accrue on the unpaid portion of the Accrual Balance at a rate equal to the Discount Rate and will be added thereto. The term "Discount Rate" means the Moody's 20 year AA Corporate Bond rate less 0.25%, with the initial rate set at 4.68%. The Board of Directors may adjust the Discount Rate to maintain the rate within reasonable standards according to GAAP and/or applicable bank regulatory guidance. This benefit does not apply to Mr. Bosley since he has reached the retirement age.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Disability Benefit. If an executive experiences a Separation from Service after a Disability (as defined in the SERP Agreement) and prior to reaching his specified retirement age, then the executive will be entitled to receive cash equal to 100% of the Accrual Balance determined as of the end of the month prior to the Separation from Service. The Accrual Balance will be paid over 20 years in equal monthly installments commencing within 90 days following the Separation from Service, provided that the executive is entitled to receive minimum annual payments of $2,547 for Mr. Oswald. Interest will accrue on the unpaid portion of the Accrual Balance at a rate equal to the Discount Rate and will be added thereto. This benefit does not apply to Mr. Bosley since he has reached the retirement age.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Change in Control Benefit. If a Change in Control (as defined in the SERP Agreement) occurs prior to the executive reaching his specified retirement age and he thereafter experiences a Separation from Service within 24 months thereof, then the executive will be entitled to receive cash in an amount equal to the present value of a 20-year payment stream equal to 35% of the executive's Average Salary, using a rate equal to the Discount Rate in effect at the time of the Separation from Service (the "CIC Benefit"). The CIC Benefit will be distributed over five years in equal monthly installments commencing within 90 days of the Separation from Service. This benefit does not apply to Mr. Bosley since he has reached the retirement age.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Death Benefit. If the executive dies prior to a Separation from Service, then the executive's designated beneficiaries will be entitled to cash in an amount equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the Accrual Balance as of the end of the month prior to death and (ii) $1,241,245 in the case of Mr. Bosley and $803,631 in the case of Mr. Oswald (the "Death Benefit"). The Death Benefit will be paid in a single lump sum within 90 days following death.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Benefit Upon Termination of the SERP Agreement. If the Bank and an executive agree to terminate his SERP Agreement, then the executive will receive the Accrual Balance as of the date of termination, which generally will be paid at the earliest distribution date that would have occurred if the SERP Agreement had not been terminated. If the Bank terminates the SERP Agreement (i) in connection with a Change in Control, (ii) upon its dissolution or in connection with its bankruptcy, or (iii) in connection with the termination of all other compensatory arrangements that would be aggregated with the SERP Agreement pursuant to Section 409A of the IRC (to the extent the executive participated in such other arrangements), then, subject to certain conditions specified in the SERP Agreement, including compliance with Section 409A of the IRC, the Bank may distribute the Accrual Balance, determined as of the date of the termination, to the executive in a lump sum.  
[END TABLE]
The following table sets forth the current amounts that could be paid to the executives under each of the situations described above, calculated as of December 31, 2018. Mr. Bosley has reached his specified retirement age of 57.
[BEGIN TABLE]
       Normal  Retirement  Benefit       Early Involuntary Termination  Benefit       Early Voluntary  Termination  Benefit           Disability Benefit           CIC Benefit           Death Benefit         Benefit Upon  Termination  of Agreement    
       Normal  Retirement  Benefit       Early Involuntary Termination  Benefit       Early Voluntary  Termination  Benefit           Disability Benefit           CIC Benefit           Death Benefit         Benefit Upon  Termination  of Agreement    
       Normal  Retirement  Benefit       Early Involuntary Termination  Benefit       Early Voluntary  Termination  Benefit           Disability Benefit           CIC Benefit           Death Benefit         Benefit Upon  Termination  of Agreement    
       Normal  Retirement  Benefit       Early Involuntary Termination  Benefit       Early Voluntary  Termination  Benefit           Disability Benefit           CIC Benefit           Death Benefit         Benefit Upon  Termination  of Agreement    
[END TABLE]
If benefit payments have begun and an executive dies before all payments have been made, then the Bank will distribute the remaining benefits to the executive's designated beneficiaries, at the same times and in the same manner as if the executive had not died. If an executive becomes entitled to benefits but dies before payments begin, then the Bank will pay the benefits, in a single lump sum on the first day of the fourth month following death, to the executive's designated beneficiaries.
No benefits will be paid if an executive's employment is terminated by the Bank for cause or if he is subject to a final removal or prohibition order issued by an appropriate federal banking agency pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Additionally, no benefit will be paid to the extent it constitutes an excess golden parachute payment under Section 280G of the IRC or is determined to be a prohibited golden parachute payment pursuant to 12 C.F.R. § 359.2.
The timing of the distribution of some or all of the foregoing benefits may be subject to a six-month waiting period under Section 409A of the IRC to the extent the executive is considered to be a "specified employee" of the Company. Section 409A of the IRC places restrictions on the ability of the Bank and/or the executives to change the form or timing of the payment of the benefits, and the SERP Agreements provide that any such change must be consistent with the requirements and limitations of Section 409A of the IRC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an executive becomes subject to tax on the benefits that could be paid under the SERP Agreement, then the Bank may, subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the IRC, make a limited distribution to the executive to cover such taxes. Any such distribution will reduce the benefits that are otherwise payable under the SERP Agreement.
In January 2011, to help fund the foregoing payment obligations, the Bank invested in life insurance policies on the lives of Mr. Bosley and Oswald.
Performance Driven Retirement Plan
On November 17, 2015, the Bank and Mr. Krebs entered into a Performance Driven Retirement Plan Agreement (the "Retirement Agreement") to provide cash benefits to Mr. Krebs following his Separation of Service (as defined in the Retirement Agreement), his Disability (as defined in the Retirement Agreement), his death, or a Change in Control (as defined in the Retirement Agreement). The Retirement Agreement requires the Bank to establish a general ledger "account" for Mr. Krebs' benefit that will be credited from time to time with cash contributions and interest thereon (the "Deferral Account").
On the effective date of the Retirement Agreement, the Bank made an initial contribution of $5,565 to the Deferral Account. Thereafter, on the first day of each month during each Plan Year (as defined in the Retirement Agreement) that Mr. Krebs is employed, the Bank is required to make a contribution equal to 0.833% of Mr. Krebs' Base Salary (as defined in the Retirement Agreement). The Bank will not be required to make monthly contributions during a Plan Year, however, if the Return on Equity (as defined in the Retirement Agreement) for the immediately preceding Plan Year is less than 6.25%. In the event of a Change in Control, the Bank is required to make a contribution to the Deferral Account in an amount determined by multiplying (i) 300% of Mr. Krebs' then-current Base Salary by (ii) the average percentage of Base Salary contributed to the Deferral Account by the Bank during the three Plan Years that immediately preceded the Change in Control. The Bank's board of directors may choose to make additional contributions to the Deferral Account at any time if it determines that such contributions would be in the best interest of the Bank. During each Plan Year prior to the earliest to occur of Mr. Krebs' Disability, death or Separation from Service, interest on the balance of the Deferral Account will be credited at an annual rate equal to 67% of the Return on Equity for the prior Plan Year, provided that in no event will the annual rate of interest be less than 0.0% nor more than 10.0%. Except when Mr. Krebs is receiving the Early Retirement Benefit (defined below), interest on the balance of the Deferral Account will be credited following the commencement of distributions at an annual rate equal to the 20 Year Moody's AA Corporate bond index less 0.25%, based on the Moody's yield on the first business day of the Plan Year.
Subject to waiting periods and other restrictions that may be imposed by applicable law, including Section 409A of the IRC, distributions from the Deferral Account will be made in one of the following manners (each of which is exclusive of the other manners):
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Commencing the month following (i) a Separation from Service that occurs after the date on which Mr. Krebs reaches 65 years of age ("Normal Retirement Age") or (ii) Mr. Krebs' Disability prior to Normal Retirement Age, the Deferral Account will be distributed in 120 equal monthly installments; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Commencing the month following a Separation from Service that occurs prior to Mr. Krebs reaching Normal Retirement Age, the Deferral Account will be distributed in 36 equal monthly installments; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Following a Change in Control that occurs while Mr. Krebs is employed (and whether or not he also experiences a Separation from Service), the Deferral Account will be paid in one lump sum within 30 days after the Change in Control; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● If Mr. Krebs dies while employed, then Mr. Krebs' designated beneficiaries will receive a lump sum payment, within 90 days of his death, in an amount equal to the greater of (i) $272,825 and (ii) the Deferral Account balance.  
[END TABLE]
The Retirement Plan permits the Bank's board of directors to agree to make early "Hardship Distributions" under limited circumstances. As a general rule, distributions may not be accelerated for any reason. Certain restrictions apply to any amendment to the Retirement Agreement that would change the timing or form of payment.
Mr. Krebs will forfeit his right to receive the amount in the Deferral Account if the Bank terminates his employment for Cause (as defined in the Retirement Agreement). In addition, Mr. Krebs will forfeit his right to receive the amount in the Deferral Account if he engages in certain competitive activities described in the Retirement Agreement. Finally, in the event that any distribution would be treated as an "excess golden parachute payment" under Section 280G of the IRC, such distribution will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that characterization, and Mr. Krebs will forfeit the excess portion of that distribution.
At December 31, 2018, the balance of the Deferral Account was $69,223.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
The following paragraphs discuss related party transactions that occurred thus far in 2019 and during 2018 and 2017, as well as related party transactions that are contemplated during the remainder of 2019 (other than compensation paid or awarded to the Company's directors and executive officers that is discussed above). For this purpose, the term "related party transaction" is generally defined as any transaction (or series of related transactions) in which (i) the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a participant, (ii) the amount involved exceeds the lesser of (a) $120,000 or (b) 1.0% of the Company's average total assets at year-end for the last two completed fiscal years, and (iii) any director, director nominee or executive officer of the Company or any person who beneficially owns more than 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock (and the immediate family members and affiliates of the foregoing) has a direct or indirect interest. The term includes most financial transactions and arrangements, such as loans, guarantees and sales of property, and remuneration for services rendered (as an employee, consultant or otherwise) to the Company and its subsidiaries.
Thus far in 2019 and during 2018 and 2017, the Company, through the Bank, had banking transactions in the ordinary course of its business with the Company's directors, executive officers and immediate family members and affiliates of the foregoing. All of these transactions were substantially the same terms, including interest rates, collateral, and repayment terms on loans, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with persons who are not related to the Company and its subsidiaries. When made, the extensions of credit to these persons by the Bank did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.
The Company and the Bank have procedures in place to help ensure that the Company and the Bank comply with all legal requirements applicable to related party transactions. Among other procedures, the Audit Committee and/or the Bank's Loan Committee must review and approve transactions with directors, executive officers and/or their respective related interests and submit such transactions to the full board of directors for approval. This review is intended to ensure compliance with Regulation O, which imposes requirements for extensions of credit to directors and executive officers, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which governs transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, and Section 5-512 of the Financial Institutions Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, which limits, and requires periodic review and approval of, extensions of credit to directors and executive officers.
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF ROWLES & COMPANY, LLP AS COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Proposal 2)
At the 2019 Annual Meeting, stockholders will be asked to ratify the Audit Committee's appointment of Rowles as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Rowles has served as the Company's independent registered accounting firm since the Company's incorporation on August 8, 2016 and as the Bank's independent auditing firm since December 1997. Rowles has advised the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors that neither it nor any of its partners or associates has any direct financial interest in or any connection with the Company or the Bank other than as the independent registered public accounting firm. A representative of Rowles is expected to be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she so desires, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Rowles & Company, LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Audit Committee, overrule any decision made by the Audit Committee, or create or imply any additional fiduciary duty by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee may, however, take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future auditor appointments.
AUDIT FEES AND SERVICES
The following table shows the fees billed to the Company in 2018 and 2017 for the audit and other services provided by Rowles for those years:
[BEGIN TABLE]
     FY 2018       FY 2017    
 Audit Fees    $ 57,237     $ 60,267   
 Audit-Related Fees      -       -   
 Tax Fees      14,007       5,400   
 All Other Fees      550       550   
 Total    $ 71,794     $ 66,217   
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees for 2018 and 2017 include fees associated with the annual audits and fees associated with the reviews of the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.
Tax Fees in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 include charges primarily related to tax return preparation and audit and tax consulting services.
All Other Fees in 2018 and 2017 include the cost of seminars held by Rowles that were attended by several of our officers and directors.
The Audit Committee has reviewed summaries of the services provided by Rowles and the related fees and has determined that the provision of non-audit services was compatible with maintaining the independence of Rowles.
It is the Audit Committee's policy to pre-approve all audit services and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Company by its independent registered public accounting firm, subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(l)(B) of the Exchange Act, which, when needed, are approved by the Audit Committee prior to the completion of the independent registered public accounting firm's audit. All of the 2018 and 2017 services described above were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Company's executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of the Company's common stock, are required to file certain reports regarding their ownership of common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Based solely on a review of copies of such reports furnished to the Company, or written representations that no reports were required, the Company believes that such persons timely filed all reports required to be filed by Section 16(a) during the year ended December 31, 2018 except for Roger D. Cassell, who filed one late Form 5 (relating to one gift of stock).
