Each of the nominees is currently a director of the Company and all nominees were previously elected by stockholders.

The proxies solicited by this proxy statement may not be voted for more than nine nominees.
INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO NOMINEES
The Nominating & Governance Committee monitors the mix of skills, knowledge, perspective, leadership, age, experience and diversity among directors in order to assure that the Board has the ability to perform its oversight function effectively. The Nominating & Governance Committee has determined that the Board will be comprised of individuals who meet the highest possible personal and professional standards. Our director nominees should have broad experience in management, policymaking and/or finance, relevant industry knowledge, business creativity and vision. They should also be committed to enhancing stockholder value and should be able to dedicate sufficient time to effectively carry out their duties.
The Nominating & Governance Committee considers many factors when determining the eligibility of candidates for nomination as director. The Nominating & Governance Committee does not have a formal diversity policy; however, in connection with the annual nomination process, the Nominating & Governance Committee considers the diversity of candidates to ensure that the Board is comprised of individuals with a broad range of experiences and backgrounds who can contribute to the Board's overall effectiveness in carrying out its responsibilities. The Nominating & Governance Committee assesses the effectiveness of its efforts at achieving a diverse Board when it annually evaluates the Board's composition. Table of Contents
The Nominating & Governance Committee considers the following specific characteristics in making its nominations for our Board: independence, wisdom, integrity, understanding and general acceptance of the Company's corporate philosophy, business or professional knowledge and experience that can bear on the Company's and the Board's challenges and deliberations, proven record of accomplishment with excellent organizations, inquiring mind, willingness to speak one's mind, ability to challenge and stimulate management, future orientation, willingness to commit time and energy, diversity and international/global experience.
The following sets forth the name and age of each nominee, identifies whether the nominee is currently a member of the Board, lists all other positions and offices, if any, now held by him or her with the Company, and specifies his or her principal occupation during at least the last five years.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
[END TABLE]
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES
The Board acts as the ultimate decision-making body of the Company, except for those matters reserved to or shared with the Company's stockholders. The Board selects, advises and oversees our management, who are responsible for the day-to-day operations and administration of the Company. The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines which, along with the charters of each of the committees of the Board and the Company's Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which we refer to as the Code of Ethics, provide the framework for the governance of the Company. A complete copy of the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the charters of the Board committees and the Code of Ethics for directors, officers and employees may be found in the "Investor Relations" section of the Company's website under "Corporate Governance" at www.vailresorts.com. Copies of these materials are also available in print, without charge upon written request to: Secretary, Vail Resorts, Inc., 390 Interlocken Crescent, Broomfield, Colorado 80021.
BOARD LEADERSHIP AND LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
Currently, the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company are held by the same person, Mr. Katz. When the Chairman of the Board is a non-independent director, the independent directors elect an independent director to serve in a lead capacity. Mr. Katz serves as Chairman of the Board and Mr. Hernandez serves as our Lead Independent Director, or Lead Director. The Board has adopted a Charter of the Lead Independent Director (attached as Appendix A to the Corporate Governance Guidelines), which is available in the "Investor Relations" section of the Company's website under "Corporate Governance" at www.vailresorts.com. The Lead Director coordinates the activities of the other non-management directors and performs such other duties and responsibilities as the Board may determine. 
The specific duties of the Lead Director include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• presiding over meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of independent directors; 
• having the authority to call meetings of the independent directors; 
• serving as the presiding director for purposes of all rights and duties assigned to the presiding director under the Company's Bylaws, including the right to call special meetings of the Board; 
• serving as principal liaison on Board-wide issues between the independent directors and the Chairman; 
• reviewing information sent to the Board and communicating with management if there needs to be additional materials or analyses provided to directors; 
• approving meeting agendas and meeting schedules for the Board, to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; 
• serving as the point of contact for communications from stockholders or other interested parties directed to the Lead Director or the non-management directors or Board as a group; 
• ensuring that he is available for consultation and direct communication, if requested by major stockholders; and 
• serving on the Executive Committee of the Board. 
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that a single leader serving as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, together with an experienced and engaged Lead Director, is the most appropriate leadership structure for the Board at this time. The Board believes that this approach is best because the Chief Executive Officer is the individual with primary responsibility for implementing the Company's strategy as approved by the Board and directing the work of other executive officers. This structure results in a single leader being directly accountable to the Board and, through the Board, to stockholders, and enables the Chief Executive Officer to act as the key link between the Board and other members of management.
MEETINGS OF THE BOARD
The Board held a total of four meetings during fiscal 2018. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board and the standing committees of the Board on which he or she served. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors are invited and encouraged to attend our annual meeting of stockholders. All of our then-serving directors attended our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders.
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS
The non-management directors' practice is to meet in executive session following the conclusion of each regularly scheduled quarterly Board meeting to discuss such matters as they deem appropriate and, at least once a year, to review the Compensation Committee's annual review of the Chief Executive Officer. These executive sessions are chaired by the Lead Director. Interested parties, including our stockholders, may communicate with the Lead Director and the non-management directors by following the procedures under the heading "Communications with the Board" below.
DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS
The Nominating & Governance Committee considers and recommends candidates for election to the Board. The Nominating & Governance Committee also considers candidates for election to the Board, if any, that are submitted by stockholders. Each member of the Nominating & Governance Committee participates in the review and discussion of director candidates. In addition, members of the Board who are not on the Nominating & Governance Committee may meet with and evaluate the suitability of candidates. In making its selections of candidates to recommend for election, the Nominating & Governance Committee seeks persons who have achieved prominence in their field and who possess significant experience in areas of importance to the Company. The minimum qualifications that the Nominating & Governance Committee believes must be met for a candidate to be nominated include independence, wisdom, integrity, understanding and general acceptance of the Company's corporate philosophy, business or professional knowledge and experience that can bear on the Company's and the Board's challenges and deliberations, proven record of accomplishment with excellent organizations, inquiring mind, willingness to speak one's mind, ability to challenge and stimulate management, future orientation, willingness to commit time and energy, diversity and international/global experience.
Stockholders who wish to submit candidates for consideration by the Nominating & Governance Committee for election at an annual or special meeting of stockholders should submit the candidate's name and qualifications, including the candidate's consent to serve as a director of the Company if nominated by the Committee and so elected, by mail to: Secretary, Vail Resorts, Inc., 390 Interlocken Crescent, Broomfield, Colorado 80021. The Nominating & Governance Committee applies the same standards in considering candidates submitted by stockholders as it does in evaluating candidates submitted by members of the Board. The Nominating & Governance Committee recommended the nominees for election at this year's annual meeting, all of whom are currently serving as directors. Table of Contents
DETERMINATIONS REGARDING INDEPENDENCE
Under the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, a majority of the Board must be comprised of directors who are independent, as determined based on the independence standards of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the NYSE's listing standards, the Board has adopted categorical standards of director independence to assist it in making determinations of independence of Board members. These categorical standards of director independence are available in the "Investor Relations" section of the Company's website under "Corporate Governance" at www.vailresorts.com. The Board has affirmatively determined that each of the nominees, other than Mr. Katz, is "independent" under the NYSE's listing standards and the categorical standards of director independence adopted by the Board.
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD
The Board has adopted a formal process by which interested parties, including our stockholders, may communicate with the Board, the Lead Director or the non-management directors as a group. This information is available in the "Investor Relations" section of the Company's website under "Corporate Governance" at www.vailresorts.com.  Information on our website does not constitute part of this document.
CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT
The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to all directors, officers and employees, including its chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer and controller, or persons performing similar functions. We make the Code of Ethics available to all directors, officers and employees and convey our expectation that every director, officer and employee read and understand the Code of Ethics and its application to the performance of each such person's business responsibilities. To assist in identifying such proposed transactions as they may arise, our Code of Ethics uses a principles-based guideline to alert directors, officers and employees to potential conflicts of interest. Under the Code of Ethics, a conflict of interest occurs when an individual's personal, social, financial or political interests conflict with his or her loyalty to the Company. Our policy under the Code of Ethics provides that even the appearance of a conflict of interest where none actually exists can be damaging and should be avoided. If any person believes a conflict of interest is present in a personal activity, financial transaction or business dealing involving the Company, then that person is instructed under the Code of Ethics to report such belief to an appropriate individual or department as identified in the Code of Ethics.
The Code of Ethics is available in the "Investor Relations" section of the Company's website under "Corporate Governance" at www.vailresorts.com, or in print, without charge, to any stockholder who sends a request to: Secretary, Vail Resorts, Inc., 390 Interlocken Crescent, Broomfield, Colorado 80021. In the event the Company amends or waives any of the provisions of the Code of Ethics applicable to our chief executive officer, chief financial officer or chief accounting officer and controller that relates to any element of the definition of "code of ethics" enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"), the Company intends to disclose these actions on its website.  Information on our website does not constitute part of this document.
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board believes that oversight of the Company's overall risk management program is the responsibility of the entire Board. We view risk management as an important part of the Company's overall strategic planning process. The Board has delegated the regular oversight of the elements of the risk management program to the Audit Committee, and the Board receives periodic updates on individual areas of risk from the Audit Committee or members of senior management, as appropriate, including a quarterly cybersecurity risk update from the Company's Chief Information Officer. The Board also periodically schedules a risk management agenda item for regular Board meetings, during which the Audit Committee or members of senior management reports to and informs the Board of its risk management oversight activities. Senior management reports directly to the Audit Committee at each scheduled Audit Committee meeting and additionally as needed on the status of the Company's risk management program. The Audit Committee has established an internal audit function to provide management and the Board with ongoing assessments of the Company's risk management processes and systems of internal control. In addition, as part of its responsibilities, the Audit Committee inquires of management and our independent auditors about the Company's processes for identifying and assessing such risks and exposures and the steps management has taken to minimize such risks and exposures to the Company. The Audit Committee also reviews the Company's guidelines and policies that govern the processes for identifying and assessing significant risks or exposures and for formulating and implementing steps to minimize such risks and exposures to the Company.
COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT
The Compensation Committee, with the assistance of our independent compensation consultant, reviewed the material compensation policies and practices for all employees, including executive officers. The Compensation Committee considered whether the compensation program encouraged excessive risk taking by employees at the expense of long-term Company value. Based upon its assessment, the Compensation Committee believes that the Company's compensation program, which includes a mix of annual and long-term incentives, cash and equity awards and retention incentives, does not present risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD
The Board has a standing Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Executive Committee and Nominating & Governance Committee. The charters for each of these committees, which have been approved by the Board, are available in the "Investor Relations" section of the Company's website under "Corporate Governance" at www.vailresorts.com, or in print, without charge, to any stockholder who sends a request to: Secretary, Vail Resorts, Inc., 390 Interlocken Crescent, Broomfield, Colorado 80021. Below is a description of each committee of the Board. Each of the committees has authority to engage legal counsel or other experts or consultants, as it deems appropriate to carry out its responsibilities.  Information on our website does not constitute part of this document.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is primarily concerned with the effectiveness of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, accounting policies and practices, financial reporting and internal controls. The Audit Committee acts pursuant  Table of Contents to its charter, and is authorized and directed, among other things, to: (1) appoint, retain, compensate, evaluate and terminate, as appropriate, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm; (2) approve all audit engagement fees and terms, as well as all permissible non-audit service engagements with the independent registered public accounting firm; (3) discuss with management and the independent registered public accounting firm and meet to review the Company's annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements, including reviewing the Company's disclosures under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (4) review reports by the independent registered public accounting firm describing its internal quality control procedures and all relationships between the Company, or individuals in financial reporting oversight roles at the Company, and the independent registered public accounting firm; (5) establish procedures, as required under applicable law, for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and the confidential and anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters; (6) monitor the rotation of partners of the independent auditors on the Company's audit engagement team as required by law; (7) review and approve or reject transactions between the Company and any related persons in accordance with the Company's Related Party Transactions Policy; (8) confer with management and the independent auditors regarding the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; (9) oversee management's efforts to monitor compliance with the Company's programs and policies designed to ensure adherence to applicable laws and regulations and the Company's Code of Ethics; (10) annually prepare a report as required by the SEC to be included in the Company's annual proxy statement; and (11) discuss policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management.
The members of the Audit Committee are Mr. Sewell, Chairman, and Messrs. Hernandez, Redmond and Sorte. The Board has determined that Messrs. Sewell, Hernandez, Redmond and Sorte are each an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in the SEC's rules and regulations adopted pursuant to the Exchange Act, and that all of the members of the Audit Committee are "independent" as defined by the NYSE's listing standards and the rules of the SEC applicable to audit committee members. The Audit Committee held five meetings during fiscal 2018. Table of Contents
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Management is responsible for the Company's accounting practices, internal control over financial reporting, the financial reporting process and preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes.
In this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, including a discussion of the quality of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements and management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee further discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed under the rules adopted by the PCAOB, as well as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm's opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
The Company's independent registered public accounting firm also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountants' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and were satisfied with, that firm's independence from the Company and its management. The Audit Committee has also considered whether the Company's independent registered public accounting firm's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with the auditors' independence.
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's internal auditor and independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee meets with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examination, their evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. In addition, the Audit Committee meets with the internal auditor, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examination and evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has also reviewed and discussed Company policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management.
Based upon the Audit Committee's discussion with management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Company's audited financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

         The Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee acts pursuant to its charter and is authorized and directed, among other things, to: (1) review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to the Chief Executive Officer's compensation, evaluate the Chief Executive Officer's performance in light of those goals and objectives (including the Chief Executive Officer's performance in fostering a culture of ethics and integrity), and, either as a committee or together with the other independent directors (as directed by the Board), determine and approve the Chief Executive Officer's compensation level based on this evaluation; (2) review the performance of, make recommendations (where appropriate) with respect to, and approve the total compensation for the executive officers of the Company other than the CEO, including any amendments to such executive's employment agreement, any proposed severance arrangements or change in control and similar agreements/provisions, and any amendments, supplements or waivers to the foregoing agreements; (3) oversee the Company's overall compensation structure, policies and programs for executive officers and employees, including assessing the incentives and risks arising from or related to the Company's compensation programs and plans, and assessing whether the incentives and risks are appropriate; (4) review and approve the Company's incentive compensation and equity-based plans and approve changes to such plans, in each case subject, where appropriate, to stockholder or Board approval, and review and approve issuances of equity securities to employees of the Company; (5) review and recommend to the Board annual retainer and meeting fees for non-employee members of the Board and committees of the Board, fix the terms and awards of stock compensation for such members of the Board and determine the terms, if any, upon which such fees may be deferred; (6) produce a compensation committee report on executive officer compensation as required by the SEC, after the committee reviews and discusses with management the Company's Compensation Discussion and Analysis, or "CD&A," and consider whether to recommend that it be included in the Company's proxy statement or Annual Report; and (7) consider and recommend to the Board the frequency of the Company's advisory vote on executive compensation.
The members of the Compensation Committee are Mr. Sorte, Chairman, Mmes. Decker, Romanow and Schneider and Mr. Vaughn. The Board has determined that all members of the Compensation Committee are "independent" as defined by the NYSE's listing standards. In addition, the Compensation Committee consists of "non-employee directors," within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and "outside directors," within the meaning of regulations promulgated under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. The Compensation Committee held two meetings during fiscal 2018.
         Compensation Committee Processes and Procedures
The Compensation Committee meets as often as necessary to carry out its responsibilities. The agenda for each meeting is usually developed by the Chairman of the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer does not participate in and is not present during any deliberations or determinations of the Compensation Committee regarding his compensation or individual performance objectives. The charter of the Compensation Committee grants the Compensation Committee sole authority, at the expense of the Company, to retain or to obtain advice from a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser to assist in the execution of the Compensation Committee's responsibilities. The Compensation Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any consultant or adviser retained and has authority to approve the fees and other retention terms. The Compensation Committee expects that it will seek advice from independent compensation consultants as it deems necessary on a periodic basis, but not necessarily annually, in order to determine that the Company's compensation programs remain appropriate and consistent with industry practices. Prior to the retention of any compensation consultant, legal counsel or any other external adviser, the Compensation Committee will assess the independence of such adviser from management, taking into consideration all factors relevant to such adviser's independence, including factors specified in the NYSE listing standards.
During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Hewitt Associates LLC, which we refer to as AON Hewitt, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AON plc, as its independent compensation consultant. AON Hewitt was retained by the Compensation Committee to review the Company's executive compensation programs, including an analysis relating to the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and the Company's performance and a risk assessment of our compensation programs.  
In fiscal 2018, AON Hewitt was paid $82,637 for these executive compensation consulting services provided to the Compensation Committee. As noted above, AON Hewitt is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of AON plc. AON plc is a multinational, multi-services insurance and consulting firm. During fiscal 2018, AON Hewitt and its affiliates provided general health and benefits consulting, actuarial consulting services and other human resource related services to the Company. The decision to engage AON Hewitt and its affiliates for these additional services was made by management as part of the Company's existing relationship with AON Hewitt concerning these services, and was not approved, or required to be approved, by the Compensation Committee or the Board. Fees for the foregoing additional services in fiscal 2018 were $136,682. The individuals at AON Hewitt that advise the Compensation Committee on executive compensation matters have no involvement in the other services provided to the Company by AON Hewitt and its affiliates, and the individuals at AON Hewitt advising the Compensation Committee report directly to, and are overseen by, the Compensation Committee. These individuals have no other relationship with the Company or management. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of AON Hewitt as required by the NYSE listing standards. The Compensation Committee reviewed its relationship with AON Hewitt and considered all relevant factors, and concluded that there are no conflicts of interest raised by the work performed by AON Hewitt and its affiliates.
Under its charter, the Compensation Committee may form, and delegate authority to, subcommittees, as appropriate, and the Chief Executive Officer has been granted authority to grant certain equity based awards for hiring incentive grants, correction grants or to promoted non-executive employees. The purpose of this delegation of authority is to enhance the flexibility of equity administration within the Company and to facilitate the timely grant of equity awards to new or recently promoted non-executive employees within specified limits approved by the Compensation Committee. The Chief Executive Officer's authority to make new hire incentive grants is limited by the restrictions established by the Compensation Committee.
Historically, the Compensation Committee has made adjustments to annual compensation, determined annual cash and equity awards, and established new performance objectives at one or more meetings held during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, the Compensation Committee also considers matters related to individual compensation, such as compensation for new executive hires, at various times as needed throughout the year. Generally, the Compensation Committee's process comprises two related elements: the determination of compensation levels and the establishment of performance objectives for the fiscal year.  Table of Contents
For executives other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee solicits and considers evaluations and recommendations submitted to the committee by the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee makes all final determinations regarding these awards, and none of our executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, are involved in the determination of their own compensation. In the case of the Chief Executive Officer, the evaluation of his performance is conducted by the Compensation Committee, which determines any adjustments to his compensation as well as awards to be granted. The non-management directors' practice is to meet in executive session following the Board meeting in September of each year to review and ratify the Compensation Committee's annual review of the Chief Executive Officer. For all executives and directors, as part of its deliberations, the Compensation Committee may review and consider, as appropriate, materials such as financial reports and projections, operational data, tax and accounting information, tally sheets that set forth the total compensation that may become payable to executives in various hypothetical scenarios, executive and director stock ownership information, company stock performance data, analyses of historical executive compensation levels and current Company-wide compensation levels, and recommendations of the Compensation Committee's compensation consultant, including analyses of executive and director compensation paid at other companies identified by the consultant.
The specific determinations of the Compensation Committee with respect to executive compensation for fiscal 2018 are described in greater detail in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis section of this proxy statement, as well as the narrative disclosure that accompanies the Summary Compensation Table and related tables in the Executive Compensation section of this proxy statement.
         Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
During fiscal 2018, no Compensation Committee interlocks existed between the Company and any other entity, meaning none of our executive officers currently serves, or has served during the last completed fiscal year, on the compensation committee or board of directors of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board or Compensation Committee. No member of our Compensation Committee has ever been an executive officer or employee of the Company.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this proxy statement. Based upon this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated into our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018.

DIRECTOR CASH COMPENSATION
All of our non-employee directors receive annual cash fees, payable in quarterly installments. The annual cash retainer for each Board member was $60,000 and no additional per meeting fees are paid. Effective October 1, 2018, the annual cash retainer for each Board member was increased to $75,000.  In addition, the Lead Director of the Board receives an additional $40,000 per year and the Chairman of the Audit Committee receives an additional $25,000 per year.  Each other Audit Committee member receives an additional $15,000 per year, the Chairman of the Compensation Committee receives an additional $20,000 per year, the Chairman of the Nominating & Governance Committee receives an additional $15,000 per year, and each other Compensation Committee member and Nominating & Governance Committee member receives an additional $10,000 each per year.  Members of the Executive Committee receive an additional $10,000 per year. A non-executive Chairman of the Board would receive an additional annual retainer of $50,000, but our Chief Executive Officer is currently our Chairman of the Board and he is not entitled to this retainer.
All directors received reimbursement of their reasonable travel expenses in connection with their service.
DIRECTOR EQUITY COMPENSATION
The Company provides its non-employee directors with equity compensation as determined each year by the Compensation Committee, which for fiscal 2018, was $200,781, consisting of 900 RSUs granted on September 27, 2017 that vested one year from the date of grant. The aggregate grant date fair value of these RSUs is set forth under the "Stock Awards" column of the Director Compensation Table and described in footnote 3 above. Table of Contents
LIMITED DIRECTOR PERQUISITES AND PERSONAL BENEFITS
Non-employee directors receive benefits consisting of lodging, ski school privileges and discretionary spending on services or goods at our resorts for personal use in accordance with the terms of the Company's Perquisite Fund Program. Each director is entitled to an annual $40,000 allowance to be used at the Company's resorts in accordance with such program, under which directors may draw against the account to pay for services or goods at the market rate. Unused funds in each director's account at the end of each fiscal year are forfeited. In accordance with SEC rules, the value of these benefits is measured on the basis of the estimated aggregate incremental cost to the Company. For this purpose, perquisites do not include benefits generally available on a non-discriminatory basis to all of our employees, such as skiing privileges.
In addition, each year we allow each director to designate one charity as the recipient of a vacation package with a retail value of no more than $4,000 and to include only the same array of services that are eligible under the Perquisite Fund Program. We also require that the package be given as part of a public event, dinner or auction and that the Company receive appropriate credit and marketing presence.
STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS
Each non-employee director must own the greater of five times his or her annual cash retainer for Board service or $300,000 in value within five years of the date such director is elected or appointed to the Board. Directors are not permitted to sell any shares of common stock (except to pay the exercise price of a particular equity grant, if any, or taxes generated as a result of equity grants) until such time as the ownership guidelines have been satisfied and then only to the extent that such sales do not reduce such director's ownership below the threshold requirement. Shares of common stock, stock owned in a directed retirement plan or IRA and the intrinsic value of vested equity grants count as stock ownership for purposes of these guidelines.  All of our non-employee directors are in compliance with this policy.
[BEGIN TABLE]
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
[END TABLE]
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock, to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership with the SEC. Our directors, executive officers and greater-than-10% stockholders are required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they file. We file Section 16(a) reports on behalf of our directors and executive officers to report their initial and subsequent changes in beneficial ownership of our common stock. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the reports we filed on behalf of our directors and executive officers, written representations from these persons that no other reports were required and all Section 16(a) reports provided to us, we believe that during fiscal 2018 our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 10% of our common stock filed the required reports on a timely basis under Section 16(a), except Messrs. Vaughn, Shapiro and Siurek did not timely report acquisitions of a total of 146, 27 and 2 shares of common stock, respectively, during fiscal 2018 that were acquired pursuant to dividend reinvestment plans.  Since learning of the above-referenced share acquisitions, we have confirmed that the dividend reinvestment option has been disabled from accounts containing shares of the Company's common stock for all of our executive officers, and we have also requested that all members of our Board of Directors do the same for their accounts that contain shares of the Company's common stock.
[BEGIN TABLE]
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS 
[END TABLE]
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS POLICY AND PROCEDURES
We have adopted a written Related Party Transactions Policy that sets forth the Company's policies and procedures regarding the identification, review, consideration and approval or ratification of "related party transactions." For purposes of our policy only, a "related party transaction" is a transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee (or any series of similar transactions or arrangements) in which the Company and any "related person" are participants involving an amount that exceeds $120,000. Transactions involving compensation for services provided to the Company solely in their capacity as an officer or director by a related person are not covered by this policy. A related person is any executive officer, director, or more than 5% stockholder of the Company, or any immediate family member of an executive officer or director, including any entity in which such persons are an officer or 10% or greater equity holder.
Under the policy, where a transaction has been identified as a related party transaction, management must present information regarding the proposed related party transaction to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, the full Audit Committee or the Board for consideration and approval or ratification, depending upon the size of the transaction involved. In considering related party transactions, the Audit Committee takes into account the fairness of the proposed transaction to the Company and whether the  Table of Contents terms of such transaction are at least as favorable to the Company as it would receive or be likely to receive from an unrelated third party in a comparable or substantially comparable transaction.
To ensure that our existing procedures are successful in identifying related party transactions, the Company distributed questionnaires to its directors and executive officers shortly following the end of the fiscal year which included, among other things, inquiries about any transactions they have entered into with us.
During fiscal 2018 and through the date of this proxy statement, there was one related party transaction under the relevant standards described above.  Jennifer O'Donnell, the sister of James O'Donnell, our Executive Vice President - Hospitality, Retail and Real Estate, was an employee of the Company in the Human Resources department during fiscal 2018. Ms. O'Donnell's total compensation in fiscal 2018 was in excess of $120,000.  In September 2018, the Audit Committee reviewed this transaction in accordance with the related party policy described above, and determined that no conflict of interest arose from such transaction. In setting Ms. O'Donnell's compensation, we followed the same policies and practices that we have historically used to set compensation for other similarly-situated employees.  Table of Contents

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis, or CD&A, describes our executive compensation program, the various components of our program and the compensation-related decisions made for fiscal 2018 with respect to our named executive officers ("NEOs"). For purposes of this CD&A and the compensation tables and narratives that follow, the NEOs for fiscal 2018 were:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Robert A. Katz, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
• Michael Z. Barkin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 
• Patricia A. Campbell, President - Mountain Division 
• Kirsten A. Lynch, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer 
• David T. Shapiro, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary 
[END TABLE]
       Executive Summary
       Our executive compensation program, which is grounded in the principle of pay-for-performance, is intended to reward our executive officers for sustained, high-level performance over the short- and long-term as demonstrated by measurable, company-wide performance metrics and individual contributions that are consistent with our overall growth strategy and achievement of goals. We compensate our executive officers with a combination of cash compensation (in the form of base salary and cash incentive compensation) and equity awards, as well as a modest amount of benefits and perquisites. Our compensation program has been structured to enhance our ability to achieve our short-term and long-term strategic goals and to retain and motivate our executive officers and senior management to achieve such goals.
        Our Executive Compensation Program Emphasizes Pay-for-Performance
      The primary objective of our executive compensation program is to emphasize pay-for-performance by incentivizing our executive officers to drive superior results and generate stockholder value. We accomplish this objective in the following ways:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Incentive Awards.    Our Management Incentive Plan ("MIP"), which applies to the award of annual cash incentive compensation, referred to in this CD&A as a "MIP award," is intended to focus our executive officers on the key corporate financial metrics that we believe drive our best results. As explained in more detail below, because Resort EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as reported for our Mountain and Lodging segments) is the performance metric associated with the MIP for our NEOs, their annual cash incentive fluctuates with our performance and the achievement of our annual goals as established by the Compensation Committee. 
• Long-Term Equity Awards.    A significant portion of our NEOs' total annual compensation opportunity is in the form of long-term equity incentive compensation, including share appreciation rights ("SARs") and restricted share units ("RSUs"), which generally vest ratably over three years or, in certain circumstances, have cliff vesting at the third anniversary. 
• High Percentage of Compensation is Variable or "At-Risk."    A significant percentage of our NEOs' compensation is tied to incentives or appreciation in our stock price, and as executive officers attain greater levels of responsibility, the percentage of their total target compensation that is variable or "at-risk" increases, and the percentage that is fixed decreases. Accordingly, the NEO whose compensation is most heavily comprised of at-risk elements is our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). Our commitment to emphasizing performance-based compensation is illustrated by the following charts, which show the mix of our program's three primary direct compensation components (fixed compensation, consisting of base salary; variable or at-risk compensation, consisting of target annual incentive compensation; and actual long-term equity incentive awards granted in the fiscal year) for our CEO and, on average, for our other NEOs for fiscal 2018: 
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance-Based Stock Awards for CEO.  In furtherance of our pay-for-performance philosophy and to further align the interests of our CEO with the interests of our stockholders, the Compensation Committee has determined that approximately 50% of the award value subject to long-term equity incentive awards granted to our CEO each fiscal year (not including RSUs granted in payment of his annual MIP award, which are already tied to the performance metrics set forth under the MIP) will be "performance-based" stock awards. These performance-based stock awards may include (i) awards that do not vest or become exercisable unless specific business performance goals established by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant of the award are satisfied, (ii) SARs subject to time-based vesting criteria, but with an exercise price at least 25% greater than the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant ("Premium SARs"), and/or (iii) SARs with an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant ("Market SARs"). For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Katz long-term equity incentive awards with approximately 50% of the award value in time-based vesting RSUs and approximately 50% of the award value in Premium SARs only. 
[END TABLE]
       Our Executive Compensation Program is Supported by Our Stockholders
       At our annual meeting of stockholders held on December 6, 2017, approximately 97.95% of the votes cast on the proposal were voted in support of the advisory resolution to approve the compensation of our NEOs. After considering the results of this vote, the Compensation Committee concluded that there is strong stockholder support of our executive compensation program and its emphasis on pay-for-performance. As a result, the Compensation Committee determined to maintain the current executive compensation program. Also at this annual meeting, our stockholders expressed a preference that advisory votes on executive compensation occur every year, as recommended by our Board of Directors. Consistent with this preference, our Board of Directors has implemented an advisory vote on executive compensation every year.
       Fiscal 2019 Committee Actions
For fiscal 2018, our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Katz, voluntarily offered to reduce his compensation from what was recommended by the Compensation Committee.  Mr. Katz offered to reduce the value of his long-term incentive award (RSUs and SARs) granted in September 2017, from approximately $4 million (the total grant date value of his RSU and SAR grant for fiscal 2017, excluding the RSUs award as part of his bonus) to approximately $2 million.  For fiscal 2019, Mr. Katz again made this suggestion to the Compensation Committee to maintain these reduced levels of equity grant values in order to ensure that the Company could prioritize other compensation initiatives for fiscal 2019 and in recognition of his own ownership in the Company's stock, built over the prior 12 years.  The Compensation Committee accepted this offer for each of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, despite the Company's strong financial and stock performance and the Committee's high degree of satisfaction with Mr. Katz's performance.

        Effective Corporate Governance Reinforces Our Executive Compensation Program
        The following features of our executive compensation program are evidence of our commitment to good corporate governance practices:
[BEGIN TABLE]
WHAT WE DO:   WHAT WE DON'T DO: 
Annual Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation.  We provide our stockholders with an annual opportunity to vote on an advisory basis to approve the compensation paid to our NEOs as disclosed in the proxy statement.   Independent Compensation Committee.  Our executive compensation program is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee, which consists solely of independent directors and makes all final determinations regarding the compensation of our NEOs.   Significant Portion of Executive Compensation Tied to Performance.  A significant portion of our NEOs' compensation is comprised of elements of performance-based, incentive compensation that are tied to defined corporate and individual performance goals or stock price performance. In the last three fiscal years, approximately 81.9% of our CEO's total compensation and approximately 71.3% of our other NEOs' total compensation, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, has on average been in the form of short and long-term incentive-based compensation (MIP award and equity awards). In addition, approximately 50% of the long-term equity incentives granted to our CEO each fiscal year consist of "performance-based" awards.   Significant Portion of Executive Compensation Delivered in the Form of Long-Term Equity-Based Incentives.  A significant portion of our NEOs' compensation is comprised of long-term equity incentive awards, consisting of SARs and RSUs, which generally vest over three years. In the last three fiscal years, approximately 73.4% of our CEO's total compensation and approximately 57.3% of our other NEOs' total compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, has on average been in the form of long-term equity-based incentives. Mr. Katz receives 50% of his annual MIP award in cash and the other 50% in RSUs that vest annually over a three-year period (included in the percentage above), meaning one-half of the MIP award earned on the basis of the Company's achievement of annual performance goals is subject to further time-based vesting and changes in the value of our common stock over that period.   Market Alignment of Compensation but with Greater Emphasis on At-Risk Compensation.  To attract and retain talented executive officers, we seek to align target pay at levels comparable with companies in our peer group. However, as compared with companies in our peer group, we generally make at-risk compensation a more significant component of our NEOs' compensation in order to emphasize pay-for-performance, and we generally make SARs a much larger portion of their at-risk compensation than RSUs.  Independent Compensation Consultant.  The Compensation Committee periodically retains and receives advice from an independent compensation consultant.       No Excessive Perquisites.  We provide our executive officers with limited perquisites, which are generally limited to credit at our owned and operated properties and which are designed to incentivize our executive officers to visit and use our resorts in order to make informed  decisions regarding our business and provide relevant feedback concerning our properties and services.  No Tax Gross-Ups on Perquisites, Except for Standard Relocation Benefits.  We do not pay tax gross-ups on the limited perquisites that our executive officers receive, except in the case of standard relocation benefits available to all similarly situated employees.  No Excise Tax Gross-Ups.  We are not required to pay excise tax gross-ups in connection with the change in control arrangements provided to our executive officers.  No Automatic Salary Increases or Guaranteed Bonuses.  We do not guarantee annual salary increases or bonuses for any NEO and no employment agreement with any NEO contains such provisions.  No "Single Trigger" Automatic Cash Payments or Benefits Upon a Change in Control.  The change in control arrangements provided to our executive officers require a termination event (including a termination by the executive for "good reason") following a change in control before any cash-based payments or benefits are triggered. Additionally, our CEO's potential cash severance is conservatively set at two times his base salary and bonus.  No Hedging or Pledging.  Under our Insider Trading Compliance Program, our executive officers are prohibited from conducting short sales or using derivatives or other instruments designed to hedge against the risk of ownership of our securities, including put and call options and collar transactions. The Insider Trading Compliance Program also prohibits directors and executive officers from pledging shares of the Company's stock.  No Equity Repricing.  We expressly prohibit the repricing of underwater SARs without stockholder approval.   No Pension Plans or SERPs.  We do not provide our executive officers with tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans or supplemental executive retirement plans.

WHAT WE DO:     
 Clawback Policy.  The Compensation Committee has adopted a clawback policy that, in the event of a financial restatement, allows us to recoup cash- or equity-based incentive compensation from executive officers that was paid based on the misstated financial information.  Stock Ownership Guidelines.  Our executive officers are subject to stock ownership guidelines, requiring that they hold a meaningful amount of our common stock, which helps to align their interests with those of our stockholders. Additionally, until the applicable guideline is achieved for an executive, he or she is required to retain at least 75% of the net shares received from vesting of RSUs or exercise of SARs.  All of our executive officers are in compliance with this policy.  Use of Tally Sheets.  The Compensation Committee uses tally sheets that provide information as to all compensation that is potentially available to our NEOs when evaluating executive compensation.  Annual Risk Assessment.  The Compensation Committee, with the assistance of our independent compensation consultant, annually conducts a compensation risk assessment and, for fiscal 2018, determined that the Company's compensation policies and practices, or components thereof, do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

       Our executive compensation program focuses on the following three key objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Emphasizing Pay-for-Performance.  Emphasize pay-for-performance by tying annual and long-term compensation incentives to achievement of specified performance objectives or overall stock performance. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attracting, Retaining and Motivating.  Attract, retain and motivate talented executives who will determine our long-term success. We have structured our executive compensation program to be competitive with compensation paid by companies in the same market for executive talent. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Rewarding Contributions and Creating Long-Term Value.  We have structured our compensation program to recognize and reward contributions of all employees, including executive officers, in achieving strategic goals and business objectives, while aligning the program with stockholder interests.

Compensation-Setting Process
Participants in Setting Executive Compensation
The Compensation Committee is responsible for determining the compensation of our executive officers, including our NEOs. In appropriate circumstances, such as when new market data supports a market adjustment, the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, considers the recommendations of our CEO in setting executive compensation, including the compensation of the other NEOs. The Compensation Committee, however, makes all final determinations regarding these awards (subject to any matters requiring approval by the Board of Directors and/or our stockholders), and no executive officer is involved in the deliberations or the determination with respect to his or her own compensation. The non-management directors' practice is to meet in executive session following the Board meeting in September of each year to review and ratify the Compensation Committee's annual review of the CEO.
         Comparative Framework
       To achieve our executive compensation objectives, the Compensation Committee periodically analyzes market data and evaluates individual executive performance with a goal of setting compensation at levels the Compensation Committee believes, based on their general business and industry knowledge and experience, are comparable with executives in other companies operating in the leisure, travel, gaming and hospitality industries, which we refer to as our "peer group." We face a somewhat unique challenge in establishing a peer group because few publicly-traded companies participate in more than one of our operating segments. Thus, when evaluating executive compensation, the Compensation Committee includes in our peer group a variety of leisure, travel, gaming and hospitality companies with whom we may compete for executive talent and the discretionary travel dollars of our guests.
When performing its annual executive compensation review, the Compensation Committee has sole authority to engage an independent compensation consultant to assist in obtaining market data and analyzing the competitive nature of our compensation programs. In fiscal 2017, the Compensation Committee engaged Aon Hewitt to conduct a competitive market study of the Company's executive compensation program and to advise on compensation decisions.  The market study analyzed our executive compensation relative to Aon Hewitt's proprietary survey data, which consisted of companies with comparable revenues, as well as to publicly-traded peer group companies recommended by Aon Hewitt. Our Compensation Committee then confirmed a peer group based upon this data. The peer group used by the Compensation Committee for fiscal 2018 compensation decisions did not change from the peer group determined in fiscal 2017 and consisted of the following companies:

The Compensation Committee intends to continue to seek advice from independent compensation consultants as it deems necessary to help ensure that our compensation programs remain appropriate and consistent with industry practices. Although the Compensation Committee believes that it is important to periodically review the compensation policies of its peer group and the survey data, the Compensation Committee also believes that our executive compensation program must further our business objectives and be consistent with our culture. Therefore, while the Compensation Committee reviews the peer group and survey data, including the total and type of compensation paid to executive officers at peer group companies to further validate that the compensation paid to our executive officers remains competitive, the Compensation Committee may not necessarily make any particular adjustments to the compensation paid to the executive officers based on the peer group or survey data.
         Company-Specific Factors
In addition to considering market data with respect to executive compensation practices of companies within our peer group, the Compensation Committee takes into account individual performance, our retention needs, our relative performance and our own strategic goals. We also conduct an annual review of the aggregate level of our executive compensation program as part of our annual budget review and annual performance review processes, which include determining the operating metrics and non-financial elements used to measure our performance and to compensate our executive officers.
The Compensation Committee, in conjunction with data and recommendations provided by our independent compensation consultant in any given year, also annually analyzes tally sheets prepared for each NEO. These tally sheets present the dollar amount of each component of the NEO's compensation, including current cash compensation (base salary and the MIP award for the applicable fiscal year), perquisites and the value of equity awards previously granted to the NEO as of the applicable fiscal year end, as well as the amounts that would have been payable to the NEO if employment had been terminated under various scenarios as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year. The Compensation Committee uses these tally sheets, which provide substantially the same information as is provided in the tables included in this proxy statement, together with peer group data, primarily for purposes of analyzing our NEOs' total compensation and determining whether it is appropriate to adjust the compensation mix for our NEOs on a going-forward basis. In its most recent review of tally sheets, the Compensation Committee determined that total compensation amounts for our NEOs remained consistent with our executive compensation philosophy and objectives.

Elements of Compensation 
Overview 
 Our executive compensation program consists of the following elements:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Compensation Element   Objective   Key Features 
Base Salary   To attract and retain executives with a proven track record of performance• Established based primarily on the scope of an executive officer's responsibilities, taking into account individual performance and experience, competitive market compensation for similar positions, as well as seniority of the individual, our ability to replace the individual, the impact the individual's loss would have on the Company, and other factors which may be deemed to be relevant by the Compensation Committee.• Reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee and, based on such review, may be adjusted to align salaries with market levels after taking into account various factors, including those listed in the bullet above.• No guaranteed increases to base salary.

Annual MIP Award   To incentivize achievement of annual financial, operational and strategic goals and achievement of individual annual performance objectives• For each fiscal year, Company and individual performance elements drive two different aspects of the MIP: (1) the aggregate amount of funds available under the MIP (driven by Company performance), and (2) the specific allocation of awards to participants under the MIP (driven by Company performance for Mr. Katz and individual performance for the other NEOs).• Our CEO receives his annual MIP award 50% in cash and 50% in RSUs that vest annually over a three-year period (as further discussed under Equity Incentive Awards below).  Our other executive officers receive annual MIP awards in cash only.

Deferred Compensation   To attract and retain executive officers with a proven track record of performance and to provide a tax-efficient means for such officers to save for retirement• Executive officers can elect to defer up to 80% of their base salary and 100% of their annual MIP award.• Executive officers can invest these amounts in pre-tax dollars in designated hypothetical investments for their accounts, and their accounts are credited with gains or losses in accordance with their selections.
Limited Perquisites   To incentivize executives to use the Company's services in order to help them in their performance by allowing them to evaluate our resorts and services based upon firsthand knowledge• Includes benefits relating to the use of one or more of our owned and operated private clubs, including skiing and parking privileges, as a part of their responsibilities and employment.• Also includes our Perquisite Fund Program, under which certain of our senior management, receive an annual allowance, based on executive level, to be used at the Company's owned or operated resorts.

       Base Salary
        The Compensation Committee generally reviews and adjusts base salaries annually at its September committee meeting, with new salaries effective in mid-October. The following table sets forth the annual base salaries approved by the Compensation Committee for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and shows the percentage change from the prior year. In recognition of individual  Table of Contents performance and overall growth and results of the Company in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018 base salary increases were approved for all NEOs.  Specifically for Mr. Barkin and Mmes. Campbell and Lynch, larger increases were given to recognize their strong performance, the Company's increase in both breadth and complexity and the Company's strong performance.

How the MIP Is Funded.    For fiscal 2018, for each NEO, 100% of the funding of the MIP was based upon the achievement of the Resort EBITDA target. Under the MIP, if we achieve 100% of the Resort EBITDA target, the MIP is funded at 100% of the target funding level for that component, as more fully detailed in the table below. If our performance exceeds 100% of the Resort EBITDA target, the MIP is funded above the target funding level for that component up to a maximum of 200% of the target funding level. If our performance falls below 100% of the annual Resort EBITDA target, the MIP is funded below the target funding level for that component. If our performance falls below 80% of the annual Resort EBITDA target, the MIP is not funded for that component.  The following table describes this metric:
MIP Funding for Resort EBITDA

[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
In the event our Resort EBITDA for any fiscal year meets the specific threshold or target level, then the MIP is funded at the appropriate level and each NEO is eligible to receive a MIP award. In addition, once the MIP is funded based upon each NEO's target MIP award percentage, the total pool for NEOs may be increased by up to 5%, with such excess being paid out, if any, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee based upon individual performance.
Target Annual MIP Awards.    The differences between the NEOs' target MIP awards as a percentage of their base salaries was determined based upon the perceived ability each executive position has to influence our performance. Threshold, target and maximum awards payable under the MIP for fiscal 2018 are reported in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. For fiscal 2018, each NEO was eligible for an annual MIP award based on a percentage of annual base salary as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]

Fiscal 2018 Results.    In fiscal 2018, we met 93.98% of the Resort EBITDA target, which resulted in a funding level at 44.90% of the target funding level for that component of the funding calculation. Based upon these results and individual performance, and noting that no adjustments were made based upon individual performance, the Compensation Committee determined the final MIP award amounts as follows:

(1) Actual payout percentages are based upon the MIP funded amount and, for each NEO other than the CEO whose payout percentage equals the 44.90% funding level of the MIP, achievement of his or her individual performance objectives. In fiscal 2018, payout percentages were based upon the 44.90% funding level of the MIP and no adjustments were made based upon individual performance objectives. 
(2) Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Katz's MIP award is paid 50% in cash and 50% in RSUs, which generally vest in equal installments over three years. 
(3) In September 2017, the Compensation Committee approved an increase to the annual target MIP percentage for each of Mr. Barkin and Mmes. Campbell and Lynch from 70% of base salary in fiscal 2017 to 75% of base salary for fiscal 2018.

        Long-Term Equity Incentives
Our long-term equity incentive award program is designed to promote long-term Company performance and align each executive's risk with stockholder interest, to reward the achievement of long-term goals, and to promote stability and corporate loyalty among our executives. The Compensation Committee bases awards of long-term equity compensation on a number of different factors, including competitive market practices as determined by our peer group analysis, the information provided by our independent compensation consultant, the amount of cash compensation that is currently paid to each NEO, each NEO's level of responsibility, our retention objectives and our pay-for-performance philosophy. In general, the Compensation Committee makes long-term equity award determinations for executive officers in September of each year and typically consults with our CEO in determining the size of grants to each NEO, other than himself, although the Compensation Committee makes all final determinations. The non-management directors' practice is to meet in executive session following the Board meeting in September of each year to review and ratify the Compensation Committee's annual review of the CEO. In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee granted long-term equity incentive awards under the 2015 Plan, which was approved by our stockholders at the 2015 annual meeting.  
As noted above, the long-term equity values awarded to our NEOs are based on a number of different factors considered by the Compensation Committee. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded each NEO an equity value based on individual achievements and performance.  As described elsewhere in this CD&A, for fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Katz his long-term equity incentive awards as approximately 50% of the award value in RSUs and approximately 50% of the award value in Premium SARs, however, as discussed above, upon the recommendation of Mr. Katz, the value of his long-term incentive award (RSUs and SARs) granted in September 2017 was reduced by approximately $2 million.
As in previous years, the long-term equity incentive awards granted to our NEOs in fiscal 2018 consisted of RSUs and SARs. In determining the mix of RSUs and SARs granted to each of our NEOs in fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee considered that RSUs have a relatively greater retentive effect, but SARs have a relatively greater performance incentive impact. Accordingly, for fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded grants to the NEOs (other than the CEO) such that 50% of the long-term equity incentive award value granted is attributed to RSUs and 50% of the award value granted is attributed to SARs. For our CEO, approximately 54.8% of the long-term equity incentive award value granted is attributed to RSUs and approximately 45.2% of the award value granted is attributed to Premium SARs. To further promote retention, the RSUs and SARs granted in fiscal 2018 vest in equal annual installments over a three year period commencing on the first anniversary date of the grant. As the awards are inherently tied to the performance of our common stock, we consider a vesting schedule based upon continued service appropriate to meet the desire for both retention and performance incentive.
The value of the equity awards granted to our NEOs in fiscal 2018 are reported in the Summary Compensation Table and are further described in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table.
 Other Executive Compensation Policies and Practices
          Clawback Policy
In line with corporate governance best practices, the Compensation Committee has adopted a clawback policy that allows the Company to seek repayment of incentive compensation that was paid based on financial statements that were subsequently restated. The policy provides that if the Board determines that there has been a material restatement of publicly issued financial results from those previously issued to the public, our Board will review all MIP awards and equity awards made to executive officers during the three-year period prior to the restatement on the basis of having met or exceeded specific performance targets. If such payments would have been lower had they been calculated based on such restated results, our Board will (to the extent permitted by governing law) seek to recoup the payments in excess of the amount that would have been paid based on the restated results.
         Equity Grant Practices
We generally seek to make equity compensation grants in the first quarter following the completion of a given fiscal year. SARs are granted with an exercise price equal to or higher than the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, which is the date the Compensation Committee approves the award. We do not have any specific program, plan or practice related to timing equity compensation awards to executives; however, the Compensation Committee generally grants annual awards on the date of the regularly scheduled first fiscal quarter Board meeting in September. Other than grants made in connection with hiring, promotions or to replace certain new hire grants once they vest and/or are exercised, equity awards are granted to NEOs at the same time that equity awards are granted to all other employees who are eligible for such awards. Table of Contents
          Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executives
Consistent with our objective of encouraging executive stock ownership to create long-term stockholder value by aligning the interests of our executives with our stockholders, the Company has adopted executive stock ownership guidelines. Under the guidelines, our executive officers are expected to hold shares of our common stock equal to multiples of their base salaries as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Title   Multiple of Base Salary  
Chief Executive Officer   6x 
Chief Financial Officer   3x 
Presidents   3x 
Executive Vice Presidents   2x 
[END TABLE]
Until an executive achieves the required level of ownership, he or she is required to retain at least 75% of the net shares received as a result of the vesting of RSUs or restricted stock or the exercise of SARs. Net shares are those that remain after shares are netted to pay any applicable exercise price or statutory tax withholdings. Shares of common stock, stock owned in a directed retirement plan or IRA and the intrinsic value of vested equity grants count as stock ownership for purposes of these guidelines. As of the date of this proxy statement, all NEOs who are subject to our stock ownership guidelines have met their required level of stock ownership.
          Policy Prohibiting Hedging and Pledging Transactions
Our Insider Trading Compliance Program prohibits executives from engaging in hedging transactions designed to offset decreases in the market value of the Company's securities, including engaging in short sales or investing in other derivatives of the Company's securities, including put and call options and collar transactions. The Insider Trading Compliance Program also prohibits directors and executive officers from pledging shares of the Company's stock.
          Post-Termination Compensation
Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Katz is entitled to receive severance payments and continuation of certain benefits upon certain terminations of employment, including certain resignations for "good reason" (as defined in his agreement). Pursuant to the Company's executive severance policy, Messrs. Barkin and Shapiro and Mmes. Campbell and Lynch are entitled to receive severance payments upon certain terminations of employment. In addition, each NEO is entitled to receive payments upon a termination occurring within a limited period of time following a change in control. We believe the change in control arrangements provide continuity of management in the event of an actual or threatened change in control. We also believe that our termination and severance provisions reflect both market practices and competitive factors. Our Board believed that these severance payments and benefit arrangements were necessary to attract and retain our executives when these agreements were entered into.
         Tax Deductibility of Executive Compensation
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform") was signed into law significantly impacting certain provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") beginning January 1, 2018.   Before the passage of Tax Reform, the Code generally provided that (i) no federal income tax business expense deduction was allowed for annual compensation in excess of $1 million paid by a publicly traded corporation to its chief executive officer and its three other most highly compensated executive officers (other than the chief financial officer), and (ii) compensation that was considered "performance-based compensation" (within the meaning of the Code) did not count towards the $1 million limit. Under Tax Reform, the scope of covered employees was expanded to include the CFO and any other executive officer who is ever considered a covered employee after 2016. In addition, with some exceptions for certain legally-binding arrangements in effect on November 2, 2017, the exclusion for performance-based compensation is no longer applicable. While the Compensation Committee considers the impact of the tax treatment of executive compensation, the primary factor influencing program design is the support of business objectives. The Compensation Committee reserves the right to design programs that recognize a full range of performance criteria important to our success, even where the compensation paid under such programs may not be deductible. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee retains flexibility to structure our compensation programs in a manner that is not tax-deductible in order to achieve a strategic result that the Compensation Committee determines to be more appropriate. We have typically intended to structure certain quantitative portions of our cash-based incentive compensation and our equity awards to our covered executive officers under the 2002 Plan, 2015 Plan and MIP as qualifying performance-based compensation for Section 162(m) purposes. However, because of the Tax Reform changes to Section 162(m), future awards of cash-based incentive compensation and equity will no longer so qualify. Table of Contents

(d) In fiscal 2018, our NEOs were entitled to participate in our Perquisite Fund Program, under which certain of the Company's officers receive an annual allowance based on officer level to be used at the Company's resorts. For fiscal 2018, annual allowances for NEOs were as follows: CEO—$70,000; President—$40,000; and Executive Vice President—$30,000. Executives may draw against the account to pay for services or goods at the market rate. Amounts of the fund used by the NEO are taxed as ordinary income, like other compensation. The amounts reported include the amounts used by the NEO towards lodging, ski school privileges and discretionary spending on services or goods at our properties for personal use. In accordance with SEC  
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents rules, the value of these benefits is measured on the basis of the estimated aggregate incremental cost to the Company for providing these benefits, and perquisites and personal benefits are not reported for any NEO for whom such amounts were less than $10,000 in the aggregate for the fiscal year. In fiscal 2018, the Company also provided to each NEO benefits relating to the use of one or more of our private clubs, for which the Company incurred no incremental costs. NEOs are responsible for the payment of their individual, non-business related expenditures incurred at such clubs, although these expenses would qualify for reimbursement under the Perquisite Fund Program if within the NEO's allowance under that program.

(1) The estimated possible payouts are based on the parameters applicable to each NEO at the time the Compensation Committee established the relevant performance goals in writing at the beginning of fiscal 2018, as more fully described in the CD&A section of this proxy statement. The actual earned and subsequently paid amounts are reported in the Summary Compensation Table under the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column. 
(2) The Threshold amount is based on the MIP's minimum target funding level based upon no achievement of Resort EBITDA targets for fiscal 2018, with the resulting funding applied to the NEO's target percentage of base salary and then paid out at the 70% threshold level for individual performance (other than for Mr. Katz, whose MIP award is tied entirely to corporate performance and payout is 50% cash and 50% RSUs that vest over three years). 
(3) The Target amount is based on the MIP's target funding level of 100% upon achievement by the Company of 100% of certain Resort EBITDA targets for fiscal 2018, with the resulting funding applied to the NEO's target percentage of base salary and then paid out at the 100% target level for individual performance (other than for Mr. Katz, whose MIP award is tied entirely to corporate performance and payout is 50% cash and 50% RSUs that vest over three years). 
(4) The Maximum amount is based on the MIP's maximum funding level of 200% upon achievement by the Company of at least 120% of certain Resort EBITDA targets for fiscal 2018, with the resulting funding applied to the NEO's target percentage of base salary and then paid out at the 130% maximum level for individual performance (other than for Mr. Katz, whose MIP award is tied entirely to corporate performance and payout is 50% cash and 50% RSUs that vest over three years). 
(5) Represents SARs that vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The exercise price of each SAR is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, except in the case of the SARs award value granted to Mr. Katz on September 27, 2017, for which the exercise price was 125% of the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Upon the exercise of a SAR, the actual number of shares the Company will issue to the NEO is equal the quotient of (i) the product of (x) the excess of the per share fair market value of our common stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price, multiplied by (y) the number of SARs exercised, divided by (ii) the per share fair market value of our common stock on the date of exercise, less any shares withheld to cover payment of applicable tax withholding obligations. The grants were made pursuant to the 2015 Plan. 
(6) The amounts shown represent the aggregate fair value of the award calculated as of the grant date in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are included in note 15 to our audited financial statements for fiscal 2018, which are included in our Annual Report. 
(7) Represents RSUs that vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant. The grants were made pursuant to the 2015 Plan. In the case of Mr. Katz, the number of shares includes 1,965 RSUs for 50% payment of Mr. Katz's total MIP award for fiscal 2017 and 4,637 RSUs as part of his long-term equity incentive award for fiscal 2018.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
The Company has an employment agreement with Mr. Katz, which was approved by the Compensation Committee. No other NEO has an employment agreement with the Company.
        Robert A. Katz, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Katz on October 15, 2008, as amended on September 30, 2011 and April 11, 2013. The employment agreement had an initial term through October 15, 2011 and provides for automatic renewal for successive one year periods if neither party provides written notice of non-renewal to the other party not less than 60 days prior to the then-current scheduled expiration date. Under the employment agreement, the initial base salary was set at $843,500, subject to annual adjustments by the Compensation Committee, though in no case may the base salary be reduced at any time below the then-current level. As part of the Company-wide wage reduction plan effective April 2, 2009, Mr. Katz waived this requirement and did not take any salary for a twelve month period. Effective April 1, 2010, Mr. Katz's salary was reinstated at 85% of his prior pre-wage reduction salary. Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Katz also participates in the Company's MIP, as more fully described in the CD&A. Under the employment agreement, if the Company achieves specified performance targets for the year under the MIP, Mr. Katz's "target opportunity" will be no less than 100% of his base salary. The employment agreement provides that Mr. Katz's MIP award is to be paid 50% in cash and 50% in RSUs that vest annually over a three year period. Mr. Katz also receives other benefits and perquisites on the same terms as afforded to senior executives generally, including customary health, disability and insurance benefits, certain membership benefits at the Company's private clubs and participation in the Perquisite Fund Program.
The employment agreement also provides for certain payments in connection with the termination (including constructive termination) of Mr. Katz under certain circumstances, as more fully described under the heading "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below. The September 2011 amendment to his employment agreement eliminated his rights to (i) receive cash severance benefits upon his voluntary resignation within six months following a change in control, and (ii) be eligible to receive tax gross-up payments on severance and other benefits payable in connection with a change in control. The April 2013 amendment eliminated his rights to paid time off in connection with the Company's adoption of a flexible time off policy.
Mr. Katz's employment agreement contains standard provisions for non-competition and non-solicitation of the Company's managerial employees that become effective as of the date of Mr. Katz's termination of employment and that continue for two years thereafter. Mr. Katz is also subject to a permanent covenant to maintain confidentiality of the Company's confidential information.

[END TABLE]
On September 15, 2000, Vail Associates, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which we refer to in this section of the proxy statement as the Employer, adopted a Deferred Compensation Plan, which we refer to as the Grandfathered Plan, for the benefit of a select group of management or highly compensated employees, or participants. The Grandfathered Plan is not tax qualified. Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, sets forth specific tax requirements related to nonqualified deferred compensation plans, including the Grandfathered Plan. Rules under Section 409A were effective for nonqualified deferrals of compensation after December 31, 2004. As a result, after December 31, 2004, no new contributions were accepted into the Grandfathered Plan.
Effective January 1, 2005, the Employer began operating a new nonqualified deferred compensation plan designed to comply with Section 409A, which we refer to as the Plan. The Plan provides for two classes of participants. Class 1 participants may contribute to the Plan up to 95% of their base pay and up to 95% of any Employer-paid bonus. Class 2 participants may defer only an amount of base pay equal to any 401(k) compliance test refund. Effective January 1, 2007, all participants became eligible to defer up to 80% of their base salary (including an amount of base pay equal to any 401(k) compliance test refund) and 100% of any Employer-paid bonus. Members of the Board may contribute up to 100% of their director fees. All contributions made by participants are 100% vested. The Employer may, on an annual basis, elect to make matching and/or discretionary employer contributions, although to date, the Employer has not made any such contributions. Matching and discretionary contributions vest as determined by the Employer or the Plan's administrative committee, which we refer to in this section of the proxy statement as the Plan Committee. The Employer or the Plan Committee may accelerate the vesting on matching and/or discretionary Employer contributions at any time, and accelerated vesting will generally occur automatically upon a change in control as defined in Section 409A.
Under the Plan, all contributions for a Plan year are allocated among the following two types of accounts at the election of the Participant: Separation from Service accounts and Scheduled Distribution accounts. Separation from Service accounts are generally payable in a lump sum or installments six months following the termination of a Participant's employment. Scheduled Distribution accounts are generally payable as a lump sum at a designated date at least three years from the year of deferral. Participants have limited rights to delay distributions from either type of account, provided that the election to delay a distribution (i) is made at least twelve months prior to the date the distribution would otherwise have been made, and (ii) delays the distribution for at least five years. All accounts are payable immediately upon the Participant's disability or death. Participants generally have the right to receive an early distribution from their accounts only upon an unforeseeable emergency. Participants have the right to designate hypothetical investments for their accounts, and their accounts are credited with gains or losses in accordance with the Participants' selections.
All contributions are placed in a rabbi trust which restricts the Employer's use of and access to the contributions. However, all money in the rabbi trust remains subject to the Employer's general creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The trustee, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., is entitled to invest the trust fund in accordance with guidelines established by the Employer. Currently, all assets are invested in a Trust-Owned Life Insurance policy. To the extent that the funds in the trust are insufficient to pay Plan benefits, the Employer is required to fund the difference. Table of Contents
The Plan Committee is charged with responsibility to select certain mutual funds, insurance company separate accounts, indexed rates or other methods, which we refer to as Measurement Funds, for purposes of crediting or debiting additional amounts to Participants' account balances. Participants may elect one or more of these Measurement Funds for purposes of crediting or debiting additional amounts to his or her account balance. As necessary, the Plan Committee may discontinue, substitute or add a Measurement Fund. Each such action will take effect as of the first day of the first calendar quarter that begins at least thirty days after the day on which the Plan Committee gives Participants advance written notice of such change. Participants can change their Measurement Fund allocations daily. The Measurement Funds are valued daily at their net asset values.
Using the weighted average return methodology, the rate of return for the Plan, as a weighted portfolio, for the prior twelve-month period ended July 31, 2017 was 8.03%. The rate of return of the S&P 500 for that same period was 16.24%. For this purpose, the weighted portfolio is a weighted average percentage allocation based on the Plan sponsor's liability holdings for a given point in time, and the weighted average returns are calculated based on the weights assigned using the returns of the underlying funds. Actual account cash balances were not used in calculating this performance. The Plan does not provide for the payment of interest based on above-market rates.
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE-IN-CONTROL
The employment agreement with Mr. Katz and the Company's executive severance policy, which applies to Messrs. Barkin and Shapiro and Mmes. Campbell and Lynch, require us to provide certain compensation in the event of certain terminations of employment or upon a change in control of the Company. The employment agreement with Mr. Katz and the executive severance policy provide that the Company may terminate the executive at any time with or without cause. However, if the executive's employment is terminated without cause or terminated by the executive for good reason, then the executive shall be entitled, in exchange for a signed release, to receive compensation in the amounts and under the circumstances described below. In addition, the forms of equity award agreements used with all of our employees provide for the full acceleration of vesting of outstanding SARs, restricted stock and RSUs upon a change in control of the Company. In accordance with the employment agreement with Mr. Katz, if he breaches the post-employment non-competition or non-solicitation covenants to which he is subject under his employment agreement, then he must promptly reimburse the Company for any severance payments received from, or payable by, the Company.
The amounts shown in the tables below are estimates of the value of the payments and benefits each of our NEOs would have been entitled to receive had a termination event and/or a change in control of the Company occurred, effective as of July 31, 2018. The actual compensation to be paid to a NEO can only be determined at the time such NEO's employment is terminated and may vary based on factors such as the timing during the year of any such event, the Company's stock price and any changes to our benefit arrangements and policies.
          Robert A. Katz, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Mr. Katz's employment agreement provides that upon (i) the giving of notice of non-renewal of the agreement by the Company or termination of employment by the Company without cause or (ii) termination of employment by Mr. Katz for good reason (as defined in the employment agreement), Mr. Katz is entitled to receive certain benefits (so long as he has executed a release in connection with his termination), including: (a) two years of then-current base salary payable in a lump sum; (b) a prorated MIP award (provided that performance targets are met) for the portion of the Company's fiscal year through the effective date of the termination or non-renewal, payable in lump sum; (c) one year of COBRA premiums for continuation of health and dental coverage, payable in a lump sum; and (d) full accelerated vesting of any RSUs, SARs or other equity awards held by Mr. Katz. If, within twelve months of the consummation of a change in control of the Company, (i) the Company terminates Mr. Katz without cause or gives notice of non-renewal of his agreement or (ii) Mr. Katz terminates his employment for good reason, Mr. Katz is entitled to receive (so long as he has executed a release in connection with his termination): (a) two years of then-current base salary payable in a lump sum; (b) a prorated MIP award (provided that performance targets are met) for the portion of the Company's fiscal year through the effective date of the termination or non-renewal, payable in lump sum; (c) an amount equal to the cash MIP award paid to Mr. Katz in the prior year, payable in lump sum; and (d) to the extent not already vested, full accelerated vesting of any RSUs, SARs or other equity awards held by Mr. Katz.

Pay Ratio Disclosure 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K (we refer to the statute and the regulation collectively as the "pay ratio rule"), we are providing the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Katz, our Chief Executive Officer, to the annual total compensation of our median employee.  The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the pay ratio rule. 
To calculate the pay ratio, we determined our median employee as of July 31, 2018, which is the last day of our fiscal 2018. On July 31, 2018, we had 14,544 employees, 6,318 of which were year-round employees and 8,226 of which were seasonal employees.  
To identify the "median employee" for purposes of this disclosure, we analyzed, for all of the individuals employed by us as of July 31, 2018, or as of June 18, 2018 in the case of Perisher, Australia employees, the compensation that we paid to each of those individuals for the 12-month period ending on that date.  We considered each employee's "compensation" to consist of (i) the employee's total gross earnings for a 12-month period ending on July 31, 2018 or June 18, 2018 (in the case of Perisher), plus (ii) the estimated amount of the Company's contributions for that period to the retirement plans in which the employee participates based upon the employee's deferral elections on the date identified.  For our Canadian employees, the rate of pay was converted to U.S. Dollars using a conversion rate US$1 to CAD$0.7684.  For our Australian employees, the rate of pay was converted to U.S. Dollars using a conversion rate US$1 to AUS$0.7438.  No cost-of-living adjustments were made.
Total Annual Compensation of our CEO in fiscal 2018 was $3,378,398 and was based on the compensation reportable in the Summary Compensation Table according to applicable instructions and interpretations.  When compared to the total annual compensation for our median employee of $17,596, this results in a pay ratio of 192:1. 
The nature of our operations requires the use of many seasonal and part-time employees who do not work year round, and accordingly, we are providing a supplemental disclosure annualizing the compensation of such employees.  To identify the "median employee" for purposes of this supplemental disclosure, we analyzed, for all of the individuals employed by us as of July 31, 2018, or as of June 18, 2018 in the case of Perisher, Australia employees, the compensation that we paid to each of those individuals for the 12-month period ending on that date.  We considered each employee's "compensation" to consist of (i) the employee's total gross earnings for the 12-month period ending July 31, 2018 or June 18, 2018 (in the case of Perisher), plus (ii) the estimated amount of the Company's contributions for that period to the retirement plans in which the employee participates.  The compensation for seasonal or part-time employees who were not employed by us for the entire 12-month period was annualized to reflect compensation for a comparable 12-month period (or 2,080 hours worked during the year). The same Canadian and Australian dollar currency conversion rates as stated above were used for this supplemental disclosure.  No cost-of-living adjustments were made.
Using the total annual compensation of our CEO in fiscal 2018 of $3,378,398 as presented in the Summary Compensation Table, when compared to the total annualized compensation for our median employee as of July 31, 2018 of $32,923, this results in a pay ratio of 103:1. Table of Contents

PROPOSAL 2. RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
[END TABLE]
SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit Committee has selected, and the Board has ratified the selection of, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019, and has further directed that management submit the selection of independent auditors for ratification by the stockholders at the annual meeting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has been the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 2002. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP expects to have a representative at the annual meeting who will have the opportunity to make a statement and who will be available to answer appropriate questions.
Neither the Company's Bylaws nor other governing documents or law require stockholder ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. However, the Audit Committee is submitting the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. It is understood that even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a new independent accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee believes that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
FEES BILLED TO VAIL RESORTS BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP DURING FISCAL 2018 AND FISCAL 2017
Audit Fees.    Audit fees (including expenses) billed (or billable) to the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the audit of our annual financial statements included in our Form 10-K and the review of the financial statements included in our Forms 10-Q with respect to fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were $2,725,250 and $2,808,537, respectively. For both fiscal years, such fees included fees for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's examination of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Audit-Related Fees.    There were no audit related fees billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP with respect to fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.
Tax Fees.    Tax fees billed or billable by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP with respect to fiscal 2018 were $5,000.  In fiscal 2017, there were $665,023 of tax fees billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  Such fees were related to tax services provided to the Company in connection with international transactions.
All Other Fees.    All other fees (including expenses) billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP with respect to fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were $4,500 and $3,600, respectively. Such fees were for access to a research database.
The Audit Committee determined that the provision of services other than audit services by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was compatible with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's independence.
The Audit Committee has the sole authority to approve all audit engagement fees and terms and pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has delegated authority to the Chairman of the Audit Committee to pre-approve services between Audit Committee meetings, which must be reported to the full Audit Committee at its next meeting. Fees for permissible non-audit services that are not pre-approved must be less than 5% of total fees paid. For fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, all of the fees included under the headings "Tax Fees" and "All Other Fees" above were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JULY 31, 2019. Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
PROPOSAL 3. ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
[END TABLE]
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking stockholders to approve an advisory resolution, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" resolution, approving our executive compensation as reported in this proxy statement. As described in the CD&A section of this proxy statement, our executive compensation program is designed to incentivize achievement of short- and long-term Company and individual performance. We believe this compensation approach aligns the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders.
The Compensation Committee has structured our executive compensation program to achieve the following key objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Emphasizing Pay-for-Performance.  Emphasize pay-for-performance by tying annual and long-term compensation incentives to achievement of specified performance objectives or overall stock performance. 
• Attracting, Retaining and Motivating.  Attract, retain and motivate talented executives who will determine our long-term success through a program competitive with compensation paid by companies in the same market for executive talent. 
• Rewarding Contributions and Creating Long-Term Value.  Recognize and reward contributions of all employees, including executive officers, in achieving strategic goals and business objectives, while aligning the program with stockholder interests. 
[END TABLE]
We encourage stockholders to read the CD&A (as well as the other tables and narrative disclosures included in this proxy statement), which describes in more detail how our executive compensation program operates and is designed to achieve our compensation objectives, including through the use of annual incentive awards, long-term equity awards, a high percentage of compensation that is variable or "at-risk" and performance-based stock awards for our CEO. The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that the policies and procedures articulated in the CD&A are effective in achieving our goals and that the compensation of our named executive officers reported in this proxy statement has supported and contributed to the Company's recent and long-term success and is aligned with the interests of our stockholders.
At the 2017 annual meeting, we submitted a "say-on-pay" resolution to our stockholders. Our stockholders approved this proposal with approximately 97.95% of the votes cast on the proposal voting in favor of the resolution. Because our Board views the annual advisory vote as a good corporate governance practice, and because at our 2017 annual meeting approximately 93.14% of the votes cast on the frequency proposal were in favor of an annual advisory vote, we are again asking stockholders to approve the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this proxy statement.  The Board currently believes that holding an annual say-on-pay vote is the most appropriate policy for the Company, consistent with the overwhelming preference indicated by our stockholders at the 2017 annual meeting. Therefore we expect that the next say on pay vote will occur at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.   
Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that stockholders approve the following advisory resolution at the annual meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers of Vail Resorts, Inc., as disclosed pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the CD&A, compensation tables and related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED."
Although this vote is advisory and is not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING – QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
[END TABLE]
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a "street name" holder?
If your shares of the Company's common stock are registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, Wells Fargo Shareowner Services, then you are a stockholder of record.
If your shares are not held in your name, but rather are held through an intermediary, such as in an account at a brokerage firm or by a bank, trustee or other nominee, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name." However, as a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other nominee regarding how to vote the shares held in your account.
Who is entitled to vote at or attend the annual meeting?
Holders of record and street name holders (subject to the requirements below) of our common stock and the Exchangeable Shares (as defined below) as of the close of business on October 9, 2018, which we refer to as the record date, are entitled to vote. On the record date, we had 40,448,667 shares of common stock outstanding and 57,629 Exchangeable Shares outstanding. Each share, including each Exchangeable Share, is entitled to one vote on each item being voted on at the annual meeting. You are entitled to attend the annual meeting only if you were a stockholder, joint holder or holder of Exchangeable Shares as of the record date or you hold a valid proxy for the annual meeting.
        If you are a stockholder of record:
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the meeting or vote by proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy in advance of the annual meeting over the telephone or on the Internet as instructed in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to ensure your vote is counted.
        If you are a street name holder:
If you are a street name holder, you may not vote your shares in person at the annual meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy from your broker or other nominee and bring such proxy to the annual meeting. If you want to attend the annual meeting, but not vote at the annual meeting, you must provide proof of beneficial ownership as of the record date, such as your most recent account statement prior to October 9, 2018, a copy of the voting instruction card provided by your broker or other nominee, or other similar evidence of ownership. Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy or otherwise instruct your nominee how to vote on your behalf in advance of the annual meeting in accordance with the instructions provided by your bank, broker, trustee or other nominee.
How do I vote my shares?
        If you are a stockholder of record of our common shares:
        By Telephone or the Internet
Stockholders of record can vote their shares via telephone or the Internet as instructed in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. The telephone and Internet procedures are designed to authenticate a stockholder's identity, to allow stockholders to vote their shares and confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded.
The telephone and Internet voting facilities will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 5, 2018.
        By Mail
Stockholders who elect to vote by mail should request a paper proxy card by telephone or Internet and should complete, sign and date their proxy cards and mail them in the pre-addressed envelopes that accompany the delivery of paper proxy cards. Proxy cards submitted by mail must be received by the time of the meeting in order for your shares to be voted.
        At the Meeting
Shares held in your name as the stockholder of record may be voted by you in person at the annual meeting. Table of Contents
If you are a street name holder of our common shares:
        By Telephone or the Internet
If your broker or other nominee provides for a means to submit your voting instructions by telephone or the Internet, you will be provided with directions on doing so by your broker or other nominee.
        By Mail
Street name holders may vote by mail by requesting a paper voting instruction card according to the instructions contained in the materials received from your broker or other nominee.
        At the Annual Meeting
Shares held in street name may be voted by you in person at the annual meeting only if you obtain a valid proxy from the broker or other nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares and bring such proxy to the annual meeting.
If you are a holder of record of the Whistler Blackcomb exchangeable shares:
Holders of exchangeable shares, which we refer to as the "Exchangeable Shares," issued by Whistler Blackcomb Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as 1068877 B.C. Ltd.), a Canadian subsidiary of ours ("Exchangeco"), are receiving these proxy materials in accordance with the provisions of the Exchangeable Shares and the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated as of October 16, 2016, among the Company, 1089881 B.C. Ltd., Exchangeco and Computershare Trust Company of Canada (the "Trustee").  The Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable for shares of the Company's common stock on a one-for-one basis.
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, holders of Exchangeable Shares are effectively provided with voting rights for each Exchangeable Share that are nearly equivalent to the voting rights applicable to a share of the Company's common stock, and holders are entitled to instruct the Trustee as to how to vote their Exchangeable Shares.  The Trustee holds one share of the Company's preferred stock designated as the "Special Voting Share."  The Special Voting Share entitles the Trustee to vote on matters in which holders of the Company's common stock are entitled to vote.  The Special Voting Share is entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of Exchangeable Shares outstanding on the record date for determining holders of the Company's common stock entitled to vote and for which the Trustee has received voting instructions from the holders of such Exchangeable Shares.  The Special Voting Share shall vote together with the holders of the Company's common stock as a single class. 
In accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Company has undertaken to perform the obligations of the Trustee and has authorized Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") to collect and receive directly the votes from the holders of the Exchangeable Shares on its behalf.  Based upon the foregoing, holders of Exchangeable shares are entitled to cast up to 61,478 votes at the annual meeting.  However, Broadridge will receive and tabulate each vote attached to the Exchangeable Shares only on the basis of instructions received from the holders of record of the Exchangeable Shares.  In the absence of instructions from a holder as to voting, Broadridge will not include the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder in the vote.
If you are a holder of record of Exchangeable Shares, you can vote your Exchangeable Shares:
By Telephone or the Internet
Holders of Exchangeable Shares of record can vote their shares via telephone or the Internet as instructed in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. The telephone and Internet procedures are designed to authenticate a stockholder's identity, to allow stockholders to vote their shares and confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded.
The telephone and Internet voting facilities will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 5, 2018.
By Mail
Holders of Exchangeable Shares who elect to vote by mail should request a paper proxy card by telephone or Internet and should complete, sign and date their proxy cards and mail them in the pre-addressed envelopes that accompany the delivery of paper proxy cards. Proxy cards submitted by mail must be received by the time of the meeting in order for your Exchangeable Shares to be voted.
        At the Annual Meeting
Holders of Exchangeable Shares who wish to vote in person at the annual meeting may instruct Broadridge (by following the procedures set forth in the voting instruction form) to give you or your designee a proxy to exercise the voting rights personally at the annual meeting.  You may also instruct Broadridge to give a proxy to a designated representative of the Company to exercise such voting rights. Table of Contents
Only holders of Exchangeable Shares whose names appear on the records of Exchangeco as the registered holders of Exchangeable Shares on the record date are entitled to exercise voting rights in respect of their Exchangeable Shares at the annual meeting.  If on the record date your Exchangeable Shares were held not in your name, but rather in the name of a nominee, then you are the beneficial owner of Exchangeable Shares held in "street name" and these proxy materials, if you have received them, are being forwarded to you by that nominee.  The nominee holding your account is considered to be the stockholder of record for purposes of voting your Exchangeable Shares.  As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your nominee on how to vote your Exchangeable Shares in accordance with the instructions provided by your nominee.
Can I change my vote?
If you are a stockholder of record of common stock, you may change your vote at any time prior to the vote at the annual meeting by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• providing timely delivery of a later-dated proxy (including by telephone or Internet vote); 
• providing timely written notice of revocation to our Secretary at 390 Interlocken Crescent, Broomfield, Colorado 80021; or 
• attending the annual meeting and voting in person. 
[END TABLE]
To be timely, later dated proxy cards and written notices if revocation is submitted by mail, must be received by the time of the annual meeting. In order to change your vote by telephone or Internet, you must do so before the telephone and Internet voting facilities close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on December 5, 2018.
If you are a street name holder of common stock, you may change your vote by timely submitting new voting instructions to your broker or other nominee following the instructions they provided, or, if you have obtained a valid proxy from your broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares, by attending the meeting and voting in person.
If you are a holder of Exchangeable Shares, you may revoke your voting instructions to Broadridge in accordance with the voting direction provided by Broadridge.
How many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at the annual meeting?
The quorum requirement for holding the annual meeting and transacting business is that holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock that is entitled to vote must be present in person or represented by proxy. Both abstentions and broker non-votes described below are counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. If there is no quorum, the holders of a majority of shares present at the meeting in person or represented by proxy may adjourn the annual meeting to another date.
How are abstentions treated?
Abstentions are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. For purposes of determining whether the stockholders have approved a matter, abstentions are not treated as votes cast affirmatively or negatively, and therefore do not have any effect on the outcome of a matter to be voted on at the annual meeting that requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of our common stock present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting. A "majority of votes cast" means the number of "FOR" votes exceeds the number of "AGAINST" votes.
What are the voting requirements?
Proposal 1—Election of Directors
In the election of directors named in this proxy statement, you may vote "FOR" one or more of the nominees or your vote may be "AGAINST" one or more of the nominees. Alternatively, you may vote "ABSTAIN" with respect to one or more nominees. You may not cumulate your votes for the election of directors. To be elected, each director nominee requires a majority of the votes cast for his or her election, which means that each director nominee must receive more votes cast "FOR" than "AGAINST" that director nominee. Abstentions are not treated as voting on this proposal. If stockholders do not elect a nominee who is already serving as a director, Delaware law provides that the director would continue to serve on the Board as a "holdover director," rather than causing a vacancy, until a successor is duly elected or until the director resigns. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines and as permitted by our Bylaws, each director has submitted an advance, contingent resignation that the Board may accept if stockholders do not elect the director. In that situation, our Nominating & Governance Committee would make a recommendation to the Board about whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether to take other action. The Board will promptly publicly disclose its decision regarding the director's resignation. Table of Contents
Proposal 2—Ratification of Selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
In the ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2019, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." This proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares present in person or represented by proxy, entitled to vote, and actually voting on the proposal at the annual meeting. Abstentions are not treated as voting on this proposal.
Proposal 3—Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation
In the advisory vote to approve executive compensation, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." This proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares present in person or represented by proxy, entitled to vote, and actually voting on the proposal at the annual meeting. Abstentions are not treated as voting on this proposal. The vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board. However, the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation as it deems appropriate.
         What are "broker non-votes"?
If you hold shares in street name through a broker and do not provide your broker with voting instructions, your shares may constitute "broker non-votes." Generally, broker non-votes occur on a matter when a broker is not permitted to vote on that matter without instructions from the beneficial owner and instructions are not given by the beneficial owner. In tabulating the voting result for any particular proposal, shares that constitute broker non-votes are considered present for purpose of determining a quorum but are not considered entitled to vote or votes cast on that proposal. Thus, a broker non-vote will make a quorum more readily attainable, but, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any matter being voted on at the annual meeting, assuming that a quorum is obtained.
If your shares are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker on how to vote your shares, your brokerage firm, in its discretion, may either leave your shares unvoted or vote your shares on "routine" matters. The proposal to ratify the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year (Proposal 2) is considered a routine matter. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, the election of directors (Proposal 1) and the advisory vote to approve executive compensation (Proposal 3) are not considered routine matters and, consequently, without your voting instructions, your broker cannot vote your uninstructed shares on these proposals.
Who will serve as inspector of elections?
The inspector of elections will be a representative from Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.
Who will bear the cost of soliciting votes for the annual meeting?
The Company is soliciting your proxy, and we will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to the original solicitation of proxies, proxies may be solicited personally, by telephone or other means of communication, by our directors and employees. Directors and employees will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies.
We may reimburse brokers holding common stock in their names or in the names of their nominees for their expenses in sending proxy material to the beneficial owners of such common stock.
What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials?
If you receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, it means that you have multiple accounts at the transfer agent or with brokers or other nominees. Please vote all of your shares as described herein, or follow the instructions received from each broker or other nominee, to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
What if I submit a proxy but do not make specific choices?
If a proxy is voted by telephone or Internet, or is signed and returned by mail without choices specified, in the absence of contrary instructions, the shares of common stock represented by such proxy will be voted as recommended by the Board, and will be voted in the proxy holders' discretion as to other matters that may properly come before the annual meeting.
How can I find out the results of the voting at the annual meeting?
Preliminary voting results will be announced at the annual meeting. Final voting results will be reported in a Form 8-K, which will be filed with the SEC following the annual meeting. Table of Contents
Annual Meeting Materials
The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, Notice of Annual Meeting, this proxy statement and the Annual Report have been made available to all stockholders and holders of Exchangeable Shares entitled to Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and entitled to vote at the annual meeting. The Annual Report is not incorporated into this proxy statement and is not considered proxy-soliciting material.

HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS 
[END TABLE]
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.
This year, a number of brokers with account holders who are Company stockholders may be "householding" our proxy materials to the extent such stockholders have given their prior express or implied consent in accordance with SEC rules. A single Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, proxy statement and Annual Report (if you requested one) will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, proxy statement and Annual Report, please notify your broker to discontinue householding and direct your written request to receive a separate Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, proxy statement and Annual Report to the Company at: Vail Resorts, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, 390 Interlocken Crescent, Broomfield, Colorado, 80021, or by calling (303) 404-1800. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, proxy statement and Annual Report at their address and would like to request householding of their communications should contact their broker.
