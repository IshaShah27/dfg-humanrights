Letter from the Board of Directors 
Dear Fellow Shareholders of 
Thor Industries: 
As your Board of Directors, we are pleased to report the performance of your Company in Fiscal Year 2018. As a Board, we focus our efforts on business strategy, risk management, talent development, succession planning, and Thor's commitment to its culture of ethics and compliance. In recent years, we have made many changes to how we govern the Company. 
In this proxy statement, in addition to the annually recurring voting matters, we ask for your vote to declassify our Board. Our classified Board served this Company well for many years, but we have determined that in today's environment, declassification provides the best structure for our Board. Please support us in this significant initiative. Our mission is to help your Company achieve sustainable operating and financial performance and to drive both short-term and long-term Shareholder value. 
Our industry faced headwinds in 2018 that impacted both our top and bottom lines. These headwinds included a new tariff policy that prompted even our domestic suppliers to opportunistically raise prices and a prolonged winter that hampered the early portion of what is typically the kickoff of our prime selling season. Once winter cleared, retail sales for our products, while tempered from the rapid growth of last year, were strong, supporting our belief that the fundamentals for our industry and your Company remain favorable for the foreseeable future. 
Regarding our bottomline, the rapidity with which some of our domestic suppliers took price increases impacted our margin performance; however, from the time the tariffs were announced, we developed and implemented strategies to offset their impact. The strategies included strategic buying initiatives, decontenting certain components in our units to maintain a steady price point, and, when appropriate and necessary, price increases. We are meeting the challenges posed by the tariffs, and we have taken the appropriate steps to minimize their impact on our margins as we look ahead. Neither weather nor an aggressive tariff policy is an excuse, rather these are factors that impeded our wholesale performance as retail pull-through was impacted and caused an increase to our cost of goods sold during Fiscal Year 2018. The initiatives we implemented, together with the continued robustness of our retail market, leave us emboldened about our future. 
As a consequence of the headwinds identified above, our stock price had a tough year after nearly five (5) years of consistent and, at times, rapid growth. We ended our year at $94.85, down 10% from the prior year. Over the past five years, our stock price has increased by 75.5% which compares favorably to the Russell 3000's growth over the same period of 65.9%. While the short term performance of our stock was disappointing, to say the least, we continue to have a positive outlook on our long-term performance and, therefore, our stock price. 
Governance Developments 
Good corporate governance is a hallmark of any successful company. At Thor, our governance is the foundation for financial integrity and sustained performance. Our focus on governance in Fiscal Year 2018 led to significant improvements in our governance structure. In Fiscal Year 2018, we amended our Amended and Restated By-Laws consistent with current best practices to institute a proxy access program and adopted certain advance notice provisions for Shareholder proposals. The proxy access program

[BEGIN TABLE]
   provides proxy access to a group of up to twenty (20) Shareholders who have  maintained ownership of at least 3% of Thor's outstanding stock for at least three (3) years the right to include in the Company's Proxy Statement nominees for election as Directors representing up to 25% of the Board or a total of two  (2) Directors, whichever is greater. Also, in this proxy, our proposal to declassify the Board is submitted for shareholder vote.   In Fiscal Year 2018, we saw the retirement of long-term Board member, Alan Siegel. Alan was a great champion for your Company and for you. He served the company  extraordinarily well since its inception. Alan was replaced on the Board by Christopher Klein, the CEO of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. Chris has already proven to be a great strategic asset to our Board. Most recently, in October  2018, we voted to expand our Board of Directors to nine (9), and we added Amelia A. Huntington to fill the final remaining vacancy on our Board. Amelia recently served as the CEO of Philips Lighting, Americas. Amelia's experience with  multinational operations is a valuable skill as we expand our operations to Europe. We are excited to add her to our Board.   Looking Ahead   Supported by strong demographics and an outstanding management team, we remain confident in the future of your Company. This confidence was manifested in the recent  announcement that Thor entered into a contract to acquire the Erwin Hymer Group, Europe's leading RV manufacturer. With production facilities in Germany, Italy, and the U.K. and a market presence throughout Europe and North America, the Erwin  Hymer Group is comprised of a well-recognized, respected and established family of brands. Our team has evaluated opportunities in Europe for years, but remained patient for the right opportunity. Acquisition of the Erwin Hymer Group was that  opportunity. Immediately accretive, this acquisition will offer opportunities for synergistic value for decades to come.   As we look ahead, we remain confident in the future of Thor Industries and thank  you--our Shareholders--for the trust and confidence that each of you place in Thor, and we hope to see you at the Meeting.

                              Alignment of Pay and Performance   Alignment of pay to performance was an essential strategy implemented by our founders when they founded the company in 1980. In Fiscal Year 2018, Thor remained true to  this strategy and its compensation plan. Our plan relies heavily upon variable performance-based incentives calculated upon the Companys net income before tax (NBT), resulting in a strong linkage between pay and financial  performance. We believe our plan, while different, is time-tested, proven, simple, and transparent. We remain confident it drives performance and aligns NEO pay with our return to Shareholders better than alternative plans over time.   In Fiscal Year 2018, a predominant percentage of our CEO and other Named Executive Officer  (NEO) compensation was variable incentive pay as demonstrated by the accompanying charts.   Key Compensation Actions Taken in Fiscal Year 2018·   No increase in base salary and we  lowered the cash incentive compensation metric and raised the equity incentive metric for our NEOs, including our CEO, Robert W. Martin to increase the amount of compensation paid in equity creating better alignment with shareholders.·   Continued use of a compensation advisory firm, Willis Towers Watson, for benchmarking.

Voting Instructions and Information 
General Information About our Annual Meeting 
A copy of this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 ("Fiscal Year 2018"), will be sent to any Shareholder who requests a copy through any of the following methods: 
The Annual Report is not to be considered a part of this proxy soliciting material. 
Who Can Vote 
You are entitled to vote if our records show that you held shares in our Company as of the Record Date, October 15, 2018. At the close of business on that date, 52,806,981 shares of our Common Stock were outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of our Common Stock is entitled to one vote. A list of Shareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available for examination by Shareholders at the Meeting and during regular business hours at the Company's office for ten (10) days prior to the Meeting. 
How to Vote 
In accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), instead of mailing a printed copy of our proxy materials to each Shareholder of record, we may furnish our proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report to Shareholders, by providing access to these documents on the Internet. Generally, Shareholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless they request them. 
If your Common Stock is held through a broker, bank, or other nominee (held in "street name"), you will receive instructions from the entity holding your stock that you must follow in order to have your shares voted. If you want to vote in person, you must obtain a legal proxy from the entity holding your shares and bring it to the Meeting. 
If you hold shares in your own name as a holder of record with our transfer agent, Computershare, you may instruct the proxies how to vote by following the instructions listed on the Notice of Internet 
Availability ("Notice Card") or the proxy card (if printed materials were requested). Of course, you can always come to the Meeting and vote your shares in person. 
Shareholders may vote their shares by proxy in any of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  By Internet: You may vote by internet 24 hours a day through 11:59 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, December 13, 2018,  by following the instructions listed on the Notice Card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  By Telephone: You may vote by telephone 24 hours a day through 11:59 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, December 13,  2018, by following the instructions listed on the Notice Card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  By Mail: You may vote by mail only if you request and receive a paper copy of the proxy materials and proxy card. You  may request proxy materials by following the instructions listed on the Notice Card. You may then vote by completing, signing, dating, and returning a proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  At the Meeting: You may attend the Meeting and vote in person.  
[END TABLE]
A proxy submitted by mail that is properly executed and timely returned to our Company that is not revoked prior to the Meeting will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If no instructions are given with respect to the proposal to be voted upon at the Meeting, proxies will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our Board of Directors on such proposals. You may revoke your proxy at any time until exercised by giving written notice to the Secretary of our Company, by voting in person at the Meeting, or by timely submitting a later-dated proxy by mail, internet, or telephone. At our Meeting, a representative of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will tabulate the votes and act as the inspector of election. 
How Votes are Counted 
A quorum is required to transact business at our Meeting. 
Shareholders of record constituting a majority of the shares entitled to cast votes shall constitute a quorum. If you have returned valid proxy instructions or attend the Meeting in person, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether there is a quorum, even if you abstain from voting on some or all matters  
[BEGIN TABLE]
 voted upon at the Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be treated as present for purposes of  determining whether a quorum is present.   Voting   Your vote may be (i) "for" or "withhold" on the proposal relating to the  election of Directors, and (ii) "for", "against", or "abstain" on each of the other proposals. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast is required to approve each proposal other than the proposal to  declassify the Board of Directors. With respect to director elections, our Amended and Restated By-Laws ("By-Laws") require each nominee for election as a  director to resign from the Board upon failing to receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election, contingent upon the acceptance of the proffered resignation by the Board, with the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate  Governance Committee of the Board. Under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the shares of the Company entitled to vote generally for the election of Directors, voting  together as a single class, is required to approve the proposal to declassify the Board of Directors. Broker non-votes and abstentions will not impact the outcome of the vote on the proposals related to the election of Directors, ratification of the  appointment of our independent registered accounting firm and the advisory vote to approve NEO compensation, as they are not counted as votes cast, but will have the same effect as votes against the proposal to declassify our Board of Directors. It  is important to be aware that if you hold shares in street name with a broker, bank, or other nominee, and you do not submit voting instructions, then your broker, bank, or nominee will not be permitted to vote your shares in its discretion on any  of the matters set for vote at our Meeting other than Proposal 2 relating to the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, which is considered a routine matter.    Cost of Proxy Solicitation   The cost of solicitation is being borne by our Company.

Thor Industries, Inc.   |   Notice of 2018 Annual Meeting & Proxy Statement        19  Board of Directors: 
Structure, Committees and Corporate Governance 
Good corporate governance is the foundation upon which our Company operates. The process of good corporate governance is dynamic, requiring constant vigilance and evaluation to determine and implement those governance practices that are best-suited to provide integrity and transparency in and to our business. At Thor, our Board and management are dedicated to the process of constant evaluation and active implementation of appropriate governance processes, practices, and policies. 
Corporate Governance 
Thor's Board-adopted Governance Guidelines serve as the framework for consistently effective governance of the Company. The Guidelines are regularly reviewed and updated and are available for review on our website, www.thorindustries.com. 
Board Selection Process 
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee screens candidates and recommends nominees to the full Board. Our By-Laws provide that our Board may set the number of Directors at no fewer than one (1) and no more than fifteen (15). Our Board currently consists of nine (9) Directors who are divided into three (3) classes, but if our Shareholders approve the proposal to declassify the Board at the 2018 Annual Meeting, each Director will stand for election each year, commencing with our 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has relied upon board search firms in identifying suitable candidates. During this process, the Board engages in an evaluation of a widely-diverse set of candidates. In Fiscal Year 2017, our Board adopted a diversity policy, requiring the initial list of prospective candidates to include qualified candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity, and gender. An important consideration in our prospective Board member evaluation includes his or her obligation to their primary company and/or to other boards that would detract from their obligation to fully serve on our Board. Further, the Committee will consider Shareholder nominations of candidates for our Board on the same basis as Board-identified candidates, provided that any such nominee possesses the requisite business, management, and educational experience. 
Proxy Access 
Our By-Laws allow a group of up to twenty (20) Shareholders who have owned at least 3% of our outstanding shares for a period of at least three (3) years to nominate up to two (2) directors or 25% of the seats up for election, whichever is greater, and include those nominations in our Proxy Statement. 
Board Structure And Leadership 
Our Board structure consists of an Executive Chairman, our founder Peter B. Orthwein, and an Independent Lead Director, Jan Suwinski. Our Board is also led by strong Committee chairs, Messrs. Graves (Compensation and Development), Kosowsky (Nominating and Corporate Governance), and Ziemer (Audit). 
Our Board has three Committees with the principal functions described below. The charters of each of these Committees are posted on our website at www.thorindustries.com and are available in print to any Shareholder who requests them.

Board of Directors: 
Structure, Committees and Corporate Governance 
Director Independence 
Two of our nine Directors are employed by our Company (Messrs. Orthwein and Martin). With the exception of these two individuals, our Board is comprised entirely of "independent" Directors as that term is defined by both NYSE listing standards and our own Governance Guidelines. The Board conducts an annual review to determine the continued "independence" of all of our independent Directors (currently, Messrs. Suwinski, Ziemer, Graves, Kosowsky, Klein, Jones, and Ms. Huntington). 
Independent Director Meetings 
Thor's independent Directors, as an entire body or part thereof, meet in executive session at the conclusion of each Audit Committee meeting and Compensation and Development Committee meeting as well as upon the conclusion of each Board meeting. 
Director Attendance 
During our Fiscal Year 2018, the Board of Directors held ten (10) meetings. In the aggregate, the Directors attended 99% of the total meetings of the full Board. No Director attended less than 90% of the combined total meetings of the full Board and the Committees on which the Director served during this past year. All of the members of the Board are encouraged, but not required, to attend the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders. All of those who were members of the Board at the time of the 2017 Annual Meeting attended the Meeting.

Each year, our Board conducts evaluations of each Committee and the Board as a whole. This process includes evaluation of the individual members of the Committees and the Board. The evaluation includes a process of dynamic feedback designed to identify areas of increased focus. 
Board Risk Oversight 
At both the full Board and Committee level, a primary function of our Board of Directors is to oversee the Company's risk profile and the processes established by management for managing risk. Our Board and its Committees regularly evaluate these risks and the mitigation strategies employed by management. In general terms, our Committees oversee the following risks: 
Audit Committee All risks related to financial controls, including all applicable legal, regulatory, and compliance risks, as well as the overall risk management governance structure, including evaluating and responding to the assessments of both our internal audit department and our external auditors. 
Compensation and Development Committee All risks associated with the design and elements of our compensation program and related compliance issues, and all risks associated with the process of developing our people and succession planning. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee All risks within the scope of the Company's governance programs and applicable compliance issues. 
In performing its oversight responsibilities, the Board relies, in part, upon the results and information gained through the Company's Enterprise Risk Management Program, and considers the program for amendment, as appropriate. The program is designed to ensure appropriate risk monitoring of, and controls over, risks associated with our business. Risks evaluated through the program include, but are not limited to, strategy, acquisitions integration, legal, compliance, human resources, mergers & acquisitions, IT & cyber security, operations, and finance risks. 
The Board receives regular reports from management regarding the status of its risk management programs, and provides input and direction designed to keep the risk management programs effective against dynamic and ever-evolving risks applicable generally to commercial enterprises and specifically to our Company. 
The Board and management have developed a culture of risk awareness and risk management that includes annual Company-wide ethics training. Through this constant process, the Company gains input from a great number of its employees as it evaluates risks and updates its management plan accordingly. 
Diversity Policy 
In Fiscal Year 2017, our Board formalized a diversity policy that it has followed in recent Board candidate searches. Under the Board's diversity policy, the initial list of candidates to be considered must include qualified candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity, and gender.  Succession Planning 
Our Board is actively engaged and involved in talent management. Our succession plan and talent management programs are reviewed semi-annually with the Compensation and Development Committee, and then reviewed and considered by the full Board. These discussions include an ongoing evaluation of our talent and leadership bench and the succession plan that envisions those individuals' advancement to key positions in our Company. 
In addition, high-potential employees are regularly evaluated and engaged in comprehensive training, both on the job and in the classroom. During Fiscal Year 2016, we instituted a program of executive studies through the University of Notre Dame in which high-potential employees and top-level management participate in a series of comprehensive programs designed to provide further education relevant to their job functions. This program runs annually and provides a mechanism for the advancement of key employees. 
Mandatory Resignation Policy 
In Fiscal Year 2017, our Board implemented a mandatory age-based resignation policy, requiring each Director who is 72 years of age or older to submit his or her resignation for consideration by the Board at our October Board meeting for action at our Annual Meeting. If the Board accepts the Director's resignation at the October Board meeting, the Director's resignation would be effective at the Annual Meeting. 
Shareholder Communications 
We encourage Shareholder communication with the Company. Any communications from interested parties directed toward our Board or independent Directors specifically may be sent to Jan Suwinski, our Lead Independent Director, who forwards to each of the other Board members or independent Directors, as appropriate, any such communications that, in the opinion of Mr. Suwinski, deal with the functions of our Board or the Committees thereof or that he otherwise determines require their attention. Mr. Suwinski's address for this purpose is c/o Thor Industries, Inc., Attention: Corporate Secretary, 601 East Beardsley Avenue, Elkhart, IN 46514. 
Code of Ethics 
We have adopted a written code of ethics, the "Thor Industries, Inc. Business Ethics Policy", which is applicable to all of our Directors, Officers, and employees, including our principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer or Controller, and other Executive Officers identified in this Proxy Statement who perform similar functions (collectively, the "Selected Officers"). Our code of ethics is posted on our website found at www.thorindustries.com and is available in print to any Shareholder who requests it. Each year members of the management teams at each of our subsidiaries, as well as our NEOs, engage in training on our Business Ethics Policy. We intend to disclose any changes in, or waivers from, our code of ethics applicable to any Selected Officer on our website or by filing a Form 8-K with the SEC. 
Our Governance Practices 
Thor is committed to governance principles that are designed to be in the best interest of our Shareholders. Our Board evaluates each governance principle as it uniquely applies to Thor. In some instances, this leads our Board to adopt and/or maintain policies that it deems in the best interest of Thor that may not be fully consistent with the views held by others. These decisions and determinations are not made lightly; instead, great consideration is given to the adoption of principles best suited to Thor's long-term success. Controlling governance principles include:

Proposal 2 
Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee of the Board has selected Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as our independent registered public accounting firm to perform the audits of our financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting for the Fiscal Year ending July 31, 2019. Deloitte was our independent registered public accounting firm for the Fiscal Year ended July 31, 2018. Unless a Shareholder directs otherwise, proxies will be voted FOR the approval of the selection of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm for the Fiscal Year ending July 31, 2019. 
Representatives of Deloitte will be present at the Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to any Shareholder questions that may arise. 
We are asking our Shareholders to ratify the selection of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm. Although ratification is not required, the Board is submitting the selection of Deloitte to our Shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interest of the Company and our Shareholders.

Report of Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee serves as the representative of the Company's Board of Directors for general oversight of the Company's financial accounting and reporting, systems of internal control and audit process, monitoring compliance with laws, regulations, and standards of business conduct. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter, a copy of which is available on our Company's website at www.thorindustries.com and is available in print to any Shareholder who requests it. 
Management of the Company has the primary responsibility for the financial reporting process, including the system of internal control. In Fiscal Year 2018, the Company's internal audit department performed extensive diligence and intensive review of the Company's internal control processes. Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm acting as the Company's independent auditor, is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and an independent audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and issuing reports thereon. 
In carrying out its duties, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the Fiscal Year ended July 31, 2018 with the Company's management and Deloitte. The Audit Committee has also discussed with Deloitte the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16, "Communications with Audit Committees," as amended, as adopted by the PCAOB. In addition, the Audit Committee has received the disclosures from Deloitte required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Deloitte's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with Deloitte its independence from the Company. Based on the foregoing reports and discussions and subject to the limitations on the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee referred to above and in the Charter of the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors has approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year ended July 31, 2018. 
The Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each of the members of the Audit Committee is "independent" as defined under the rules of the NYSE.

The foregoing report of our Audit Committee shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any previous or future documents filed by our Company with the SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we incorporate the report by reference in any such document.  Proposal 3 
Advisory Vote to Approve Compensation of our NEOs 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, provides that the Company's Shareholders have the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules. The Company currently plans to provide this opportunity on an annual basis. Our compensation program for our Named Executive Officers is designed to: (i) closely align compensation with our profitability and performance and thereby with the objectives of long-term holders of our stock; (ii) link compensation to specific, measurable, and long-term value-creating results; and (iii) enable us to attract and retain key executive talent. 
Our Shareholders are asked to approve our compensation program through what is commonly called the "Say on Pay" vote. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the Named Executive Officers and the philosophy, policies, and practices described in this Proxy Statement. The Say on Pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation and Development Committee, or the Board. The Board and the Committee will review the voting results and consider them, along with any specific insight gained from Shareholders of the Company and other information relating to the Shareholder vote on this proposal, when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
Through your vote of approval, we ask that you endorse the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including disclosures in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the compensation tables, and any related material disclosed in this Proxy Statement, is hereby APPROVED.

Proposal 4 
Vote on Declassification of our Board of Directors 
Since its inception, Thor has operated with a classified Board of Directors. Through its process of evaluation of good governance practices and upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board of Directors adopted, subject to shareholder approval, amendments to Article Seven of the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effectuate the declassification of the Board following the 2018 Annual Meeting (the "Declassification Amendments"). 
Currently, the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation divides Board members into three (3) classes, with the directors in each class being elected for a three-year term. The term of the three classes is staggered so that only one class of directors is nominated for election at any one annual meeting. The Board has periodically considered the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining a classified board structure and concluded that this structure was in the best interests of the Company and our Shareholders at such times. There are valid arguments in favor of and in opposition to a classified board structure. Proponents of a classified board structure believe it provides increased board stability, improved long-term planning and an enhanced ability to protect Shareholder value in a potential takeover and to resist potentially unfair and abusive takeover tactics. On the other hand, the Board believes that corporate governance standards have evolved and that many investors and commentators now believe that the election of directors is the primary means for shareholders to influence corporate governance policies and increase the Board's and management's accountability to shareholders. Annual elections of directors will provide our Shareholders with the opportunity to register their views on the performance of the entire Board each year.

 The Board of Directors recommends that the Shareholders vote to DECLASSIFY the Board of Directors.   
[END TABLE]
To facilitate the declassification of the Board in a timely manner (following approval of the Declassification Amendments by the Shareholders), each current member of the Board, including the Class C director nominees nominated by the Board in this Proxy Statement for election at the 2018 Annual Meeting should they be elected at the Annual Meeting, has committed to tender his or her resignation following the 2018 Annual Meeting if he or she is a member of the Board at that time, and each such director will subsequently be reappointed to the declassified Board by the remaining members of the Board such that each member of the Board will serve a one-year term following the 2018 Annual Meeting and stand for election annually, beginning at the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting. 
The text of the proposed amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is attached hereto as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement, with additions marked with bolded text and deletions indicated by strike-outs. If approved at the Annual Meeting, we will file a Certificate of Amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation reflecting such amendments with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as soon as practicable after the Annual Meeting. The Board has approved corresponding changes to the By-Laws of the Company, which are subject to and contingent upon receipt of Shareholder approval of the proposed amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and which would become effective as of the effectiveness of the amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. 
Through your vote of approval, we ask that you endorse the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the Shareholders determine that the Company's Articles of Incorporation should be amended to provide that the Company's Board of Directors shall be declassified and that each Director shall stand for election each year, commencing with the 2019 Annual Meeting.

 Our Compensation Philosophy: 
Tying Pay to Performance 
We Are Different 
Since our inception, we have utilized a pay plan established by our founders in 1980 to tie pay directly to financial performance. Today, the ideas upon which they established our pay philosophy remain as the guiding principles upon which our compensation plan operates today. The plan calls for a base salary plus an opportunity to earn cash incentive-based awards under our Management Incentive Plan ("MIP") and our Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTI"), which awards Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") that vest over three (3) years. Both the MIP and LTI awards are based on a single metric, Thor's net income before taxes ("NBT"). Our continued use of this single metric system (discussed in greater detail below) reinforces the idea that simplicity and transparency are hallmarks of our program. While our program is an outlier from the multi-factored, multi-tiered programs preferred by proxy advisory firms that are utilized by many publicly-traded companies, we believe it is time-tested to deliver results to our Shareholders by helping us attract and retain essential talent in our people-driven industry. It is also time-tested to closely align our pay with our financial performance. Our Compensation and Development Committee tailors the plan so that the targeted amount of compensation paid under our plan aligns well with benchmarking from companies in our compensation peer group and, in a broader sense, with companies from similar industries that are our approximate size. 
Because we believe our pay philosophy has driven, and continues to drive, results over time for our Shareholders, we are reticent to change it in the absence of compelling evidence relevant to our specific situation that a change would somehow be better for our Shareholders. Our Compensation and Development Committee, our entire Board, and our management team take evaluation of our compensation program very seriously. However, adjusting our plan simply to conform to what other public companies do will never be an option for us. A tried and true system that we believe has proven its ability to drive results for our Shareholders and to align well with Shareholder return is not one that should be altered lightly even when the more generally-accepted practice is to utilize a multi-factored program. Unless and until a program design change promises to better align our compensation with the interests of our Shareholders, neither the Compensation and Development Committee nor management is compelled to make a change solely to fall in line with current popular practices that may work well for other publicly-traded companies that exist in more typical commercial environments. That said, we recognize the value of the proxy advisory firms service and constantly evaluate the outputs from our program to ensure that the compensation paid fall within benchmarked ranges of compensation for our NEOs. If our plan resulted in compensation that exceeded benchmarks, we would quickly consider revisions to ensure that the compensation paid under our plan remained within acceptable ranges. 
As we have consistently reported to you, our industry is unique. Our industry is defined by its geographic centricity which poses a constant threat to our most valuable asset, our people. Our pay plan is a valuable tool in our effort to attract and retain key talent. Were Thor to lose key managers, it would certainly not be in the best interests of our Shareholders in either the short-term or the long-term. Given the ongoing threat to our talent created by the geographic centricity of our industry, it is essential that our pay plan be simple and transparent. We believe complicated pay structures that are seemingly ever-shifting in design fail to offer the consistency and transparency that we must have to retain our key talent and have contributed to the demise of what were great competitors, proving the crucial importance of a simple, fair compensation plan to sustained success in our industry. We further believe that history has proven our pay plan's ability to deliver results to our Shareholders, and that the future success of the Company depends, in many ways, on maintaining simple, transparent compensation practices. 
Aside from the adjustment to MIP and LTI, which were designed to have more paid in equity and less in cash, the Compensation Committee implemented no change to the structure of our plan in Fiscal Year 2018. The changes we implemented were designed to lower cash compensation and increase equity compensation but 
Thor Industries, Inc.   |   Notice of 2018 Annual Meeting & Proxy Statement        39 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis to have no net positive increase on the total compensation paid to our NEOs. Any increase in compensation is tied exclusively to increased performance, as measured by our NBT. 
Our evaluation of our pay plan and supporting philosophy is constantly reconsidered in light of current market conditions, so our lack of change to our plan should not be misconstrued as a suggestion that either our Compensation and Development Committee or our management team has not engaged in a thorough evaluation of alternative solutions. As it has done in years past, our Compensation and Development Committee, utilizing the resources and guidance of its consultant, engaged in a thorough and critical assessment of our compensation program and various alternative solutions. Based on that assessment, the Committee again concluded that, at this time, our compensation program effectively aligns with the interests of our Shareholders. 
Our "Say On Pay" vote record establishes that, historically, our 
Shareholder Understanding and Feedback is Important To Us 
During Fiscal Year 2014, we began to solicit input and feedback on our compensation program from our Shareholders. The response to date has been overwhelmingly supportive of our program. We will continue to take advantage of opportunities to do so in the future as Shareholder understanding and feedback is important to us. Our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Todd Woelfer, coordinates these discussions for us. 
Feel free to contact Todd if you have questions or wish to provide feedback about our compensation program. He can be reached at (574) 970-7460 or investors@thorindustries.com. 
Shareholders agree with our philosophy and understand its importance to our future. Last year, 94.3% of Shareholders voted in favor of our NEO compensation plan. Because we always welcome Shareholder input on our compensation program, in Fiscal Year 2014, we established a dedicated Shareholder outreach program. Consistent with our prior "Say On Pay" voting results, we have received overwhelming support from our Shareholders on our unique plan. 
In addition to the "pay for performance" principles first adopted by our founders in 1980, our Compensation and Development Committee is guided by the following practices and principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  Use of Benchmarking. We benchmark our executive compensation levels to our compensation peer group and to  the market generally to ensure that our pay practices are in line with recognized practices of like-sized manufacturing companies.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  Work with Compensation Consultant. In Fiscal Year 2018, the Compensation and Development Committee  utilized Willis Towers Watson as its compensation consultant.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  Seek to Attract and Retain Top Level Talent. The Committee aims for pay practices that are competitive  with industry competitors who are our local competition for talent.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  Align the Pay Plan with Shareholder Interests. The Committee supports a pay plan that places a significant  portion of our executives' pay at risk, making it variable and dependent upon the pre-tax profits of our business.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.  Incentivize Sustained Profitability. The Committee promotes a pay plan that incentivizes our executives to  deliver sustained profitability for our Shareholders within the guidelines of good corporate governance. The three-year vesting schedule for LTI not only helps retain key talent, but also incentivizes management to perform over the long term.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
6.  Identify and Manage Risk. Our Committee evaluates and seeks to minimize risk exposure that is inherent in  any pay for performance plan. A strong "no fault" clawback policy, discussed below, helps mitigate the risk as does diligent review of the process that results in compensation decisions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.  Review and Evaluate Tally Sheets.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
8.  Avoid Change in Control or Post-Employment Obligations for our Top Executives. Our Company does not typically  enter into written employment agreements for severance or for compensation in the event of a change in control.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
9.  Maintain a Simple, Transparent Pay Program and Avoid Any Significant Perquisites for our Executives. Options are  not awarded. Our NEOs get no "other compensation" and/or perqs that are not paid to all of Thor's full-time employees other than an annual physical exam.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
10.  Exercise Limited or No Discretion. Our pay program is designed to award our management team when performance  merits it and to respond appropriately when performance does not. Accordingly, we do not actively revisit the outputs from our program to adjust pay upward or downward. While we have, on very limited occasion, issued unplanned discretionary bonuses  in the circumstances of a limited, not likely to be repeated, outstanding performance, we otherwise do not exercise discretion in awarding compensation to our NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
11.  Maintain a "no fault" clawback policy. Our Board of Directors is required to clawback any  incentive-based compensation paid to any employee within three (3) years of the issuance of any restated financial statement if such restated financial statement impacts the amount of incentive compensation that should have been paid under any  incentive based pay program.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.  Avoid Single Trigger Vesting of Equity-based Awards upon Change in Control. In Fiscal Year 2015, the Board  approved (for implementation in Fiscal Year 2016) a double trigger for all future awards and grants requiring either a corresponding change in employment status or the failure of an acquirer to assume the award before any change in control would  result in the accelerated vesting of such award.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
13.  Prohibit hedging or pledging of Company Securities by our NEOs or Board Members. The Company prohibits our  Executive Officers and members of its Board of Directors from engaging in any hedging transactions, transacting short sales, or pledging any Company stock.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Our NEO Compensation For Fiscal Year 2018 
Base Salary 
Base salaries are part of the compensation package paid to our executives and are determined according to various factors, including benchmarking, experience, talent, contribution, industry standards, expectations, and performance. 
On an annual basis, all employees' base salaries are reviewed for possible adjustments. Adjustments, though, are not automatic. Instead, they are determined in conjunction with available benchmarking data and/or merit-based factors, driven either by exceptional performance or promotion that often is based on experience with our Company. For our executives, the Compensation and Development Committee considers the market practices of our peer group as a guide for recognized ranges of compensation. 
For Fiscal Year 2018, no adjustment to base salaries were made. 
Variable Incentive Compensation 
The variable, performance-based elements comprise the vast majority of our NEOs' compensation. The elements, our MIP and LTI, are determined based on our NBT. For Fiscal Year 2018, our NEOs' compensation was approximately 89% incentive-based pay. Our philosophy promotes heavy reliance on variable performance-based pay. For Fiscal Year 2018, performance metrics were changed to increase the LTI and decrease the MIP with no net increase in total compensation to better align compensation with shareholder interest. 
CASH INCENTIVE AWARDS 
Cash incentive compensation consists of our MIP. We do not adjust or otherwise manipulate earnings in any way. Instead, we report and pay on GAAP earnings. The financial metrics for the performance-based cash incentive compensation for our NEOs are determined prior to our Fiscal Year or within the first portion thereof. The amount of cash incentive compensation for our NEOs is generally calculated and paid on a quarterly basis. 
In Fiscal Year 2018, we lowered our percentage of NBT paid to our NEOs and increased the amount of compensation paid under our LTI, seeking to keep total compensation equal. The result was a decrease in cash compensation offset by an approximately equal amount of equity compensation. 
For Fiscal Year 2018, the incentive formulas for our MIP and cash payouts for our NEOs were as follows:

[END TABLE]
The receipt of the cash incentive compensation is contingent upon the executive being employed with the Company or an operating subsidiary at the time of payment; certification by our Compensation and Development Committee that the amount proposed to be paid under the Plan is consistent with pre-determined formulas; and that there is no cause to consider payment of a lesser amount.  LONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 
Like the MIP, the LTI used Fiscal Year 2018 NBT as the metric to determine the awards earned under the plan. 
The LTI awards RSUs instead of cash. The RSUs earned, based on the metrics below, vest in three (3) equal annual installments beginning on the anniversary date of the grant. Participants must remain employees of our Company or one of its subsidiaries through the vesting period to be entitled to receive the stock that is issued upon vesting of the RSUs. An important tool for talent retention, our LTI program provides that any employee who leaves our Company before the vesting date immediately forfeits their right to receive any and all outstanding unvested RSUs. 
For Fiscal Year 2018, the percentages under the LTI were increased in an amount intended to offset the decrease in the amount of incentive cash compensation paid under our MIP. 
For Fiscal Year 2018, the amount of LTI awards earned for our NEOs were as follows:

Additional Compensation Elements 
Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines 
In Fiscal Year 2013, our Board adopted stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs and our Board. In Fiscal Year 2015, our Board's ownership guideline was increased to three (3) times the Board retainer amount. The guidelines require retention of the following levels of stock: 
Our NEOs and Board of Directors must satisfy the requirement within five (5) years of, in the case of our NEOs, the date of their first LTI award at their current position or, in the case of the Board of Directors, the date of their first annual award. All Board members and NEOs are either in compliance with the guidelines or will be in compliance once the guideline becomes applicable. 
Clawback Policy 
As mentioned above, on a "no fault" basis, our Board of Directors is required to clawback any excess incentive-based compensation paid to any employee within three (3) years of the issuance of any restated financial statement if such restated financial statement impacts the amount of incentive compensation that should have been paid under any incentive-based pay program. 
Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policy 
Our Company prohibits our Executive Officers and members of its Board of Directors from engaging in any hedging transactions, transacting short sales, or pledging any Company stock. 
Severance Plans and Change in Control Agreements 
Our Company does not typically enter into written employment agreements for severance or for compensation in the event of a change in control. Our key employees are important to the Company's long-term success and their value is determined by their efforts to improve our performance. From those efforts, these employees create their own protection in the event of a change in control or employment circumstance. Currently, none of our NEOs has such an agreement with the Company. 
Prior to Fiscal Year 2016, the Thor Industries, Inc., 2010 Equity and Incentive Plan (our "2010 Plan") specified that, upon the occurrence of a change in control, all options and/or restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards will automatically become vested and exercisable in full and all restrictions or conditions, if any, on any restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards would automatically lapse. In Fiscal Year 2015, the Board voted to amend this plan commencing with restricted stock units awarded based on Fiscal Year 2016 results to require a "double trigger" before such shares would vest. The "double trigger" provides that vesting would occur only upon the occurrence of both a Change in Control (as defined in the 2010 Plan) and either a corresponding change in employment status or the failure of an acquirer to assume the awards. This "double trigger" requirement is a key element in the Thor Industries, Inc. 2016 Equity and Incentive Plan that was approved by the Shareholders at our Fiscal Year 2017 Annual Meeting. 
The aggregate value of change in control and termination benefits for each NEO is summarized under the subheading, "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control and Agreements with Resigning Officers" on page 60. 
Tax Deductibility 
Our Compensation and Development Committee's policy is to qualify compensation paid to our NEOs for deductibility for federal income tax purposes to the extent it believes it is practical and in the Company's and Shareholder's best interests. However, to retain highly skilled executives and remain competitive with other employers, our Compensation and Development Committee has the right to authorize compensation that would not be deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code or otherwise. 
Section 409A of the Code 
Our compensation plans and programs are designed to comply with Section 409A of the Code, which places strict restrictions on plans that provide for the deferral of compensation.  How We Make Compensation Decisions and Why We Made Them for Fiscal Year 2018 
The Compensation Committee 
Our Compensation and Development Committee is responsible for the oversight of our compensation plan. Each year, the Compensation and Development Committee engages in a thorough evaluation of the performance of our NEOs. 
The Board of Directors conducts a review of Mr. Orthwein as Executive Chairman and Mr. Martin as CEO. These evaluations are significant factors to the Committee as it determines the base salary and incentive compensation elements of the compensation plans for the Executive Chairman and CEO. It should be noted, however, that Mr. Orthwein's compensation, particularly the LTI component where he receives no award, is intentionally suppressed, despite his outstanding performance, due to his current ownership of a significant amount of Thor stock as a founder. 
Mr. Orthwein and Mr. Martin do not participate in their own performance evaluation or in setting their own compensation. For the other NEOs, the Executive Chairman and CEO evaluate each NEO's individual performance and recommend a tailored compensation plan for that individual to the Compensation and Development Committee. Messrs. Orthwein and Martin work together to conduct such evaluations and develop appropriate recommendations. The Compensation and Development Committee then reviews and votes to approve or modify these recommendations. 
For more information on the Compensation and Development Committee, view our Corporate Governance Section of this Proxy Statement. Additionally, the Compensation and Development Committee's charter can be found on our website at www.thorindustries.com. 
Our Independent Compensation Consultant 
In Fiscal Year 2018, the Compensation and Development Committee utilized Willis Towers Watson as its compensation consultant. Willis Towers Watson reports directly to the Committee, and the Committee is empowered to retain or replace Willis Towers Watson or hire additional consultants at any time. A representative of Willis Towers Watson regularly attends the Committee meetings and provides data and advice to the Committee throughout the year. Additionally, a representative from Willis Towers Watson regularly meets in executive session with the Committee. 
Willis Towers Watson's role is to provide market and peer group data and to advise the Committee on compensation-related decisions. 
During Fiscal Year 2018, the compensation consultant provided the following services to the Committee: 
In Fiscal Year 2018, the total fees and expenses attributable to Willis Towers Watson were $131,561.84. 
Our Compensation Peer Group 
Importantly, Willis Towers Watson assists the Committee in determining an appropriate compensation peer group. Our Company has a unique challenge in its peer review process. With the exception of two competitors who are not reasonable compensation peers due to significant size differences, none of the companies with whom we compete for talent are publicly-traded and, therefore, our competitors do not publicly disclose their compensation practices. Geographic proximity to our competitors makes the competition for key talent an ever-present challenge. Our compensation plans are developed with that fact in mind and are designed to attract and retain industry-leading talent through a program that is reasonable and heavily tied to our Company's financial performance. In Fiscal Year 2018, as it has previously, Thor benchmarked its executive pay against a peer group of publicly-traded companies and used this data in conjunction with 
Thor Industries, Inc.   |   Notice of 2018 Annual Meeting & Proxy Statement        45 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis our own industry-specific knowledge in evaluating its executive compensation practices. The Compensation and Development Committee periodically reviews and, as indicated, updates the peer group. Our general guidelines for our peer group are to include companies that are one-half to two times our revenue; however, our current makeup of peers is slightly more conservative. None of our competitors that fall in that range of revenue publicly disclose their compensation data so none of our competitors are included in this group. However, our peer group represents manufacturing companies of similar size as expressed in sales and market capitalization. Additionally, we sought to identify manufacturing firms that introduce their products to market through dealerships or franchises. Beyond these factors, however, there is no true basis for comparison between Thor and these companies. While the compensation peer group is not comprised of our market competitors, it nevertheless provides a somewhat meaningful basis for market comparison of our executive compensation packages. We believe the peer group below represents as good a comparator group as can currently be found for our Company. Our peer group for Fiscal Year 2018 consisted of the following companies: 
Peer Group for FY 2018 
AGCO Corporation 
American Axle Manufacturing, Inc. 
BorgWarner, Inc. 
Brunswick Corporation 
Dover Corporation 
Flowserve Corporation 
Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. 
Harley-Davidson, Inc. 
Oshkosh Corporation 
Owens Corning 
Parker-Hannifin Corporation 
Pentair PLC 
Polaris Industries, Inc. 
Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. 
Tenneco, Inc. 
Textron, Inc. 
While our stock had a disappointing year in Fiscal Year 2018 given our record numbers, when compared to our peer group over the last five (5) years, we have performed very well. The chart below depicts our stock versus the average stock performance of our peer group over the last five (5) years. Our stock has grown at nearly double the rate of our peer group average. 
In evaluating the competitiveness and reasonableness of our executive compensation practices, we analyze the peer group's compensation data as reported in their most recent proxy statements. In this process, we measure actual pay data with comparable NEOs and the aggregate NEO compensation. We also evaluate the fixed and incentive-based variables of our compensation program as compared to the peer group. This information is then presented to the Committee for its consideration as it determines the appropriate compensation of our NEOs. While the Company reviews the compensation information of its peer group, generally, it does not aim to meet any particular benchmark figure.  Measuring the Alignment: Evaluating the Relationship Between Our Fiscal Year 2018 Performance and Our Compensation 
As noted above, our founders developed a pay strategy that was specifically intended to align pay with Company financial performance, which, over the long-term, aligns the pay with our Shareholders. In application, we believe this philosophy has worked exceedingly well. Fiscal Year 2018 posed a great test for our compensation plan as it was a year of record profit, yet because of several factors that primarily affected the second half of our year, our stock price ended the year lower than where it began. Our Fiscal Year 2018 results include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Company record total sales of $8.33 billion, up 14.9% from Fiscal Year 2017's prior record level;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Record high net income of $430 million, up 14.9% from Fiscal Year 2017's prior record level;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Towable RV sales up 17.2% over Fiscal Year 2017;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Motorized RV sales up 8.9% over Fiscal Year 2017;

• Three-year TSR of over 21%; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Record diluted earnings per share of $8.14, up 14.8% from Fiscal Year 2017's prior record level.   
[END TABLE]
The success of our philosophy is demonstrated by the relationship between Company performance and NEO compensation. The chart below compares the percentage growth of our CEO's compensation to the percentage growth of our net income before taxes and our growth in EPS for Fiscal Year 2018. In Fiscal Year 2018, earnings before tax increased by 13.8%, and EPS grew by 14.8%. While our CEO's compensation increased by 13.0%. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       While Fiscal Year 2018's TSR was disappointing to us, the year offered a great test to our compensation plan. Despite the negative TSR for the  year, our strong performance over the longer term supports the total compensation paid to our CEO. As we have indicated in the past, the evaluation of our plan is ongoing, and we provide periodic stress testing of our plan to ensure that it will  pass the proxy advisory firm's metric testing. Fiscal Year 2018 posed a great stress test for the plan, and it passed.   Application of our compensation philosophy results in NEO compensation that is heavily determined by variable incentive-based pay. The following graphs depict the  relative breakdown between base salary and variable incentive pay as reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 53.

Identification of Median Employee 
We selected June 30, 2018, as the date on which to determine our median employee. As of that date, the Company had approximately 16,300 employees. For purposes of identifying the median employee, we used taxable (W-2) fiscal year-to-date compensation. Using this methodology, we determined that our median employee was a full-time, hourly direct labor employee. In determining the annual total compensation of the median employee for Fiscal Year 2018, we calculated the employee's compensation in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K as required by the SEC's executive compensation disclosure rules, which calculation included the median employee's base pay, overtime pay, and bonus compensation. We performed this calculation in the same manner used to determine Mr. Martin's total compensation, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table. 
The pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by us, as the method, assumptions, adjustments or estimates used to calculate the median employee may be different from the method used by us. In addition, other companies may have different employment and compensation practices than we do.

 Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
For Fiscal Year 2018, the Compensation and Development Committee was comprised entirely of the four (4) independent Directors listed on page 49. No member of the Compensation and Development Committee is a current or, during our Fiscal Year 2018 or any time before, was a former officer or employee of the Company or any of its operating subsidiaries. During Fiscal Year 2018, no member of the Compensation and Development Committee had a relationship that must be described under SEC rules relating to disclosure of related person transactions. In Fiscal Year 2018, none of our Executive Officers served on the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that had one or more of its executive officers serving on the Board or the Compensation and Development Committee of the Company. 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
As our Compensation and Development Committee evaluates our compensation programs, it considers many areas of risk potentially associated with the various programs as well as steps that can be taken to mitigate those risks. This process includes consideration of many factors, including: 
Management and the Compensation and Development Committee will continue to regularly evaluate the risks associated with our compensation programs and will consider changes necessary to prevent incentives to take excessive risk. As a result of our most recent evaluation, we do not believe that our compensation programs created risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. To the contrary, we believe that the programs promote sound business judgment and align employee performance with the realization of the Company's strategic plan and maximization of Shareholder value.

Summary of Equity Compensation Plans 
Thor Industries, Inc. 2016 and 2010 Equity and Incentive Plans 
Our 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2016 Plan") and our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan" and together with the 2016 Plan the "Equity Plans") are each designed to enable us to obtain and retain the services of the types of employees and Directors who will contribute to our long-range success and to provide incentives that are linked directly to increases in share value, which will inure to the benefit of our Shareholders. The maximum number of shares issuable under each of the Equity Plans is 2,000,000 (subject to adjustment to reflect certain corporate transactions or changes in our capital structure), with 1,669,452 and 1,211,385 shares remaining available to be granted under the 2016 Plan and the 2010 Plan, respectively, subject to recycling provisions in the Equity Plans for canceled, forfeited, or expired shares. 
ADMINISTRATION 
The Equity Plans are administered by the Compensation and Development Committee (our "Committee"). Among other responsibilities, the Committee selects participants from among the eligible individuals, determines the number of shares of Common Stock that will be subject to each award, and prescribes the terms and conditions of each award, including without limitation the exercise price, methods of payment, vesting provisions, and restrictions on awards. 
ELIGIBILITY 
Our employees and Directors and those of our affiliated companies (employees of affiliated companies only with respect to the 2010 Plan), as well as those whom we reasonably expect to become our employees and Directors or those of our affiliated companies (employees of affiliated companies only with respect to the 2010 Plan), are eligible to receive awards. 
AVAILABLE EQUITY AWARDS 
STOCK OPTIONS 
Under each of our Equity Plans, the Committee may grant incentive and nonstatutory stock options. The exercise price of an incentive or nonstatutory stock option must generally be at least 100% (and in the case of an incentive stock option granted to a more than 10% Shareholder, 110%) of the fair market value of the Common Stock subject to that option on the date that option is granted. The Committee determines the rate at which options vest (provided options granted under the 2016 Plan may vest only after the expiration of a minimum one-year period from the date of the award) and any other conditions with respect to exercise of the options, in each case subject to the terms of the applicable Equity Plan. Only employees may be granted incentive stock options. 
RESTRICTED AWARDS AND PERFORMANCE COMPENSATION AWARDS 
Our Committee may award actual shares of our Common Stock ("Restricted Stock") or hypothetical Common Stock units having a value equal to the fair market value of an identical number of shares of our Common Stock and paid in the form of shares of Common Stock or cash ("Restricted Stock Units"). The Committee may generally determine, in its sole discretion, the terms of each award, including the applicable restricted period prior to delivery or settlement of the award. Participants generally have the rights and privileges of a stockholder as to Restricted Stock, including the right to vote such Restricted Stock and the right to receive dividends; provided, that, any cash dividends and stock dividends with respect to the Restricted Stock are withheld by the Company for the participant's account, and not paid by the Company unless and until the restrictions on the Restricted Stock have lapsed. Participants have no voting rights with respect to any Restricted Stock Units. At the discretion of the Committee, each Restricted Stock Unit may be credited with cash and stock dividends paid by the Company in respect of one share of Common Stock. Such dividend equivalents are held by the Company for the participant's account, and not paid by the Company unless and until the restrictions on the Restricted Stock Units have lapsed. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit awards may be subject to forfeiture.  
Thor Industries, Inc.   |   Notice of 2018 Annual Meeting & Proxy Statement        55 
Executive Compensation 
Generally Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may not be sold or transferred during the restricted period. The Committee may provide for an acceleration of vesting in the terms of any restricted award. 
Under each of our Equity Plans, the Committee may designate relevant awards as performance compensation. Performance compensation awards entitle the recipients to receive Common Stock or hypothetical common share units upon the attainment of specified performance goals. Cash bonuses may also be designated as performance compensation awards. 
STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS 
The Committee may, in its discretion, grant stock appreciation rights to participants under our Equity Plans. Generally, stock appreciation rights permit a participant to exercise the right and receive a payment equal to the value of our Common Stock's appreciation over a span of time in excess of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of grant of the stock appreciation right. 
ADJUSTMENTS IN CAPITALIZATION 
If there is a specified type of change in our Common Stock, such as stock or extraordinary cash dividends, stock splits, reverse stock splits, recapitalizations, reorganizations, mergers, consolidations, combinations, exchanges, or other relevant changes in capitalization, appropriate equitable adjustments or substitutions will generally be made to the various limits under, and the share terms of, the Equity Plans and the awards granted thereunder. In addition, in the event of certain mergers, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or our reorganization or liquidation, the Committee may cancel outstanding awards and cause participants to receive, in cash, stock, or a combination thereof, the value of the awards. 
AMENDMENTS 
Our Board of Directors may amend, suspend, or terminate the Equity Plans or awards thereunder at any time, provided that amendments to the Equity Plans will not be effective without Shareholder approval if such approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange requirements and amendments to awards without participant approval generally may not impair the participant's rights under the award. In addition, under the terms of the 2016 Plan, the Company generally may only reduce the exercise price of an option or stock appreciation right, or cancel outstanding option and stock appreciation rights in exchange for cash, other awards or options or stock appreciation rights with a lower exercise price, with Shareholder approval. 
CHANGE IN CONTROL UNDER THE 2016 PLAN 
Subject to the terms of an award agreement, in the event of a change in control, as defined in the 2016 Plan, (i) any and all outstanding options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2016 Plan shall become immediately exercisable unless such awards are assumed, converted, replaced, or continued by the continuing entity; provided, however, that in the event of a participant's termination of employment without cause or resignation for good reason within twenty-four (24) months following consummation of a change in control, any awards so assumed, converted, replaced, or continued will become immediately exercisable; (ii) any restriction imposed on a restricted award or performance compensation award shall lapse unless such awards are assumed, converted, replaced, or continued by the continuing entity; provided, however, that in the event of a participant's termination of employment without cause or resignation for good reason within twenty-four (24) months following consummation of a change in control, the restrictions on any awards so assumed, converted, replaced, or continued shall lapse; and (iii) the portion of any and all performance compensation awards that remain outstanding following the occurrence of a change in control shall be determined by applying actual performance from the beginning of the performance period through the date of the change in control using the performance formula to determine the amount of the payout or distribution rounded to the nearest whole share of Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the change in control occurs prior to the end of a performance period for an award, the performance formula shall generally be adjusted to take into account the shorter period of time available to achieve the performance goals. 
The portion of an award that remains outstanding following the occurrence of a change in control shall vest in full at the end of  the performance period set forth in such award so long as the participant's employment (or if the participant is a Director, service) with the Company or one of its subsidiaries does not terminate until the end of the performance period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such portion shall vest in full upon the earliest to occur of the following events: (i) the termination of the participant by the Company without cause, (ii) the refusal of the continuing entity to assume, convert, replace, or continue the award, or (iii) the resignation of the participant for good reason. 
"Cause" as used in the 2016 Plan generally means the employee has committed or pled guilty to a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude, has engaged in conduct likely to result in harm to the Company's reputation, has been grossly negligent, has engaged in willful misconduct with respect to the Company, or violated federal or state securities laws. "Good reason" as used in the 2016 Plan generally means a diminution of the participant's duties or authority, any relocation of more than 50 miles, or a material reduction in salary. 
CHANGE IN CONTROL UNDER THE 2010 PLAN 
In Fiscal Year 2015, the Board voted to amend the 2010 Plan commencing with Fiscal Year 2016 to require a "double trigger" requiring either a corresponding change in employment status or the failure of an acquirer to assume the award before any change in control would result in the accelerated vesting of an award. This change applies to grants made under the 2010 Plan in Fiscal Year 2016 and after. Grants outstanding before the Board approved this change would be treated as follows: 
In the event of a change in control, as defined in the 2010 Plan, and regardless of whether in combination with another event such as a termination of the applicable participant's service by the Company without cause, unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, all options and stock appreciation rights will become immediately exercisable with respect to 100% of the shares subject to such option or stock appreciation rights, and the restrictions will expire immediately with respect to 100% of such shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units subject to such award (including a waiver of any applicable performance goals). 
In addition, unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, all incomplete performance periods in respect of a performance compensation award will end upon a change in control, and the Committee will (a) determine the extent to which performance goals with respect to each such performance period have been met, and (b) cause to be paid to the applicable participant partial or full performance compensation awards with respect to performance goals for each such performance period based upon our Committee's determination of the degree of attainment of performance goals or assuming that applicable "target" levels of performance have been attained or on such other basis as determined by our Committee. Further, in the event of a change in control, the Committee may in its discretion and upon advance notice to the affected persons, cancel any outstanding awards and pay to the holders thereof, in cash or stock, or any combination thereof, the value of such awards based upon the price per share of our Common Stock received or to be received by other Shareholders of the Company.

Thor Industries, Inc.   |   Notice of 2018 Annual Meeting & Proxy Statement        59 
Executive Compensation 
Summary of Deferred Compensation Plan 
On December 9, 2008, our Board approved and adopted the amended and restated Thor Industries, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (our "Deferred Compensation Plan"), which was amended and restated primarily to comply with Section 409A of the Code. The general purpose of our Deferred Compensation Plan is to provide our eligible employees with the benefits of an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation program. 
Under our Deferred Compensation Plan, participants may elect to defer portions of their salary and bonus amounts. The amounts are credited to the participant's individual account, which is credited with earnings and losses based on the performance of certain investment funds selected by us and elected by the participant. 
Participants are vested in their elective deferrals at all times. Vested benefits become payable under our Deferred Compensation Plan (i) upon the participant's separation from service, (ii) upon the occurrence of a change in control, (iii) upon the participant's death or disability, or (iv) in connection with a severe financial hardship due to an unforeseen emergency (but in this case amounts payable are limited to the amount necessary to satisfy the emergency plus anticipated taxes). In each case, payment will be made within ninety (90) days following the event triggering the payment unless the participant is determined by our Board to be a specified employee under Section 409A of the Code and the payment trigger is the participant's separation from service, in which case the payment will be delayed for a period of six (6) months. 
At the time the participant makes a deferral election, the participant may elect a lump sum payment or installment payments spreading payment over 2 to 15 years upon separation from service. 
Our Compensation and Development Committee administers our Deferred Compensation Plan. Our Compensation and Development Committee has the ability to modify or terminate the plan, provided that any modification or termination does not adversely affect the rights of any participant or beneficiary as to amounts under the plan. Our Compensation and Development Committee also has the ability to terminate our Deferred Compensation Plan and accelerate the payments of all vested accounts in connection with certain corporate dissolutions or changes in control, provided that the acceleration is permissible under Section 409A of the Code. Our Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control and Agreements with Resigning Officers 
Except for (i) potential payments under our Deferred Compensation Plan and (ii) the previously discussed lapsing of restrictions on certain restricted awards, as of July 31, 2018, there were no potential obligations owed to our NEOs or their beneficiaries under existing plans or arrangements, whether written or unwritten, in the event of a change in control or termination of employment, including because of death, disability, or retirement. 
The Company has no employment or similar agreements with any NEO with provisions regarding severance or change in control benefits. 
Our Deferred Compensation Plan provides for payment of the vested deferred amounts upon termination of employment and following a change in control. Under our Deferred Compensation Plan, if an NEO's employment terminated on or before July 31, 2018, or if the NEO died or became disabled, the entire vested account balance (reported in the "Aggregate Balance at 7/31/18" column of the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation table above) would be paid. A change in control would also trigger payment to the NEO. The Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End table provides the fair value of outstanding restricted units that would have vested upon a change of control and either a corresponding change in employment status or the failure of the acquirer to assume such awards occurring as of July 31, 2018.  Ownership of Common Stock 
The following table sets forth information as of October 15, 2018, with respect to the beneficial ownership, as defined in Rule 13(d) under the Exchange Act, of our Common Stock by: (i) each person known by the Company to beneficially own, as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, 5% or more of the outstanding Common Stock; (ii) each Director of the Company; (iii) each Executive Officer of the Company named in the Summary Compensation Table on page 53; and (iv) all Executive Officers and Directors of the Company as a group. As of October 15, 2018, there were 52,806,981 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding:

Additional Corporate Governance Matters 
Certain Relationships and Transactions with Management 
Our Audit Committee is required to review and approve all related party transactions that are required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. All such related party transactions must also be approved by the disinterested members of our Board if required by Delaware General Corporation Law. Through its review for Fiscal Year 2018 activity, the Audit Committee identified no such transactions. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
The federal securities laws require the filing of certain reports by officers, directors, and beneficial owners of more than ten percent (10%) of our securities with the SEC and the NYSE. Specific due dates have been established and we are required to disclose in this Proxy Statement any failure to file by these dates. Based solely on a review of copies of the filings furnished to us, or written representations that no such filings were required, the Company believes that all filing requirements were satisfied by each of our Officers, Directors, and ten percent (10%) Shareholders during Fiscal Year 2018. 
Shareholder Proposals 
In order to submit Shareholder proposals for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders for inclusion in the Company's Proxy Statement pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8, materials must be received by the Secretary at the Company's principal office, no later than July 3, 2019, provided that if the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders is more than 30 days before or more than 30 days after December 14, 2019, then the deadline will be a reasonable time before the Company makes available its proxy materials. 
Shareholder director nominations for inclusion in the Company's Proxy Statement under the Company's proxy access program must be received by the Secretary at the Company's principal office not before June 3, 2019 or after July 3, 2019, provided, however, that if the date for which the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders is called is more than 30 days before or more than 30 days after December 14, 2019, then notice by the nominating Shareholder to be timely must be received by the Secretary of the Company by the later of the close of business on the date that is 180 days prior to the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of such annual meeting date is first made. 
The Company's By-Laws also establish an advance notice procedure with regard to director nominations and shareholder proposals that are not submitted for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, but that a shareholder instead wishes to present directly at an annual meeting. To properly bring before the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a nomination or other matter the Shareholder wishes to present at the meeting, Shareholder written notification of such matter, must be received by the Secretary at the Company's principal office not before August 22, 2019, or after September 16, 2019, provided that if the date for which the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders is called is more than 30 days before or more than 30 days after December 14, 2019, then notice by the Shareholder to be timely must be received by the Secretary not earlier than the close of business on the 100th day prior to the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and not later than the later of (i) the 75th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or (ii) the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made. 
All Shareholder proposals must comply with all of the requirements of SEC Rule 14a-8 or the Company's By-Laws, as applicable. The Company reserves the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with applicable requirements. 
Other Matters 
Management knows of no other matters that will be presented for consideration at the Meeting. However, if any other matters are properly brought before the Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy to vote the proxy in accordance with their best judgment.
