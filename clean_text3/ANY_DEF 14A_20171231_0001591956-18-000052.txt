PROXY STATEMENT AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CIRCULAR
As at November 28, 2018 
General Information
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Sphere 3D Corp. (the "Company"), is providing these proxy materials to you in connection with the solicitation by and on behalf of the management of the Company of proxies for use at our annual and special meeting of shareholders (the "Meeting"). The Meeting will be held at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel in Toronto International Airport, Terminal 3, Toronto, Ontario L5P 1C4, on Friday, December 28, 2018 at 2:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) or at any adjournment(s) or postponement(s) thereof, for the purposes set forth in the attached Notice of Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders (the "Notice of Meeting"). This proxy statement and management information circular (the "Proxy Statement") summarizes the information that you will need to know to vote in an informed manner.
At the Meeting, the shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the proposals 1 through 3 below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. to consider and, if deemed advisable, to pass an ordinary resolution to elect four directors who will serve until the end of the next annual and special shareholder meeting; 
2. to consider and, if deemed advisable, to pass an ordinary resolution appointing Moss Adams LLP as the Company's auditor who will serve until the end of the next annual and special shareholder meeting; 
3. to consider and, if deemed advisable, to pass an ordinary resolution to amend the Company's 2015 performance incentive plan;  
4. to receive the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2017, including the auditor's report thereon; and 
5. to transact such other business as may properly come before the Meeting or any adjournment thereof. 
[END TABLE]
The Company does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. If any other matters are properly presented at the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof for consideration, however, the holders of the proxies will have discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their best judgment.
The Board recommends you vote "FOR" resolutions to (i) elect the nominated directors, (ii) appoint the auditors, and (iii) amend the 2015 performance incentive plan.
Solicitation of Proxies
Solicitations may be made by mail and supplemented by telephone, internet, or other personal contact by the officers, employees or agents of the Company without special compensation. Pursuant to National Instrument 54-101 - Communication with Beneficial Owners of Securities of a Reporting Issuer ("NI 54-101"), arrangements have been made with clearing agencies, brokerage houses and other financial intermediaries to forward proxy solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of the common shares of the Company. The cost of any such solicitation will be borne by the Company. Voting Rights, Outstanding Shares, Record Date
We will begin mailing this Proxy Statement and the accompanying form of proxy (or voting instruction form) on or about November 28, 2018 to all shareholders of record that are entitled to vote. Each common share that you own entitles you to one vote on all the matters to be voted upon at the Meeting. If you submit a properly executed form of proxy (or voting instruction form) without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be counted as a vote in favor of the proposals. Only shareholders that owned our common shares at the close of business on November 14, 2018, (the "Record Date"), are entitled to vote at the Meeting. On the Record Date, 1,964,019 common shares were outstanding.
Quorum and Required Vote 
The Company's by-laws provide that a quorum at the Meeting shall consist of at least two persons present and holding or representing by proxy not less than 25% of the total number of outstanding common shares having voting rights at the Meeting. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the Meeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the Meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject the Company to additional expense. Once a common share is represented at the Meeting, whether in person or by proxy, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the Meeting and any adjournment of the Meeting. However, if a new record date is set for the adjourned Meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established.
The proposals to (i) elect the nominated directors, (ii) appoint the auditors, and (iii) amend the 2015 performance incentive plan requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shareholders represented in person or by proxy at the Meeting.
Appointment of Proxies
The persons named in the form of proxy are directors and/or officers of the Company. A shareholder has the right to appoint a person (who need not be a shareholder of the Company) to attend and represent such shareholder at the Meeting other than those persons named in the form of proxy. Such right may be exercised by striking out the printed names and inserting such other person's name in the blank space provided in the form of proxy or by completing another proper form of proxy.
If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote in one of three ways:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข attend the Meeting and vote in person; 
โข complete, sign, date and return the enclosed form of proxy; or 
โข vote via the Internet following the instructions included with your form of proxy and outlined below. 
[END TABLE]
If you are a shareholder of record, then you may go to www.voteproxyonline.com to vote your shares via the Internet. The votes represented by this proxy will be generated on the computer screen and you will be prompted to submit or revise your vote as desired.
To be used at the Meeting, proxies must be received by TSX Trust Company not less than 48 hours (excluding Saturday, Sunday and statutory holidays in the province of Ontario) preceding the Meeting or an adjournment or postponement of the Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Chair of the Meeting has the discretion to accept proxies received after such deadline. The time limit for deposit of proxies may be waived or extended by the Chair of the Meeting at his or her discretion, without notice. Proxies may also be deposited with the Chairman of the Meeting prior to the commencement of the Meeting. If a registered shareholder receives more than one proxy form because such shareholder owns shares registered in different names or addresses, each proxy form should be completed and returned. Revocability of Proxies
As a shareholder, once you have submitted your proxy by mail or via the Internet, you may revoke it as to any matter upon which a vote has not already been cast pursuant to the authority conferred by the proxy. You may revoke your proxy in any one of three ways:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข you may grant another proxy marked with a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy) using any of the methods described above (and until the applicable deadline for each method); 
โข you may notify our Secretary in writing that you wish to revoke your proxy before it is voted at the Meeting of any adjournment or postponement thereof; or 
โข you may vote in person at the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
[END TABLE]
Voting of Proxies
A representative from our transfer agent, TSX Trust Company, will tabulate the votes. All common shares represented at the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting by properly executed proxies will be voted and where a choice, including the choice to withhold from voting, with respect to any matter to be acted upon has been specified in the form of proxy, the common shares represented by the proxy will be voted in accordance with such specifications on any ballot that may be called for. If no instruction is given, then the proxy will be voted FOR each of the directors and Proposal No. 2 and Proposal No. 3.
The enclosed form of proxy confers discretionary authority upon the management designees, or other persons named as proxy, with respect to amendments to or variations of matters identified in the Notice of Meeting and any other matters that may properly come before the Meeting. At the date of this Proxy Statement, the Company is not aware of any amendments thereto, or variations thereof, or other matters that may come before the Meeting. In the event that other matters come before the Meeting, then the management designees intend to vote in accordance with the judgment of the management of the Company.
Advice to Non-Registered Shareholders on Voting Their Shares
The information set forth in this section is of significant importance to many shareholders of the Company, as a substantial number of shareholders do not hold their common shares in their own name. Shareholders who do not hold their common shares in their own name (referred to in this Proxy Statement as "Non-Registered Shareholders") should note that only proxies deposited by shareholders whose names appear on the records of the Company as the registered holders of common shares can be recognized and acted upon at the Meeting. If common shares are listed in an account statement provided to a shareholder by a broker, bank, trust company or other intermediary (an "Intermediary") then, in almost all cases, those common shares will not be registered in such shareholder's name on the records of the Company. Such common shares will generally be registered under the name of the nominee of a clearing agency in which such Intermediary participates or, more rarely, in the name of the Intermediary. In Canada, the vast majority of such shares are registered under the name of CDS & Co. (the nominee of CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc.). Common shares of Non-Registered Shareholders can only be voted (for or against resolutions) or withheld from voting upon the instructions of the Non-Registered Shareholder. Without specific instructions, Intermediaries and nominees are prohibited from voting common shares held by Non-Registered Shareholders. Therefore, Non-Registered Shareholders should carefully follow the instructions of their Intermediaries and indicated on the materials provided to them and ensure that instructions respecting the Meeting and the voting of their common shares are communicated to the appropriate person.
Applicable securities legislation requires Intermediaries to seek voting instructions from Non-Registered Shareholders in advance of shareholders' meetings. Every Intermediary has its own mailing procedures and provides its own return instructions to clients, which should be carefully followed by Non-Registered Shareholders in order to ensure that their common shares are voted at the Meeting. If you are a Non-Registered Shareholder, in addition to the Notice of Meeting accompanying this Proxy Statement, you also received, depending on the Intermediary through which your common shares are held, either a voting instruction form which must be completed and returned in accordance with the directions printed on the form (in some cases, the completion of the voting instruction form by telephone, facsimile or over the Internet is  permitted) or a form of proxy which has already been signed or stamped with a facsimile signature of the Intermediary and which is restricted as to the number of Shares beneficially owned by you. Non- Registered Shareholders who receive voting instruction forms, forms of proxy or other voting materials from an Intermediary should complete and return such materials in accordance with the instructions accompanying the materials in order to properly vote their common shares.
Although a Non-Registered Shareholder may not be recognized directly at the Meeting for the purposes of voting common shares not registered in its name, a Non-Registered Shareholder may attend at the Meeting as proxyholder for the registered holder of its common shares and vote such common shares in that capacity. Non-Registered Shareholders who wish to attend the Meeting and vote their common shares as proxyholder for the registered holder of their common shares should carefully follow the instructions of their Intermediaries and indicated on the materials provided to them.
Proxy-related materials in connection with the Meeting are being sent and made available to both registered and Non-Registered Shareholders. If you are a Non-Registered Shareholder, and the issuer or its agent has sent proxy-related materials directly to you, your name and address and information about your holdings of securities, have been obtained in accordance with applicable securities regulatory requirements from your Intermediary. By choosing to send these materials to you directly, the issuer (and not the Intermediary) has assumed responsibility for (i) delivering these materials to you, and (ii) executing your proper voting instructions. Please return your voting instructions as specified in the request for voting instructions.
Adjournments or Postponements 
Although it is not currently expected, the Meeting may be adjourned or postponed for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies. Any adjournment or postponement may be made without notice, other than by an announcement made at the Meeting of the time, date and place of the adjourned or postponed Meeting. 
Voting Shares and Principal Holders Thereof 
The Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares, of which, as of the Record Date, 1,964,019 common shares were issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Meeting on the basis of one vote for each common share held.
All share and per share amounts herein have been adjusted to give effect to the 1-for-8 reverse share consolidation (also known as reverse stock split) of the Company completed on November 5, 2018, which was approved by the Company's shareholders on October 31, 2018.
The holders of common shares of record at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to vote such common shares at the Meeting on the basis of one vote for each common share held.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
General
National Policy 58-201 - Corporate Governance Guidelines and National Instrument 58-101 - Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices ("NI 58-101") set out a series of guidelines for effective corporate governance. The guidelines address matters such as the composition and independence of corporate boards, the functions to be performed by boards and their committees and the effectiveness and education of board members. Each reporting issuer, such as the Company, must disclose on an annual basis and in prescribed form, the corporate governance practices that it has adopted. The following is the Company's required annual disclosure of its corporate governance practices.
Director Independence
The Board has determined that the following current directors are independent within the meaning of NI 58-101 and NI 52-110 and NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2):  Cheemin Bo-Linn, Vivekanand Mahadevan and Duncan McEwan. The Board has determined that Peter Tassiopoulos is not independent because of his position as an officer of the Company (holding the position of Chief Executive Officer). As a result, the Board is currently comprised of three independent directors and a majority of independent directors. 
Chairman of the Board of Directors and Lead Independent Director
Vivekanand Mahadevan acts as lead independent director in order to ensure appropriate leadership for the independent directors. The lead independent director provides a source of Board leadership complementary to that of a Chairman. The primary responsibilities of the lead independent director are to (i) enhance board effectiveness, including by reviewing and approving that appropriate procedures are in place to allow the Board to function independently from management and (ii) act as liaison between the Board and management and amongst directors. The Board believes that this leadership structure provides the appropriate balance of non-management oversight from the board level.
Meetings of Independent Directors
The independent directors on the Board and each of the committees meet regularly without management (including non-independent directors) present as part of Board meetings scheduled in the ordinary course. During the last completed fiscal year of the Company, the Board and the committees met as follows:

Directorships
The Board has a policy of reviewing directorships and committee appointments held by directors in other public companies, ensuring each director is able to fulfill his or her duties and that conflicts of interest are avoided. No directors currently serve on the board of any other public company.
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight and Mandate of the Board
The mandate of the Board is to supervise the management of the business and affairs of the Company with a view to evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether the Company's resources are being managed in a manner consistent with enhancing shareholder value, ethical considerations and corporation social responsibility. Such mandate includes, without limitation, responsibility for risk oversight. While the full Board is charged with ultimate oversight responsibility for risk management, committees of the board also have responsibilities with respect to various aspects of risk management oversight.
The mandate of the Board adopted on March 27, 2015 sets out the key responsibilities of the Board in fulfilling its role. The full text of the Board's mandate is attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. The board's principal responsibilities relate to the stewardship of management and are summarized below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(i) reviews and approves the Company's strategic planning process and periodic capital and operating plans;  
(ii) reviews the Company's human resources policies, including the approval of the compensation of executive officers, and implements succession planning, including appointing, counseling and monitoring the performance of executive officers;  
(iii) with assistance from the Nominating and Governance Committee, adopts and enforces good corporate governance practices; 
(iv) oversees the management of risks and the implementation of internal control;  
(v) established policies and procedures for the disclosure of reliable and timely information to shareholders and other stakeholders, and for the proper communication with shareholders, customers and governments; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(vi) reviews policies and procedures to confirm ethical behaviors of the Company and its employees, monitors compliance with applicable laws and legislation, and satisfies itself as to the integrity of the executive officers and throughout the Company; and with assistance from the Nominating and Governance Committee, assesses the performance of the Board, its committees and each director.  
[END TABLE]
Position Descriptions
The Board has adopted a written position description for the Chairman, which is set out in the Board Mandate attached hereto as Appendix A. The Chairman is principally responsible for overseeing the operations and affairs of the Board. The Board has not developed written position descriptions for the Chief Executive Officer or the Chair of each Board committee. The Board committees each has a written charter which orients the conduct of the Chair of each committee. See "Corporate Governance - Board Committees". The Chief Executive Officer's role and responsibilities are set forth in the Chief Executive Officer's employment agreement, and annual performance metrics and goals are established and approved by the Board and the Compensation Committee.
Orientation and Continuing Education
The Board has not adopted a formal policy on the orientation and continuing education of new and current directors. When a new director is appointed, the Board delegates individual directors the responsibility for providing an orientation and education program for such new director. This may be delivered through informal meetings between the new directors and the Board and senior management, complemented by presentations on the main areas of the Company's business, and on the role of the Board, of the Board's committees and of directors. When required, the Board may arrange for topical seminars to be provided to members of the Board or committees of the Board. Such seminars may be provided by one or more members of the Board and management or by external professionals.
Measures to Encourage Ethical Business Conduct 
The Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Policy (the "Code") to govern the business-related conduct of all employees, officers, directors, agents and contractors of the Company to maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct in corporate affairs. This Code is intended to comply with applicable securities legislation and stock exchange rules. Specifically, the purpose of this Code is (i) to encourage among the Company's representatives a culture of honesty, accountability and mutual respect; (ii) to provide guidance to help the Company's representatives recognize ethical issues; and (iii) to provide mechanisms to support the resolution of ethical issues.
The Board also monitors compliance by requiring directors and officers to declare any conflicts of interest or any other situation that could represent a potential violation of any applicable rules and regulations. When applicable, the Board will receive reports from management regarding any allegations of unethical conduct. The Company has implemented a Whistleblower Policy that includes an employee complaint "hotline" to allow employees to report any ethical or financial/accounting concerns on a confidential or anonymous basis.
The Nominating and Governance Committee regularly reviews the Code, the process for administering the Code and compliance with the Code. Any changes to the codes are considered by the Board for approval. The Code can be found on the Company's website at http://investors.sphere3d.com and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
Nomination of Directors and Officers
During 2017, the Board as a whole was responsible for identifying and evaluating qualified candidates for nomination to the Board. The Company recognizes the importance and benefit of having a Board and executive officers comprised of highly talented and experienced individuals who reflect the diversity of the Company's stakeholders, including its customers and employees and the changing demographics of the communities in which the Company operates. While the Board has not adopted a formal written policy, the Board and the Nominating and Governance Committee will, when identifying candidates to nominate for election to the Board or appoint as executive officers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(i) consider the competency and skills that the Board considers necessary for the Board, as a whole, to possess, the competency and skills that the Board considers each existing director to possess, the competency and skills that each new nominee will bring to the Board, and the ability of each new nominee to devote sufficient time and resources to his or her duties as a director; 
(ii) consider individuals who are highly qualified, based on their talents, experience, functional expertise and personal skills, character and qualities having regarding to the Company's current and future plans and objectives, as well as anticipated regulatory and market developments; 
(iii) consider the level of representation of women on the Board and in executive officer positions along with other markers of diversity when making recommendations for nominees to the Board or for appointment as executive officers and in general with regard to succession planning for the Board and executive officers; and 
(iv) as required, engage qualified independent external advisors to assist the Board in conducting its search for candidates that meet the Board's criteria regarding skills, experience and diversity. 
[END TABLE]
Industry and institutional knowledge along with commitment and expertise are vital to the successful functioning of the Board. Given the nature and size of the Company's business and its industry, the Board has determined that while it is committed to fostering diversity among board members, it would be unduly restrictive and not in the best interests of the Company to adopt specific director term limits. Diversity and Board renewal will be supported through the other mechanisms designed to address the needs of the Company (as described elsewhere in this Proxy Statement) and not through the imposition of arbitrary term limits.
Given the nature and size of the Company's business and its industry, it may be challenging for the Company to identify a qualified pool of candidates that adequately reflects the various diverse characteristics that the Company seeks to promote. The Company has therefore not adopted any specific women representation targets, but will promote its objectives through the initiatives set out in this Proxy Statement with a view to identifying and fostering the development of a suitable pool of candidates for nomination or appointment over time. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, of the four directors serving on the Board, one (25%), namely Dr. Bo-Linn, is a woman. If all four nominees for election as director are elected, one woman (25%) will serve on the Board. Although the Company has not adopted a written policy in this respect, it is conscious of the value of female representation within a group. At this time, one woman holds a position as "executive officer" of the Company, as that term is defined under NI 58-101.
Effective March 21, 2013, the Board established a Nominating and Governance Committee as a standing committee of the Board, the primary function of which is to oversee corporate governance activities as described above. See "Corporate Governance - Assessment of Directors, the Board and Board Committees".
Assessment of Directors, the Board and Board Committees
The Nominating and Governance Committee assesses and provides recommendations on an annual basis to the Board on the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, the committees, and the contribution of individual directors. All directors are free to make suggestions on improvement of the Board's practices at any time and are encouraged to do so. The Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee will also meet regularly with each director to discuss such director's performance and such director's assessment of the Board, the committees' and other directors' performance.
Board Committees
The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee. The mandate, organization, powers and responsibilities of each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee, along with other Corporate Governance documents can be found on the Company's website at http://investors.sphere3d.com. Audit Committee
We have a standing audit committee as defined in Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the primary function of which is to assist the Board in fulfilling its financial oversight responsibilities, which includes monitoring the quality and integrity of the Company's financial statements and the independence and performance of the Company's external auditor, acting as a liaison between the Board and the Company's external auditor, reviewing the financial information that will be publicly disclosed and reviewing all audit processes and the systems of internal controls management that the Board has established.

Each of the members of the Audit Committee is independent and "financially literate" within the meaning of NI 52-110. In addition to being independent under NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2), all members of the Audit Committee must meet the additional independence standards for audit committee members set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act and NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5605(c)(2)(A). The Board of Directors has determined that Dr. Bo-Linn qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. Messrs. Bowman and Ashkin served on the Audit Committee until their resignations from the Board on April 13, 2017 and June 27, 2017, respectively.
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee is a standing committee of the Board, the primary functions of which are to set performance guidelines for and evaluate the performance of the Chief Executive Officer, review and approve the compensation programs for the Chief Executive Officer and the Company's other executive officers and members of senior management (subject, in the case of equity-based compensation, to approval by the Board in accordance with applicable laws), review and make recommendations to the Board with respect to, succession planning, review and administer the Company's long-term incentive plans(s), review and approve other compensation and benefit programs of the Company, and review the Company's general human resources policies with senior management.
The Compensation Committee is comprised of the following directors: Messrs. McEwan (Chair), Mahadevan and Dr. Bo-Linn, all of which are independent as per the definition set forth in NI 52-110. Messrs. Bowman and Ashkin served on the Compensation Committee until their resignations from the Board on April 13, 2017 and June 27, 2017, respectively. Late in 2017, the Compensation Committee retained Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC ("Pearl Meyer") to serve as its independent compensation consultant and provide advice on certain changes to the Company's employment and other arrangements with the named executive officers and other key employees. These changes were approved by the Compensation Committee in December 2017 and are described in detail under "Executive Officer Compensation" below. Except for the consulting services provided to the Compensation Committee, Pearl Meyer did not perform any other services for the Company or its management.
Nominating and Governance Committee 
The Nominating and Governance Committee is a standing committee of the Board, the primary functions of which is to provide the Board with advice and recommendations relating to corporate governance in general, including, without limitation, all matters relating to the stewardship role of the Board in respect of the management of the Company, Board size and composition including the identification of new nominees to the Board and leading the candidate selection process, and orientation of new members, Board compensation, and such procedures as may be necessary to allow the Board to function independently of management.
The Nominating and Governance Committee annually reviews and assesses the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, the effectiveness and membership of the Board committees, and the contribution of the individual directors and makes such recommendations to the Board arising out of such review as it deems appropriate. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee is comprised of the following directors: Messrs. Mahadevan (Chair), Dr. Bo-Linn and Mr. McEwan all of whom are independent as per the definition set forth in NI 52-110. Messrs.

Amendment of the Company's 2015 Performance Incentive Plan 
At the Meeting, shareholders will be asked to approve amendments to the Sphere 3D Corp. 2015 Performance Incentive Plan (the "2015 Plan") as described below. The 2015 Plan was initially approved by the shareholders on June 18, 2015. The proposed amendments to the 2015 Plan, described below, were adopted by the Board on November 19, 2018, subject to shareholder approval. The persons named in the enclosed form of proxy intend to vote FOR the amendment of the 2015 Plan.
The proposed amendments to the 2015 Plan provide that the maximum number of the Company's common shares that may be issued under the 2015 Plan (described below as the "Share Limit") will automatically increase on the first trading day of April 2019 by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) ten percent (10%) of the total number of common shares issued and outstanding on March 31, 2019 or (ii) such number of common shares as may be established by the Board, and will automatically increase on the first trading day in January of each calendar year thereafter during the term of the 2015 Plan (commencing with January 2020) by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) ten percent (10%) of the total number of common shares issued and outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) such number of common shares as may be established by the Board. As of the Record Date, a total of 69,843 shares were subject to outstanding awards granted under the 2015 Plan, and 352,362 shares were then available for new award grants under the 2015 Plan before taking the proposed share increase into account.
The proposed amendments to the 2015 Plan would also eliminate certain provisions that allowed the Company to grant awards under the plan intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code as these provisions are no longer needed in light of recent changes in U.S. tax laws. In addition, the proposed amendments would increase the number of shares that may be issued pursuant to "incentive stock options" (as defined under U.S. tax laws) granted under the 2015 Plan from 38,966 shares to 200,000 shares. (For clarity, any shares issued in respect of incentive stock options granted under the 2015 Plan will also count against the overall share limit for the plan.)
The Company believes that incentives and stock-based awards focus employees on the objective of creating shareholder value and promoting the success of the Company, and that incentive compensation plans like the 2015 Plan are an important attraction, retention and motivation tool for participants in the plan. The Board believes that the number of shares currently available for new award grants under the 2015 Plan does not give the Company sufficient authority and flexibility to adequately provide for future incentives and, accordingly, recommends the proposed amendments and provide for the share limit to be automatically increased each year as described above.
If shareholders do not approve the proposed amendment of the 2015 Plan, the existing share limit and other terms of the 2015 Plan will continue in effect.
Summary Description of the 2015 Performance Incentive Plan
The principal terms of the 2015 Plan are summarized below. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the 2015 Plan, as proposed to be amended, which appears as Appendix C to this Proxy Statement.
Purpose. The purpose of the 2015 Plan is to promote the success of the Company and the interests of our shareholders by providing an additional means for us to attract, motivate, retain and reward selected employees and other eligible persons through the grant of awards. Equity-based awards are also intended to further align the interests of award recipients with that of our shareholders.
Administration. Our Board or one or more committees appointed by our Board (in the manner and on the terms authorized by the Board) administers the 2015 Plan. Any such committee shall be comprised solely of one or more directors or such number of directors as may be required under applicable law. A committee may delegate some or all of its authority to another committee so constituted, to the extent permitted by applicable laws (the appropriate acting body, be it the Board, a committee within its delegated authority, or an officer within his or her delegated authority, is referred to in this proposal as the "Administrator"). Subject to the express provisions of the 2015 Plan and applicable laws, the Administrator has broad authority under the 2015 Plan, including, without limitation, the authority:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข to select eligible participants and determine the type(s) of award(s) that they are to receive; 
โข to grant awards and determine the terms and conditions of awards, including the price (if any) to be paid for the shares or the award and, in the case of share-based awards, the number of shares to be offered or awarded; 
โข to determine any applicable vesting and exercise conditions for awards (including any applicable performance-based vesting or exercisability conditions) and the extent to which such conditions have been satisfied, or determine that no delayed vesting or exercise is required, and to accelerate or extend the vesting or exercisability or extend the term of any or all outstanding awards; 
โข to cancel, modify, or waive the Company's rights with respect to, or modify, discontinue, suspend, or terminate any or all outstanding awards, subject to any required consents; 
โข subject to the other provisions of the 2015 Plan, to make certain adjustments to an outstanding award and to authorize the conversion, succession or substitution of an award; 
โข to determine the method of payment of any purchase price for an award or Company common shares delivered under the 2015 Plan, as well as any tax-related items with respect to an award, which may be in the form of cash, check, or electronic funds transfer, by the delivery of already-owned Company common shares or by a reduction of the number of shares deliverable pursuant to the award, by services rendered by the recipient of the award, by notice and third party payment or cashless exercise on such terms as the Administrator may authorize, or any other form permitted by law; 
โข to modify the terms and conditions of any award, establish sub-plans and agreements and determine different terms and conditions that the Administrator deems necessary or advisable to comply with laws in the countries where the Company or one of its subsidiaries operates or where one or more eligible participants reside or provide services; 
โข to approve the form of any award agreements used under the 2015 Plan; and  
โข to construe and interpret the 2015 Plan, make rules for the administration of the 2015 Plan, and make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2015 Plan. 
[END TABLE]
No Repricing. In no case (except due to an adjustment to reflect a stock split or other event referred to under "Adjustments" below, or any repricing that may be approved by shareholders) will the Administrator (1) amend an outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right to reduce the exercise price or base price of the award, (2) cancel, exchange, or surrender an outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right in exchange for cash or other awards for the purpose of repricing the award, or (3) cancel, exchange, or surrender an outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right in exchange for an option or stock appreciation right with an exercise or base price that is less than the exercise or base price of the original award.
Eligibility. Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2015 Plan include officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, directors of the Company, and certain consultants and advisors to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Currently, approximately 50 officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (including all of the Company's named executive officers), and each of the Company's three non-employee directors, are considered eligible under the 2015 Plan.
Authorized Shares; Limits on Awards. Currently, the maximum number of the Company's common shares that can be issued under the 2015 Plan is equal to the sum of (i) 640,843 shares, plus (ii) the number of any shares subject to stock options granted under our Second Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan (the "Prior Plan") and outstanding as of June 18, 2015 (the date our shareholders approved the 2015 Plan) which expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after June 18, 2015 without being exercised (such total number of shares, the "Share Limit"). As of the Record Date, 4,479 shares had become available for new award grants under the 2015 Plan pursuant to clause (ii) above as a result of the  cancellation or termination of stock options granted under the Prior Plan after June 18, 2015 and on or before the Record Date, and 10,137 shares were then subject to options that remained outstanding under the Prior Plan. No new awards may be granted under the Prior Plan.
If our shareholders approve this 2015 Plan proposal, the Share Limit described above will automatically increase on the first trading day in April 2019 by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) ten percent (10%) of the total number of common shares issued and outstanding on March 31, 2019 or (ii) such number of common shares as may be established by the Board, and will automatically increase on the first trading day in January of each calendar year thereafter during the term of the 2015 Plan (commencing with January 2020), by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) ten percent (10%) of the total number of common shares issued and outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) such number of common shares as may be established by the Board.
The 2015 Plan generally provides that the number of Shares that are then available for new award grants under the plan, as well as the number of Shares subject to then-outstanding awards under the plan and the exercise prices of such awards, will be proportionately adjusted as described below under "Adjustments" in the event of a stock split, reverse stock split or similar event affecting the Shares.
In addition to the Share Limit, the 2015 Plan also provides that the maximum number of shares that may be delivered pursuant to options qualified as incentive stock options granted under the 2015 Plan is 38,966 shares. If our shareholders approve this 2015 Plan proposal, this sub-limit on incentive stock options will be increased to 200,000 shares. (For clarity, any shares issued in respect of incentive stock options granted under the 2015 Plan will also count against the overall Share Limit described above.)
Except as provided in the next sentence, shares that are subject to or underlie awards granted under the 2015 Plan which expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or for any other reason are not paid or delivered under the 2015 Plan shall again be available for subsequent awards under the 2015 Plan. Shares that are exchanged by a participant or withheld by the Company as full or partial payment in connection with any award granted under the 2015 Plan, as well as any shares exchanged by a participant or withheld by the Company or one of its subsidiaries to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any award granted under the 2015 Plan, shall be available for subsequent awards under the 2015 Plan. To the extent that an award granted under the 2015 Plan is settled in cash or a form other than shares, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no such cash or other settlement shall not be counted against the shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan. In the event that shares are delivered in respect of a dividend equivalent right granted under the 2015 Plan, the number of shares actually delivered with respect to the award shall be counted against the share limits of the 2015 Plan. To the extent that shares are delivered pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right or stock option granted under this Plan, the number of shares actually delivered with respect to the award shall be counted against the share limits of the 2015 Plan. (For purposes of clarity, if a stock appreciation right relates to 100,000 shares and is exercised at a time when the payment due to the participant is 15,000 shares, 15,000 shares shall be charged against the Share Limit with respect to such exercise.) In addition, the 2015 Plan generally provides that shares issued in connection with awards that are granted by or become obligations of the Company through the assumption of awards (or in substitution for awards) in connection with an acquisition of another Company will not count against the shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan. The Company may not increase the applicable share limits of the 2015 Plan by repurchasing Company common shares on the market (by using cash received through the exercise of stock options or otherwise).
Types of Awards. The 2015 Plan authorizes stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other forms of awards granted or denominated in the Company's common shares or units of the Company's common shares, as well as cash bonus awards. The 2015 Plan retains flexibility to offer competitive incentives and to tailor benefits to specific needs and circumstances. Any award may be structured to be paid or settled in cash. A stock option is the right to purchase Company common shares at a future date at a specified price per share (the "exercise price"). The per share exercise price of an option generally may not be less than the fair market value of a Company common share on the date of grant. The maximum term of an option is ten years from the date of grant. An option may either be an incentive stock option or a nonqualified stock option. Incentive stock option benefits are taxed differently from nonqualified stock options, as described under "Federal Income Tax Consequences of Awards Under the 2015 Plan" below. Incentive stock options are also subject to more restrictive terms and are limited in amount by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and the 2015 Plan. Incentive stock options may only be granted to employees of the Company or a subsidiary.
A stock appreciation right is the right to receive payment of an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of a Company common share on the date of exercise of the stock appreciation right over the base price of the stock appreciation right. The base price will be established by the Administrator at the time of grant of the stock appreciation right and generally may not be less than the fair market value of a Company common share on the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights may be granted in connection with other awards or independently. The maximum term of a stock appreciation right is ten years from the date of grant. Options and stock appreciation rights may be fully vested at grant or may be subject to time- and/or performance-based vesting requirements.
The other types of awards that may be granted under the 2015 Plan include, without limitation, stock bonuses, restricted stock, performance stock, stock units or phantom stock (which are contractual rights to receive shares of stock, or cash based on the fair market value of a share of stock), dividend equivalents which represent the right to receive a payment based on the dividends paid on a share of stock over a stated period of time, or similar rights to purchase or acquire shares, and cash awards.
Any awards under the 2015 Plan may be fully-vested at grant or may be subject to time- and/or performance-based vesting requirements.
Dividend Equivalents; Deferrals. Subject to applicable laws, the Administrator may provide for the deferred payment of awards, and may determine the other terms applicable to deferrals. The Administrator may provide that awards under the 2015 Plan (other than options or stock appreciation rights), and/or deferrals, earn dividends or dividend equivalents based on the amount of dividends paid on outstanding Company common shares, provided that as to any dividend equivalent rights granted in connection with an award granted under the 2015 Plan that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements, no dividend equivalent payment will be made unless the related performance-based vesting conditions of the award are satisfied (or, in the case of a restricted stock or similar award where the dividend must be paid as a matter of law, the dividend payment will be subject to forfeiture or repayment, as the case may be, if the related performance-based vesting conditions are not satisfied).
Assumption and Termination of Awards. If an event occurs in which the Company does not survive (or does not survive as a public corporation in respect of its common shares), including, without limitation, a dissolution, merger, combination, consolidation, conversion, exchange of securities, or other reorganization, or a sale of all or substantially all of the business, stock or assets of the Company, awards then-outstanding under the 2015 Plan will not automatically become fully vested pursuant to the provisions of the 2015 Plan so long as such awards are assumed, substituted for or otherwise continued. However, if awards then-outstanding under the 2015 Plan are to be terminated in such circumstances (without being assumed or substituted for), such awards would generally become fully vested, subject to any exceptions that the Administrator may provide for in an applicable award agreement. The Administrator also has the discretion to establish other change in control provisions with respect to awards granted under the 2015 Plan. For example, the Administrator could provide for the acceleration of vesting or payment of an award in connection with a corporate event or in connection with a termination of the award holder's employment. Transfer Restrictions. Subject to certain exceptions contained in Section 5.7 of the 2015 Plan, awards under the 2015 Plan generally are not transferable by the recipient other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and are generally exercisable, during the recipient's lifetime, only by the recipient. Any amounts payable or shares issuable pursuant to an award generally will be paid only to the recipient or the recipient's beneficiary or representative. The Administrator has discretion, however, to establish written conditions and procedures for the transfer of awards to other persons or entities, provided that such transfers comply with applicable federal and state securities laws and are not made for value (other than nominal consideration, settlement of marital property rights, or for interests in an entity in which more than 50% of the voting securities are held by the award recipient or by the recipient's family members).
Adjustments. As is customary in incentive plans of this nature, each share limit and the number and kind of shares available under the 2015 Plan and any outstanding awards, as well as the exercise or purchase prices of awards, and performance targets under certain types of performance-based awards, are subject to adjustment in the event of certain reorganizations, mergers, amalgamations, combinations, conversions, recapitalizations, stock splits, stock dividends, or other similar events that change the number or kind of shares outstanding, and extraordinary dividends or distributions of property to the shareholders (except as noted above under "Authorized Shares; Limits on Awards").
No Limit on Other Authority. The 2015 Plan does not limit the authority of the Board or any committee to grant awards or authorize any other compensation, with or without reference to the Company's common shares, under any other plan or authority.
Termination of or Changes to the 2015 Plan. The Board may amend or terminate the 2015 Plan at any time and in any manner. Shareholder approval for an amendment will be required only to the extent then required by applicable law or deemed necessary or advisable by the Board. Unless terminated earlier by the Board and subject to any extension that may be approved by shareholders, the authority to grant new awards under the 2015 Plan will terminate on May 14, 2025. Outstanding awards, as well as the Administrator's authority with respect thereto, generally will continue following the expiration or termination of the plan. Generally speaking, outstanding awards may be amended by the Administrator (except for a repricing), but the consent of the award holder is required if the amendment (or any plan amendment) materially and adversely affects the holder.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of Awards under the 2015 Plan
The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the 2015 Plan under current federal law, which is subject to change, are summarized in the following discussion of the general tax principles applicable to the 2015 Plan. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and, among other considerations, does not describe the deferred compensation provisions of Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to the extent an award is subject to and does not satisfy those rules, nor does it describe state, local, or international tax consequences (including the treatment of awards under Canadian tax laws).
With respect to nonqualified stock options, the Company is generally entitled to deduct and the participant recognizes taxable income in an amount equal to the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise. With respect to incentive stock options, the Company is generally not entitled to a deduction nor does the participant recognize income at the time of exercise, although the participant may be subject to the U.S. federal alternative minimum tax.
The current federal income tax consequences of other awards authorized under the 2015 Plan generally follow certain basic patterns: nontransferable restricted stock subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture results in income recognition equal to the excess of the fair market value over the price paid (if any) only at the time the restrictions lapse (unless the recipient elects to accelerate recognition as of the date of grant); bonuses, stock appreciation rights, cash and stock-based performance awards, dividend equivalents, stock units, and other types of awards are generally subject to tax at the time of payment; and compensation otherwise effectively deferred is taxed when paid. In each of the foregoing cases, the Company will generally have a corresponding deduction at the time the participant recognizes income. If an award is accelerated under the 2015 Plan in connection with a "change in control" (as this term is used under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code), the Company may not be permitted to deduct the portion of the compensation attributable to the acceleration ("parachute payments") if it exceeds certain threshold limits under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (and certain related excise taxes may be triggered). Furthermore, under Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the aggregate compensation in excess of $1,000,000 attributable to awards held by current or former named executive officers may not be deductible by the Company in certain circumstances.
Specific Benefits under the 2015 Performance Incentive Plan
The Company has not approved any awards that are conditioned upon shareholder approval of the proposed amendment of the 2015 Plan. The Company is not currently considering any other specific award grants under the 2015 Plan.
The closing market price for a Company common share as of the Record Date was $2.61 per share.
Equity Compensation Plan Information
The Company currently maintains the Prior Plan, the 2015 Plan, and a 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which have been approved by the Company's shareholders. No new awards may be granted under the Prior Plan.
The following table sets forth the number of the Company's common shares subject to outstanding awards, the weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, and the number of shares remaining available for future award grants under the Prior Plan, the 2015 Plan, and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan as of December 31, 2017.

This table does not include the equity awards we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Overland in December 2014. As of December 31, 2017, an additional 147 of our common shares were subject to outstanding stock options we assumed in the acquisition (at a weighted average exercise price of $2,114.08 per share). Of the aggregate number of shares that remained available for future issuance reported in column (c), 96,272 were available under the 2015 Plan and 37,500 were available under the ESPP. The 2015 Plan permits the granting of the following types of incentive awards: stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, and stock units. 
(3) These figures represent stock units (the "Inducement Stock Units") granted to certain employees as an inducement to their commencing employment with us as provided under the Nasdaq listing rules. The Inducement Stock Units are generally subject to the same terms as stock units granted under the 2015 Plan. The Inducement Stock Units vest over three years and are subject to earlier termination in the case of termination of the employee's employment or a change in control of the Company.

The affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast by shareholders represented in person or by proxy at the Meeting is required to approve the proposal.
All members of the Board and all of the Company's executive officers are eligible for awards under the 2015 Plan and thus have a personal interest in the approval of the proposed amendment to the 2015 Plan.
The Board unanimously recommends voting FOR the Plan Amendment Resolution. REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. The Company's management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements and the related schedule in the Annual Report with Company management, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles; the reasonableness of significant judgments; and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. 
The Committee is governed by a charter. The Committee held four meetings during fiscal year 2017. The Committee is comprised solely of independent directors as defined by the Nasdaq listing standards and Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The meetings of the Committee are designed to facilitate and encourage communication among the Committee, the Company, the Company's internal audit function and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
The Committee discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Committee meets with the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations; their evaluations of the Company's internal control, including internal control over financial reporting; and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting.
The Committee reviewed and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited consolidated financial statements and related schedule with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, its judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), including PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16, Communication With Audit Committees, the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other applicable regulations. In addition, the Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by PCAOB Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, regarding the firm's communications with the Committee concerning the firm's independence and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the firm's independence from Company management and the Company and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the firm's independence.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 Executive Officer Compensation
Our executive compensation programs are determined by the Compensation Committee, within the scope of the authority delegated to it by our Board of Directors and subject to applicable law. The goals of our program are to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced executives and to provide compensation opportunities that are linked to corporate and individual performance. Decisions by the Compensation Committee on our executive compensation programs are subjective and the result of its business judgment, which is informed by the experiences of its members. The named executive officers do not have any role in determining their own compensation, although the Compensation Committee does consider the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer in setting compensation levels for the named executive officers other than himself. The primary components of our executive compensation program are base salary, performance bonuses and long-term equity incentive awards. As described in more detail below, the Board approved certain changes to our executive compensation program in December 2017, including certain severance arrangements and those described under "Stay Bonus Agreements" and "Sale Bonus Plan".
 Base Salaries. Base salaries are primarily intended to attract and retain highly qualified executives by providing them with fixed, predictable levels of compensation. The named executive officers' salary levels are specified in their employment agreements (other than for Mr. Tassiopoulos who is not a party to an employment agreement with the Company) and are subject to periodic review and adjustment by the Compensation Committee.
Performance Bonuses. In March 2017, the Compensation Committee approved a bonus plan for fiscal 2017. The bonus plan was divided into two bonus periods, with the first period consisting of the first two quarters of 2017 and the second period consisting of the last two quarters of fiscal 2017. The bonus amounts were determined based on our revenue and operating expenses for each bonus period against performance targets established by the Compensation Committee for that period. The Compensation Committee also approved the following target bonuses for the named executive officers participating in the plan (in each case expressed as a percentage of the executive's annual base salary: Mr. Kelly - 100%; Mr. Tassiopoulos - 100%; Mr. Kalbfleisch - 60%; and Ms. Yeh - 20%. The named executive officers' bonuses for fiscal 2017 are reported in the table above.
 Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards. Long-term equity incentives are intended to align the named executive officers' interests with those of our shareholders as the ultimate value of these awards depends on the value of the Company's shares. The Company has historically granted equity awards in the form of stock options with an exercise price that is equal to the per-share closing price of our common shares on the grant date. In recent years, restricted stock units have also been granted as provided for under the Company's 2015 Plan. The Compensation Committee believes that stock options are an effective vehicle for aligning the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders as the executive will only realize value on their options if the share price increases during the period between the grant date and the date the stock option is exercised. The stock options and restricted stock units function as a retention incentive for the named executive officers as they typically vest over a multi-year period following the date of grant. Restricted stock units, which are payable in our common shares, also link the interests of the award recipient with those of our shareholders as the potential value of the award is directly linked to the value of our common shares. Restricted stock units were included as part of the equity award mix granted in fiscal 2017 because they serve as a heightened retention incentive (as the awards generally have some value regardless of our stock price performance) and to help manage the potential dilutive impact of our equity awards (as one restricted stock unit generally has a greater grant date fair value than one stock option, so fewer restricted stock units generally have to be granted than if an award of equivalent grant date fair value was granted in the form of stock options). The named executive officers' equity awards are subject to accelerated vesting in certain circumstances under their agreements with the Company described below. Stay Bonus Agreements. In December 2017, the Board approved stay bonus agreements for each of our named executive officers and certain other key employees. Under these agreements, one-half of the executive's stay bonus will be payable if the executive remains employed with us through a change in control of the Company, and the other one-half of the stay bonus will be payable if the executive remains employed with us for three months after the change in control. If the executive's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by the executive for good reason (as such terms are defined in the agreement), any portion of the stay bonus that has not previously been paid will be payable on the executive's termination (regardless of whether a change in control has occurred). The aggregate stay bonus opportunity for each of the executive officers is as follows:  Mr. Kelly - $800,000; Mr. Kalbfleisch - $268,000; Mr. Tassiopoulos - $330,000; and Ms. Yeh - $268,000. In each case, payment of the stay bonus is contingent upon the executive providing the Company with a release of claims.
Sale Bonus Plan. To provide an additional incentive for our named executive officers and certain other key employees to achieve a sale of the Company, we adopted a sale bonus plan in 2017 that provides for participants to receive a specified percentage of the net consideration from one or more qualifying transactions. For purposes of the plan, a "qualifying transaction" is generally a sale of a majority of the Company's stock or a sale of any of its assets, and the "net consideration" is generally (1) the total proceeds to be paid to the Company or its stockholders in the qualifying transaction, less (2) the Company's net debt at the time of the transaction, less (3) amounts payable by the Company under the stay bonus agreements described above and the Company's other expenses incurred in the transaction. Upon a qualifying transaction, a bonus pool equal to 20% of the net consideration in the transaction is established, with each participant being entitled to receive his or her specified percentage of the bonus pool (subject to the terms and conditions of the plan). The specified percentage of the bonus pool that is currently allocated to each of the executive officers is as follows:  Mr. Kelly - 30%; Mr. Kalbfleisch - 20%; Mr. Tassiopoulos - 20%; and Ms. Yeh - 15%. A participant must be employed with the Company at the time of the qualifying transaction (or have been terminated by the Company without cause or resigned for good reason within the period of 120 days prior to the qualifying transaction) to be eligible for a bonus with respect to the qualifying transaction. If a participant resigns (other than for good reason) or otherwise forfeits his or her interest under the bonus plan, the forfeited interest may be regranted by the Board as one or more new awards under the plan or, to the extent not re-granted before the time of a qualifying transaction, would be reallocated to the other participants on a pro-rata basis. Bonuses under the plan would generally be paid in connection with the closing of the qualifying transaction but may be subject to any deferred payment arrangement (such as an escrow or earn-out provision) that applies to the consideration paid in the transaction to the Company or its stockholders.
Employment, Severance and Change in Control Agreements
Eric L. Kelly. In connection with our acquisition of Overland, we assumed the employment agreement then in effect between Overland and Mr. Kelly, who had been serving as Overland's President and Chief Executive Officer and was appointed our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, effective December 1, 2014. The agreement provides for Mr. Kelly to earn a base salary of $400,000 and to be eligible to receive an annual bonus based upon the achievement of financial and management objectives reasonably established by our Board of Directors or an authorized committee of our Board of Directors. His annual bonus target is 100% of the greater of $400,000 or his base salary as of the end of the applicable fiscal quarter or year in which the bonus is earned, and he has the opportunity to earn an annual bonus of up to 150% of the target bonus. To the extent that any travel, lodging or auto-expense reimbursements we make to Mr. Kelly are taxable to him, we will provide him with a tax restoration payment so that he will be put in the same after-tax position as if such reimbursements had not been subject to tax. Mr. Kelly's employment agreement automatically renews each year for an additional one-year term. We may unilaterally modify Mr. Kelly's cash compensation at any time, subject to Mr. Kelly's right to terminate his employment for good reason as described below. As discussed above, in connection with the Overland Divestiture, Mr. Kelly ceased to serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and no longer holds any positions with the Company. Mr. Kelly's employment agreement also provides that if we terminate his employment without cause or if he resigns from employment for good reason (other than in the circumstances contemplated by his retention agreement described below), we will be obligated to pay him an aggregate severance payment equal to the sum of (i) 150% of the greater of his base salary then in effect or his original base salary, (ii) a portion of his target bonus prorated based on the number of days he was employed during the period on which the target bonus is based (such pro-rated target bonus to also be paid if his termination were due to his death or disability), (iii) an amount equal to the estimated premiums he would be required to pay to continue health insurance coverage under our insurance plans for himself and his eligible dependents under COBRA for 18 months following the date of his termination, and (iv) the estimated amount necessary for him to continue life, accident, medical and dental insurance benefits for himself and his eligible dependents in amounts substantially similar to those which he received immediately prior to the date of his termination for a period of 18 months following his termination (reduced by the amount of any payment for COBRA premiums as described in clause (iii) above). For these purposes, the terms "cause" and "good reason" are defined in the agreement, and a termination of employment by us without cause includes a termination by us at the end of the term then in effect. The severance payment will be made in equal monthly installments over 18 months in accordance with our regular payroll practices. In addition, Mr. Kelly will be entitled to accelerated vesting for any unvested portion of his then outstanding stock options and any other equity-based awards that would otherwise have vested during the 12-month period following his termination. In the case of vested stock options, he will be permitted to exercise such options in whole or in part at any time within one year of the date of his termination, subject to earlier termination upon the expiration of the maximum term of the applicable options under the applicable plan or upon a change in control. The severance benefits described above are contingent upon Mr. Kelly providing us with a general release of all claims.
In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Overland, we also assumed the retention agreement then in effect between Overland and Mr. Kelly. In December 2017, the Board approved an amended and restated version of this agreement with Mr. Kelly. The amended retention agreement provides that if Mr. Kelly's employment continues through a change in control of the Company (or if his employment is terminated by the Company without cause or he resigns for good reason (as such terms are defined in the agreement) within sixty days prior to the change in control), he will be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to 150% of the sum of his base salary at the time of the consummation of the change of control or his termination date (whichever is higher) and his annual target bonus. Mr. Kelly will also be entitled to accelerated vesting of his then-outstanding and unvested stock options and other equity-based awards granted by the Company, and he will be permitted to exercise vested stock options for one year of the date of his termination, subject to earlier termination upon the expiration of the maximum term of the option or upon a change of control. In addition, if his employment is terminated by the Company without cause or he resigns for good reason within the sixty-day period before a change in control or any time after the change in control, Mr. Kelly will be entitled to a lump sum payment of (i) an amount equal to the estimated premiums he would be required to pay to continue health insurance coverage under our insurance plans for himself and his eligible dependents under COBRA for 18 months following the date of his termination, and (ii) the estimated amount necessary for him to continue life, accident, medical and dental insurance benefits for himself and his eligible dependents in amounts substantially similar to those which he received immediately prior to the date of his termination for a period of 18 months following his termination (reduced by the amount of any payment for COBRA premiums as described in clause (i) above). If any portion of any payment under Mr. Kelly's retention agreement would constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, then that payment will be reduced to an amount that is one dollar less than the threshold for triggering the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code if such reduction would result in a greater benefit for Mr. Kelly on an after-tax basis. The benefits provided under Mr. Kelly's retention agreement are contingent upon him providing us a general release of claims. In no event will Mr. Kelly be entitled to both the benefits provided under his retention agreement and the severance benefits provided under his employment agreement. Kurt L. Kalbfleisch. In connection with our acquisition of Overland, we assumed the employment agreement then in effect between Overland and Mr. Kalbfleisch, who had been serving as Overland's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and was appointed our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective December 1, 2014. In December 2017, the Board approved an amended and restated version of this agreement with Mr. Kalbfleisch. The restated agreement provides for Mr. Kalbfleisch to earn a base salary of $300,000. Mr. Kalbfleisch's employment agreement automatically renews each year for an additional one-year term. We may unilaterally modify Mr. Kalbfleisch's cash compensation at any time, subject to Mr. Kalbfleisch's right to terminate his employment for good reason. If we terminate Mr. Kalbfleisch's employment without cause or he resigns his employment for good reason (as such terms are defined in the agreement), in either case more than sixty days before a change in control of the Company, he will be entitled to an aggregate severance payment equal to the sum of (i) the greater of his annual base salary then in effect or his original base salary of $300,000, (ii) a portion of any target bonus prorated based on the number of days he was employed during the period on which the target bonus is based (such pro-rated target bonus to also be paid if his termination were due to his death or disability), (iii) an amount equal to the estimated premiums he would be required to pay to continue health insurance coverage under our insurance plans for himself and his eligible dependents under COBRA for 12 months following the date of his termination, and (iv) the estimated amount necessary for him to continue life, accident, medical and dental insurance benefits for himself and his eligible dependents in amounts substantially similar to those which he received immediately prior to the date of his termination for a period of 12 months following his termination (reduced by the amount of any payment for COBRA premiums as described in clause (iii) above). The severance payment will be made in equal monthly installments over the 12 months following termination of employment. In addition, Mr. Kalbfleisch will be entitled to accelerated vesting of any unvested portion of his then outstanding stock options and other equity-based awards that would otherwise have vested during the 12-month period following his termination. In the case of vested stock options, he will be permitted to exercise such options in whole or in part at any time within one year of the date of his termination, subject to earlier termination upon the expiration of the maximum term of the applicable options under the applicable plan or upon a change in control.
Mr. Kalbfleisch's restated employment agreement also provides that if his employment continues through a change in control of the Company (or if his employment is terminated by the Company without cause or he resigns for good reason (as such terms are defined in the agreement) within sixty days prior to the change in control), he will be entitled to a lump sum payment equal to 150% of his base salary then in effect. Mr. Kalbfleisch will also be entitled to accelerated vesting of his then-outstanding and unvested stock options and other equity-based awards granted by the Company, and he will be permitted to exercise vested stock options for one year of the date of his termination, subject to earlier termination upon the expiration of the maximum term of the option or upon a change of control. In addition, if his employment is terminated by the Company without cause or he resigns for good reason within the sixty-day period before a change in control or any time after the change in control, Mr. Kalbfleisch will be entitled to a lump sum payment of (i) an amount equal to the estimated premiums he would be required to pay to continue health insurance coverage under our insurance plans for himself and his eligible dependents under COBRA for 12 months following the date of his termination, and (ii) the estimated amount necessary for him to continue life, accident, medical and dental insurance benefits for himself and his eligible dependents in amounts substantially similar to those which he received immediately prior to the date of his termination for a period of 12 months following his termination (reduced by the amount of any payment for COBRA premiums as described in clause (i) above). If any payment under Mr. Kalbfleisch's employment agreement would constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, then that payment will be reduced to an amount that is one dollar less than the threshold for triggering the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code if such reduction would result in a greater benefit for Mr. Kalbfleisch on an after-tax basis. In each case, the severance and change in control benefits provided under Mr. Kalbfleisch's employment agreement are contingent upon him providing us with a general release of all claims. Peter Tassiopoulos. In December 2017, the Board approved certain compensation arrangements for Mr. Tassiopoulos. Pursuant to these arrangements, if Mr. Tassiopoulos' employment continues through a change in control of the Company (or if his employment is terminated by the Company without cause or he resigns for good reason (as such terms are defined in the agreement) prior to the change in control), he will be entitled to receive a lump sum payment of $360,000, and his outstanding and unvested equity-based awards granted by the Company will fully accelerate. In addition, if at any time his employment is terminated by the Company without cause or he resigns for good reason, he will be entitled to receive an amount equal to the estimated premiums he would be required to pay to continue health insurance coverage under our insurance plans for himself and his eligible dependents under COBRA for 12 months following the date of his termination. The benefits described above are contingent upon Mr. Tassiopoulos providing us with a general release of all claims and the entry into a settlement and release agreement by Mr. Tassiopoulos with respect to his prior bonus and severance arrangements with the Company.
Jenny C. Yeh. In December 2017, the Board approved a retention agreement with Ms. Yeh that amended and restated her prior severance agreement with the Company. Under her retention agreement, if Ms. Yeh's employment continues through a change in control of the Company (or if her employment is terminated by the Company without cause or she resigns for good reason (as such terms are defined in the agreement) prior to the change in control), she will be entitled to receive a lump sum payment in an amount equal to 12 months of her base salary, and her outstanding and unvested equity-based awards granted by the Company will fully accelerate. In addition, if at any time her employment is terminated by the Company without cause or she resigns for good reason, she will be entitled to receive an amount equal to the estimated premiums she would be required to pay to continue health insurance coverage under our insurance plans for herself and her eligible dependents under COBRA for 12 months following the date of her termination. The benefits described above are contingent upon Ms. Yeh providing us with a general release of all claims.
Overland Divestiture
As previously announced on the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 14, 2018, the Company sold all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Overland Storage, Inc. The Overland Divestiture constituted a change in control as defined in each of the foregoing arrangements, and each of our named executive officers remained employed with us through the closing of the transaction. Accordingly, each named executive officer would be entitled to the applicable payments and benefits under these arrangements on the terms described above.
Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans
For more information on the Company's equity compensation plans, please see "Equity Compensation Plan Information" and "Summary Description of the 2015 Performance Incentive Plan" under the "Amendment of the Company's 2015 Performance Incentive Plan" proposal.
401(k) Plan
Our On-Track 401(k) Savings Plan covers all of our U.S. employees, provided they meet the requirements of the plan. Our 401(k) plan is intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code so that employee contributions and income earned on such contributions are not taxable to employees until withdrawn. Employees may elect to defer up to 60% of their eligible compensation (not to exceed the statutorily prescribed annual limit) in the form of elective deferral contributions to our 401(k) plan. However, our named executive officers qualify as highly compensated employees and may only elect to defer up to 8.5% of their eligible compensation (not to exceed the statutorily prescribed annual limit) in the form of elective deferral contributions to our 401(k) plan. Our 401(k) plan also has a catch-up contribution feature for employees aged 50 or older (including those who qualify as highly compensated employees) who can defer amounts over the statutory limit that applies to all other employees. Our 401(k) Plan permits but does not require matching contributions by us on behalf of participants. Compensation of Directors
The following table provides compensation information for the members of our Board of Directors during 2017 who were not employed by us or any of our subsidiaries ("non-employee directors"). Eric Kelly and Peter Tassiopoulos are each named executive officers who also served on the Board of Directors during 2017. The 2017 compensation information for each of these individuals is presented in the Summary Compensation Table above and they were not entitled to any additional compensation for their service on the Board during fiscal 2017.

The non-employee board members are paid $10,000 per quarter for their service on the Board except that the Chair of the Audit Committee and the Lead Board member are paid $12,500 per quarter for their service on the Board. During 2017, the Board also granted restricted stock units to certain non-employee directors as described in the notes to the table above. Under the terms of the non-employee directors' equity awards, each of these awards, to the extent outstanding and unvested, became fully vested on the closing of the Overland Divestiture on November 13, 2018 described above. The Board retains complete discretion to adopt or modify our programs for providing cash and/or equity-based compensation to our non-employee directors as it deems appropriate from time to time.

The Nominating and Governance Committee identifies candidates for Board membership based on their character, integrity, judgment and record of achievement and any skills and talents they possess which would add to the Board's decision-making process and enhance the overall management of the business and affairs of the Corporation.
Directors must have sufficient time to carry out their duties and not assume responsibilities that would materially interfere with or be incompatible with Board membership. Directors who change their principal occupation are expected to advise the Nominating and Governance Committee and, if determined appropriate by the Nominating and Governance Committee, resign from the Board.
A-5
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.2  Director Independence 
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that, except during periods of temporary vacancies, not less than half of its members should be Independent Directors.
In all cases, the determination of whether a director is independent will be made by the Board in accordance with applicable securities laws and stock exchange rules. Generally, an "Independent Director" is a director who has no direct or indirect material relationship with the Corporation. For these purposes, "material relationship" means a relationship which could, in the view of the Board, reasonably interfere with the exercise of a director's independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
In making a determination regarding a director's independence, the Board will consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including the director's commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable and familial relationships and such other criteria as the Board may determine from time to time.
The Board will review the independence of all directors on an annual basis and will disclose its determinations annually. To facilitate this review, directors will be asked to provide the Board with full information regarding their business and other relationships with the Corporation and its affiliates and with senior management and their affiliates. 
Directors have an ongoing obligation to inform the Board of any material changes in their circumstances or relationships which may affect the Board's determination as to their independence.
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.3  Board Size 
[END TABLE]
The Corporation will have a minimum of one director and a maximum of ten directors, with the number of directors from time to time within such range being fixed by resolution of the directors, provided that until otherwise so determined by resolution, the number of directors will be four (4). The Board is of the view that its current size of four (4) members is conducive to effective decision-making and committee work.
The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of the Board size on a regular basis and reporting its analysis and recommendations to the Board.
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.4  Term 
[END TABLE]
Each director is elected or appointed at the annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation to hold office until the close of the annual meeting of shareholders next following such director's election or appointment and until such director's successor is elected or appointed.
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.5  Board Succession 
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for maintaining a Board succession plan that is responsive to the Corporation's needs and the interests of its shareholders.
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.6 Service on Other Boards and Audit Committees

During the early stage of development of the Corporation, compensation for serving on the Board and its various subcommittees (including the Audit Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee), as well as Chair of the Board (if the Chair is a non-employee) and any subcommittee thereof, and any meeting fees relating thereto shall be paid to outside directors by way of grant of options.

The Board should adopt and approve a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") for employees which addresses, among other things, avoidance of conflicts of interest, protection of confidential information, compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, adherence to good disclosure practices and procedures for employees and third parties to report concerns with respect to accounting and auditing matters. As set out in the Code, an employee who, in good faith, reports a concern regarding accounting matters or a suspected breach of the Code is protected from retaliation, such as discharge, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment or discrimination.
The Board should also adopt and approve a Code of Ethics for directors that set out the ethical standards that apply to directors in the exercise of their duties.
Both Codes should be available in print to any shareholder who requests a copy. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
16.  Indemnification and Insurance 
[END TABLE]

The Corporation maintains insurance for the benefit of its directors and officers against any liability incurred by them for which they would be indemnified. The amount and terms of the insurance coverage are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and practices with the objective of adequately protecting directors and officers from such liability.
[BEGIN TABLE]
17.  Conflicts of Interest 
[END TABLE]
Each director is required to inform the Nominating and Governance Committee of any conflict of interest he or she may have with the Corporation. If a director has a personal interest in a matter before the Board or a committee, he or she must not participate in any vote on the matter except where the Board or the committee has expressly determined that it is appropriate for him or her to do so in accordance with applicable law.

[BEGIN TABLE]
3.3 Binding Determinations. Any determination or other action taken by, or inaction of, the Corporation, any Subsidiary, or the Administrator relating or pursuant to this Plan (or any award made under this Plan) and within its authority hereunder or under applicable law shall be within the absolute discretion of that entity or body and shall be conclusive and binding upon all persons. Neither the Board nor any Board committee, nor any member thereof or person acting at the direction thereof, shall be liable for any act, omission, interpretation, construction or determination made in good faith in connection with this Plan (or any award made under this Plan), and all such persons shall be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement by the Corporation in respect of any claim, loss, damage or expense (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) arising or resulting therefrom to the fullest extent permitted by law and/or under any directors and officers liability insurance coverage that may be in effect from time to time. Neither the Board nor any Board committee, nor any member thereof or person acting at the direction thereof, nor the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be liable for any damages of a participant should an option intended as an ISO (as defined below) fail to actually meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), applicable to ISOs, should any other award(s) fail to qualify for any intended tax treatment, should any award grant or other action with respect thereto not satisfy Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise for any tax or other liability imposed on a participant with respect to an award. 
3.4 Reliance on Experts. In making any determination or in taking or not taking any action under this Plan, the Administrator may obtain and may rely upon the advice of experts, including employees and professional advisors to the Corporation.

4. COMMON SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN; SHARE LIMITS 
4.1 Shares Available. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.1, the shares that may be delivered under this Plan shall be the Corporation's authorized but unissued Common Shares. For purposes of this Plan, "Common Shares" shall mean the common shares of the Corporation and such other securities or property as may become the subject of awards under this Plan, or may become subject to such awards, pursuant to an adjustment made under Section 7.1. 
[END TABLE]
C-3
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.2 Share Limits. The maximum number of Common Shares that may be delivered pursuant to awards granted to Eligible Persons under this Plan (the "Share Limit") is equal to the sum of the following: 
(1) 640,843 Common Shares, plus 
(2) the number of any Common Shares subject to stock options granted under the Corporation's Second Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan (the "Prior Plan") and outstanding on June 18, 2015 which expire, or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, after that date without being exercised. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Share Limit will automatically increase on the first trading day of April 2019 by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) ten percent (10%) of the total number of common shares issued and outstanding on March 31, 2019 or (ii) such number of common shares as may be established by the Board, and will automatically increase on the first trading day in January of each calendar year thereafter during the term of the 2015 Plan (commencing with January 2020) by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) ten percent (10%) of the total number of common shares issued and outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) such number of common shares as may be established by the Board.
The maximum number of Common Shares that may be delivered pursuant to options qualified as incentive stock options granted under this Plan is 200,000 shares. 
Each of the foregoing numerical limits is subject to adjustment as contemplated by Section 4.3, Section 7.1, and Section 8.10.
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.3 Awards Settled in Cash, Reissue of Awards and Shares. Except as provided in the next sentence, shares that are subject to or underlie awards granted under this Plan which expire or for any reason are cancelled or terminated, are forfeited, fail to vest, or for any other reason are not paid or delivered under this Plan shall again be available for subsequent awards under this Plan. Shares that are exchanged by a participant or withheld by the Corporation as full or partial payment in connection with any award granted under this Plan, as well as any shares exchanged by a participant or withheld by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to any award granted under this Plan, shall be available for subsequent awards under this Plan. To the extent that an award granted under this Plan is settled in cash or a form other than Common Shares, the shares that would have been delivered had there been no such cash or other settlement shall not be counted against the shares available for issuance under this Plan. In the event that Common Shares are delivered in respect of a dividend equivalent right granted under this Plan, the number of shares actually delivered with respect to the award shall be counted against the share limits of this Plan. To the extent that Common Shares are delivered pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right or stock option granted under this Plan, the number of shares actually delivered with respect to the award shall be counted against the share limits of this Plan. Refer to Section 8.10 for application of the foregoing share limits with respect to assumed awards.  
4.4 Reservation of Shares; No Fractional Shares; Minimum Issue. The Corporation shall at all times reserve a number of Common Shares sufficient to cover the Corporation's obligations and contingent obligations to deliver shares with respect to awards then outstanding under this Plan (exclusive of any dividend equivalent obligations to the extent the Corporation has the right to settle such rights in cash). No fractional shares shall be delivered under this Plan. The Administrator may pay cash in lieu of any fractional shares in settlements of awards under this Plan. The Administrator may from time to time impose a limit (of not greater than 100 shares) on the minimum number of shares that may be purchased or exercised as to awards granted under this Plan unless (as to any particular award) the total number purchased or exercised is the total number at the time available for purchase or exercise under the award. 
[END TABLE]
C-4
[BEGIN TABLE]
5. AWARDS 
5.1 Type and Form of Awards. The Administrator shall determine the type or types of award(s) to be made to each selected Eligible Person. Awards may be granted singly, in combination or in tandem. Awards also may be made in combination or in tandem with, in replacement of, as alternatives to, or as the payment form for grants or rights under any other employee or compensation plan of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries. The types of awards that may be granted under this Plan are (subject, in each case, to the no repricing provisions of Section 3.2): 
[END TABLE]
5.1.1    Stock Options. A stock option is the grant of a right to purchase a specified number of Common Shares during a specified period as determined by the Administrator. An option may be intended as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code (an "ISO") or a nonqualified stock option (an option not intended to be an ISO). The award agreement for an option will indicate if the option is intended as an ISO; otherwise it will be deemed to be a nonqualified stock option. The maximum term of each option (ISO or nonqualified) shall be ten (10) years. The per share exercise price for each option shall be not less than 100% of the fair market value of a Common Share on the date of grant of the option. When an option is exercised, the exercise price for the shares to be purchased shall be paid in full in cash or such other method permitted by the Administrator consistent with Section 5.5.
5.1.2    Additional Rules Applicable to ISOs. To the extent that the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time of grant of the applicable option) of stock with respect to which ISOs first become exercisable by a participant in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, taking into account both Common Shares subject to ISOs under this Plan and stock subject to ISOs under all other plans of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries (or any parent or predecessor corporation to the extent required by and within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), such options shall be treated as nonqualified stock options. In reducing the number of options treated as ISOs to meet the $100,000 limit, the most recently granted options shall be reduced first. To the extent a reduction of simultaneously granted options is necessary to meet the $100,000 limit, the Administrator may, in the manner and to the extent permitted by law, designate which Common Shares are to be treated as shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO. ISOs may only be granted to employees of the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries (for this purpose, the term "subsidiary" is used as defined in Section 424(f) of the Code, which generally requires an unbroken chain of ownership of at least 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of each subsidiary in the chain beginning with the Corporation and ending with the subsidiary in question). There shall be imposed in any award agreement relating to ISOs such other terms and conditions as from time to time are required in order that the option be an "incentive stock option" as that term is defined in Section 422 of the Code. No ISO may be granted to any person who, at the time the option is granted, owns (or is deemed to own under Section 424(d) of the Code) shares of outstanding Common Shares possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Corporation, unless the exercise price of such option is at least 110% of the fair market value of the stock subject to the option and such option by its terms is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date such option is granted.
5.1.3    Stock Appreciation Rights. A stock appreciation right or "SAR" is a right to receive a payment, in cash and/or Common Shares, equal to the excess of the fair market value of a specified number of Common Shares on the date the SAR is exercised over the "base price" of the award, which base price shall be set forth in the applicable award agreement and shall be not less than 100% of the fair market value of a Common Share on the date of grant of the SAR. The maximum term of a SAR shall be ten (10) years.
5.1.4    Other Awards; Dividend Equivalent Rights. The other types of awards that may be granted under this Plan include: (a) stock bonuses, restricted stock, performance stock, stock units, phantom stock or similar rights to purchase or acquire shares, whether at a fixed or variable price (or no price) or fixed or variable ratio related to the Common Shares, and any of which may (but need not) be fully vested at grant 
C-5
or vest upon the passage of time, the occurrence of one or more events, the satisfaction of performance criteria or other conditions, or any combination thereof; (b) any similar securities with a value derived from the value of or related to the Common Shares and/or returns thereon; or (c) cash awards. Dividend equivalent rights may be granted as a separate award or in connection with another award under this Plan; provided, however, that dividend equivalent rights may not be granted in connection with a stock option or SAR granted under this Plan. In addition, any dividends and/or dividend equivalents as to the unvested portion of a restricted stock award that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements or the unvested portion of a stock unit award that is subject to performance-based vesting requirements will be subject to termination and forfeiture to the same extent as the corresponding portion of the award to which they relate.
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.2 [Reserved]. 
5.3 Award Agreements. Each award shall be evidenced by either (1) a written award agreement in a form approved by the Administrator and executed by the Corporation by an officer duly authorized to act on its behalf, or (2) an electronic notice of award grant in a form approved by the Administrator and recorded by the Corporation (or its designee) in an electronic recordkeeping system used for the purpose of tracking award grants under this Plan generally (in each case, an "award agreement"), as the Administrator may provide and, in each case and if required by the Administrator, executed or otherwise electronically accepted by the recipient of the award in such form and manner as the Administrator may require. The Administrator may authorize any officer of the Corporation (other than the particular award recipient) to execute any or all award agreements on behalf of the Corporation. The award agreement shall set forth the material terms and conditions of the award as established by the Administrator consistent with the express limitations of this Plan. 
5.4 Deferrals and Settlements. Payment of awards may be in the form of cash, Common Shares, other awards or combinations thereof as the Administrator shall determine, and with such restrictions as it may impose. The Administrator may also require or permit participants to elect to defer the issuance of shares or the settlement of awards in cash under such rules and procedures as it may establish under this Plan. The Administrator may also provide that deferred settlements include the payment or crediting of interest or other earnings on the deferral amounts, or the payment or crediting of dividend equivalents where the deferred amounts are denominated in shares. 
5.5 Consideration for Common Shares or Awards. The purchase price for any award granted under this Plan or the Common Shares to be delivered pursuant to an award, as applicable, may be paid by means of any lawful consideration as determined by the Administrator, including, without limitation, one or a combination of the following methods: 
โข services rendered by the recipient of such award; 
โข cash, check payable to the order of the Corporation, or electronic funds transfer; 
โข notice and third party payment in such manner as may be authorized by the Administrator; 
โข the delivery of previously owned Common Shares; 
โข by a reduction in the number of shares otherwise deliverable pursuant to the award; or 
โข subject to such procedures as the Administrator may adopt, pursuant to a "cashless exercise" with a third party who provides financing for the purposes of (or who otherwise facilitates) the purchase or exercise of awards. 
[END TABLE]
In no event shall any shares newly-issued by the Corporation be issued for less than the minimum lawful consideration for such shares or for consideration other than consideration permitted by applicable law. Common Shares used to satisfy the exercise price of an option shall be valued at their fair market value on the date of exercise. The Corporation will not be obligated to deliver any shares unless and until it receives full payment of the exercise or purchase price therefor and any related withholding obligations 
C-6
under Section 8.5 and any other conditions to exercise or purchase have been satisfied. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable award agreement, the Administrator may at any time eliminate or limit a participant's ability to pay the purchase or exercise price of any award or shares by any method other than cash payment to the Corporation. Common Shares delivered pursuant to Awards granted under this Plan, when the applicable consideration therefor shall have been received by the Corporation, shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable.
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.6 Definition of Fair Market Value. For purposes of this Plan, "fair market value" shall mean, unless otherwise determined or provided by the Administrator in the circumstances, the closing price (in regular trading) for a Common Share on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the "Market") for the date in question or, if no sales of Common Shares were reported on the Market on that date, the closing price (in regular trading) for a Common Share on the Market for the next preceding day on which sales of Common Shares were reported on the Market. The Administrator may, however, provide with respect to one or more awards that the fair market value shall equal the closing price (in regular trading) for a Common Share on the Market on the last trading day preceding the date in question or the average of the high and low trading prices of a Common Share on the Market for the date in question or the most recent trading day. If the Common Shares are no longer listed or are no longer actively traded on the Market as of the applicable date, the fair market value of the Common Shares shall be the value as reasonably determined by the Administrator for purposes of the award in the circumstances. The Administrator also may adopt a different methodology for determining fair market value with respect to one or more awards if a different methodology is necessary or advisable to secure any intended favorable tax, legal or other treatment for the particular award(s) (for example, and without limitation, the Administrator may provide that fair market value for purposes of one or more awards will be based on an average of closing prices (or the average of high and low daily trading prices) for a specified period preceding the relevant date). 
[END TABLE]
5.7Transfer Restrictions.
5.7.1    Limitations on Exercise and Transfer. Unless otherwise expressly provided in (or pursuant to) this Section 5.7 or required by applicable law: (a) all awards are non-transferable and shall not be subject in any manner to sale, transfer, anticipation, alienation, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or charge; (b) awards shall be exercised only by the participant; and (c) amounts payable or shares issuable pursuant to any award shall be delivered only to (or for the account of) the participant.
5.7.2    Exceptions. The Administrator may permit awards to be exercised by and paid to, or otherwise transferred to, other persons or entities pursuant to such conditions and procedures, including limitations on subsequent transfers, as the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, establish in writing. Any permitted transfer shall be subject to compliance with applicable federal, provincial and state securities laws and shall not be for value (other than nominal consideration, settlement of marital property rights, or for interests in an entity in which more than 50% of the voting interests are held by the Eligible Person or by the Eligible Person's family members).
5.7.3    Further Exceptions to Limits on Transfer. The exercise and transfer restrictions in Section 5.7.1 shall not apply to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a) transfers to the Corporation (for example, in connection with the expiration or termination of the award), 
(b) the designation of a beneficiary to receive benefits in the event of the participant's death or, if the participant has died, transfers to or exercise by the participant's beneficiary, or, in the absence of a validly designated beneficiary or if such designation cannot be validly made, transfers by will or the laws of descent and distribution,     
(c) subject to any applicable limitations on ISOs, transfers to a family member (or former family member) pursuant to a domestic relations order if approved or ratified by the Administrator, 
[END TABLE]
C-7
[BEGIN TABLE]
(d) if the participant has suffered a disability, permitted transfers or exercises on behalf of the participant by his or her legal representative, or 
(e) the authorization by the Administrator of "cashless exercise" procedures with third parties who provide financing for the purpose of (or who otherwise facilitate) the exercise of awards consistent with applicable laws and the express authorization of the Administrator. 
5.8 International Awards. One or more awards may be granted to Eligible Persons who provide services to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries outside of the United States. Any awards granted to such persons may be granted pursuant to the terms and conditions of any applicable sub-plans, if any, appended to this Plan and approved by the Administrator. The awards so granted need not comply with other specific terms of this Plan, provided that shareholder approval of any deviation from the specific terms of this Plan is not required by applicable law or any applicable listing agency. 
6. EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR SERVICE ON AWARDS 
6.1 General. The Administrator shall establish the effect of a termination of employment or service on the rights and benefits under each award under this Plan and in so doing may make distinctions based upon, inter alia, the cause of termination and type of award. If the participant is not an employee of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries and provides other services to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, the Administrator shall be the sole judge for purposes of this Plan (unless a contract or the award otherwise provides) of whether the participant continues to render services to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries and the date, if any, upon which such services shall be deemed to have terminated. 
6.2 Events Not Deemed Terminations of Service. Unless the express policy of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, or the Administrator, otherwise provides, or except as otherwise required by applicable law, the employment relationship shall not be considered terminated in the case of (a) sick leave, (b) military leave, or (c) any other leave of absence authorized by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, or the Administrator; provided that, unless reemployment upon the expiration of such leave is guaranteed by contract or law or the Administrator otherwise provides, such leave is for a period of not more than three months. In the case of any employee of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries on an approved leave of absence, continued vesting of the award while on leave from the employ of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries may be suspended until the employee returns to service, unless the Administrator otherwise provides or applicable law otherwise requires. In no event shall an award be exercised after the expiration of the term set forth in the applicable award agreement. 
6.3 Effect of Change of Subsidiary Status. For purposes of this Plan and any award, if an entity ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Corporation a termination of employment or service shall be deemed to have occurred with respect to each Eligible Person in respect of such Subsidiary who does not continue as an Eligible Person in respect of the Corporation or another Subsidiary that continues as such after giving effect to the transaction or other event giving rise to the change in status unless the Subsidiary that is sold, spun-off or otherwise divested (or its successor or a direct or indirect parent of such Subsidiary or successor) assumes the Eligible Person's award(s) in connection with such transaction. 
7. ADJUSTMENTS; ACCELERATION 
7.1 Adjustments. Subject to Section 7.2, upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to): any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a stock split in the form of a stock dividend) or reverse stock split; any merger, amalgamation, combination, consolidation, conversion or other reorganization; any spin-off, split-up, or similar extraordinary dividend distribution in respect of the Common Shares; or any exchange of Common Shares or other securities of the Corporation, or any similar, unusual or extraordinary corporate transaction in respect of the Common Shares; then the Administrator shall equitably and proportionately adjust (1) the number and type of Common Shares (or other securities) that thereafter may be made the subject of awards (including the specific share limits, maximums and  
[END TABLE]
C-8
numbers of shares set forth elsewhere in this Plan), (2) the number, amount and type of Common Shares (or other securities or property) subject to any outstanding awards, (3) the grant, purchase, or exercise price (which term includes the base price of any SAR or similar right) of any outstanding awards, and/or (4) the securities, cash or other property deliverable upon exercise or payment of any outstanding awards, in each case to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by this Plan and the then-outstanding awards.
Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable award agreement, upon (or, as may be necessary to effect the adjustment, immediately prior to) any event or transaction described in the preceding paragraph or a sale of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Corporation as an entirety, the Administrator shall equitably and proportionately adjust the performance standards applicable to any then-outstanding performance-based awards to the extent necessary to preserve (but not increase) the level of incentives intended by this Plan and the then-outstanding performance-based awards.
It is intended that, if possible, any adjustments contemplated by the preceding two paragraphs be made in a manner that satisfies applicable Canadian and U.S. legal, tax (including, without limitation and as applicable in the circumstances, Section 424 of the Code, and Section 409A of the Code) and accounting (so as to not trigger any charge to earnings with respect to such adjustment) requirements.
Without limiting the generality of Section 3.3, any good faith determination by the Administrator as to whether an adjustment is required in the circumstances pursuant to this Section 7.1, and the extent and nature of any such adjustment, shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.2 Corporate Transactions - Assumption and Termination of Awards. Upon the occurrence of any of the following: any recapitalization, merger, amalgamation, combination, consolidation, conversion or other reorganization in connection with which the Corporation does not survive (or does not survive as a public company in respect of its Common Shares); any exchange of Common Shares or other securities of the Corporation in connection with which the Corporation does not survive (or does not survive as a public company in respect of its Common Shares); a sale of all or substantially all the business, stock or assets of the Corporation in connection with which the Corporation does not survive (or does not survive as a public company in respect of its Common Shares); a dissolution of the Corporation; or any other event in which the Corporation does not survive (or does not survive as a public company in respect of its Common Shares); then the Administrator may make provision for a cash payment in settlement of, or for the termination, assumption, substitution or exchange of any or all outstanding share-based awards or the cash, securities or property deliverable to the holder of any or all outstanding share-based awards, based upon, to the extent relevant under the circumstances, the distribution or consideration payable to holders of the Common Shares upon or in respect of such event. Upon the occurrence of any event described in the preceding sentence, then, unless the Administrator has made a provision for the substitution, assumption, exchange or other continuation or settlement of the award or the award would otherwise continue in accordance with its terms in the circumstances: (1) unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, each then-outstanding option and SAR shall become fully vested, all shares of restricted stock then outstanding shall fully vest free of restrictions, and each other award granted under this Plan that is then outstanding shall become payable to the holder of such award; and (2) each award shall terminate upon the related event; provided that the holder of an option or SAR shall be given reasonable advance notice of the impending termination and a reasonable opportunity to exercise his or her outstanding vested options and SARs (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting required in the circumstances) in accordance with their terms before the termination of such awards (except that in no case shall more than ten days' notice of the impending termination be required and any acceleration of vesting and any exercise of any portion of an award that is so accelerated may be made contingent upon the actual occurrence of the event). 
[END TABLE]
Without limiting the preceding paragraph, in connection with any event referred to in the preceding paragraph or any change in control event defined in any applicable award agreement, the Administrator 
C-9
may, in its discretion, provide for the accelerated vesting of any award or awards as and to the extent determined by the Administrator in the circumstances.
The Administrator may adopt such valuation methodologies for outstanding awards as it deems reasonable in the event of a cash or property settlement and, in the case of options, SARs or similar rights, but without limitation on other methodologies, may base such settlement solely upon the excess if any of the per share amount payable upon or in respect of such event over the exercise or base price of the award.
In any of the events referred to in this Section 7.2, the Administrator may take such action contemplated by this Section 7.2 prior to such event (as opposed to on the occurrence of such event) to the extent that the Administrator deems the action necessary to permit the participant to realize the benefits intended to be conveyed with respect to the underlying shares. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrator may deem an acceleration and/or termination to occur immediately prior to the applicable event and, in such circumstances, will reinstate the original terms of the award if an event giving rise to an acceleration and/or termination does not occur.
Without limiting the generality of Section 3.3, any good faith determination by the Administrator pursuant to its authority under this Section 7.2 shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.3 Other Acceleration Rules. The Administrator may override the provisions of Section 7.2 by express provision in the award agreement and may accord any Eligible Person a right to refuse any acceleration, whether pursuant to the award agreement or otherwise, in such circumstances as the Administrator may approve. The portion of any ISO accelerated in connection with an event referred to in Section 7.2 (or such other circumstances as may trigger accelerated vesting of the award) shall remain exercisable as an ISO only to the extent the applicable $100,000 limitation on ISOs is not exceeded. To the extent exceeded, the accelerated portion of the option shall be exercisable as a nonqualified stock option under the Code. 
8. OTHER PROVISIONS 
8.1 Compliance with Laws. This Plan, the granting and vesting of awards under this Plan, the offer, issuance and delivery of Common Shares, and/or the payment of money under this Plan or under awards are subject to compliance with all applicable federal, provincial, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations (including but not limited to provincial, state and federal securities law and federal margin requirements) and to such approvals by any listing, regulatory or governmental authority as may, in the opinion of counsel for the Corporation, be necessary or advisable in connection therewith. The person acquiring any securities under this Plan will, if requested by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, provide such assurances and representations to the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries as the Administrator may deem necessary or desirable to assure compliance with all applicable legal and accounting requirements. 
8.2 No Rights to Award. No person shall have any claim or rights to be granted an award (or additional awards, as the case may be) under this Plan, subject to any express contractual rights (set forth in a document other than this Plan) to the contrary. 
8.3 No Employment/Service Contract. Nothing contained in this Plan (or in any other documents under this Plan or in any award) shall confer upon any Eligible Person or other participant any right to continue in the employ or other service of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, constitute any contract or agreement of employment or other service or affect an employee's status as an employee at will, nor shall interfere in any way with the right of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to change a person's compensation or other benefits, or to terminate his or her employment or other service, with or without cause. Nothing in this Section 8.3, however, is intended to adversely affect any express independent right of such person under a separate employment or service contract other than an award agreement. 
8.4 Plan Not Funded. Awards payable under this Plan shall be payable in shares or from the general assets of the Corporation, and no special or separate reserve, fund or deposit shall be made to assure payment of such awards. No participant, beneficiary or other person shall have any right, title or interest in any fund  
[END TABLE]
C-10
or in any specific asset (including Common Shares, except as expressly otherwise provided) of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries by reason of any award hereunder. Neither the provisions of this Plan (or of any related documents), nor the creation or adoption of this Plan, nor any action taken pursuant to the provisions of this Plan shall create, or be construed to create, a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries and any participant, beneficiary or other person. To the extent that a participant, beneficiary or other person acquires a right to receive payment pursuant to any award hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Corporation.
[BEGIN TABLE]
8.5 Tax Withholding. Upon any exercise, vesting, or payment of any award, or upon the disposition of Common Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO prior to satisfaction of the holding period requirements of Section 422 of the Code, or upon any other tax withholding event with respect to any award, arrangements satisfactory to the Corporation shall be made to provide for any taxes the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries may be required to withhold with respect to such award event or payment. Such arrangements may include (but are not limited to) any one of (or a combination of) the following: 
(a) The Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries shall have the right to require the participant (or the participant's personal representative or beneficiary, as the case may be) to pay or provide for payment of at least the minimum amount of any taxes which the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries may be required to withhold with respect to such award event or payment. 
(b) The Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries shall have the right to deduct from any amount otherwise payable in cash (whether related to the award or otherwise) to the participant (or the participant's personal representative or beneficiary, as the case may be) the minimum amount of any taxes which the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries may be required to withhold with respect to such award event or payment. 
(c) In any case where a tax is required to be withheld in connection with the delivery of Common Shares under this Plan, the Administrator may in its sole discretion (subject to Section 8.1) require or grant (either at the time of the award or thereafter) to the participant the right to elect, pursuant to such rules and subject to such conditions as the Administrator may establish, that the Corporation reduce the number of shares to be delivered by (or otherwise reacquire) the appropriate number of shares, valued in a consistent manner at their fair market value or at the sales price in accordance with authorized procedures for cashless exercises, necessary to satisfy the minimum applicable withholding obligation on exercise, vesting or payment. In no event shall the shares withheld exceed the minimum whole number of shares required for tax withholding under applicable law. 
8.6 Effective Date, Termination and Suspension, Amendments. 
[END TABLE]
8.6.1    Effective Date. This Plan is effective as of May 15, 2015, the date of its approval by the Board (the "Effective Date"). This Plan shall be submitted for and subject to shareholder approval no later than twelve months after the Effective Date. Unless earlier terminated by the Board, this Plan shall terminate at the close of business on the day before the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date. After the termination of this Plan either upon such stated expiration date or its earlier termination by the Board, no additional awards may be granted under this Plan, but previously granted awards (and the authority of the Administrator with respect thereto, including the authority to amend such awards) shall remain outstanding in accordance with their applicable terms and conditions and the terms and conditions of this Plan.
8.6.2    Board Authorization. The Board may, at any time, terminate or, from time to time, amend, modify or suspend this Plan, in whole or in part. No awards may be granted during any period that the Board suspends this Plan.
8.6.3    Shareholder Approval. To the extent then required by applicable law or deemed necessary or advisable by the Board, any amendment to this Plan shall be subject to shareholder approval.
C-11
8.6.4    Amendments to Awards. Without limiting any other express authority of the Administrator under (but subject to) the express limits of this Plan, the Administrator by agreement or resolution may waive conditions of or limitations on awards to participants that the Administrator in the prior exercise of its discretion has imposed, without the consent of a participant, and (subject to the requirements of Sections 3.2 and 8.6.5) may make other changes to the terms and conditions of awards. Any amendment or other action that would constitute a repricing of an award is subject to the limitations set forth in Section 3.2.
8.6.5    Limitations on Amendments to Plan and Awards. No amendment, suspension or termination of this Plan or amendment of any outstanding award agreement shall, without written consent of the participant, affect in any manner materially adverse to the participant any rights or benefits of the participant or obligations of the Corporation under any award granted under this Plan prior to the effective date of such change. Changes, settlements and other actions contemplated by Section 7 shall not be deemed to constitute changes or amendments for purposes of this Section 8.6.
[BEGIN TABLE]
8.7 Privileges of Stock Ownership. Except as otherwise expressly authorized by the Administrator, a participant shall not be entitled to any privilege of stock ownership as to any Common Shares not actually delivered to and held of record by the participant. Except as expressly required by Section 7.1 or otherwise expressly provided by the Administrator, no adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights as a shareholder for which a record date is prior to such date of delivery. 
8.8 Governing Law; Construction; Severability. 
[END TABLE]
8.8.1    Choice of Law. This Plan, the awards, all documents evidencing awards and all other related documents shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California and the federal laws of the United States of America applicable thereto without recourse to their conflict of laws rules.
8.8.2    Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision invalid and unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Plan shall continue in effect.
[BEGIN TABLE]
8.9 Captions. Captions and headings are given to the sections and subsections of this Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of this Plan or any provision thereof.     
8.10 Stock-Based Awards in Substitution for Stock Options or Awards Granted by Other Corporation. Awards may be granted to Eligible Persons in substitution for or in connection with an assumption of employee stock options, SARs, restricted stock or other stock-based awards granted by other entities to persons who are or who will become Eligible Persons in respect of the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, in connection with a distribution, merger or other reorganization by or with the granting entity or an affiliated entity, or the acquisition by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, of all or a substantial part of the stock or assets of the employing entity. The awards so granted need not comply with other specific terms of this Plan, provided the awards reflect only adjustments giving effect to the assumption or substitution consistent with the conversion applicable to the Common Shares in the transaction and any change in the issuer of the security. Any shares that are delivered and any awards that are granted by, or become obligations of, the Corporation, as a result of the assumption by the Corporation of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by an acquired Corporation (or previously granted by a predecessor employer (or direct or indirect parent thereof) in the case of persons that become employed by the Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries in connection with a business or asset acquisition or similar transaction) shall not be counted against the Share Limit or other limits on the number of shares available for issuance under this Plan. 
8.11 Non-Exclusivity of Plan. Nothing in this Plan shall limit or be deemed to limit the authority of the Board or the Administrator to grant awards or authorize any other compensation, with or without reference to the Common Shares, under any other plan or authority. 
[END TABLE]
C-12
[BEGIN TABLE]
8.12 No Corporate Action Restriction. The existence of this Plan, the award agreements and the awards granted hereunder shall not limit, affect or restrict in any way the right or power of the Corporation or any Subsidiary (or any of their respective shareholders, boards of directors or committees thereof, as the case may be) to make or authorize: (a) any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the capital structure or business of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (b) any merger, amalgamation, consolidation or change in the ownership of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (c) any issue of bonds, debentures, capital, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting the capital stock (or the rights thereof) of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (d) any dissolution or liquidation of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, (e) any sale or transfer of all or any part of the assets or business of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, or (f) any other corporate act or proceeding by the Corporation or any Subsidiary. No participant, beneficiary or any other person shall have any claim under any award or award agreement against any member of the Board or the Administrator, or the Corporation or any employees, officers or agents of the Corporation or any Subsidiary, as a result of any such action. 
8.13 Other Company Benefit and Compensation Programs. Payments and other benefits received by a participant under an award made pursuant to this Plan shall not be deemed a part of a participant's compensation for purposes of the determination of benefits under any other employee welfare or benefit plans or arrangements, if any, provided by the Corporation or any Subsidiary, except where the Administrator expressly otherwise provides or authorizes in writing. Awards under this Plan may be made in addition to, in combination with, as alternatives to or in payment of grants, awards or commitments under any other plans or arrangements of the Corporation or its Subsidiaries. 
8.14 Clawback Policy. The awards granted under this Plan are subject to the terms of the Corporation's recoupment, clawback or similar policy as it may be in effect from time to time, as well as any similar provisions of applicable law, any of which could in certain circumstances require repayment or forfeiture of awards or any Common Shares or other cash or property received with respect to the awards (including any value received from a disposition of the shares acquired upon payment of the awards).
