 Compensation  element   Why this element is  included   How the amount of the element is determined    How the element fits in the overall program   
 Base Salary   Fixed base pay necessary to attract and retain executives and compensate performance of core job duties.   Base salary and any changes in salary are based on views of individual retention or performance factors and market data at peer companies (but without specific benchmarking).   Short-term cash compensation that is fixed and paid during the year, addresses employee cash-flow needs and retention objectives.   
 Annual Cash Bonus   Variable cash compensation that motivates executives and ties a significant compensation opportunity to achieving individual and corporate performance goals.   Annual bonus is based on both discretionary and non-discretionary performance criteria.   Short-term cash compensation that is contingent on achievement of Company and individual goals, as determined by the Compensation Committee, is intended to link compensation to short-term stockholder interests.   
 Long-Term Equity Incentive   Equity compensation (in the form of restricted stock units ("RSUs") and options) fosters long-term retention of management and aligns executive officer and stockholder interests.    Long-term equity incentive awards are determined primarily based on how the award's grant date value relates to the executive officer's total cash compensation and how the vesting and other aspects of the award might incentivize performance.    Long-term compensation that is tied to the value of Common Stock and is primarily contingent on meeting performance goals and continued employment, which is intended to link compensation to long-term stockholder value accretion and reinforces retention.  
 Equity compensation complements cash compensation and provides performance incentives.    
     RSUs may be subject to both performance-based and service-based vesting or performance-based vesting only.          
     Options may be subject to service-based vesting.          
 Deferred compensation plan   Supplemental element to assist in retaining executives.   Executive officers may defer up to 100% of their base salary and bonus.   A tax planning benefit for executives.
