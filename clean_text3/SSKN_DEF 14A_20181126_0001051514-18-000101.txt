PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE
2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THIS PROXY MATERIAL AND VOTING
Why am I receiving these materials?
We sent you this Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card because the Board of Directors of STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc. ("we", "us", "our", or "the Company") is soliciting your proxy to vote at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"). You are invited to attend the Annual Meeting, and we request that you vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement. You do not need to attend the meeting to vote your shares. Instead, you may simply complete, sign and return the enclosed proxy card, or you may grant a proxy to vote your shares by means of the telephone or on the Internet.
We intend to mail this Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy card together with our 2017 Annual Report to Stockholders on or about November 26, 2018 to all stockholders of record on November 19, 2018 entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Each share of common stock outstanding on the record date will be entitled to one vote.
Who can vote at the Annual Meeting?
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on November 19, 2018 will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. On this record date, there were 29,943,086 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote.
Stockholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name
If on November 19, 2018 your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, then you are a stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or vote by proxy.
Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of a Broker or Bank
If on November 19, 2018 your shares were held not in your name, but rather in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered to be the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent on how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. Since you are not the stockholder of record, however, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker or other agent.
What am I voting on?
There are two matters scheduled for a vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 1  election of seven directors; and  
 1  election of seven directors; and  
2   ratification of BDO USA LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.    
[END TABLE]
How do I vote?
You may either vote "For" all the nominees to the Board of Directors or you may "Withhold" your vote for any nominee you specify. For each of the other matters you may vote "For" or "Against" or abstain from voting. Procedures for voting are fairly simple:
Stockholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting, or vote by proxy using the enclosed proxy card or via the Internet or telephone (see "- Voting Via the Internet or by Telephone" below). If you vote by proxy, your shares will be voted as you specify on the proxy card. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person if you have already voted by proxy.
- 1 -
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To vote in person, come to the Annual Meeting, and we will give you a ballot when you arrive.  
• To vote in person, come to the Annual Meeting, and we will give you a ballot when you arrive.  
• To vote using the enclosed proxy card, simply complete, sign and date the enclosed proxy card and return it promptly in the envelope provided. If you return your signed proxy card to us before the Annual Meeting, we will vote your shares as you direct.   
[END TABLE]
The telephone and Internet voting procedures below are designed to authenticate stockholders' identities, to allow stockholders to grant a proxy to vote their shares and to confirm that stockholders' instructions have been recorded properly. Stockholders granting a proxy to vote via the Internet should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and telephone companies, which must be borne by the stockholder.
Stockholders of record may go to www.proxyvote.com to grant a proxy to vote their shares by means of the Internet. They will be required to provide the control number contained on their proxy cards. Any stockholder using a touch-tone telephone may also grant a proxy to vote shares by calling 1 -800-690-6903 and following the operator's instructions.
General Information for All Shares Voted Via the Internet or by Telephone
Votes submitted via the Internet or by telephone must be received by 11:59 p.m. EST on December 26, 2018. Submitting your proxy via the Internet or by telephone will not affect your right to vote in person should you decide to attend the Annual Meeting.
Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of Broker or Bank
If you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank, or other agent, you should have received a proxy card and voting instructions with these proxy materials from that organization rather than from us. Simply complete and mail the proxy card or voting instructions as instructed by your broker, bank or other agent to ensure that your vote is counted. To vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker, bank, or other agent. Follow the instructions from your broker, bank or other agent included with these proxy materials, or contact your broker, bank or other agent to request a proxy form.
Most beneficial owners whose stock is held in street name receive instructions for granting proxies from their banks, brokers or other agents, rather than the proxy card.
How many votes do I have?
On each matter to be voted upon, you have one vote for each share of our common stock you own as of November 19, 2018.
What if I return a proxy card but do not make specific choices?
Stockholder of Record: Shares Registered in Your Name
If you are a stockholder of record and you sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then the proxy holders will vote your shares in the manner recommended by the Board of Directors on the matters presented in this Proxy Statement and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion for any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting.
Beneficial Owner: Shares Registered in the Name of Broker or Bank
If your shares are held in an account at a bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or other similar organization, then you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name. In that case, you will have received these proxy materials from that organization holding your account and, as a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct your broker, bank, trustee, or nominee how to vote the shares held in your account. If no voting instructions are given, your broker or nominee has discretionary authority to vote your shares on your behalf on routine matters as determined in accordance with NYSE Rule 452 by The New York Stock Exchange. A "broker non-vote" results on a matter when your broker or nominee returns a proxy but does not vote on a particular proposal because it does not have discretionary authority to vote on that proposal and has not received voting instructions from you. We believe that your broker or nominee may not have discretionary voting power with respect to Proposal No. 1 to be considered at this meeting. You may not vote shares held in street name at the annual meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from that organization holding your account.
- 2 -
Who is paying for this proxy solicitation?
We will pay for the entire cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to these mailed and posted proxy materials, we will bear the cost of proxies solicited by the Board of Directors. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, solicitation may be made personally or by telephone or electronic communication by our directors, officers and employees, none of whom will receive additional compensation for these services. We will also reimburse brokers and other nominees for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with distributing forms of proxies and proxy materials to the beneficial owners of common stock.
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card?
If you receive more than one proxy card, your shares are registered in more than one name or are registered in different accounts. Please complete, sign and return each proxy card to ensure that all of your shares are voted.
Can I change my vote after submitting my proxy?
Yes. You may revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the meeting. If you are the record holder of your shares, you may revoke your proxy in any one of four ways:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· you may submit a proxy with a later date that is received by us prior to the Annual Meeting;  
· you may send a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to our Secretary at 5 Walnut Grove Drive, Suite 140, Horsham, Pennsylvania 19044;  
· you may vote by telephone or via the Internet; or  
· you may attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. Simply attending the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held by your broker or bank as a nominee or agent, you must follow the instructions provided by your broker or bank.
When are stockholder proposals due for next year's annual meeting?
Under Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), our stockholders may present proper proposals for inclusion in our Proxy Statement and for consideration at the next annual meeting of stockholders by submitting their proposals to us in a timely manner. In order to be considered for inclusion in the Proxy Statement distributed to stockholders prior to the annual meeting of stockholders in the year 2019, a stockholder proposal must be received by us no later than July 30, 2019 and must otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8.
In order to be considered for presentation at the annual meeting of stockholders in the year 2019, although not included in the Proxy Statement, a stockholder proposal or nomination(s) must comply with the requirements of our Fifth Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") and be received by us no later than the close of business on July 30, 2019; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the 2019 annual meeting is more than thirty (30) days before or more than sixty (60) days after December 27, 2019, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual meeting or the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by us. Stockholder proposals should be delivered in writing to STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc., 5 Walnut Grove Drive, Suite 140, Horsham, Pennsylvania 19044, Attention: Secretary. A copy of our Bylaws may be obtained from us upon written request to the Secretary.
How are votes counted?
Votes will be counted by the Inspector of Elections appointed for the meeting, who will separately tabulate "For", "Against" and "Withhold" votes, abstentions and broker non-votes.
How many votes are needed to approve each proposal?
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal No. 1, the election of directors, the seven nominees receiving the most "For" votes (among votes properly cast in person or by proxy) will be elected. Broker non-votes will count towards the quorum but will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. Stockholders do not have the right to cumulate their votes for directors.  
• Proposal No. 2, the ratification of BDO USA LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, must receive a "For" vote from the majority of shares present and entitled to vote either in person or by proxy to be approved. Abstentions will have the same effect as an "Against" vote. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote.  
[END TABLE]
- 3 -
What is the quorum requirement?
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will be present if at least one-third of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote are represented by votes at the Annual Meeting or by proxy. On the record date, there were 29,943,086 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote.
Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or other nominee) or if you vote in person at the meeting or by telephone or via the Internet. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the quorum requirement. If there is no quorum, the chairman of the meeting or a majority of the votes present at the Annual Meeting may adjourn the meeting to another date.
How can I find out the results of the voting at the Annual Meeting?
Preliminary voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. Final voting results will be published in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by us within four business days of the Annual Meeting.
How can I obtain additional copies?

BACKGROUND – THE COMPANY
We are a medical technology company in Dermatology and Plastic Surgery dedicated to developing, commercializing and marketing innovative products for the treatment of dermatologic conditions. Its products include the XTRAC® excimer laser and VTRAC® lamp systems utilized in the treatment of psoriasis, vitiligo and various other skin conditions; and the STRATAPEN® MicroSystem, marketed specifically for the intended use of micropigmentation.
The XTRAC is an ultraviolet light excimer laser system utilized to treat psoriasis, vitiligo and other skin diseases. The XTRAC received clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") in 2000. As of September 30, 2018, there were 746 XTRAC systems placed in dermatologists' offices in the United States under the Company's recurring revenue business model. The XTRAC systems deployed under the recurring revenue model generate revenue on a per procedure basis or include a fixed payment over an agreed upon period with a capped number of treatments, which if exceeded would incur additional fees. The per-procedure charge is inclusive of the use of the system and the services provided by the Company to the customer which includes system maintenance, and other services. The VTRAC Excimer Lamp system, offered in addition to the XTRAC system internationally, provides targeted therapeutic efficacy demonstrated by excimer technology with a lamp system.
During 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to license the Nordlys product line from Ellipse A/S. In 2018, the Company determined we would no longer market the line. In June, following the financing, the Company wrote down all inventory and fixed assets related to the product line to the net realizable value and recorded an expense of $280 in cost of revenues.
Effective February 1, 2017, the Company entered into an exclusive OEM distribution agreement with Esthetic Education, LLC to be the exclusive marketer and seller of private label versions of the SkinStylus MicroSystem and associated parts under the name of STRATAPEN. This three-year agreement allows for two one-year extensions.
The following financial data, in this narrative, is expressed in thousands, except for XTRAC systems and share information.
Recent Developments
Equity Financing
On March 30, 2018, we entered into multiple agreements in order to obtain $17,000 of equity financing from the following sources:
On May 29, 2018, we completed the sale and issuance (the "Financing") of 15,740,741 shares of the Company's common stock, subject to customary post-closing adjustments, to Accelmed Growth Partners L.P. ("Accelmed"), Broadfin Capital ("Broadfin"), Sabby Management ("Sabby"), Gohan Investments, Ltd. and Dr. Dolev Rafaeli, our President and Chief Executive Officer, for gross proceeds of $17.0 million at a per share price of $1.08.  The various stock purchase agreements were entered into on March 30, 2018 (collectively, the "Agreements").
We incurred $2,336 of costs related to the Financing during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, which have been offset against the proceeds in the accompanying financial statement. These costs included $500 to Accelmed for legal fees, consulting, due diligence and administrative costs related to the stock purchase agreement.
- 4 -
In further consideration of entering into their respective stock purchase agreements, Sabby and Broadfin have each entered into separate agreements restricting their abilities to sell their holdings (the "Leak-Out Agreements"). Under the terms of each of the respective Leak-Out Agreements, the stockholder has agreed that from the later of (a) the date that the approval by the shareholders of the transactions is deemed effective and (b) the closing of the transactions contemplated pursuant to the SPA, the stockholder shall not sell dispose or otherwise transfer, directly or indirectly, (including, without limitation, any sales, short sales, swaps or any derivative transactions that would be equivalent to any sales or short positions) any shares of common stock of the Company held by the stockholder on the date hereof or issuable to the stockholder upon conversion of shares of the Company's Series C Preferred Stock held by the stockholder on the date hereof, (a) if prior to April 1, 2019, at a price per share of the Company's common stock less than $1.296, subject to adjustment for reverse and forward stock splits and the like, or (b) thereafter, at a price per share reflecting less than the price set forth on the schedule in the Leak-Out Agreements subject to adjustment for reverse and forward stock splits and the like, unless, (1) in the case of either clauses (a) or (b), otherwise approved by the Company's Board of Directors, (2) in the case of clause (b), under a shelf prospectus or such other controlled offering as may be agreed to by the Principal Stockholders (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) or (3) in the case of either clauses (a) or (b), in a sale pursuant to which any other stockholder(s) of the Company are offered the same terms of sale, including in a merger, consolidation, transfer or conversion involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
In addition, Sabby and Broadfin delivered to us a voting undertaking obligating Sabby and Broadfin to increase their respective "blocker" to 9.99% prior to the record date for the meeting of the shareholders.
On May 23, 2018, we held a special meeting of stockholders where the stockholders approved, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rules 5635(b) and (d), the issuance of an aggregate of 15,740,741 shares of the Company's common stock pursuant to refinancing, plus all additional shares that may be issued pursuant to the Retained Risk Provisions, as defined in the agreements
The investors in the Financing may receive additional shares, in the event of certain contingencies, as described in the Stock Purchase Agreements. At the closing, the Company determined certain contingencies had been met and in July 2018, the Company issued 153,004 shares associated with those contingencies. Since the share amounts were known at the close of the financing the Company included these shares in Common Stock Issuable as of September 30, 2018. There are additional contingencies included in the SPA's but the Company has determined they are not probable or estimable at this time.
In connection with the Agreements, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") with the Investors to prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement covering the shares of common stock issued in the Financing. The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3, which became effective on September 24, 2018.
MidCap Credit Facility
On May 29, 2018, we entered into a Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the "Amendment"), pursuant to which the Company repaid $3.0 million in principal of the existing $10.6 million credit facility established with MidCap in 2015. The terms of the credit facility have been amended to impose less restrictive covenants and lower prepayment and exit fees for the Company. The Amendment modified the principal payments payable under the Credit Agreement including a period of 18 months where there are no principal payments due. The interest rate on the credit facility is one-month LIBOR plus 7.25%. Principal payments begin December 2019. Principal and interest payments beginning December 2019 are $252. The Company was in compliance with the covenant as of September 30, 2018.
Change of Control
The closing of the transactions contemplated by Agreements (the "Transactions") and the issuance of shares of Common Stock to the purchasers resulted in a change of control of the Company and a change in management and composition of the Company's Board of Directors. Following the Transactions, Accelmed controls a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock. As of November 1, 2018, Accelmed holds (a) approximately 40% of the issued and outstanding voting stock of the Company and (b) approximately 36% of the Company's issued and outstanding capital stock, assuming the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Company's Series C Preferred Stock (but excluding the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants).
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the ownership of our common stock, par value $0.001, as of November 1, 2018 by: (i) each director and nominee for director; (ii) each of our executive officers who are named in the Summary Compensation Table presented herein; (iii) all of our executive officers and directors as a group; and (iv) all those known by us to be beneficial owners of more than five percent of its common stock.
Except as indicated by footnote, and subject to community property laws, where applicable, the persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Independence of the Board of Directors
As required under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ"), a majority of the members of a listed company's Board of Directors must qualify as "independent," as affirmatively determined by the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors consults with our counsel to ensure that the Board of Director's determinations are consistent with all relevant securities and other laws and regulations regarding the definition of "independent," including those set forth in pertinent listing standards of NASDAQ, as are in effect from time to time.
Consistent with these considerations, after review of all relevant transactions or relationships between each director, or any of his or her family members, and us, its senior management and its independent registered public accounting firm, the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that the majority of our directors and director nominees are independent directors within the meaning of the applicable NASDAQ listing standards. Except for Dr. Rafaeli, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Navarro, who received consulting fees ending in 2017, all other current members of the Board of Directors are independent under the applicable listing standards of NASDAQ.
Board Leadership Structure
Our Board of Directors administers its risk oversight function as a whole by making risk oversight a matter of collective consideration. While management is responsible for identifying risks, our Board of Directors has charged the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors with evaluating financial and accounting risk, the Compensation/Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors with evaluating risks associated with employees and compensation. Investor-related risks are usually addressed by the Board as a whole.
The Board of Directors met fifteen times during the last fiscal year. During the last fiscal year, the Audit Committee met four times, the Compensation Committee met three times and the Nominating and Governance Committee met five times. Prior to July 2018, the Nominating and Governance Committee was a separate committee. All directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate meetings of the Board of Directors and the committees on which they served that were held during the period in which they were a director and a committee member.
Information Regarding the Board of Directors and its Committees
Our Board of Directors has an Audit Committee and a Compensation/Nominating and Governance Committee. The following table provides membership information for each of these committees:

Below is a description of each committee of the Board of Directors. Each of the committees has authority to engage independent advisors, as it deems appropriate to carry out its responsibilities. The Board of Directors has determined that each member of each committee meets the applicable rules and regulations regarding "independence" and that each member is free of any relationship that would interfere with his or her individual exercise of independent judgment with regard to us.

Mr. Gill chairs this committee and has been designated as the "Audit Committee financial expert" under Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. The Board of Directors determined in 2018 that each of member of the Audit Committee satisfies the independence and other composition requirements of the SEC and NASDAQ.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed the audited financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 with management, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing, approving and managing the engagement of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, including the scope, extent and procedures of the annual audit and compensation to be paid therefore, and all other matters the Audit Committee deems appropriate, including the Company's independent registered public accounting firm's accountability to the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviewed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, its judgment as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee by the Standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), including PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications With Audit Committees , the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and other applicable regulations, and discussed and reviewed the results of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm's examination of the financial statements. In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the independent registered public accounting firm's independence from management and the Company, including the matters in the written disclosures and the letter regarding its independence by Rule 3526 of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. The Audit Committee also considered whether the provision of non-audit services was compatible with maintaining the independent registered public accounting firm's independence.
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for its audits, and received from them written disclosures and letter regarding their independence. The Audit Committee meets with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of its examinations, its evaluations of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. The Audit Committee held four meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board of Directors has approved) that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee has also retained BDO USA LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.

In addition, Mr. McCaney was granted options to purchase up to 1,550,000 shares of our common stock, having a term of ten years, as follows: (i) 542,500 shares vesting in three substantially equal installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of October 31, 2016; and (ii) up to 1,007,500 shares vesting in three substantially equal annual installments upon a determination by our Board that we have achieved the following milestones for each of the 2017, 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, respectively: (A) one-third if we achieve the revenue plan established by our Board for such year, (B) one-third if we achieve the EBITDA plan established by our Board for such year, and (C) one-third if we achieve the goals established by our Board for such year; provided that any such stock option that has not vested with respect to any particular year due to the failure to satisfy a milestone condition for that year will terminate as of the end of that year and will no longer become exercisable. If (i) we undergo a change of control before the stock option vests in full and (ii) Mr. McCaney is not offered post-change of control employment by us or any successor entity, or if offered such post-change of control employment and Mr. McCaney terminates his employment for good reason (as those terms are defined in the employment agreement) within a period of 30 days after the date of the change of control, conditioned upon his execution of a release satisfactory to us, all such stock options that have not previously terminated shall accelerate and shall vest in full upon the effective date of the termination of Mr. McCaney's employment.

The non-cash payments are paid in the form of restricted stock units vesting equally in quarterly tranches over 12 months. Any cash payments are to be paid each quarter in advance.
Limitation on Directors' Liabilities; Indemnification of Officers and Directors
Our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended ("Certificate of Incorporation") and bylaws designate the relative duties and responsibilities of our officers, establish procedures for actions by directors and stockholders and other items. Our Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws also contain extensive indemnification provisions, which will permit us to indemnify our officers and directors to the maximum extent provided by Delaware law. Pursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation and under Delaware law, our directors are not liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty, except for (i) any breach of the director's duty of loyalty; (ii) acts for omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; breach of duty with respect to dividends and other distributions; or (iv) any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance
We have obtained directors' and officers' liability insurance, which expires on May 29, 2019. We are required under our indemnification agreements to maintain such insurance for us and members of our Board of Directors.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
Sabby Management, LLC and Broadfin Capital LLC 2015 through 2017 Transactions
On June 22, 2015, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with the Purchasers, including certain funds managed by Sabby Management, LLC and Broadfin Capital LLC (existing Company shareholders), in connection with a private placement. The Purchasers were issued Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 0.6 million shares of common stock, having an exercise price of $3.75 per share. We also issued $32.5 million aggregate principal amount of Debentures that, subject to certain ownership limitations and stockholder approval conditions, were convertible into 8,666,668 shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $3.75 per share. The Debentures were bearing interest at the rate of 2.25% per year, and, unless previously converted, were to mature on the five-year anniversary of the date of issuance. On September 30, 2015, the Company repriced outstanding Warrants held by certain investors to reduce the exercise price to $3.75 per share.
In connection with this financing, we also granted to the Purchasers resale registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the Debentures and the Warrants pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement. In addition to the registration rights, the Selling Stockholders are entitled to receive liquidated damages upon the occurrence of a number of events relating to filing, becoming effective and maintaining an effective registration statement covering the shares underlying the Debentures and the Warrants. The liquidated damages will be payable upon the occurrence of each of those events and each monthly anniversary thereof until cured. The amount of liquidated damages payable is equal to 2.0% of the aggregate purchase price paid by each Purchaser, provided, however, the maximum aggregate liquidated damages payable to a Purchaser shall be 12% of the aggregate subscription amount paid by such Purchaser pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The liquidated damages shall accrue interest at a rate of 12% per annum (or such lesser maximum amount that is permitted to be paid by applicable law), accruing on a daily basis for each event until such event is cured.
- 14 -
The Registration Rights Agreement requires us to file one or more registration statements for all of the securities that may be issued upon conversion of the Debentures and exercise of the Warrants issued to the Purchasers. Pursuant to the applicable transaction documents, however, certain Purchasers may not exercise their conversion/exercise rights for that number of shares of common stock which, together with all other shares owned by that Purchaser and its affiliates would result in more than 9.99% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock calculated on the basis of the then outstanding shares.
On September 20, 2017, the Company announced the closing of an exchange transaction pursuant to the Securities Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") dated as of June 7, 2017 between the Company and holders of its 2.25% Senior Series A Secured Convertible Debentures due June 30, 2021 and 4% Senior Secured Convertible Debentures due July 30, 2021 (collectively, the "Debentures"). In closing the exchange transaction under the Exchange Agreement, the holders of the Debentures exchanged the Debentures, having an aggregate principal amount of approximately $40.5 million, into 40,482 shares (the "Preferred Shares") of the Company's newly created Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. The Preferred Shares are convertible into a total of approximately 15,049,000 shares of the Company's common stock. Each Preferred Share has a stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $2.69. The Company included the Exchange Agreement as an exhibit to its Form 8-K current report, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on June 7, 2017. The Company relied upon the exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") afforded by Section 3(a)(9) of the 1933 Act, i.e., the exchange of the Debentures for the Preferred Shares in which no commission or other remuneration was paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting such exchange. In connection with the closing under the Exchange Agreement, on September 20, 2017, the Company filed a Certificate of Designations with the Delaware Secretary of State setting forth the rights, preferences and privileges of the Company's Series C Convertible Preferred Stock.
Modevity and Director Coyne
During 2017, Modevity LLC ("Modevity"), the developer of the ARALOC Secure Content Distribution Platform, a software system for sharing proprietary and / or confidential content files over the internet and allowing its users to collaborate securely from any mobile or desktop device, has provided certain consulting services to the Company advising on the development of our digital media and marketing initiatives, including providing assistance in our first limited test of targeted advertising using Facebook. Our Board member, James Coyne, has been the Chief Executive Officer of Modevity since helping to found the company in April 2004. To date, Modevity has provided this assistance without charge to the Company. Should the Company continue to utilize Modevity's services, we expect to be charged at market rates for such assistance. Independent of these services provided by Modevity, in November 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Olympic Media, a company founded by Ryan Coyne, the son of James Coyne, to create and execute a focused tactical plan to leverage new and existing digital assets across social and digital platforms to drive psoriasis and vitiligo sufferers to the Company's website and call center for conversion to new patient appointments. The agreement with Olympic Media provides for no minimum payments or other financial commitments and is terminable by either party without penalty on ten days written notice. James Coyne has no financial interest in Olympic Media.
2018 Accelmed Led Investment
On March 30, 2018, the Company entered into the Accelmed Purchase Agreement with Accelmed, pursuant to which Accelmed has agreed to invest $13.0 million to purchase upon closing 12,037,037 shares of the Company's common stock at a price per share of $1.08. The Company may incur additional expenses, or Accelmed may receive additional shares in the event of certain contingencies. The Company is required to reimburse Accelmed for its legal, consulting, due diligence and certain costs related to the proposed transaction, including the reasonable legal fees, disbursements and related charges of Accelmed's counsel in an aggregate amount not to exceed $400,000 (or up to $500,000 in the event of certain contingencies, and subject to no cap in the event the Company's stockholders do not approve the transaction) at the earliest of (i) the closing, or (ii) the termination of Accelmed Purchase Agreement for any reason other than by reason of a breach of the Accelmed Purchase Agreement by Accelmed.
Upon closing under the Accelmed Purchase Agreement, Accelmed controlled a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock.
The Accelmed Purchase Agreement also requires that the Company indemnify Accelmed for certain items as defined in Accelmed Purchase Agreement, which may result in the issuance of additional shares of the Company's common stock to the Investors in the event the Company incurs additional cash obligations above the thresholds contained in the Accelmed purchase Agreement, including excess amounts from sales taxes, broker fees, insurance coverage and legal fees (the "Retained Risk Provisions"). Pursuant to the Retained Risk provisions, Accelmed received an additional 75,590 shares.
Broadfin and Sabby Purchase Agreements
In connection with the Accelmed investment, the Company entered into two separate stock purchase agreements on March 30, 2018, each for $1.0 million with two then current stockholders, Broadfin and Sabby. Upon closing of these transactions with the closing under the Accelmed Purchase Agreement, each of Sabby and Broadfin received 925,926 shares of the Company's common stock at a price per share of $1.08. Under the Retained Risk Provisions of the agreements, Broadfin received an additional 41,759 shares and Sabby received an additional 24,027 shares.

The Company also entered into two separate subscription agreements in connection with the Accelmed investment: (i) a subscription agreement with Gohan Investments, Ltd. for $1.0 million to purchase 925,926 shares of our common stock at $1.08 per share; and (ii) a subscription agreement with Dr. Dolev Rafaeli for $1.0 million to purchase 925,926 shares of our common stock at $1.08 per share upon closing under the Accelmed Purchase Agreement.
Pursuant to the Retained Risk Provisions, each of Gohan Investments and Dr. Rafaeli received an additional 5,814 shares.

The audit reports by EisnerAmper on the financial statements of the Company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and were not modified or qualified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
During the Company's two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and throughout the subsequent interim period through October 8, 2018, there were no (1) disagreements (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K between the Company and EisnerAmper on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of EisnerAmper, would have caused EisnerAmper to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports on the consolidated financial statements for such fiscal years, or (2) any "reportable events" as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has selected BDO USA LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 and has further directed that the Board of Directors submit the selection of BDO USA LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for ratification by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting.

If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if they determine that such a change would be in the best interests of us and our stockholders.

Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services
Consistent with the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee charter requires that the Audit Committee review and pre-approve all audit services and permitted non-audit services provided by the independent auditors to us or any of our subsidiaries. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to a member of the Audit Committee and if it does, the decisions of that member must be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
The Audit Committee's pre-approval policy provides as follows:
· First, once a year when the base audit engagement is reviewed and approved, management will identify all other services (including fee ranges) for which management knows it will engage BDO USA LLP for the next 12 months. Those services typically include quarterly reviews, specified tax matters, certifications to the lenders as required by financing documents, consultation on new accounting and disclosure standards and, in future years, reporting on management's internal controls assessment.
· Second, if any new "unlisted" proposed engagement arises during the year, the engagement will require approval of the Audit Committee.
All fees to our independent accounting firm were approved by the Audit Committee.
HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.
A single proxy statement may be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that it will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you notify your broker or the Company that you no longer wish to participate in "householding." If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual report in the future you may notify your broker or direct your written request to: STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc., 5 Walnut Grove Drive, Suite 140, Horsham, Pennsylvania 19044, Attention: Secretary. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their address and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their broker. In addition, we will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the annual report and proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered.
