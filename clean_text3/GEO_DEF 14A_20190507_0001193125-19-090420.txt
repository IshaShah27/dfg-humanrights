Dear Shareholder: 
You are cordially invited to attend the 2019 annual meeting of the shareholders of The GEO Group, Inc. We will hold the meeting virtually, conducted via live audio webcast on Tuesday, May 7, 2019, at 10:00 A.M. (EDT). 
This year we are furnishing proxy materials to our shareholders primarily on the Internet rather than mailing paper copies of the materials to each shareholder. As a result, most of you will receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of paper copies of this proxy statement and our annual report. The notice contains instructions on how to access the proxy statement and the annual report over the Internet, as well as instructions on how to request a paper copy of our proxy materials. This process significantly lowers the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials. On or about March 28, 2019, we mailed to shareholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. 
Your vote is very important to us. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting virtually, your shares should be represented and voted. After reading the enclosed proxy statement, please vote your shares as soon as possible. Shareholders may vote via the Internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/GEO2019, by telephone, or by completing and returning a proxy card. Submitting a vote before the annual meeting will not preclude you from voting virtually at the meeting should you decide to attend. If you wish to participate in the meeting, please refer to page 52 for additional guidelines. 
Sincerely, 
George C. Zoley 
Chairman of the Board, 
Chief Executive Officer and Founder

The Notice of Internet Availability provides instructions as to how shareholders can access the Proxy Materials online, contains a listing of matters to be considered at the meeting, and sets forth instructions as to how shares can be voted. Shares must be voted either by telephone, online or by completing and returning a proxy card. Shares cannot be voted by marking, writing on and/or returning the Notice of Internet Availability. Any Notices of Internet Availability that are returned will not be counted as votes.

Telephone: (561) 893-0101 
March 28, 2019 
The GEO Group, Inc. ("GEO," the "Company," "we" or "us") is furnishing this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our board of directors (the "Board") for use at the annual meeting of shareholders on May 7, 2019, at 10:00 A.M., Eastern Daylight Time. This year's annual meeting will be a virtual meeting of shareholders, conducted via live audio webcast. You will be able to attend the Annual Meeting online, vote your shares electronically and submit your questions during the Annual Meeting via a live audio webcast by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/GEO2019. Please note that the proxy card provides a means to withhold authority to vote for any individual director nominee. Also note that the format of the proxy card provides an opportunity to specify your choice between approval, disapproval or abstention with respect to the proposals indicated on the proxy card. A proxy card which is properly executed, returned and not revoked will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated. A proxy voted by telephone or the Internet and not revoked will be voted in accordance with the shareholder's instructions. If no instructions are given, proxies that are signed and returned or voted by telephone or the Internet will be voted as follows: 
"FOR" the election of the nominated directors for the ensuing year; 
"FOR" the proposal to ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as the independent registered public accountants of GEO for the fiscal year 2019; 
"FOR" the advisory approval of the resolution on named executive officer compensation; and 
"AGAINST" the shareholder proposal regarding an annual Human Rights Report, if properly presented before the meeting. 
Under New York Stock Exchange rules, brokerage firms have authority to vote shares on routine matters for which their customers do not provide voting instructions. The ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accountants for 2019 is considered a routine matter. As a result, if you hold your shares through a broker and do not direct the broker how to vote your shares on this routine matter, your broker may vote the shares on your behalf. 
Under New York Stock Exchange rules, the election of directors, the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation and the shareholder proposal are not considered a routine matter. As a result, if a brokerage firm does not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of shares held by the firm, those shares will not be voted and will be considered broker non-votes with respect to those matters. A broker non-vote will have no effect on the election of directors, the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation and the shareholder proposal. 
This proxy statement, the notice of annual meeting, the proxy card and our 2018 annual report will be mailed or made accessible via the Internet on or about March 28, 2019. 
Management is not aware of any other matters to be presented for action by shareholders at the annual meeting. 
Holders of GEO common stock at the close of business on February 26, 2019, the record date, will be entitled to one vote for each share of common stock outstanding in their name on the books of GEO at that date. On February 26, 2019, GEO had 120,727,325 shares of common stock outstanding. 
The presence, in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the record date will constitute a quorum for purposes of the annual meeting. The election of   directors requires a majority of the votes cast. The appointment of Grant Thornton LLP will be ratified if the number of votes cast in favor of ratification exceeds the number of votes cast against ratification. The advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation will be approved if the number of votes cast in favor of approval exceeds the number of votes cast against approval.    The shareholder proposal will be approved if the number of votes cast in favor of approval exceeds the number cast against approval. Shares of common stock represented by proxies that reflect abstentions or "broker non-votes" (i.e., shares held by a broker or nominee which are represented at the annual meeting, but with respect to which such broker or nominee is not empowered to vote on a particular proposal) will be counted as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the proposal but will not be counted as "votes cast" with respect to the election of directors, the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation and the shareholder proposal. If less than the majority of the outstanding shares of common stock are represented at the annual meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the annual meeting to another date and time. 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Shareholder

2018 Annual Report to Shareholders are available at www.proxyvote.com.

The costs of preparation, assembly and mailing this proxy statement and the accompanying materials will be borne by GEO. GEO will also pay the cost of soliciting your proxy and reimbursing brokerage firms and others for forwarding proxy materials to you. Certain of GEO's officers, directors and employees may participate in the solicitation of proxies by mail, personal interview, letter, fax and telephone without additional consideration.  PROPOSAL 1: 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Director Nominees 
GEO's board of directors is currently comprised of seven (7) members. All of the nominees are presently directors of GEO. Except for Messrs. Kernan and Van Hauwermeiren who were appointed to GEO's board of directors subsequent to GEO's 2018 annual meeting, all nominees were elected by the shareholders at GEO's 2018 annual meeting. 
If instructed, the persons named on the accompanying proxy card will vote for the election of the nominees named below to serve for the ensuing year and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. If any nominee for director shall become unavailable (which management has no reason to believe will be the case), it is intended that the shares represented by the enclosed proxy card will be voted for any such replacement or substitute nominee as may be nominated by the board of directors.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, ITS COMMITTEES AND OTHER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE INFORMATION 
GEO's board of directors held nine meetings during fiscal year 2018. Each director attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the board of directors and of the meetings held by all board committees on which such director served. 
Director Independence 
Pursuant to the corporate governance standards applicable to companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), the board of directors must be comprised of a majority of directors who qualify as independent directors. In determining independence, each year the board of directors affirmatively determines whether directors have a "material relationship" with GEO. When assessing the "materiality" of a director's relationship with GEO, the board of directors considers all relevant facts and circumstances, not merely from the director's standpoint, but also from that of the persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation. An independent director is free from any relationship with GEO that may impair the director's ability to make independent judgments. Particular attention is paid to whether the director is independent from management and, with respect to organizations affiliated with a director with which GEO does business, the frequency and regularity of the business conducted, and whether the business is carried out at arm's length on substantially the same terms to GEO as those prevailing at the time from unrelated third parties for comparable business transactions. Material relationships can include commercial, banking, industrial, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable and familial relationships. 
Applying the NYSE's independence standards, the board of directors has determined that, Anne N. Foreman, Richard H. Glanton, Guido Van Hauwermeiren, Christopher C. Wheeler and Julie Myers Wood qualify as independent under the NYSE's corporate governance standards, and that the board of directors is therefore comprised of a majority of independent directors. The board of directors' determination that each of these directors is independent was based on the fact that none of the directors had a material relationship with GEO outside of such person's position as a director, including a relationship that would disqualify such director from being considered independent under the NYSE's listing standards.  Committees 
Under our corporate governance guidelines, the board of directors has established eight standing committees. The members of the board of directors serving on these committees and the functions of those committees are set forth below.

[END TABLE]
 In fulfilling the committee's duties to identify and recommend candidates for election to our board of directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the mix of skills, experience, character, commitment, and diversity — diversity being broadly construed to mean a variety of opinions, perspectives and backgrounds, such as gender, race and ethnicity differences, as well as other differentiating characteristics, all in the context of the requirements of our board of directors at the time of election. 
Executive Committee 
Periodically during fiscal year 2018, members of the Executive Committee informally discussed various matters relating to GEO's business. The Executive Committee has full authority to exercise all the powers of the board of directors between meetings of the board of directors, except as reserved by the board of directors. During 2018, the Executive Committee acted four times through resolutions adopted at duly convened meetings or by unanimous written consent. All actions taken by the Executive Committee in 2018 were ratified by the board of directors at their next quarterly meeting. 
Corporate Planning Committee 
The Corporate Planning Committee periodically reviews with management various corporate strategic initiatives, including potential merger and acquisition activities, business expansion issues and corporate finance matters. 
Operations and Oversight Committee 
The Operations and Oversight Committee reviews with management various issues relating to our operations that may arise from time to time. 
Legal Steering Committee 
The Legal Steering Committee reviews with management strategic issues with respect to material litigation and other discrete legal issues. 
Independent Committee 
The Independent Committee considers matters that may arise from time to time that the board of directors designates for independent director review. 
Director Identification and Selection 
The processes for director selection and director qualifications are set forth in Section 3 of our Corporate Governance Guidelines. The board of directors, acting on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, will nominate a slate of director candidates for election at each annual meeting of shareholders and will elect directors to fill vacancies, including vacancies created as a result of any increase in the size of the board, between annual meetings. Nominees for director are selected on the basis of outstanding achievement in their personal careers, broad experience, wisdom, integrity, ability to make independent, analytical inquiries, understanding of the business environment, and willingness to devote adequate time to the duties of the board of directors. The board believes that each director should have a basic understanding of (i) the principal operational and financial objectives and plans and strategies of GEO, (ii) the results of operations and financial condition of GEO and of any significant subsidiaries or business segments, and (iii) the relative standing of GEO and its business segments in relation to its competitors. The board is committed to diversified membership and it does not and will not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, religion or disability in selecting nominees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may, to the extent it deems appropriate, engage a third party professional search firm to identify and review new director candidates and their credentials. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider proposed nominees whose names are submitted to it by shareholders. We adopted proxy access in advance of our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders.   Our proxy access provisions are set forth in Article II, Section 6 of our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Bylaws"). The proxy access provisions permit a shareholder, or a group of up to twenty (20) shareholders, owning three percent (3%) or more of the Company's outstanding common stock continuously for at least three (3) years, to nominate twenty percent (20%) of the number of directors then in office (rounding down to the nearest whole number) provided that the shareholder or group and each nominee satisfy the eligibility, procedural and disclosure requirements for proxy access as specified in the Bylaws, including that the Company receive notice of such nominations between 90 and 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the previous year's annual meeting of shareholders. Since our annual meeting for 2019 is scheduled for May 7, 2019, any nomination pursuant to our proxy access process to be considered at the 2020 annual meeting must be properly submitted to us not earlier than January 8, 2020 or later than February 7, 2020. 
There are no differences between the considerations and qualifications for director nominees that are recommended by shareholders and director nominees recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Other than adopting proxy access, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has not adopted a formal process because it believes that the informal consideration process has been adequate to date. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee intends to review periodically whether a more formal policy should be adopted. If a shareholder wishes to suggest a proposed name of a nominee for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee outside of the proxy access process, the name of that nominee and related personal information should be forwarded to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in care of the Corporate Secretary, at least six months before the next annual meeting to assure time for meaningful consideration by the committee. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our CEO also serves as the Chairman of the board of directors. Richard H. Glanton has served as Lead Independent Director of the Company since January 1, 2011. 
Mr. Glanton has been a director of GEO since 1998 and is currently the Chairman of the Audit and Finance Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Independent Committee and a member of the Executive Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Operations and Oversight Committee and the Legal Steering Committee. As the Lead Independent Director, Mr. Glanton has input to the Chairman of the board on preparation of agendas for board and committee meetings. Mr. Glanton chairs board meetings when the Chairman of the board is not in attendance and provides input to the independent directors and ensures that the effectiveness of the board is assessed on a regular basis. The Lead Independent Director reports to the board regarding deliberations of the independent directors and may recommend special meetings of the independent directors as necessary. Because of Mr. Glanton's long history as a board member and his service as the Chairman of the Audit and Finance Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Independent Committee, the board believes that Mr. Glanton is uniquely qualified to serve as the Lead Independent Director of the Company. In 2012, in connection with our conversion to a REIT, Mr. Glanton was the chairman of a special committee created to review and manage the divestiture of GEO Care, Inc. 
As a company that is focused on its core business, we believe the CEO is in the best position to direct the independent directors' attention on the issues of greatest importance to the Company and its shareholders. Since our CEO knows the Company's business, is a pioneer in the industry and has over thirty years of experience, we believe that our CEO is the appropriate person to lead the board of directors. Our overall corporate governance policies and practices combined with the strength of our independent directors, including our Lead Independent Director, and our internal controls minimize any potential conflicts that may result from combining the roles of Chairman and CEO. 
We believe the current leadership structure of the board of directors supports the risk oversight functions described below by providing independent leadership at the board and committee level through the Lead Independent Director with ultimate oversight by the full board of directors led by our Chairman and CEO. The board of directors periodically reviews and considers whether the current board leadership structure continues to be appropriate for our Company.  Board Risk Oversight 
Our board of directors has overall responsibility for risk oversight with a focus on the most significant risks facing the Company. Throughout the year, the board of directors and the committees to which it has delegated responsibility dedicate a portion of their meetings to review and discuss specific risk topics in greater detail.

Annual Board and Committee Self-Assessments and Non-Employee Director Executive Sessions 
The board of directors conducts a self-assessment annually, which is reported by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to the board of directors. In addition, the Audit and Finance Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also undergo annual self-assessments of their performance. The non-employee directors of the board of directors meet in executive session at least twice per year and such meetings are presided over by a presiding director who is typically the chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, who is currently Mr. Wheeler. 
Communications with Directors 
The board of directors has adopted a process to facilitate written communications by shareholders or other interested parties to the entire board, the independent members of the board as a group or any individual member of the board, including the presiding director for non-employee director executive sessions. Persons wishing to write to the board of directors of GEO, or to a specified director (including the presiding director for non-employee director executive sessions) or a committee of the board, should send correspondence to the Corporate Secretary at 4955 Technology Way, Boca Raton, Florida 33431. 
The Corporate Secretary will forward to the directors all communications that, in his or her judgment, are appropriate for consideration by the directors. Examples of communications that would not be appropriate for consideration by the directors include commercial solicitations and matters not relevant to the shareholders, to the functioning of the board, or to the affairs of GEO. 
Board Member Attendance at Annual Meetings 
GEO encourages all of its directors to attend the annual meeting of shareholders. All of our directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. 
Adoption of Global Human Rights Policy and Ongoing Dialogue 
On February 14, 2013, following consultation with relevant internal and external stakeholders, GEO's Board of Directors adopted a Global Human Rights Policy. The Global Human Rights Policy has been in effect since that date, and GEO has undertaken to train all of its employees in the policy and GEO's commitment to respect human rights. 
In the years following adoption of the Global Human Rights Policy, GEO has undertaken to engage interested stakeholders in learning about the operation of prison and detention facilities, the work GEO does to ensure that it fulfills its commitment to respect human rights in the operation of those facilities, and the work GEO has been doing with respect to its Continuum of Care program. Continuum of Care is GEO's program to facilitate transition of those within GEO's custody and care to life outside of the corrections/detention system, and to reduce recidivism. In the coming years, GEO anticipates continued engagement with interested stakeholders on its programs, and in particular, Continuum of Care. 
During 2020, GEO anticipates publishing its first annual public statement regarding the work it has done to date to operationalize its commitment to respect human rights, while giving due consideration to the legal and contractual obligations GEO has with respect to the confidentiality of information about those in its custody and care. Similarly, where appropriate and possible, GEO expects to offer information in this statement that will help stakeholders and shareholders better understand GEO's progress in the human rights area. GEO also anticipates ongoing review of its Global Human Rights Policy and associated training. Where appropriate, GEO anticipates engaging relevant stakeholders in this process.  Additional information on GEO's Global Human Rights Policy can be found at http://geogroup.com/human_rights.

[END TABLE]
The Audit and Finance Committee of the board of directors has implemented procedures to ensure that all audit and permitted non-audit services provided to GEO are pre-approved by the Audit and Finance Committee. All of the audit, audit-related, tax and all other services provided by Grant Thornton to GEO in 2018 and 2017 were approved by the Audit and Finance Committee pursuant to these procedures. All non-audit services provided in 2018 and 2017 were reviewed with the Audit and Finance Committee, which concluded that the provision of such services by Grant Thornton was compatible with the maintenance of that firm's independence in the conduct of its auditing functions. 
Audit and Finance Committee Pre-Approvals of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Permissible Non-Audit Services 
The Audit and Finance Committee periodically approves the provision of various audit, audit-related, tax and other services by Grant Thornton. The Audit and Finance Committee plans to continue to review and pre-approve such services as appropriate. In addition, the Audit and Finance Committee has delegated to its Chairman, Richard H. Glanton, the authority to grant, on behalf of the Audit and Finance Committee, the pre-approvals required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the provision by Grant Thornton to GEO of auditing and permissible non-audit services; provided, however, that any decision made by Mr. Glanton with respect to any such  pre-approvals must be presented at the next regularly scheduled full Audit and Finance Committee meeting that is held after such decision is made. 
All of the services provided by Grant Thornton to GEO in 2018 and 2017 were approved by the Audit and Finance Committee pursuant to these procedures. The Audit and Finance Committee will continue to review and pre-approve such services as appropriate.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS 
Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee of our board of directors establishes and regularly reviews our compensation philosophy and programs, exercises authority with respect to the determination and payment of base and incentive compensation to executive officers and administers the 2011 employee stock purchase plan and our 2018 stock incentive plan. Our Compensation Committee consists of three members, each of whom is independent as that term is defined in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations that have been promulgated under that Act, and in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The Compensation Committee operates under a written charter that was first adopted by our board of directors in February 2004 and has been amended periodically. The charter more fully describes the role, responsibilities and functioning of the Compensation Committee. A current copy of this charter can be viewed on our website at www.geogroup.com by clicking the link "Social Responsibility" on our homepage and then clicking the links "Governance with Integrity — Corporate Governance". 
Say-on-Pay Results 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, over 98% of the votes cast voted to approve the advisory resolution on our executive compensation referred to as the "say-on-pay" vote. The Compensation Committee believes that the positive outcome of the say-on-pay vote supports the compensation arrangements established by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee considered the results of the shareholder vote on the 2018 "say-on-pay" proposal as one of the many factors relevant in connection with the discharge of its responsibilities along with the advice of its independent compensation consultant and shareholder feedback. During 2018, the Compensation Committee continued the compensation program in place during 2017 with the changes noted below under the section titled, "Why Each Element of Compensation is Paid and How the Amount of Each Element is Determined". 
Role and Independence of Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee assessed the independence of Pay Governance LLC, ("Pay Governance"), a nationally recognized executive compensation consultant, taking into account the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other services provided by Pay Governance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The amount of fees paid by GEO to the consultant as a percentage of its total revenues;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any business or personal relationships between the consultant (including its representatives) and GEO's directors or senior officers; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The policies and procedures the consultant has in place to prevent conflicts of interest, which includes a prohibition against stock ownership in GEO.   
[END TABLE]
Pay Governance has attested to its independence and does not provide any services to GEO other than those related to executive compensation consulting. Based on its assessment, the Compensation Committee agreed that the compensation consultant is independent and that the compensation consultant's work has not raised any conflict of interest. 
During 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Pay Governance to perform the following services: (i) a peer group analysis and review of the compensation levels of the named executive officers; (ii) review the proxy statement for the 2018 annual shareholders meeting including consultation related to the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of the proxy statement; (iii) calculation of the Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") Performance to determine the performance-based restricted stock payout levels; (iv) calculation of the   Accounting Fair Value for performance-based restricted stock awards; and (v) review of the Company's stock ownership guidelines for executives and directors. Other than as described above, Pay Governance was not asked to perform any other services for us in 2018. GEO paid Pay Governance a total of $47,775 related to its work for the Compensation Committee in 2018. 
Under its charter, the Compensation Committee has the ability to retain any advisors it deems necessary or desirable in order for it to discharge its duties. The Compensation Committee also has sole authority to terminate the retention of any advisor it has retained. 
Process for Determining Compensation 
When making decisions regarding the compensation of named executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee considers competitive market data and analyses prepared by Pay Governance, historical pay to the named executive officers and the appropriateness of such compensation, including by comparing it to a peer group of companies periodically. From time to time, the Compensation Committee will use peer group and broader general industry data to obtain a general understanding of compensation practices and therefore ensure that it is acting in an informed and responsible manner to make sure our executive compensation program is competitive. The Compensation Committee views peer group data as one factor in assisting its compensation decisions. In 2018, the Compensation Committee asked Pay Governance to conduct a peer group analysis to evaluate our compensation programs and practices as a whole, and the compensation levels of our named executive officers. When evaluating pay levels and practices of peer companies within the REIT industry, the Compensation Committee focused on data from the group of similarly-sized, equity REITs listed below. After determining that the historical peer group continued to be appropriate on the basis of revenue size and with all companies generally focused on the specialty REIT industry, the Compensation Committee did not make any changes to the following peer group for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 AvalonBay Communities, Inc.    Essex Property Trust, Inc. 
 Boston Properties, Inc.    Extra Space Storage Inc. 
 Brixmor Property Group Inc.    GGP Inc. 
 CBL & Associates Properties, Inc.    Iron Mountain Incorporated 
 CoreCivic, Inc.    Kimco Realty Corporation 
 Crown Castle International Corp.    Lamar Advertising Company 
 Digital Realty Trust, Inc.    Prologis, Inc. 
 Equinix, Inc.    Ventas, Inc. 
 Equity Residential    Vornado Realty Trust 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee also considers the compensation recommendations set forth by the Chief Executive Officer for named executive officers other than himself. Under the Compensation Committee's charter, the Chief Executive Officer cannot provide the Compensation Committee with a compensation recommendation for himself. When considering compensation matters generally, and the compensation packages of the named executive officers in particular, the Compensation Committee meets in executive session outside the presence of the named executive officers. The Compensation Committee uses its experience and judgment and considers performance of the Company and the executive officer in making final compensation decisions. 
Important Factors Given Particular Consideration by the Compensation Committee in Setting Compensation for the Named Executive Officers 
In setting executive compensation for our named executive officers, the Compensation Committee gives particular attention and focus to the following factors over a several year-period: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our financial performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our stock price performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achievement of strategic operating objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our growth and prospects for continued future growth in both revenues and profitability; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The performance of our senior management team.  
[END TABLE]
Applying these factors to our Company during the previous several years in setting CEO and other named executive officer compensation, the Compensation Committee considered the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• During the past several years, we have experienced strong growth in revenue and profitability and believe we have become the most diversified service  provider in our peer group, which will continue to yield growth opportunities in excess of typical industry levels;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• During the past several years, we have successfully completed and integrated several significant strategic acquisitions, including, most recently, the  acquisition of Community Education Centers whose operations encompass over 12,000 beds nationwide, the acquisition of eight correctional and detention facilities from LCS Correctional Services, Inc. and its affiliates, the acquisition by our  subsidiary, Protocol Criminal Justice, Inc., of assets relating to customer relationship management software from APAC Customer Services, Inc., our acquisition of Soberlink, Inc., a leading developer and distributor of mobile alcohol monitoring  devices and services, our acquisition and integration of BI Incorporated in 2011, which allowed us to introduce important new electronic monitoring and community service offerings to our customers, and the acquisition and integration of Cornell  Companies in 2010-2011, which materially expanded the scope of our U.S. Corrections Services and what we now refer to as our GEO Care segment;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• During 2018, GEO's total revenues increased approximately 3% to $2.33 billion and Adjusted EBITDAre increased approximately 6% to  $443.7 million. Since 2014, GEO has grown Adjusted EBITDAre at a compounded annual growth rate of 7.1%;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We believe we have the most seasoned and accomplished senior management team in our industry, led by our Chairman, CEO and Founder, who is an industry  pioneer and has a long and established track record of leading our company to substantial growth in revenue and profitability since the inception of our business;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We believe the efforts undertaken by our senior management team over the past several years to expand our company´s business, both in our core  corrections business and into new diversified services, have positioned us to have what we believe are stronger prospects for stable and strong revenue and profit growth than any peer company in our industry;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our senior management team has consistently demonstrated the ability, over a long period of time, to manage through and capably address and mitigate  the key risks that face our business on an ongoing basis; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our senior management team has consistently made delivering shareholder value a priority. We have had solid long-term stock price performance. The  following graph compares the total shareholder return of our common stock compared to the total shareholder return of several indexes, including the MSCI U.S. Equity REITs index over the five-year period ended December 31, 2018. (GEO TSR 133.4%  vs MSCI 118.5%).  
[END TABLE]
 Total Shareholder Return for Five-Year Period Ended December 31, 2018 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The successful conversion by GEO into a real estate investment trust, or a REIT, effective January 1, 2013, a transaction which we believe has  significantly increased shareholder value, including through the payment of regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders. We commenced paying regular quarterly dividends in 2013. For 2016, 2017 and 2018, we paid an aggregate of $1.73, $1.88 and  $1.88 per share for the year, respectively, in quarterly dividends.  
[END TABLE]
The factors above are among the most critical we consider in setting our named executive officer compensation. 
Elements of Compensation 
Our compensation program for named executive officers consists of the following components: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual base salaries  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual cash incentive compensation  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance-based equity compensation  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other benefits and perquisites  
[END TABLE]
Each of these components is reflected in the Summary Compensation Table and is also discussed in further detail below. 
Why Each Element of Compensation is Paid and How the Amount of Each Element is Determined 
The following is a brief discussion of each element of our named executive officer compensation. The Compensation Committee considers each of these elements in order to ensure that a desirable overall mix is established between base compensation and incentive compensation, cash and non-cash compensation and annual and long-term compensation. The Compensation Committee also evaluates on a periodic basis the overall competitiveness of our executive compensation packages as compared to packages offered in the marketplace for which we compete for executive talent. Overall, our Compensation Committee believes that our executive compensation packages are currently appropriately balanced and structured to retain and motivate our named executive officers, who we believe constitute the most experienced senior management team in our industry. The Compensation Committee evaluates GEO's executive compensation policies and practices on an ongoing basis. 
Base Salaries. The cash salaries paid to the named executive officers are incorporated into the terms of existing executive employment agreements with our named executive officers. Any increases in salaries have been made either pursuant to the terms of the employment agreements or at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.   Mr. Zoley, who also serves as our Chairman, receives no additional compensation for his board service, so his annual base salary reflects the workload, responsibilities and contributions made by Mr. Zoley as our Chief Executive Officer and our Chairman. 
For 2018, our Compensation Committee determined it was appropriate to increase the annual base salaries of Messrs. Zoley, Evans, Donahue and Bulfin by 2% and the annual base salary of Ms. Schlarb by 4% as compared to their 2017 annual base salaries following their individual performance assessments and a review of projected executive salary increases in the market. 
Annual Cash Incentive Compensation. Annual cash incentive compensation for each of our named executive officers is governed by our Senior Management Performance Award Plan, as Amended and Restated on April 27, 2016, which was approved by our shareholders at the Company's 2016 annual meeting of shareholders in accordance with the performance-based compensation exception ("Performance-Based Exception") under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code") that such a plan be approved by shareholders at least once every five years. Although the Performance-Based Exception has been repealed, payments to the Chief Executive Officer made in accordance with this plan are intended to still be tax deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code because such payments to the Chief Executive Officer should be grandfathered from the repeal of the Performance-Based Exception for the Company's 2018 fiscal year. The plan is administered by our Compensation Committee, which has the authority to make all discretionary determinations necessary or appropriate under the plan. The plan is governed by the Compensation Committee and is administered on a day to day basis by the Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President of Human Resources. 
Under the plan, each of our named executive officers is eligible to receive annual cash incentive compensation based on our relative achievement of budgeted revenue and net income for the fiscal year. We believe revenue and net income are meaningful metrics to assess our performance. The metrics are used by our management team when it develops its annual operating plan and budget and are used by our investors in evaluating our performance against the annual financial guidance we give on revenue and net income. For purposes of the plan, net income means our net income after all federal, state and local taxes. Extraordinary items and changes in accounting principles, as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, may be disregarded in determining our net income. Non-recurring and unusual items not included or planned for in our annual budget may also be excluded from net income in the sole and absolute discretion of the Compensation Committee. In determining the amount of annual incentive cash compensation awarded, our net income is weighted 65% and our revenue is weighted 35% (collectively, the "Target Weighting of Revenue and Net-Income-After-Tax"). 
Awards under the plan are made as follows: (i) targets for budgeted revenue and net income are set at the beginning of each fiscal year; (ii) the plan includes for each named executive officer an annual incentive target amount as a percentage of the officer's salary which forms the basis for computing the officer's award under the plan; and (iii) at the end of the fiscal year, a multiplier set forth in the plan that is based on our relative achievement of budgeted revenue and net income for the fiscal year is applied to each officer's annual incentive target amount referenced in (ii) above. The multiplier is the same for all named executive officers.  The following table shows, for each named executive officer, the annual incentive target amount as a percentage of salary that the respective officer is eligible to receive under the Amended and Restated Senior Management Performance Award Plan. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Chief Executive Officer    150% 
 Chief Financial Officer    75% 
 Senior Vice Presidents    70% 
[END TABLE]
The following table shows how each named executive officer's annual incentive cash compensation award is calculated by applying a percentage adjustment methodology, or multiplier, separately to the respective Target Weighting of Revenue and Net-Income-After-Tax results on a straight-line basis: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance    80%     100%      120%   
 Payout    50%     100%      150%   
[END TABLE]
In addition to the calculations described above, if the budgeted goals for revenue and net income are exceeded, the annual incentive amounts for the Chief Financial Officer and the other Senior Vice Presidents may be adjusted up to an additional 50% upon the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee based on the results of an individual performance assessment. The Chief Executive Officer is not eligible for positive individual performance adjustments. The Compensation Committee and the Chief Executive Officer consider the contribution of the particular officer during the fiscal year when determining whether to make an individual performance adjustment. 
Under the terms of the plan, no amendment to the plan may alter the performance goals, increase the maximum amount which can be awarded to any participant, change the class of eligible employees or make any other change that would require shareholder approval under the exemption for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, in each case, without the prior approval of our shareholders (to the extent required under the performance-based compensation exception of Section 162(m) of the Code). 
2018 Cash Incentive Outcomes 
In 2018, the Company achieved Net income and Revenue performance above the target performance objective. The table below provides the 2018 cash incentive outcomes based on the Adjusted Net income and Revenue performance levels actually achieved. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Adjusted Net income1      65%     $ 162.5      $ 165.4      102%     104%   
 Revenue      35%     $ 2,285.0      $ 2,331.0      102%     105%   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
1  Adjusted Net income reflects adjustments for start-up expenses, legal related expenses, close-out expenses, loss on extinguishment of debt and incremental expense associated with the issuance of performance-based restricted stock. The fiscal year 2018 Adjusted Net income target was set slightly lower  than the actual fiscal year 2017 Adjusted Net income achieved as a result of increased net interest expense attributable to higher interest rates as well as higher overall debt balances.  
[END TABLE]
 Based on these results, the following annual incentive amounts were awarded to the Named Executive Officers for fiscal year 2018 performance: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 George C. Zoley      1,654,695        104.6%        1,730,811      N/A      1,730,811      104.6% 
 Brian R. Evans      452,033        104.6%        472,827      —        472,827      104.6% 
 J. David Donahue      374,850        104.6%        392,093      —        392,093      104.6% 
 John J. Bulfin      367,051        104.6%        383,935      —        383,935      104.6% 
 Ann M. Schlarb      303,450        104.6%        317,409      —        317,409      104.6% 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Since the Corporate Financial Performance Factor was greater than 100%, NEOs, other than the Chief Executive Offer, were eligible for  individual performance multipliers of 50% on their award. The Compensation Committee did not apply the individual performance multiplier for the 2018 non-equity incentive payments.   
[END TABLE]
2018 Equity Incentive Awards 
Our Compensation Committee has historically granted awards under our equity compensation plans to our key employees and members of our board of directors to support a performance-oriented culture and to further align the interests of management and our shareholders. 
The amounts of awards granted under our equity compensation plans are determined by the Compensation Committee after taking into account the following factors: the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer (other than for his awards), the availability of awards for issuance companywide, competitive market practices, the overall performance of the Company and the individual performances of the grantees. 
On April 24, 2018, GEO granted performance-based restricted stock to our named executive officers that vest, if earned, on March 10, 2021 using the same performance criteria as the grants made in 2017. 
For 2018, 100% of our equity incentive awards provided to the NEOs were in the form of performance-based restricted stock awards which was much more performance oriented than the mix of performance and time vested equity awards observed across the peer group. On average, the peers deliver approximately 50% of their long-term incentive to NEOs in time-vested equity. 
The following table lists the number of performance-based shares of restricted stock granted to each named executive officer in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 George C. Zoley    150,000    $3,240,000 
 Brian R. Evans      45,000    $   972,000 
 J. David Donahue      37,500    $   810,000 
 John J. Bulfin      30,000    $   648,000 
 Ann M. Schlarb      30,000    $   648,000 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The approved value on the date of grant reflects the number of shares granted multiplied by the closing share price on the date of grant. The  closing share price for each grant was $21.60 on April 24, 2018. We note that this value differs from the value disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table where the portion of the shares covered by the Relative TSR metric are valued based on a  Monte Carlo simulation model per the SEC's requirements.  
[END TABLE]
 Specifically, the performance targets for the 2018 performance-based restricted stock grants are:

 Relative TSR    50%    P30    P50    P90 
 Return on Capital Employed    50%    +1% of WACC    9%    12% 
     Payouts (% of  Target)    30%    100%    200% 
     Payouts (% of  Target)    30%    100%    200% 
[END TABLE]
The threshold required for payment under the return on capital employed ("ROCE") metric is set at +1% of our weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") over the three-year measurement period to ensure that payments only occur during periods of positive returns. The WACC is a product of the cost of our capital over the performance period and will not be known until the performance period has concluded. 
Additionally, there is a performance "governor" that caps payouts under the Relative TSR metric at 100% of target if GEO's absolute TSR is negative over the 3-year period. 
Equity Incentive Outcomes for 2016 to 2018 Performance Cycle 
On March 10, 2016, the Compensation Committee granted target awards of performance-based restricted stock vesting over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2016 provided that certain TSR performance goals and ROCE goals were met as of December 31, 2018. Specifically, the performance targets were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Relative TSR    75%    P30    P50    P90 
 Return on Capital Employed    25%    +1% of WACC    9%    12% 
     Payouts (% of  Target)    30%    100%    200% 
     Payouts (% of  Target)    30%    100%    200% 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee engaged Pay Governance to calculate the final TSR rank and payout calculations for the TSR component of these awards. Pay Governance determined that based upon their calculations for the Company and the FTSE NAREIT Equity REITs Index, the Company's 2016-2018 TSR of 45.9% places the Company in the 74th percentile of the peer group which results in a TSR component payout of 160%. Management of the Company calculated the return on capital employed component of the performance-based restricted stock to be 11.3% which results in a ROCE component payout of 176.7% of the target award. Based on the calculations of the TSR component and the ROCE component, management of the Company certified to the Compensation Committee that when the TSR component is combined with the ROCE component, the combined award payout is approximately 168.3% of the target award. After reviewing the information provided to the Compensation Committee by Pay Governance and management, the Compensation Committee approved the vesting of the performance-based restricted stock in the amounts provided below:

[END TABLE]
 2019 Compensation Actions 
Mr. Bulfin retired effective as of January 1, 2019 but will remain as a consultant through December 31, 2020. As a result, the discussion of 2019 compensation actions does not include any compensation discussion with respect to Mr. Bulfin. 
Due to Mr. Bulfin's valuable expertise and experience with GEO's legal activities and corporate governance matters, GEO entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Bulfin. Pursuant to the consulting agreement, Mr. Bulfin will provide consulting services with respect to GEO's legal activities and corporate governance matters for a two-year period from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020 for a consulting fee of $10,000 per month (or a total of $240,000 for the full consulting term). Additionally, all of Mr. Bulfin's unvested performance-based shares will continue to vest according to their terms as long as Mr. Bulfin continues to serve as a consultant during the end of each performance period. 
Base Salary 
For 2019, our Compensation Committee determined it was appropriate to increase the annual base salaries of Messrs. Zoley, Evans and Donahue and Ms. Schlarb by 3% as compared to their 2018 annual base salaries. 
Annual Cash Incentive Opportunities 
The annual cash incentive compensation for fiscal year 2019 performance will be determined under the Senior Management Performance Award Plan consistent with the methodology used in 2018 based on the budgeted Net income and Budgeted Revenue 2019 performance goals set by the Compensation Committee. 
Equity Incentive Awards 
The Compensation Committee granted performance-based restricted stock awards on March 1, 2019 to our named executive officers that will vest on March 15, 2022 based on two performance metrics measured from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021 as follows: (i) 50% of the shares of restricted stock in each award vest if GEO meets certain TSR performance targets for the 3-year period; and (ii) 50% of the shares of restricted stock in each award can vest if GEO meets certain ROCE performance targets for the 3-year period. For 2019, 100% of the equity grants authorized for the named executive officers were performance based. 
The following lists the number of performance-based shares granted to each of the continuing 2018 named executive officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Executive    Number of Performance Based Restricted Stock Granted in 2019     Value on Date of Authorization $23.64/share(1) 
Executive    Number of Performance Based Restricted Stock Granted in 2019     Value on Date of Authorization $23.64/share(1) 
 George C. Zoley    100,000    $2,364,000 
 Brian R. Evans      40,000    $   945,600 
 J. David Donahue      30,000    $   709,200 
 Ann M. Schlarb      30,000    $   709,200 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The approved value on the date of authorization reflects the number of shares authorized x the closing share price on the date of  authorization. The closing share price was $23.64 on February 11, 2019. This is the value that the Committee views as a fair reflection of the targeted value delivered on the date of authorization. We note that this value will differ from the  value that will be disclosed in the 2019 Summary Compensation Table where the portion of the shares covered by the Relative TSR metric will be valued based on a Monte Carlo simulation model per the SEC's requirements.   
[END TABLE]
Other Benefits and Perquisites. Our executive compensation program includes other benefits and perquisites as more fully reflected on the table set forth below titled "All Other Compensation." These benefits and perquisites are reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee with respect to amounts and appropriateness. Currently, the benefits and perquisites which the named executive officers are eligible to receive fall into four general   categories: (i) retirement benefits pursuant to our executive retirement agreement in the case of Mr. Zoley and pursuant to our senior officer retirement plan in the case of the other named executive officers; (ii) benefits under certain other deferred compensation plans; (iii) value attributable to life insurance we afford our named executive officers beyond that which is offered to our other employees generally; and (iv) travel and entertainment perquisites, such as an automobile allowance, club dues and personal use of the corporate aircraft. For 2018, Mr. Zoley was allotted thirty (30) hours of personal use of the corporate aircraft. For 2018, the Board authorized the allotment of five (5) hours of personal use of the corporate aircraft for Mr. Evans. 
Executive Retirement Agreement. Mr. Zoley has an executive retirement agreement that requires us to pay him a lump sum amount on the date that his employment with GEO ends. Such amount is determined by his age at the time of retirement with the amount increasing by approximately 4% per year up to age 71. Mr. Zoley's retirement agreement formerly included a tax gross-up provision for taxes applicable to his lump sum retirement payment. In 2012, Mr. Zoley agreed to amend his retirement agreement to eliminate the tax gross-up provision. In exchange for this amendment, the amount of the lump sum retirement payment which Mr. Zoley was entitled to receive was proportionally increased so that Mr. Zoley would be entitled to receive substantially the same net benefit he would otherwise have received if the tax gross-up had remained in place. Mr. Zoley's benefits under the executive retirement agreement are fully vested and he will therefore be entitled to receive the amount called for by the agreement whenever his employment with GEO is terminated for any reason, whether by GEO or by him. If Mr. Zoley had retired at December 31, 2018, we would have had to pay him a total of $8.3 million. The $8.3 million will be delivered in a lump-sum amount and equates to $243,147 annually when divided by his 34 years of service with the company. The amount owed under the retirement agreement to Mr. Zoley would be payable from the general assets of GEO. 
Senior Officer Retirement Plan. Mr. Bulfin participated and Messrs. Evans and Donahue and Ms. Schlarb currently participate in our senior officer retirement plan, which is offered to all of our Senior Vice Presidents. The senior officer retirement plan is a defined benefit plan and, subject to certain maximum and minimum provisions, provides for the payment to the officer of a monthly retirement benefit based on a percentage of the officer's final average annual salary earned during the employee's last five years of credited service (excluding bonus) multiplied by the employee's years of credited service. A participant will vest in his or her benefits under the senior officer retirement plan upon the completion of ten (10) years of service. The amount of benefit increases for each full year beyond ten (10) years of service except that there are no further increases after twenty-five (25) years of service. The maximum target benefit under the senior officer retirement plan is 45% of final average salary. Reduced benefits are payable for lesser service and early retirement. Benefits under the senior officer retirement plan are offset 100% by social security benefits received by the officer and are computed on the basis of a straight-life annuity. The plan also provides for pre-retirement death and disability benefits. Amounts owing under the plan are payable from the general assets of the Company. 
Deferred Compensation Plans. Our named executive officers are currently excluded from participating in our 401(k) plan by virtue of their compensation level. Accordingly, we have established a deferred compensation plan for certain employees, including the named executive officers, which permits them to defer up to 100% of their compensation to provide for their retirement. Under the deferred compensation plan, the Company may make matching contributions on a discretionary basis. Mr. Bulfin participated in the deferred compensation plan. Messrs. Evans and Donahue and Ms. Schlarb currently participate in the deferred compensation plan. Mr. Bulfin participated in the deferred compensation plan up until his retirement. 
Excess Group Life Insurance. We pay rates for the life insurance policies of our named executive officers above the level that is excludable under applicable tax rules. Payments in connection with the resulting excess coverage are treated as imputed income to the officers and are not deductible by the Company. 
How Each Compensation Element Fits into the Overall Compensation Objectives and Affects Decisions Regarding Other Elements 
In establishing compensation packages for executive officers, numerous factors are considered, including the particular executive's experience, expertise and performance, the Company's overall performance and   compensation packages available in the marketplace for similar positions. In arriving at amounts for each component of compensation, our Compensation Committee strives to strike an appropriate balance between base compensation and incentive compensation, including equity based compensation and cash awards under the Senior Management Performance Award Plan. The Compensation Committee also endeavors to properly allocate between cash and non-cash compensation (subject to the availability of equity compensation awards under our then current equity compensation plans), and between annual and long-term compensation. 
When considering the marketplace, particular emphasis is placed upon compensation packages available at a comparable group of peer companies. 
In 2012, Pay Governance completed a report on behalf of the Compensation Committee to evaluate its executive compensation program in light of the marketplace to make sure the program is competitive. In 2015, Pay Governance completed an assessment of Mr. Zoley's total compensation in light of the marketplace and the ISS peer group specifically. Additionally, in 2018, Pay Governance completed a peer group analysis to evaluate the compensation levels of our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee intends to continue this practice on a periodic basis in the future. 
Executive and Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Company adopted stock ownership guidelines in 2012 applicable to our senior executive officers, including our named executive officers, and our board members. The guidelines, as most recently amended in 2018, require our CEO to maintain equity holdings in GEO equal in value to at least 6 times his annual base salary (an increase from 5 times his annual base salary), our other executive officers to maintain equity holdings in GEO equal in value to at least 3 times their annual base salaries, and our non-employee directors to maintain equity holdings in GEO equal in value to at least 3 times their annual cash retainers. The guidelines as most recently amended also specify that shares which will count toward the total share ownership requirement are actual shares owned, options and restricted shares, vested and unvested, and unvested performance share awards at the threshold level. Performance share awards at the target and maximum level will not be counted until the performance metrics have been met and the performance shares have vested. All officers and directors must satisfy the stock ownership guidelines five years from their appointment as director or a senior executive officer. 
Clawback/Recoupment Policy 
The Company maintains a clawback policy providing that any incentive payment awarded by GEO to an executive officer (including a named executive officer) under any GEO incentive compensation plan may be recouped by GEO in the event of material fraud or misconduct by the recipient, among other triggers. 
Prohibition of Hedging and Pledging of Company Shares 
The Company prohibits certain transactions in the Company's securities under the terms of its insider trading policy, including engaging in hedging transactions and short sales of the Company's securities, trading in options, warrants, puts and calls or similar instruments on the Company's securities. Additionally, directors, officers and employees may not hold Company securities in margin accounts or otherwise pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan unless a waiver from this restriction is granted. 
CONCLUSION 
We believe that our compensation programs appropriately reward executive performance and closely align the interests of our named executive officers and key employees with the interests of our shareholders, while also enabling the Company to attract, retain, and motivate talented executives. The Compensation Committee will continue to evolve and administer our compensation program in a manner that the Compensation Committee believes will be in the best interests of our shareholders. The Compensation Committee monitors the results of the advisory vote on our executive compensation (referred to as the "say-on-pay" vote) and incorporates such results as one of many factors considered in connection with the discharge of its responsibilities.  SUBMITTED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS:

Compensation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Risk Management 
Our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain our officers and to motivate them to increase shareholder value on both an annual and longer term basis primarily by generating increasing levels of revenue and net income. To that end, compensation packages include significant forms of incentive compensation to ensure that an executive officer's interest is aligned with the interests of our shareholders in generating revenue and net income. Based upon the Compensation Committee's regular review of the Company's compensation policies and practices, the Compensation Committee determined that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for our employees are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE 
The following table shows compensation earned by each of the named executive officers of GEO during 2018, 2017 and 2016, for services in all capacities while they were employees of GEO, and the capacities in which the services were rendered. For purposes of this proxy statement, GEO's named executive officers are (i) the Chief Executive Officer of GEO, (ii) the Chief Financial Officer of GEO, and (iii) each of the three most highly compensated executive officers as of December 31, 2018 of GEO other than the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.

  (1)  This column reflects the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 ("FASB 718") with respect to stock awards granted during 2018, 2017 and 2016 for each named executive officer. Stock awards granted in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were performance based awards and will  be earned if the Company achieves its performance based targets. Assumptions used in the calculation of the amounts related to stock awards are described in Note 1 to the Company's audited financial statements for the year ended  December 31, 2018, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2019.

We note that this differs from the value disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table where the portion of the  shares covered by the Relative TSR metric are valued based on a Monte Carlo simulation model per the SEC's requirements. The value based on the Monte Carlo simulation for the Relative TSR metric was $27.8 on April 24, 2018 as compared to  the actual closing share price of $21.60 on April 24, 2018. The Compensation Committee views the closing share price on the date of grant to be a fair reflection of the targeted value delivered on the date of grant.

CERTAIN MATERIAL EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS AND ARRANGEMENTS 
The following executive compensation agreements and arrangements are material to an understanding of the amounts paid and/or payable to our named executive officers disclosed in the table above. 
Executive Employment Agreements 
Effective August 22, 2012, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement with Mr. Zoley, which was amended by the First Amendment, dated April 29, 2013, the Second Amendment, dated May 29, 2013, and the Third Amendment, dated June 1, 2015 (collectively, the "Employment Agreement"). The Employment Agreement has a continuously rolling three-year term. 
The Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Zoley is entitled to receive a target annual performance award of up to a maximum of 150% of his annual base salary in accordance with the Senior Management Performance Award Plan. 
The Employment Agreement provides that upon the termination of the agreement for any reason other than by GEO for cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or by Mr. Zoley without good reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement), he will be entitled to receive a termination payment equal to 2 (two) times his annual base salary plus target bonus for the fiscal year in which his employment is terminated or, if greater, the target bonus for the fiscal year immediately prior to such termination. In addition, the Employment Agreement provides that upon such termination, GEO will transfer all of its interest in any automobile used by the executive pursuant to its employee automobile policy and pay the balance of any outstanding loans or leases on such automobile so that the executive owns the automobile outright. In the event such automobile is leased, the Employment Agreement provides that GEO will pay the residual cost of the lease. 
Upon the termination of the Employment Agreement by GEO for cause or by Mr. Zoley without good reason, Mr. Zoley will be entitled to only the amount of compensation that is due through the effective date of the termination, including any performance award that may be due and payable to him under the terms of the Senior Management Performance Award Plan. The Employment Agreement includes a non-competition covenant that runs through the three-year period following the termination of the executive's employment, and customary confidentiality provisions. 
The Employment Agreement for Mr. Zoley reflected an annual base salary of $1,000,000 for 2015 and provides that the annual base salary is subject to increases in the future as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. Additionally, the Employment Agreement provides that all outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock granted to Mr. Zoley fully vest immediately upon a "termination without cause" as such term is defined in his employment agreements, as approved by the Compensation Committee. However, any restricted stock that is still subject to performance based vesting at the time of such termination shall only vest when, and to the extent, the Compensation Committee of the board of directors certifies that the performance goals have been met. 
Senior Officer Employment Agreements 
We have senior officer employment agreements with Messrs. Evans and Donahue, and Ms. Schlarb. The employment agreements have rolling two-year terms which continue until each executive reaches age 67 absent their earlier termination. We had a senior officer employment agreement with Mr. Bulfin through January 1, 2019. Mr. Bulfin retired on January 1, 2019. Due to Mr. Bulfin's valuable expertise and experience with GEO's legal activities, GEO entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Bulfin. Please see page 32 for additional information regarding Mr. Bulfin's consulting agreement.  The amounts of base salaries that were paid to each of these executives during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table above. The executives are also entitled to receive a target annual incentive bonus in accordance with the terms of our Senior Management Performance Award Plan which is further described below. 
The senior officer employment agreements provide that upon the termination of the agreement for any reason other than by GEO for cause (as defined in the employment agreement) or by the voluntary resignation of the executive, the executive will be entitled to receive a termination payment equal to the following: (1) two years of the executive's then current annual base salary; plus (2) the continuation of the executive's employee benefits (as defined in the employment agreement) for a period of two years, plus (3) the dollar value of the sum of paid vacation time that the executive was entitled to take immediately prior to the termination which was not in fact taken by the executive. In addition, the employment agreements provide that upon such termination of the executive, we will transfer all of our interest in any automobile used by the executive pursuant to our employee automobile policy and pay the balance of any outstanding loans or leases on such automobile so that the executive owns the automobile outright. In the event such automobile is leased, the employment agreements provide that we will pay the residual cost of the lease. Also, upon such termination, all of the executive's unvested stock options and restricted stock will fully vest immediately, provided however, that any restricted stock that is still subject to performance based vesting at the time of such termination shall only vest when and to the extent the Compensation Committee of the Board certifies that the performance goals were actually met. 
Upon the termination of the employment agreements by us for cause or by the voluntary resignation of the executive, the executive will be entitled to only the amount of salary, bonus, and employee benefits that is due through the effective date of the termination. Each employment agreement includes a non-competition covenant that runs through the two-year period following the termination of the executive's employment, and customary confidentiality provisions. 
Under the terms of the employment agreements, annual base salaries for 2018 approved by the Compensation Committee for Messrs. Evans, Donahue and Bulfin and Ms. Schlarb were $602,711, $535,500, $524,358 and $443,500, respectively. Additionally, all outstanding unvested stock options and restricted stock granted to each of Messrs. Evans, Donahue and Bulfin and Ms. Schlarb fully vest immediately upon a "termination without cause" as such term is defined in each of their employment agreements, as approved by the compensation committee.    Performance based awards will only vest upon the determination by the Compensation Committee that the established performance goals have been met. 
Executive Retirement Agreement 
We also have an executive retirement agreement with Mr. Zoley. The retirement agreement provides that upon the later of (i) the date he actually retires from employment with GEO, or (ii) his 55th birthday, GEO will make a lump sum payment to Mr. Zoley. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" for the amount we would have had to pay Mr. Zoley as of December 31, 2018 pursuant to his executive retirement agreement had he retired at his current age as of that date. 
The retirement agreement provides that if the executive should die after his 55th birthday but before he retires from GEO, GEO shall immediately pay to the executive's beneficiary(ies) or estate the amount GEO would have paid to the executive had he retired immediately prior to his death. The retirement agreement includes non-competition provisions that run for a two-year period after the termination of the executive's employment. Mr. Zoley has reached the age of 55. 
Senior Officer Retirement Plan 
GEO maintains a senior officer retirement plan for all of its Senior Vice Presidents, including Mr. Evans, Mr. Donahue, and Ms. Schlarb. The senior officer retirement plan is a non-qualified defined benefit plan and, subject to certain maximum and minimum provisions, provides for the payment to the officer of a monthly   retirement benefit based on a percentage of the officer's final average annual salary earned during the employee's last five years of credited service (excluding bonus) multiplied by the employee's years of credited service. A participant will vest in his or her benefits under the senior officer retirement plan upon the completion of ten (10) years of service, provided such participant remains continuously employed by the Company until at least age fifty five (55). The amount of benefit increases for each full year beyond ten (10) years of service except that there are no further increases after twenty-five (25) years of service. The maximum target benefit under the senior officer retirement plan is 45% of final average annual salary. Reduced benefits are payable for lesser service and early retirement. Benefits under the senior officer retirement plan are offset one hundred percent (100%) by social security benefits received (or estimated social security benefits to be received, if applicable) by the officer and are computed on the basis of a straight-life annuity. The plan also provides for pre-retirement death and disability benefits. Amounts owing under the plan are payable from the general assets of the company. Mr. Bulfin was a participant under the Senior Officer Retirement Plan while employed with GEO. At the time of his retirement on January 1, 2019, Mr. Bulfin had completed in excess of ten (10) years of service. As a result, Mr. Bulfin will be entitled to receive a retirement payment of approximately $1.7 million under the terms of the Senior Officer Retirement Plan.

All of the payments in the table would have been payable pursuant to the employment and retirement agreements and arrangements described more fully above under "Certain Material Executive Compensation Agreements and Arrangements." All amounts in the table would have been payable in lump sums from the general assets of GEO.

  (5)  The benefits of Messrs. Zoley, Evans and Bulfin and Ms. Schlarb under the retirement agreement, in the case of Mr. Zoley and the  Senior Officer Retirement Plan, in the case of Messrs. Evans and Bulfin are fully vested and those officers would therefore have been entitled to receive the amounts set forth in this column if their employment with GEO had been terminated for any  reason on December 31, 2018, whether by GEO or the officer, regardless of whether cause or good reason existed, and including in the event of a termination due to the retirement, death or disability of the officer. Please see "Certain  Material Executive Compensation Agreements and Arrangements" for a description of our executive and senior officer retirement agreements and arrangements. Mr. Bulfin retired effective as of January 1, 2019 and will receive payments  totaling $1.7 million pursuant to the terms of the Senior Officer Retirement Plan.

PAY RATIO 
Under rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, we are required to calculate and disclose the total compensation paid to our median employee, as well as the ratio of the total compensation paid to the median employee as compared to the total compensation paid to our CEO. The paragraphs that follow describe our methodology and the resulting CEO pay ratio. 
We identified the median employee using our employee population on December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 22,000 employees located in the United States, Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Approximately 88% of our total employees are located in the United States. Our diverse employee population varies significantly in experience, education and specialized training. Regardless of the employee's role in the organization or their location, the process for determining salaries is the same. Local market competitive data is reviewed to set base pay rates. Individual salaries are then adjusted from these base pay rates to reflect the individual's role and responsibilities as well as his or her experience, education and specialized training. 
Pursuant to the de minimis exception, in identifying the median employee, we excluded 512 employees in South Africa and 87 employees in the United Kingdom which together represent approximately 3% of our workforce. We used the relevant average currency exchange rate to convert the compensation of our Australian employees to U.S. dollars. We did not make cost of living adjustments. 
To identify the median employee from our employee population, we compared the amount of base salary, as reflected in our payroll records for 2018, excluding our CEO. We identified our median employee using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all of our employees included in the calculation. We   do not grant equity to a large percentage of our employee population, so using base salary, is considered to be representative. As a result, the total annual compensation for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $37,112 for our median employee and $6,913,465 for our CEO as reflected in the "Total" column of the Summary Compensation Table. The ratio of our CEO's pay to that of our median employee for 2018 was approximately 186 times. 
Because the SEC rules for identifying the median of the annual total compensation of our employees and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allows companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio for our Company, as other companies have headquarters and offices in different states and countries, have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios. 
This information is being provided for compliance purposes. Neither the Compensation Committee nor management used the pay ratio measure in making compensation decisions.

To GEO's knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to GEO and written representations that no other reports were required, during the year ended December 31, 2018, all such filing requirements applicable to GEO's directors, executive officers and greater than 10% beneficial owners were complied with. 
PROPOSAL 2: 
RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 
The Audit and Finance Committee of our board of directors has appointed Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accountants for the 2019 fiscal year. The Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for the appointment, oversight and termination of our independent registered public accountants. We are seeking the ratification of our shareholders of this appointment, although our Audit and Finance Committee is not bound by any shareholder action on this matter. 
If the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accountants is not ratified by our shareholders, the Audit and Finance Committee will reconsider its appointment, but may nevertheless retain Grant Thornton LLP. Also, even if the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accountants is ratified by our shareholders, the Audit and Finance Committee may direct the appointment of a different independent auditor at any time during the year if the Audit and Finance Committee determines, in its discretion, that such a change would be in our best interests. Grant Thornton LLP has advised GEO that no partner or employee of Grant Thornton LLP has any direct financial interest or any material indirect interest in GEO other than receiving payment for its services as independent certified public accountants. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The board of directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of Grant Thornton LLP as our independent registered public accountants for the 2019 fiscal year. 
PROPOSAL 3: 
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in July 2010, requires that we provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  As described above in detail under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," we seek to closely align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders. Our compensation programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate our named executive officers to increase shareholder value on both an annual and a longer term basis primarily by generating increasing levels of revenue, net income, net operating income, adjusted funds from operations, total shareholder return and return on capital employed, while at the same time avoiding the encouragement of unnecessary or excessive risk taking. 
The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the vote relates to the compensation of our named executive officers, as described in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The vote is advisory, which means that the vote is not binding on the Company, our board of directors or the Compensation Committee. Although non-binding, our board of directors and Compensation Committee will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation program. 
Accordingly, we ask our shareholders to vote on the following resolution at the annual meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED." 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The board of directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement.

RESOLVED: Shareholders request that GEO report annually on its website to investors, beginning in September 2019, on how it implements the portion of the Policy that addresses "Respect for Our Inmates and Detainees," including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  How GEO ensures that its employees are aware of, and know how to apply, the company's commitment to inmate/detainee human rights;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  Metrics used to assess human rights performance, including any process for independent outside verification of such metrics; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  How GEO remedies shortcomings in human rights performance.  
[END TABLE]
SUPPORTING STATEMENT 
HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY IMPLEMENTATION AND PERFORMANCE 2019 — THE GEO GROUP 
WHEREAS, The GEO Group ("GEO") represents itself as "the world's leading provider of correctional, detention, and community reentry services" and promotes itself as having "always been committed to protecting human rights." However, the company faces increasing scrutiny and expectations from investors and clients regarding its human rights performance. 
The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General in October 2018 reported "serious issues relating to safety, detainee rights, and medical care" at a GEO-owned and operated immigration detention center in Adelanto, California. Inspectors found nooses made from twisted bed sheets in 15 of 20 cells inspected, despite 1 suicide and 7 attempts at the facility last year. In addition, during their visit officials found that all 14 detainees in administrative segregation had been placed inappropriately. 
A GEO owned and operated prison in Clayton, New Mexico, the site of a major riot in September 2017, resulted in the serious injury of an inmate. The New Mexico Secretary of Corrections confirms "major security breaches. It wasn't safe" and GEO had less than half the required staffing the evening of the riot. 
There are currently three lawsuits alleging forced labor/human trafficking at GEO immigrant detention centers in California, Colorado, and Washington. 
Human Rights performance is critical to GEO's reputation and long-term growth. In order to ensure that the company is adequately respecting human rights in its facilities and meeting the objectives outlined in the portion of its Global Human Rights Policy (the "Policy") that addresses "Respect for Our Inmates and Detainees," which lacks specificity, additional public disclosure regarding GEO's implementation is necessary. 
In particular, shareholders would benefit from information about how GEO ensures awareness of the company's commitment to inmate/detainee human rights, assesses human rights performance, and remedies shortcomings in that performance. Disclosing this information will benefit human rights performance at GEO and mitigate human rights risks inherent within GEO's business environment. Disclosure will also provide investors with important information to adequately assess human rights risks. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
GEO's board of directors recommends a vote "AGAINST" the adoption of this proposal for the following reasons: 
Our Board has carefully considered this shareholder proposal and does not believe that its adoption at this time is in the best interests of GEO and its shareholders. We believe the timing of the report requested of September 2019 is arbitrary and does not give us sufficient time to develop a meaningful report. Additionally, and more importantly, any report that we produce must give due consideration to the legal, contractual, and statutory obligations GEO has with respect to the confidentiality of information about those in its custody and care and we believe the shareholder proposal does not give due consideration to these obligations.  As we have previously indicated, we take seriously our commitment to protect the human rights of all persons in our custody and care. In 2013, our Board formalized that commitment when it adopted the GEO Global Human Rights Policy. In that policy, we acknowledged the unique nature of our operations as a private provider of detention, correction, residential treatment, and monitoring related services to governmental entities and the significant role that respect for human rights plays in those operations. 
We believe that integration of the GEO Global Human Rights Policy into daily operations is as important to the Company as having the policy itself. Upon the adoption of our Global Human Rights Policy in 2013, we developed and rolled out a comprehensive training program to inform and educate all current employees of the Company's commitment to respect human rights. All new GEO corrections officers and employees are required to participate in this training which includes educational videos and a human rights training module focused on educating the Company's employees on the following: (i) defining GEO's role with human rights; (ii) demonstrating how GEO ensures human rights compliance; (iii) identifying the human rights of GEO employees; (iv) identifying the human rights of inmates/detainees; and (v) describing GEO's commitment to the community. 
We employ personnel in positions of management, administrative and clerical, security, educational services, human services, health services and general maintenance at our various locations. The training our employees receive will vary based on the nature of their position. For example, under the laws applicable to most of our operations, and internal company policies, our correctional officers are required to complete a minimum amount of training. We generally require at least 40 hours of pre-service training before an employee is allowed to assume their duties plus an additional 120 hours of training during their first year of employment in our domestic facilities, consistent with American Correctional Association ("ACA") standards and/or applicable state laws. The 120 hours of instruction covers such topics as legal issues, rights of inmates, techniques of communication and supervision, and interpersonal skills. In addition to the usual aggregate of 160 hours of training in the first year, most states require 40 or 80 hours of on-the-job training. Florida law, for example, requires that correctional officers receive 520 hours of training. Each of our employees who has contact with inmates receives a minimum of 40 hours of additional training each year, and each manager receives at least 24 hours of training each year. We believe that our training programs meet or exceed all applicable requirements. 
We are focused on maintaining and enhancing the quality of operations at our facilities and we are proud that our company-wide policies and procedures as well as our operational performance at facilities within the standards and guidelines required by our government partners have led to accreditation for many of our facilities by ACA, The Joint Commission and the National Commission on Correctional Health Care. The accreditation process is complex and involves the evaluation of numerous factors and standards. For example, accreditation by the ACA of adult facilities includes the evaluation of the Company's performance against numerous performance standards, the evaluation of documentation provided by the Company, interviews of employees and detainees under our care and an assessment of the ability of detainees to file grievances. 
Ensuring the safety, security and well-being of those under our protection and care is a key focus for us which is reflected in our company-wide policies and procedures, our quality control plan specific to each facility, our monitoring and oversight activities at our facilities, our annual audits of facilities designed to evaluate our performance and compliance with our policies as well as those of our government partners, and the development of any necessary corrective action plans. Additionally, our government partners implement their contract requirements and detention standards that we must satisfy, perform monitoring and oversight activities at our facilities, including on-site monitors at certain of our facilities, and conduct audits of our performance and compliance with all applicable contract requirements and standards. 
Our operations comply with the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 ("PREA"), as well as client-specific policies and procedures relating to rape and sexual abuse. Our PREA coordinator is responsible for implementation of PREA monitoring systems and policies as well as developing, implementing and overseeing GEO's compliance with the national PREA standards in all its required corrections, reentry, and youth services   facilities. In addition, the GEO PREA coordinator provides guidance and resources in all matters related to PREA training, reporting, compliance, allegations, and investigations. 
In addition to the monitoring and oversight activities described above, we train our employees regarding the availability of our employee hotline for reporting any suspected misconduct as well as whistleblower protection for anyone reporting misconduct in good faith. Any misconduct reported to the employee hotline will be investigated by the GEO Office of Professional Responsibility. If we conclude after an investigation that an employee engaged in misconduct, we will address such misconduct as appropriate, including by reprimanding or terminating the employee. If the misconduct involves the violation of law, we report such misconduct to the proper law enforcement authorities. Additionally, our government customers also provide hotlines that are available to detainees to report misconduct. 
As our Global Human Rights Policy provides, we also have a "philosophy to support the ability of inmates and detainees to develop the values and skills needed to complete their terms, and upon release, become productive and law-abiding members of society." To this end, we launched our Continuum of Care program that provides enhanced in-custody offender rehabilitation programming, including cognitive behavioral treatment, integrated with post-release support services. We have committed $10 million of annual funding of the Continuum of Care program. Additionally, we have published a Continuum of Care Report for each of 2017 and 2018 providing highlights, fact sheets, a description of the services provided, and a description of outcomes and success stories. We are proud of our Continuum of Care program and we believe the annual reports we have published provide our shareholders and stakeholders with meaningful information regarding our role in assisting those in our care to become productive and law-abiding members of society. 
As we have stated, the implementation of our Global Human Rights Policy and our commitment to respect human rights is a process that requires ongoing assessment of our efforts and continuous improvement. We continue to be fully committed to that process and that commitment stems from the highest level of the organization. While we do not support this shareholder proposal for the reasons discussed above, we are in the planning stages and we are committed to publishing an annual public statement beginning in 2020 regarding the work we have done to date to operationalize our commitment to respect human rights, while giving due consideration to the legal and contractual obligations and limitations we have with respect to the confidentiality of information about those in our custody and care. Where appropriate and possible, we expect to offer information in this statement that will help stakeholders and shareholders better understand our progress in the human rights area. We also anticipate an ongoing review of our Global Human Rights Policy and associated training. 
In the years following adoption of the Global Human Rights Policy, we have undertaken to engage interested stakeholders in learning about the operation of our prison and detention facilities, the work we do to ensure that we fulfill our commitment to respect human rights in the operation of those facilities, and the work we have been doing with respect to our Continuum of Care program. Where appropriate, we anticipate engaging relevant stakeholders in the process of implementing our planned annual public statement. We believe the actions we have already undertaken discussed above and our continued engagement with various stakeholders will continue to build upon our long-term strategy to promote human rights. 
The Board believes the policies, training and programs implemented by the Company combined with the Company's forthcoming planned annual public statement will strike the appropriate balance between the Company's continuation of a long-term strategy to promote human rights in the real world environment the Company operates in and the shareholder's proposed report that does not give due consideration to the legal and contractual obligations we have with respect to the confidentiality of information about those in our custody and care. 
Conclusion 
For these reasons, the Board recommends that you vote "AGAINST" this proposal. Proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted against the proposal unless instructed otherwise.  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL AND NOMINATIONS DEADLINE
