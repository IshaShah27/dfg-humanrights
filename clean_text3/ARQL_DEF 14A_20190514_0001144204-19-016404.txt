TABLE OF CONTENTS
LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS
Introduction 
In 2018, we made important strides in advancing our pipeline of product candidates. As a result of those achievements, which build on steady progress from the prior two years, the Company's stock price began to recover, and we were able to raise the capital necessary to take the next steps in what could be a transformational phase for ArQule.
After successfully partnering our FGFR inhibitor, derazantinib, early in 2018, we continued to focus our energies on the Phase 1 study with ARQ 531, the development of miransertib in rare diseases and the dose escalation study with ARQ 751, all in biomarker-defined patient populations. I am gratified to report that significant advances were made with all these programs, and we plan to redouble our efforts in 2019 as we strive to bring these important therapies to patients in areas of high unmet need.
Pipeline of Product Candidates 
For ARQ 531, our potent and reversible dual inhibitor of wild type and C481S-mutant Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), we successfully enrolled over twenty patients across seven dose cohorts ranging from 5 mg to 65 mg QD in the Phase 1 trial. We presented data from this trial at three major conferences (AACR, EHA and ASH) that demonstrated a good safety profile, profound target engagement and encouraging signs of dose-dependent clinical activity in both lymphomas and C481S-mutant CLL. In addition, we recently reported that we saw the first partial response (88% tumor volume reduction) in a patient with C481S-mutant CLL in cohort 7 (65 mg) and that cohort 7 has been cleared for safety. We plan to present further data on the safety and activity of ARQ 531 at the 24th Annual European Hematological Association Congress in mid-June.
For miransertib, our potent and selective inhibitor of the AKT serine/threonine kinase, we presented first-of-its kind clinical data in Proteus syndrome at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG), received FDA fast track designation in PROS and worked with regulators to define registrational trial designs for both indications. We are in the process of initiating a registrational program in Proteus syndrome and PROS and will seek to gain approval of miransertib as the first (and only) systemic treatment for patients suffering from these devastating overgrowth diseases.
As previously reported, we have been collaborating with Memorial Sloan Kettering with miransertib in oncology, specifically in advanced endometrial cancer patients in combination with the aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole. In 2018, we expanded this Phase 1b study to up to forty patients, and we plan to present data for this trial in the second half of 2019.
Finally, we are encouraged by the data that we produced during 2018 with our highly potent and selective next generation AKT inhibitor, ARQ 751. We completed the dose escalation portion of the Phase 1 trial in relapsed and refractory metastatic cancer patients harboring AKT1, PI3K or PTEN mutations, identified a recommended Phase 2 dose of 75 mg QD and presented data at the EORTC/AACR/NCI congress in November. We now have moved ARQ 751 into a Phase 1b study in patients harboring these mutations to further explore its safety and activity both as a single agent and in combination with other anti-cancer agents. We plan to present data on this Phase 1b study later in the year.
In February 2018, we partnered our FGFR inhibitor, derazantinib, with Sinovant Sciences Ltd., a subsidiary of Roivant Sciences Ltd. (Sinovant), in Greater China and in April partnered derazantinib in the rest of the world with Basilea Pharmaceutica Ltd. (Basilea). Basilea continues the timely recruitment of the registrational trial in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and reported encouraging safety and activity data as part of its interim assessment of the trial conducted in January 2019. We anticipate that Sinovant will launch the first human clinical trial of derazantinib in Greater China in mid-2019. We are eligible to receive up to approximately $400 million in regulatory and sales milestones and tiered royalties on sales from these collaborations.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Looking Ahead 
Building on the progress of 2018, we believe that 2019 could be a watershed year for our product pipeline through the achievement of the following goals:
 ARQ 531 – complete the dose escalation portion of the Phase 1 trial; determine a recommended Phase 2 dose; initiate Phase 1b expansion cohorts; present results of the dose escalation Phase 1 trial at a major industry conference or conferences; and plan for a registrational trial in patients harboring the C481S  mutation 
​
 Miransertib (rare diseases) – initiate a registrational trial in Proteus syndrome and PROS 
​
 Miransertib (oncology) – complete recruitment of the ongoing Phase 1b trial in endometrial cancer and present data at a major conference later this year
​
 ARQ 751 – complete recruitment of the Phase 1b expansion trial and present data at a major conference later this year
​
 Derazantinib – complete the orderly and timely transfer of all clinical, manufacturing and regulatory responsibilities to our partners, Basilea and Sinovant
​
Finance 
In July 2018, we successfully raised approximately $70 million as a result of significant clinical progress across our pipeline. This follow-on offering allowed us to finish the year with almost $100 million of cash and marketable securities, putting us on strong financial footing to move our pipeline forward and achieve key clinical milestones in 2019.
As in years past, I would like to sincerely thank the patients that participate in our studies, the investigators with whom we collaborate, and the employees of ArQule whose dedication has allowed us to reach the point where we are today: on the cusp of launching a new registrational trial in rare diseases and delivering data that could change the landscape for the treatment of CLL and other B-cell malignancies.
Sincerely,
Paolo Pucci Chief Executive Officer

​
Proxy Statement 
​
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MEETING AND VOTING 
Why am I receiving these materials? 
ArQule, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("ArQule," the "Company," "we," "us," or "our"), sent you the Notice of Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy card because according to our stockholder records you own shares of our Common Stock, $0.01 par value ("Common Stock"). Any stockholder of record at the close of business on March 20, 2019 (the "Record Date") is entitled to vote those shares at the Company's upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders ("Annual Meeting"), which will be held on May 14, 2019 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time at the Boston Burlington Marriott, One Mall Road, Burlington, Massachusetts 01803. Our Board of Directors (the "Board") is soliciting your proxy to vote at the Annual Meeting. All stockholders are invited to attend the Annual Meeting and are entitled to and requested to vote on the items of business described in this Proxy Statement; however, you do not need to attend the Annual Meeting to vote your shares. Instead, you may simply complete, sign and return the accompanying proxy card, or follow the instructions below to submit your proxy by telephone or on the Internet. Although our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 is being delivered with the Proxy Statement, the Annual Report should not be deemed to be a part of the Proxy Statement. 
What is a proxy statement and what is a proxy? 
A proxy statement is a document that the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations require us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy designating individuals to vote on your behalf. A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote the shares you own. That other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document also is called a proxy or proxy card. We have designated Paolo Pucci and Peter S. Lawrence as proxies for the Annual Meeting. We will first provide this Proxy Statement and proxy card on or about March 28, 2019. 
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and a stockholder who holds stock in street name? 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our registrar and transfer agent, American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC, you are considered a stockholder of record with respect to those shares. If your shares are held in "street name," meaning your shares are held in a bank or brokerage account or with another nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares and the proxy materials were forwarded to you by your bank or broker, who is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank or broker how to vote the shares held in your account. 
What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting? 
The principal business expected to be transacted at the Annual Meeting, as more fully described below, will be: 
1.
To elect Susan L. Kelley, M.D. and Michael D. Loberg, Ph.D. as directors to hold office for a term of three years and until their respective successors are elected and qualified; 
​
2.
To approve an amendment and restatement of our 2014 Equity Incentives Plan to increase the number of shares of our Common Stock available for issuance pursuant to future awards made under the plan by 2,750,000; 
​

[END TABLE]
For Proposal 1, subject to our Majority Voting Policy described below, the affirmative vote of a plurality of shares of Common Stock cast by stockholders present at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, is required to elect each of the nominees. 
As an advisory vote, Proposal 4, the proposal to approve executive compensation, is not binding on the Company. However, the Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee"), which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions. 
What is the Majority Voting Policy? 
Our Board has adopted a policy that provides that in an uncontested election of directors, any nominee that is elected but receives a greater number of votes withheld from his or her election than votes in favor of election is expected to tender his or her resignation promptly following the date of the stockholders' meeting at which the vote occurs. As described below, the Compensation Committee will consider the resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept it in accordance with the terms of our Majority Voting Policy. 
What shares can I vote? 
Each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share held as of the Record Date on each matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. March 20, 2019 is the Record Date for our Annual Meeting. On that date, we had outstanding 109,095,759 shares of Common Stock.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
How many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at the Annual Meeting? 
The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority in interest of all stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business. For purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, proxies received but marked as abstentions and so-called "broker non-votes" (described below) will be counted as present. 
What if I am a beneficial owner and do not give voting instructions to my bank, broker or other nominee? 
As a beneficial owner, in order to ensure that your shares of Common Stock are voted in the way you would like, you must provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee by the deadline provided in the materials received from your banker, broker or other nominee. If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, whether your shares of Common Stock can be voted by such person depends on the type of item being voted on. 
 Non-Discretionary Items.   The election of directors (Proposal 1), amendment and restatement of our 2014 Equity Incentives Plan (Proposal 2) and advisory proposal to approve executive compensation (Proposal 4) are non-discretionary items and may not be voted by banks, brokers or other nominees who have not received specific voting instructions from beneficial owners. If you have not specifically instructed your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares on these proposals, your shares will not be voted on that matter, creating what is called a "broker non-vote." 
​
 Discretionary Items.   The ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 3) is a discretionary item. Generally, banks, brokers or other nominees that do not receive specific voting instructions from beneficial owners may vote on this proposal at their discretion. 
​
What Vote is Required to Approve Each Proposal and How are Votes Counted? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal   ​ ​  Required Vote   ​ ​  Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes   ​ 
[END TABLE]
 TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​​​​​​
How do I vote if my shares are held by my broker? 
If your shares are held by your broker in "street name," you will need to instruct your broker, in the manner provided by your broker, how to vote your shares. If your shares are held in "street name" and you wish to vote them in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain from your broker a properly executed legal proxy, identifying you as an ArQule stockholder, authorizing you to act on behalf of the broker at the Annual Meeting and specifying the number of shares with respect to which the authorization is granted. 
What different methods can I use to vote? 
Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to either: 
 complete, sign, date and return the accompanying proxy card; 
​
 vote on the Internet pursuant to the instructions provided in the proxy card; or 
​
 vote by telephone (toll-free) in the United States or Canada, in accordance with the instructions on the proxy card. 
​
What if I am a stockholder of record and do not specify a choice for a matter when returning a proxy? 
Stockholders should specify their choice for each matter on the Proxy Card. If you submit a valid proxy without directions as to votes on the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting, the proxy will be voted "FOR" each of Proposals 1 through 4. 
Can I change my vote after I have already voted? 
Stockholders may revoke the authority granted by an executed proxy at any time before its exercise by voting in person at the Annual Meeting or by filing with our President and Chief Operating Officer a written revocation or a duly executed proxy with a later date. If your shares are held in "street name," you should contact your broker for instructions on changing your vote. 
Who will bear the cost of soliciting votes for the Annual Meeting? 
We will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies, including charges and expenses of brokerage firms and others for forwarding solicitation material by mail to beneficial owners of stock. We have engaged The Proxy Advisory Group, LLC®, to assist in the solicitation of proxies and provide related advice and informational support for a services fee and the reimbursement of customary disbursements in an amount that is not expected to exceed $15,000 in the aggregate. In addition, our officers, employees and other representatives may solicit proxies in person or by telephone. 
What happens if additional matters are presented at the Annual Meeting? 
Other than the items of business described in this Proxy Statement, we are not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy holders will have discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If for any reason any of our nominees is not available as a candidate for director, the person named as proxy holder will vote your proxy for such other candidates as may be nominated by the Board. 
When will the Company announce the voting results? 
We will announce the preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. The Company will report the final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC which can be accessed on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or on our website at www.arqule.com.

This Proxy Statement, including the accompanying letter to stockholders, as well as other written reports and oral statements that we make from time to time, include statements that express our opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be, "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements can generally be identified by use of forward-looking terminology such as "believes", "expects", "intends", "may", "will", "plans", "should", "anticipates," "potential," "goal" or similar terminology. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees that the future results, plans, intentions or expectations, expressed or implied, will be achieved. Matters subject to forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date hereof, such expectations are based on certain assumptions regarding the progress of product development efforts including clinical trials and pre-clinical activities conducted by ourselves and third parties, the prosecution of existing and efforts to execute new collaborative agreements, receipt of potential milestones and royalties under our collaborative agreements, government regulations, reliance on third parties to conduct clinical trials and perform research and analysis services, adequate financial resources, changes in economic and business conditions, and other factors relating to our growth. Such expectations may not materialize if product development efforts, including any necessary trials of our potential drug candidates, are delayed or suspended, if our compounds fail to demonstrate safety and efficiency, if positive early results are not repeated in later studies or in humans, if the therapeutic value of our compounds is not realized, if negotiations with potential collaborators are delayed or unsuccessful, if we are unsuccessful at integrating acquired assets or technologies, or if other assumptions prove incorrect. We describe additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from these forward-looking statements in the "Risk Factors" section of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and other public filings with the SEC. 
Any forward-looking statements contained herein represent our judgment as of the date hereof and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​

Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Conduct 
At ArQule, we value honesty, integrity, and fairness in our dealings with our fellow employees, our stockholders, our collaborators and our communities. In addition to meeting both the letter and the spirit of regulations and rules adopted by the SEC, other federal and state laws and regulations and the standards of the Nasdaq Global Market ("Nasdaq"), our directors have mandated that our business dealings comply with the highest ethical and corporate governance standards. 
We have adopted general corporate governance principles, the ArQule Corporate Code of Conduct ("Code of Conduct") and related policies to provide guidance to our directors and management in their efforts to provide effective and appropriate corporate governance. As is the case with our other policies and practices, the tenets reflected in our governance principles, Code of Conduct and policies are intended to align the interests of our directors, management and other employees with those of our stockholders. We review and, if necessary in our judgment, modify the guidelines from time to time. 
The Code of Conduct applies to our directors, employees and officers, including our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, respectively) and our Chief Medical Officer. The Code of Conduct addresses: the standards of conduct expected of each director, officer and employee; conflicts of interest; corporate disclosure processes; compliance with laws, rules and regulations (including insider trading laws); corporate opportunities; confidentiality; fair dealing; and protection and proper use of Company assets. It also strongly encourages the reporting of any illegal or unethical behavior. Waivers of the requirements of the Code of Conduct or associated policies with respect to members of the Board and executive officers are subject to the approval of the full Board or a committee of the Board to which resolution of the matter is delegated and will be disclosed on our website. The governance principles, Code of Conduct and certain related policies are available on our website at http://www.arqule.com in the "Investors and Media" section under the heading "Corporate Governance."

Director Qualifications and Nomination Process 
Director Qualifications 
Our Compensation Committee identifies nominees for director from various sources including referrals from current Board members and industry contacts. In the past, the Compensation Committee has also used third party consultants to assist in identifying, evaluating, and recruiting potential nominees; however, no third-party consultant was used for this purpose during 2018. The directors have not set formal criteria or qualifications for individuals to be nominated or re-nominated as candidates for Board membership. Instead, the Compensation Committee has developed a general profile for candidates reflecting the personal and professional characteristics that our directors believe a suitable individual should possess. Such characteristics include integrity, business acumen and educational background, relevant industry experience, understanding of interpersonal relationships, no conflict of interest, a high degree of commitment to the functioning of the Board and its committees, and the ability to meet the independence and financial literacy requirements defined by applicable Nasdaq and SEC rules. Additionally, the Compensation Committee carefully considers issues of diversity among its members in identifying and considering potential nominees and attempts, where appropriate, to achieve a diversity of professional experiences, business cultures, perspectives, genders, ages and ethnicities, among other characteristics, in the membership of the Board and its committees. 
Our Company is a clinical-stage biotechnology company engaged in the research and development of innovative therapeutics to treat cancers and rare diseases. In light of the Company's current needs and business priorities, the Compensation Committee believes that the Board's membership should include directors with a high level of scientific and relevant business experience. Our business requires an understanding of the science behind our pre-clinical and clinical product candidates, as well as the clinical development and commercialization processes. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee has determined that scientific, drug development and commercialization experience should be represented on the Board. In addition, as a public company, our Board should include individuals who are financially literate to serve as members of the audit committee. We also believe that members should have a firm grounding in corporate governance and business ethics. Lastly, our business is dynamic and rapidly evolving and benefits from having a Board that includes individuals from a variety of backgrounds and professional experiences who contribute to the Board's overall ability to identify and ask difficult questions and to think innovatively. 
The following table summarizes how the qualifications, attributes, skills and experience described above relate to each individual director's contributions to the Board and its Committees. An "X" in the chart below indicates a specific competency for which the director has been nominated to serve on the Company's Board and its committees. 
The lack of an "X" for a particular qualification does not mean that the director does not possess that qualification or skill. Rather, an "X" indicates a primary area of focus or expertise of a director on which the Board currently relies.

Stockholder Nominations 
Stockholders may recommend individuals to our Compensation Committee for consideration as potential director candidates by submitting their names, together with any pertinent information regarding the candidate, including biographical information and a statement by the proposed candidate that he or she is willing to serve if nominated and elected, by mail to our corporate secretary at our offices at One Wall Street, Burlington, MA 01803. The Compensation Committee will evaluate stockholder-recommended candidates by following substantially the same process, and applying substantially the same criteria, as it follows for candidates submitted by others. If the Board determines to nominate a stockholder-recommended candidate and recommends his or her election, then his or her name will be included in our proxy card for the next annual meeting. 
Stockholders also have the right under our By-laws to directly nominate director candidates, without any action or recommendation on the part of the Compensation Committee or our Board, by following the procedures set forth under "Stockholder Proposals." 
Majority Voting Policy 
In March 2014, our Board adopted a majority voting policy with respect to the election of directors. The policy provides that in an uncontested election of directors of the Company, any nominee for election as a director who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" such election (a "Majority Withheld Vote") shall, promptly following the date of the stockholders' meeting at which the election occurred, tender his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board for consideration by the Compensation Committee. For purposes of the policy, an "uncontested election" means an election in which the number of nominees for election as director is equal to the number of directors to be elected. 
The Compensation Committee will consider the resignation and, promptly following the stockholders' meeting at which the election occurred, will recommend to the Board whether or not to accept it. The Compensation Committee will be expected to accept the resignation except in situations where circumstances would warrant the applicable director continuing to serve on the Board. 
In its deliberations about the proper recommendation, the Compensation Committee will consider a range of possible alternatives concerning the director's tendered resignation as it deems appropriate including, without limitation, acceptance of the resignation, rejection of the resignation, or rejection of the resignation coupled with a commitment to seek to address and cure the underlying reasons reasonably believed by the Compensation Committee to have substantially resulted in the "withheld" votes. 
The Board will act on the Compensation Committee's recommendation within 90 days of the date of the stockholders' meeting at which the election occurred. The Board will consider the information, factors and alternatives evaluated by the Compensation Committee in arriving at its recommendation and such additional information, factors and alternatives that the Board may consider to be relevant. 
Following the Board's decision on the Compensation Committee's recommendation, the Company will promptly disclose the decision regarding whether or not to accept the nominee's resignation (or the reasons for rejecting the resignation, if applicable), as well as a summary of the factors considered, in a Form 8-K furnished to the SEC. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Our Board retains ultimate responsibility for risk oversight and our management retains the responsibility for risk management. The role of our Board in our Company's risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports that include areas of material long- and short-term internal and external risks to our Company, including clinical, regulatory, manufacturing, financial, information technology, intellectual property, legal, compensation, strategic and reputational risks. The full Board (or the appropriate committee in the case of risks that are under the purview of a particular committee) receives these reports from the member of management responsible for the function from which the risk arises so that it can understand and assess our ongoing risk identification, risk management and risk mitigation strategies. Our Board also administers its risk oversight function through the required approval by the Board (or a committee of the Board) of significant transactions and other material decisions, and regular periodic  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​​​
reports from our company's independent registered public accounting firm and other outside consultants regarding various areas of potential risk, including, among others, those relating to our internal controls and financial reporting. As part of its charter, the Audit Committee discusses with management and our independent registered public accounting firm significant financial risks and exposures and the steps management has taken to minimize those risks. 
Communications with Directors 
We do not have a formal process for communication by stockholders with our directors. However, stockholders and others who wish to communicate may write to the Board as a whole, or to individual director's c/o: 
ArQule, Inc.One Wall StreetBurlington, Massachusetts 01803-4757Attn: Peter S. Lawrence President and Chief Operating Officer 
Such communications will be forwarded directly to the addressee. 
Director Independence 
Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules requires a majority of a listed company's board of directors to be comprised of independent directors. In addition, the Nasdaq rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company's audit and compensation committees be independent under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and compensation committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act. 
On January 15, 2019, our Board determined that all of our directors, other than Paolo Pucci, our Chief Executive Officer, are "independent directors" under the Nasdaq rules. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No member of the Compensation Committee during 2018 was an officer, former officer, or employee of the Company or had a relationship disclosable under our policies or SEC regulations. Further, during 2018, no executive officer of the Company served as: 
 a member of the compensation committee (or equivalent) of any other entity, one of whose executive officers served as one of our directors or was an immediate family member of a director, or served on our Compensation Committee; or 
​
 a director of any other entity, one of whose executive officers or their immediate family member served on our Compensation Committee. 
​
BOARD COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS 
During 2018, the Board held seven meetings in person or by telephone. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and the committees of the Board on which he or she served. 
We do not have a policy regarding attendance of directors at our annual meeting of stockholders. In May 2018, all of our directors attended our 2018 Annual Meeting. We also do not have a formal policy regarding the separation of our Board Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions. At this time, the positions are separate because the Board believes that this structure is in the best current interest of the Company and our stockholders. 
Committees of the Board 
Our Board has a standing audit committee (the "Audit Committee"), Compensation Committee and science committee (the "Science Committee"). Independent directors, as defined under the Nasdaq listing  TABLE OF CONTENTS
standards and SEC rules, chair and make up the entire membership of each of these committees. The Board has adopted written charters for each of our standing committees, which may be viewed by accessing the "Investors and Media" section of our website at www.arqule.com and clicking on the heading "Corporate Governance". 
Audit Committee 
In 2018, the members of the Audit Committee were Mr. Barabe (Chairman), Dr. Messenger and Mr. Zenner. The Audit Committee met five times in 2018. Each member of the Audit Committee meets the independence and financial literacy requirements as defined by applicable Nasdaq and SEC rules. The Board has determined that Mr. Barabe is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
The duties and principal purposes of the Audit Committee include: 
 oversight of the Company's accounting and financial reporting process; 
​
 monitoring of the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;

​
The Company's independent registered public accounting firm (currently, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP) is ultimately accountable to the Audit Committee in its capacity as a committee of the Board. The Audit Committee has sole authority and responsibility to select, hire, oversee, evaluate, approve the compensation of, and, where appropriate, replace our independent registered public accounting firm. 
A more detailed description of the duties of the Audit Committee is set forth in the committee's charter. 
Compensation Committee 
In 2018, the members of the Compensation Committee were Dr. Messenger (Chairman), Dr. Loberg and Mr. Zenner. The Compensation Committee met four times in 2018. Each member of the Compensation Committee meets the independence requirements as defined by applicable Nasdaq and SEC rules.

In 2018, each of our non-employee directors who was serving as a director prior to and immediately following the annual meeting of stockholders received a $25,000 annual retainer. In addition, the Board and/or committees chairs received an additional annual retainer as follows: 
 $20,000 for the Chairman of the Board; 
​
 $15,000 for the Chairman of the Audit Committee; 
​
 $15,000 for the Chairman of the Compensation Committee; and 
​
 $20,000 for the Chairman of the Science Committee. 
​
Each non-employee director receives an additional fee for each Board and/or committee meeting as follows: 
 $2,000 for each day on which the Board meets and the director attends; 
​
 $1,250 for each day on which the Audit Committee meets and the director attends; 
​
 $1,250 for each day on which the Compensation Committee meets and the director attends; and 
​
 $2,500 for each day on which the Science Committee meets and the director attends. 
​
All of our non-employee directors are eligible to participate in our 2014 Equity Incentives Plan. In 2018, our non-employee directors were entitled to the following stock-based compensation: 
 An initial grant upon election to the Board of an option to purchase 30,000 shares of Common Stock, vesting in three equal annual installments; 
​
 An annual grant of an option to purchase 20,000 shares of Common Stock (25,000 shares of Common Stock for the Chairman of the Board), vesting as to 100% of the award on the first anniversary of the date of grant; and 
​

​
In June 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Radford, an AON Hewitt company ("Radford"), to analyze our non-employee director compensation program. Further information on the Compensation Committee's engagement of Radford is set forth in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the subheading "Independent Compensation Consultant." Radford concluded that the directors overall total cash compensation was generally consistent with the 50th percentile of our peer group, but that the annual equity value was below the 25th percentile of our peer group. Radford updated its calculations in January 2019. Based on the Company's policy that equity compensation for non-employee directors should be targeted at the 50th percentile of our peer group, Radford recommended certain changes to the equity component of our non-employee director compensation program. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee accepted Radford's recommendations and the Board adopted the Compensation Committee's recommendations by amending the equity portion of our non-employee director compensation program in March 2019. From and after the date of such amendment, our non-employee directors will be entitled to the following stock-based compensation: 
 An initial grant upon election to the Board of an option to purchase 60,000 shares of Common Stock, vesting in three equal annual installments; 
​
 An annual grant of an option to purchase 40,000 shares of Common Stock (50,000 shares of Common Stock for the Chairman of the Board), vesting as to 100% of the award on the first anniversary of the date of grant; and 
​
 An initial grant upon appointment as Chairman of the Board of an option to purchase 50,000 shares of Common Stock, vesting in three equal annual installments. 
​
Each non-employee director is also entitled to reimbursement for reasonable travel and other expenses incurred in connection with attending meetings of the Board and any committee on which he or she serves. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for recommending the compensation of our named executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer, to the Board for its consideration. 
Compensation Philosophy 
Guiding Principles: 
Our executive compensation program is designed to be closely linked to corporate performance and returns to stockholders. To this end, we have developed an overall compensation strategy and a specific compensation plan that establishes competitive base salaries and ties a significant portion of executive compensation to the Company's success in meeting specified and measurable Company-wide performance goals. By using stock options and other stock-based awards, we ensure that part of each executive officer's compensation is closely tied to the performance of our stock. We believe that a significant part of overall compensation for senior executives should be "at risk," i.e., contingent upon successful implementation of the Company's strategy and achievement of its goals. Individuals with the greatest influence on company-wide performance should have the largest amount of cash benefits and stock-based awards at risk. In our view, a balanced approach to compensation decisions motivates management's efforts to drive positive outcomes in both current and future environments and mitigates the risk that any one incentive could lead executive officers to take actions that are not in the Company's best interest. In addition, the tying of compensation to performance goals that must be achieved in a heavily regulated business environment such as ours adds an additional layer of scrutiny to the Company's actions and reduces the opportunity for individuals to take inappropriate actions without discovery and sanctions. 
Objectives: 
 To attract and retain the best executive talent available; 
​
 To motivate our executives to achieve the goals inherent in our business strategy; 
​
 To link executive and stockholder interests through equity-based compensation; and 
​
 To provide a compensation package that recognizes corporate performance and individual contributions. 
​
Key compensation elements: 
 Base salary; 
​
 Annual performance-based cash bonuses; 
​
 Stock-based incentive awards; and 
​
 Employee benefits. 
​
Each of these elements is described in more detail below. 
The Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee advises our Board concerning the Company's compensation philosophy and policies, in general, and, in particular, recommends to the Board for determination, the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and other named executive officers and of members of the Board. Recommendations and decisions made by the Compensation Committee are typically reported to the full Board for approval, endorsement or ratification, as appropriate. As part of our Board's risk oversight responsibilities, our Compensation Committee reviews the Company's compensation policies and practices that are generally applicable to our employees and discusses with management risks created by such policies and practices. Based on that review and discussions with management, and taking into consideration ArQule's risk assessment and risk management policies and procedures, we believe that our compensation policies and procedures do not encourage excessive or unnecessary risk-taking and that the level of risk that they do encourage is appropriate.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
The Compensation Committee's Process 
General 
Our Compensation Committee sets the mix of elements of executive compensation to be recommended to the Board for approval including base salary, annual performance-based cash bonuses and stock-based awards for our named executive officers. While the Compensation Committee considers the elements of compensation described below separately, it takes into account the full compensation package afforded to each executive officer in making its recommendations. The Compensation Committee also makes recommendations concerning the appropriate linkage of executive compensation to corporate and individual performance and financial returns to stockholders. In evaluating compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the views of our Chief Executive Officer regarding achievement of individual and departmental objectives of those executives reporting directly to him. 
Independent Compensation Consultant 
Under its charter, SEC regulations and Nasdaq rules, the Compensation Committee has access to extensive resources and broad discretionary authority to engage compensation consultants and other advisors to assist it in its deliberations. From time to time and on an ad hoc basis, as needed, the Compensation Committee may retain an independent compensation consultant to provide executive compensation advice. In making its selection of a compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee assesses the consultant's independence to determine whether a conflict of interest exists that would prevent the consultant from exercising independent judgment when advising the Compensation Committee. 
Approximately every two years the Compensation Committee reviews peer group compensation data and additional selected compensation data produced by Radford. In 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Radford as its independent compensation consultant to provide compensation consulting services. Specifically, the Compensation Committee requested that Radford compile, analyze and present third-party data regarding the compensation of executives and non-employee directors at comparable companies and to compare that compensation with our current executive and non-employee director compensation programs. Radford did not provide any other services to us in 2018 beyond its engagement as an advisor to the Compensation Committee on executive and director compensation matters. Radford concluded that our executive officer's overall total cash compensation was generally consistent with the 50th percentile of our peer group, but that the annual equity value was below the 25th percentile of our peer group. Based on the Company's policy that equity compensation for executive officers should be targeted at the 50th percentile of our peer group, Radford recommended certain changes to the equity component of our executive compensation program. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee accepted Radford's recommendations and the Board adopted the Compensation Committee's recommendations by amending the equity portion of our executive compensation program in January 2019. These amendments will affect equity awards granted to executive officers in 2019 and beyond. 
In reviewing our executive compensation program, our peer group of companies, which we evaluate in conjunction with our review of peer compensation data, is comprised principally of non-commercial, life sciences companies with products in phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials that Radford has deemed to be most comparable to us in market capitalization and head count. In 2018, our peer group was comprised of the following companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
​  AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   ​ ​ Epizyme, Inc.  ​ ​  Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   ​ 
​ Cytokinetics, Incorporated  ​ ​  Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.   ​ ​ Ziopharm Oncology, Inc. ​ 
[END TABLE]
Benchmarking 
In general terms on a periodic basis, the Compensation Committee benchmarks total compensation for all of our employees to the median compensation (i.e. 50th percentile) of employees performing similar job  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
functions at our peer companies. However, we strongly believe in retaining the best talent among our executive management team. Therefore, we have recommended in the past, and may recommend in the future, total compensation packages for executive management that vary substantially from the median based on factors such as industry experience, scope of responsibility, knowledge, and unique qualifications. 
Say-on-Pay 
In 2018, our stockholders cast an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. Our stockholders endorsed our compensation philosophy with more than 99% of stockholders' votes cast being in favor our named executive officers' compensation. Consequently, our current intention is to continue implementing our existing programs and policies. 
Elements of Compensation 
Base Salary 
Salary levels are considered annually as part of our performance review process, but also in cases including promotion or other change in the job responsibilities of an executive officer. For named executive officers, initial base salaries generally are established in connection with negotiation of an offer of employment or an employment agreement. In addition to promotion and increased responsibilities, base salaries may also be adjusted based on merit and/or to reflect company-wide salary adjustments. 
The following table shows changes in the annualized base salaries of our named executive officers from 2017 to 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name and Principal Position   ​ ​  2017 Annualized Base Salary ($)   ​ ​  2018 Annualized Base Salary ($)   ​ ​% Increase   ​ ​  Comment   ​ 
 Paolo Pucci, CEO   ​ ​ ​ ​ 499,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 506,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 1.5 ​ ​ ​ Base salary negotiated in and adjusted per amended employment agreement and annual review.  ​ 
 Peter S. Lawrence, COO   ​ ​ ​ ​ 448,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 459,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2.5 ​ ​ ​ Base salary negotiated in and adjusted per amended employment agreement and annual review.  ​ 
 Dr. Brian Schwartz, CMO   ​ ​ ​ ​ 446,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 457,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2.5 ​ ​ ​ Base salary negotiated in and adjusted per employment agreement and annual review.  ​ 
 Robert J. Weiskopf, CFO   ​ ​ ​ ​ 317,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 325,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2.5 ​ ​ ​  Base salary adjusted at annual review.  ​ 
[END TABLE]
Salaries of our named executive officers are also reported in the Summary Compensation Table. 
Performance-Based Bonuses 
Cash bonuses represent a percentage of each named executive officer's salary. In determining the target award opportunity for the bonus of a particular executive, we consider compensation data and the level of strategic contribution to the Company's performance. This determination is made at the time an executive officer is hired and generally is one of the negotiated terms of his or her employment agreement. Adjustments to bonus targets are also considered, subject to the requirements of those employment agreements, as part of the annual review process. 
At the beginning of each fiscal year, we set corporate goals at minimum, planned, and maximum levels of performance and weight the goals according to their importance to our corporate strategy. Levels of performance for these goals are expressed as percentages which, when determined by our Compensation Committee and Board following conclusion of the fiscal year, are aggregated to arrive at an overall level of performance for the Company. In determining individual bonus amounts for our named executive officers, our directors take into consideration the Company's overall performance, the named executive officer's achievement of specific individual goals and the amount of the named executive officer's target bonus.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
The following is a summary description of the primary corporate goals for 2018 used to determine performance-based bonuses: 
Development Goals
 Derazantinib (ARQ 087): Dose a specified number of patients in the registrational trial for derazantinib in Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by year end. 
​
 ARQ 531: Establish recommended Phase 1b dose and dose first patient a Phase 1b trial by year end. 
​
 Miransertib (ARQ 092): Dose first patient in registrational trial in Proteus syndrome by a specified date. 
​
 ARQ 751: Reach a go/no go decision for ARQ751 in oncology by a specified date. 
​
Finance
 End year with a specified amount of cash and marketable securities while meeting all key budget parameters. 
​
Business Development
 Conclude one or more business development transactions with a specified amount of upfront payment and other milestones. 
​
Following the recommendations of the Compensation Committee, our Board determined that, on a weighted basis, our overall level of performance warranted payment of bonuses at 100% of the bonus target. This determination reflected results with respect to development goals that were at and in certain cases below planned performance levels and finance and business development goals that were at or above planned performance levels. The following table shows percentages of target and actual bonuses paid to our named executive officers.

[END TABLE]
The amounts of cash bonus awards made to our named executive officers are also reported in the Summary Compensation Table. 
Stock-based Awards 
Primarily, we have granted stock options and/or shares of restricted stock to our named executive officers under our stockholder-approved equity incentive plans. Stock options must be issued with an exercise price equal to the closing price of our Common Stock as reported by Nasdaq on the date of grant. Options vest over various periods of time, generally four years. Restricted stock awards have restrictions which lapse over various periods of time, also generally four years. We have also awarded performance-based stock units (PSUs), each of which represents a contingent right to receive one share of  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Common Stock. Under the terms of our plans and subject to the restrictions contained in those plans, the Compensation Committee has the flexibility to rebalance the vesting terms and performance conditions of these awards as it deems necessary or advisable, for example to take into account unforeseen adverse events or clinical developments. 
Stock option grants, and awards of restricted stock and stock units, are designed to encourage the creation of stockholder value over the long term since the full benefits of the options and awards cannot be realized unless stock price appreciation is achieved, and, once achieved, is maintained and increased. Accordingly, awards of options, restricted stock and stock units align the interests of executive officers and employees with those of stockholders. 
In general, we establish ranges for these grants and awards to our named executive officers based on a number of factors, including published third-party data, the executive's job level, promotions, responsibilities he or she may assume in the upcoming year, responsibilities undertaken in prior years and other considerations deemed appropriate by the Compensation Committee. In determining an executive's annual grant, we apply the results of the Company's annual performance and the executive's individual performance to the applicable range, and then take into consideration any other factors that the Compensation Committee deems relevant. 
After consideration of all of these factors, as well as corporate and individual performance, in January 2019 for performance in 2018, we awarded Mr. Pucci an option to purchase 650,850 shares of our Common Stock; Mr. Lawrence, an option to purchase 368,350 shares of our Common Stock, Dr. Schwartz, an option to purchase 314,050 shares of our Common Stock and Mr. Weiskopf, an option to purchase 100,000 shares of our Common Stock. All of these options vest ratably over a four-year period commencing from the date awarded. 
The Compensation Committee makes a recommendation regarding annual stock option awards at a meeting in December prior to the first meeting of the Board in the following calendar year. At its January meeting, the Board acts upon the recommendations of the Compensation Committee and the actual awards are granted on the date of Board approval. 
Performance-Based Option Awards 
In 2017, the Compensation Committee granted participating executives performance-based options at an exercise price of  $0.95 per share. Mr. Pucci, Mr. Lawrence, Dr. Schwartz and Mr. Weiskopf have the opportunity to earn options covering up to 600,000, 300,000, 260,000 and 160,000 shares, respectively. In addition to time-based vesting, the options will vest and become exercisable only if specified performance conditions are satisfied. These performance conditions are linked to our product candidate development pipeline, with the percentages of achievement ranging from 25% to 100% depending upon the level of our clinical success. In addition, the option grants to Messrs. Pucci and Lawrence are subject to an additional condition tied to our stock price. As of March 20, 2019, the performance conditions have been achieved with respect to 50% of the performance-based options. If the remaining performance conditions are not satisfied within 36 months of the date of grant, the unearned performance options will terminate. 
Other Factors 
Each year, prior to arriving at final compensation for the Company's named executive officers, the Compensation Committee typically considers other factors that it deems relevant in addition to those listed above. These factors may include the performance of the Company's stock relative to its peer group as well as other considerations and circumstances. As a result, even in cases where progress against corporate performance goals has been positive and an individual's performance has been judged as strong, the individual's compensation may be impacted. For example, until 2017 our Chief Executive Officer's realizable pay (base salary and bonus) had been effectively unchanged for five years since its adjustment in January 2012 despite relatively strong performance against corporate performance goals and high levels of individual performance during that period. The Compensation Committee will continue to exercise this type of discretion in situations where it is deemed appropriate. 
Employment Agreements 
ArQule generally enters into employment agreements with its named executive officers. Typically, these agreements are offered in connection with recruiting executive officers when ArQule deems it necessary or  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
appropriate to attract, incentivize and retain new hires. Agreements of this type exist to establish initial salary and bonuses, benefits, initial option grants, reporting lines, and change of control and related severance provisions, among other things. Mr. Pucci, Mr. Lawrence and Dr. Schwartz have such agreements. 
Other Elements of Compensation and Perquisites 
We provide our named executive officers with certain benefits and perquisites. In general, we provide these benefits on the same terms as those applicable to all of our other employees. Any non-recurring benefit or program such as housing allowance or relocation costs, will be reported as "All Other Compensation" in the Summary Compensation Table. The primary benefits are: 
 health (medical, dental and vision) insurance for which the Company pays a portion of the premiums; 
​
 a life insurance benefit equivalent to two times base salary up to a maximum of  $400,000 for which the Company pays the premiums; 
​
 long-term disability insurance equal to 60% of base salary up to $15,000 per month, the premiums for which are paid by the Company with the amount of the premiums being included in the taxable compensation of employees; 
​
 if necessary to attract management talent, housing allowances and relocation costs; 
​
 a retirement plan (401(k) Plan) under which an employee can choose to contribute up to 60% (subject to Tax Code limits) of compensation on a pre-tax basis with a matching contribution from the Company of  $0.50 for each $1.00 contributed up to the first 6% of compensation; 
​
 a tax-qualified stock purchase plan which permits participants to acquire shares of Common Stock at a price that is 85% of the stock price on either the first day or last day of the designated offering period (generally six months), whichever is lower; and 
​
 tuition reimbursement up to $3,000 per year for undergraduate courses and $6,000 for graduate courses. 
​
Currently, the Company does not have a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, a pension plan, or other defined benefit plan. In addition, the Company does not have a policy on adjustments to, or recovery of, awards if the performance measures on which they were based are adjusted or restated. 
Potential Payments to Named Executive Officers upon Termination or Change of Control 
The employment agreements of Mr. Pucci, Mr. Lawrence and Dr. Schwartz provide for certain payments to be made to them in the event that their employment with the Company is, or is deemed to be (as provided in the employment agreements), terminated without "cause." Severance benefits are an important tool in attracting and retaining key employees and provide a degree of financial security to such employees where their employment is terminated through no fault of their own. Each of the agreements also provides for acceleration of vesting of the executive's stock-based awards in certain circumstances following the occurrence of a change of control of the Company. We believe that it is generally appropriate to vest stock-based awards to key employees who are terminated in connection with a change of control transaction, as such a transaction may often result in the elimination or reduction of the employee's ability to realize value from his or her options. 
For information regarding the severance and change of control benefits provided to Mr. Pucci, Mr. Lawrence and Dr. Schwartz under their employment agreements, see "Payments upon Termination or Change of Control". TABLE OF CONTENTS​
Tax Considerations 
If an executive is entitled to nonqualified deferred compensation benefits that are subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Tax Code"), and such benefits do not comply with Section 409A, the executive would be subject to adverse tax treatment, including accelerated income recognition (in the first year that benefits are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture) and an additional income tax of 20% of the amount so recognized. The employment agreements of our named executive officers described herein contain provisions intended to limit or eliminate adverse tax consequences through timing of payments. 
In 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which substantially modified the Tax Code and, among other things, eliminated the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m). As a result, the Compensation Committee currently expects that compensation in amounts over $1 million paid to any named executive officer will no longer be deductible.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​

CEO Pay Ratio—9.9:1 
We believe our executive compensation program must be consistent and internally equitable to motivate our employees to perform in ways that enhance shareholder value. We are committed to internal pay equity, and the Compensation Committee monitors the relationship between the pay of our executive officers and the pay of our non-executive employees. The Compensation Committee reviewed a comparison of our Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation in fiscal year 2018 to that of all other Company employees for the same period. The calculation of annual total compensation of all employees was determined in the same manner as the "Total Compensation" shown for our Chief Executive Officer in the "Summary Compensation Table" in this proxy. Pay elements that were included in the annual total compensation for each employee are: 
 salary received in fiscal year 2018;
​
 annual bonus payment received in fiscal year 2018;
​
 grant date fair value of annual stock-based awards granted in 2018;
​
 Company-paid 401(k) Plan match made during fiscal year 2018; and
​
 Company-paid life insurance premiums during fiscal year 2018.
​
Our calculation includes all employees as of December 31, 2018. 
We determined the compensation of our median employee by: (i) calculating the annual total compensation described above for each of our employees, (ii) ranking the annual total compensation of all employees except for the Chief Executive Officer from lowest to highest (a list of 30 employees), and (iii) since we have an even number of employees when not including the Chief Executive Officer, determining the average of the annual total compensation of the two employees ranked fifteen and sixteen on the list ("Median Employee"). 
The annual total compensation for fiscal year 2018 for our Chief Executive Officer was $1,744,527, and for the Median Employee was $175,993. The resulting ratio of our Chief Executive Officer's pay to the pay of our Median Employee for fiscal year 2018 is 9.9 to 1.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​

PROPOSAL 2—APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF OUR 2014 EQUITY INCENTIVES PLAN 
General 
We are asking our stockholders to approve an amendment and restatement of our 2014 Equity Incentives Plan, referred to as the 2014 Plan, to provide for a 2,750,000 share increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the 2014 Plan. Other than the increase in the number of shares that may be issued under the 2014 Plan, the amended and restated 2014 Plan is unchanged from the existing 2014 Plan that was previously approved by stockholders. The Board approved the amendment and restatement of the 2014 Plan on March 12, 2019. 
The following summary of the material terms of the 2014 Plan is qualified by reference to the full text of the 2014 Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix A. 
The 2014 Plan permits us to grant awards to our directors, employees and consultants in any of the following forms: 
 options to purchase shares of Common Stock, which may be non-statutory stock options or incentive stock options; 
​
 stock appreciation rights, which give the holder the right to receive the difference between the fair market value per share of Common Stock on the date of exercise over the grant price; 
​
 performance shares vesting upon the attainment of specified performance goals; 
​
 restricted stock, which is subject to restrictions on transferability and subject to forfeiture on terms set by the Compensation Committee; 
​
 stock units, which represent the right to receive shares of Common Stock in the future, subject to terms, restrictions, conditions, performance criteria, vesting requirements and payment rules as set by the Compensation Committee; and 
​
 other stock-based awards in the discretion of the Compensation Committee, including convertible Preferred Stock, convertible debentures, exchangeable securities and Common Stock awards or options. 
​
The 2014 Plan also allow us to make cash awards under specified circumstances. 
To date, we have granted only incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock and stock units under the 2014 Plan. Currently, we plan to issue only stock options and restricted stock under the 2014 Plan but retain the flexibility to make awards in other forms. 
Common Stock Available under the 2014 Plan 
The amendment and restatement of the 2014 Plan will increase the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that we may issue under the 2014 Plan by 2,750,000 shares. If stockholders approve the amendment and restatement of the 2014 Plan, the aggregate number of shares that will be available for grants and awards under the 2014 Plan will be 10,250,000, plus an undetermined number of shares subject to awards made under our 1994 Equity Incentive Plan that otherwise would have been returned to that plan on account of the expiration, cancellation or forfeiture of awards. We are not able to grant additional awards under our 1994 Equity Incentive Plan. 
As of March 20, 2019, options to purchase an aggregate of 2,346,956 shares remain available for issuance under the 2014 Plan and there were 8,839,822 shares subject to outstanding options under the 2014 Plan. In addition, as of March 20, 2019, there were 3,476,995 shares subject to outstanding options under the 1994 Equity Incentive Plan that could become available for issuance under the 2014 Plan if they expire, terminate or are otherwise forfeited. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Under the 2014 Plan, the number of shares of Common Stock available for grants and awards is calculated as follows: 
 To the extent that any award is forfeited, or any stock option or stock appreciation right terminates, expires or lapses without being exercised, the shares subject to those awards not delivered are again available for awards under the 2014 Plan. 
​
 Shares tendered or withheld to pay the exercise price of a stock option or to pay tax withholding for restricted stock will count against shares authorized but unissued under the 2014 Plan and will not be added back to the shares available under the 2014 Plan. When a stock appreciation right is exercised and settled for shares, the number of shares subject to the grant will be counted against the number of shares available for issuance under the 2014 Plan regardless of the number of shares used to settle the stock appreciation right upon exercise. 
​
 For any two (2) shares of Common Stock issued in connection with a full value award, i.e., performance shares, restricted stock, stock units or other stock-based awards, three (3) fewer shares of Common Stock will be available for issuance in connection with options and future stock awards under the 2014 Plan. 
​
Administration and Eligibility 
The selection of persons who will receive awards under the 2014 Plan and the sizes and types of awards will be generally determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee determines, within the limits of the 2014 Plan, the terms and conditions of each award. All of the Company's directors and employees are eligible to participate in the 2014 Plan. As of January 2019, the Company had 36 employees. Consultants of the Company or any affiliate, who are capable of contributing significantly to the successful performance of the Company are also eligible to participate in the 2014 Plan, but only for awards other than incentive stock options.
The exercise price of any stock option (non-statutory and incentive) granted under the 2014 Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant and the term of any such option or stock appreciation right may not be greater than 10 years. Incentive stock options granted to an employee who owns 10% of our voting stock may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant and the term of any such option may not be greater than five years. Fair market value under the 2014 Plan is defined as the the closing sale price of a share of Common Stock as reported on the applicable securities exchange or quotation system as of the relevant date. 
Subject to certain limitations, the Compensation Committee or the Board may delegate to one or more of our executive officers the power to make awards to participants who are not subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The Board has granted such authority to Mr. Pucci and Mr. Lawrence. 
Adjustments to Reflect Certain Events and Transactions 
If the outstanding Common Stock of the Company changes as a result of a stock dividend, stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, split-up, spin-off, combination, exchange of shares, or the like, the 2014 Plan permits the Compensation Committee to substitute or adjust: (a) the number and class of securities subject to outstanding awards or the type of consideration to be received upon exercise or payment of an award, (b) the exercise price of options, (c) the aggregate number and class of securities for which awards may be granted under the 2014 Plan, and/or (d) the maximum number of securities with respect to which an employee may be granted awards during any calendar year. In the event of a merger or consolidation to which the Company is a party or other specified transactions, the 2014 Plan authorizes the Compensation Committee to make such changes and adjustments to outstanding awards as it deems equitable including causing any award to become vested in whole or in part, be assumed by a successor or acquirer, or be cancelled in consideration of a cash payment equal to the fair value of the cancelled award. 
Withholding 
The Company is generally required to withhold tax on the amount of income recognized by a participant with respect to an award. Withholding requirements may be satisfied, as provided in the  TABLE OF CONTENTS
agreement evidencing the award, by (a) tender of a cash payment to the Company, (b) withholding of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable, or (c) delivery to the Company by the participant of unencumbered shares of Common Stock. 
Termination and Amendment; Term of Plan 
Unless sooner terminated by the Board in accordance with its terms, the 2014 Plan will terminate on May 12, 2024. Once the 2014 Plan is terminated, no further awards may be granted or awarded under the 2014 Plan. Termination of the 2014 Plan will not affect the validity of any awards outstanding on the date of termination. 
Federal Income Tax Considerations 
The following discussion briefly summarizes certain federal income tax consequences of awards under the 2014 Plan and does not attempt to describe all possible federal or any foreign, state, local, or other tax consequences related to awards or tax consequences based upon particular circumstances. 
Incentive Stock Options.   In general, no taxable income is realized by a participant upon the grant of an Incentive Stock Option ("ISO"). If stock is issued to the participant pursuant to the exercise of an ISO, and if no disqualifying disposition of such shares is made by the participant within two years after the date of grant or within one year after the transfer of such shares to such him or her, then upon the sale of such shares, any amount realized in excess of the option price will be taxed to the participant as a long-term capital gain and any loss sustained will be a long-term capital loss. However, if the participant disposes of the shares acquired on exercise before the later of the second anniversary of the date of grant or one year after the receipt of the shares by the participant (a "Disqualifying Disposition"), the participant generally would include in ordinary income in the year of the Disqualifying Disposition an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise (or, if less, the amount realized on the disposition of the shares), over the exercise price paid for the shares. Subject to certain exceptions, an ISO generally will not be treated as an ISO if it is exercised more than three months following termination of employment. If an ISO is exercised at a time when it no longer qualifies as an ISO, it will be treated for tax purposes as a non-statutory stock option as discussed below. 
Non-statutory Stock Options.   A participant generally is not required to recognize income on the grant of a non-statutory stock option. Generally, ordinary income is instead required to be recognized on the date the non-statutory stock option is exercised. In general, the amount of ordinary income required to be recognized is the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price. 
Restricted Stock.   A participant who is granted restricted stock under the 2014 Plan is not required to recognize income with respect to the shares until the shares vest, unless the participant makes a special tax election to recognize income upon award of the shares. In either case, the amount of income the participant recognizes equals the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock at the time income is recognized. 
Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance Shares, Stock Units and Other Stock Based Awards.   A participant generally is not required to recognize income on the grant of a stock appreciation right, an award of performance shares, an award of stock units, or any other stock-based award. Generally, ordinary income is instead required to be recognized upon the issuance of shares and/or cash pursuant to the terms of the award. In general, the amount of ordinary income required to be recognized is the excess, if any, of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any shares received, over the amount, if any, paid for the award. 
Deductibility by Company.   The Company generally is not allowed a deduction in connection with the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option. However, if a participant is required to recognize ordinary income as a result of a Disqualifying Disposition, the Company generally will be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income so recognized. In general, for a non-statutory stock option (including an incentive stock option that is treated as a non-statutory stock option, as described above), a restricted stock award, a stock appreciation right, a performance shares award, a stock units award, or any other stock-based award, the Company will be allowed to deduct the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant, provided certain income tax reporting requirements are satisfied.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Performance-Based Compensation.   Subject to certain exceptions, Section 162(m) of the Tax Code disallows federal income tax deductions for compensation paid by a publicly-held corporation to certain executives to the extent the amount paid to an executive exceeds $1 million for the taxable year. Historically, compensation that qualified as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) could be excluded from this $1 million limit, but this exception has now been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, unless transition relief for certain compensation arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017 is available. 
Tax Rules Affecting Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans.   Section 409A of the Tax Code imposes tax rules that apply to "nonqualified deferred compensation plans." Failure to comply with, or to qualify for an exemption from, the rules with respect to an award could result in significant adverse tax results to the award recipient including immediate taxation upon vesting, an additional income tax of 20 percent of the amount of income so recognized, plus a tax in the nature of interest. The 2014 Plan is intended to comply with, or qualify for an exemption from, Section 409A of the Tax Code to the extent applicable. 
Parachute Payments.   Where payments to certain persons that are contingent on a change of control exceed limits specified in the Tax Code, the person generally is liable for a 20 percent excise tax on, and the corporation or other entity making the payment generally is not entitled to any deduction for, a specified portion of such payments. Any award under which vesting is accelerated by a change of control of the Company, would be relevant in determining whether the excise tax and deduction disallowance rules would be triggered. 
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by the stockholders present at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, is needed to approve the increase in the number of shares that may be issued under the 2014 Plan. If you submit a proxy without direction as to a vote on this matter, your proxy will be treated as a vote "FOR" this proposal. Broker non-votes and abstentions will not be treated as votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on this proposal.

PROPOSAL 4—ADVISORY VOTE ON APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
The SEC's proxy rules permit our stockholders to cast an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this proxy statement. Furthermore, our Board recognizes that stockholders have a legitimate interest in executive compensation matters and a growing interest in voicing their approval on our policies with respect to such matters. 
Accordingly, this proposal gives you, as a stockholder, the opportunity to endorse or not endorse our overall compensation programs and policies relating to our named executive officers, as described in detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and related compensation tables (and accompanying narrative disclosures) contained in this proxy statement, by voting for or against the compensation of our named executive officers.
Your vote will not directly affect or otherwise limit any compensation or award arrangements that have already been granted to any of our named executive officers. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board. However, our Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
We believe that our compensation policies and procedures support our business strategy by rewarding successful achievement of specific business goals, as well as our operating and financial results. Furthermore, we believe that our compensation policies and procedures, which provide performance-based incentives to maximize stockholder value, are strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. 
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by the stockholders present at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, is needed to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers. If you submit a proxy without direction as to a vote on this matter, your proxy will be treated as a vote "FOR" this proposal. Broker non-votes and abstentions will not be treated as votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on this proposal. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THIS PROPOSAL. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to Awards that are intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may not delegate its authority and powers with respect to such Awards if such delegation would cause the Awards to fail to so qualify. 
4. Eligibility.   Awards may be granted only to Eligible Persons, provided that Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Eligible Persons who are Section 422 Employees. 
5. Stock Subject to Plan.
5.1. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.2 or Section 14 or amendment of the Plan pursuant to Section 15, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to Awards (including Incentive Stock Options) under the Plan shall equal the sum of  (a) 10,250,000 and (b) any Shares that otherwise would have been returned to the Amended and Restated 1994 Equity Incentive Plan after the Effective Date, on account of the expiration, cancellation or forfeiture of awards granted under the Company's Amended and Restated 1994 Equity Incentive Plan. Shares granted under the Plan may be either authorized but unissued Shares or treasury Shares. 
5.2. If any Shares subject to an Award under the Plan or an award outstanding under the Company's Amended and Restated 1994 Equity Incentive Plan are forfeited, or any Award or award outstanding under the Company's Amended and Restated 1994 Equity Incentive Plan is settled for cash, the Shares shall, to the extent of such forfeiture or cash settlement, again be available for Awards under the Plan subject to the following sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the following Shares shall not be added to the Shares authorized for grant under this Section: (i) Shares tendered by the Participant or withheld by the Company in payment of the purchase price of an Option, (ii) Shares tendered by the Participant or withheld by the Company to satisfy any tax withholding obligation with respect to an Award, (iii) Shares subject to an SAR settled in Shares for which the Award is exercised (that is, Shares actually issued pursuant to an SAR, as well as the Shares that represent payment of the exercise price) will cease to be available under the Plan. 
5.3. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 14, the maximum number of Shares with respect to which an Employee may be granted Awards under the Plan (whether settled in Shares or the cash equivalent thereof) during any calendar year is one million (1,000,000) Shares. The maximum number of Shares with respect to which an Employee has been granted Awards shall be determined in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code. 
5.4. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5, for any two (2) Shares issued in connection with a Full Value Award, three (3) fewer Shares will be available for issuance in connection with Awards under Section 5.1. 
5.5. Shares of Common Stock underlying any outstanding stock option or Full Value Award granted under the Amended and Restated 1994 Equity Incentive Plan that, after the Effective Date, expires, or is terminated, surrendered or forfeited, in whole or in part, for any reason without issuance of such Shares shall be available for the grant of new Awards under this Plan. For purposes of Section 5.7, for any two (2) Shares added back in connection with a Full Value Award, three (3) Shares will be available for issuance in connection with Awards under Section 5.1.

6. Options.
6.1. Options granted under the Plan shall be either Incentive Stock Options or Nonqualified Stock Options, as designated by the Committee. Each Option granted under the Plan shall be a Nonqualified Stock Option unless expressly identified as an Incentive Stock Option, and each Option shall be evidenced by an Agreement that specifies the terms and conditions of the Option. Options shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 6 and such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee may specify. The Committee, in its discretion, may condition the grant or vesting of an Option upon the achievement of one or more specified Performance Goals. 
6.2. The Exercise Price of an Option granted under the Plan shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Date of Grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who, on the Date of Grant is a Ten-Percent Stockholder, the Exercise Price shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Date of Grant. 
6.3. The Committee shall determine the Option Period for an Option, which shall be specifically set forth in the Agreement, provided that an Option shall not be exercisable after ten years (five years in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Employee who on the Date of Grant is a Ten-Percent Stockholder) from its Date of Grant. 
7. Exercise of Options.
7.1. Subject to the terms of the applicable Agreement, an Option may be exercised, in whole or in part, by delivering to the Company a notice of the exercise, in such form as the Committee may prescribe, accompanied by (a) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised or (b) to the extent provided in the applicable Agreement, irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company cash equal to the Exercise Price of the Option. 
7.2. To the extent provided in the applicable Agreement or otherwise authorized by the Committee, payment of the Exercise Price may be made by delivery (including constructive delivery) of Shares (provided that such Shares, if acquired pursuant to an Option or other Award granted hereunder or under any other compensation plan maintained by the Company or any Affiliate, have been held by the Participant for such period, if any, as the Committee may specify) valued at Fair Market Value on the Date of Exercise. 
7.3. To the extent provided in the applicable Agreement, an Option may be exercised by directing the Company to withhold from the Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Option (or portion thereof) being exercised a number of Shares having a Fair Market Value not in excess of the aggregate Exercise Price of the Option (or portion thereof being exercised), with payment of the balance of the Exercise Price, if any, being made pursuant to Section 7.1 and/or Section 7.2. 
8. Performance Awards.   Each Performance Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Agreement that (a) provides for the payment of cash or issuance of Shares to a Participant contingent upon the attainment of one or more specified Performance Goals over such period as the Committee may specify, and (b) contains such other terms and conditions as the Committee may specify. If the terms of a Performance Award provide for payment in the form of Shares, for purposes of Section 5.3, the Performance Award shall be deemed to cover a number of Shares equal to the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon payment of the Award. If the terms of a Performance Award provide for payment in the form of cash, the maximum cash amount payable to any Employee pursuant to all Performance Awards granted to an Employee during a calendar year shall not exceed two million dollars $2,000,000. 
9. Restricted Stock Awards.   Each Award of Restricted Stock under the Plan shall be subject to an Agreement specifying the terms and conditions of the Award. Restricted Stock granted under the Plan shall consist of Shares that are restricted as to transfer, subject to forfeiture, and subject to such other terms and conditions as the Committee may specify. Such terms and conditions may provide, in the discretion of the Committee, for the lapse of such transfer restrictions or forfeiture provisions to be contingent upon the achievement of one or more specified Performance Goals.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
10. Restricted Stock Unit Awards.   Each Award of Restricted Stock Units under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Agreement that (a) provides for the issuance of Shares (or the cash equivalent thereof) to a Participant at such time(s) as the Committee may specify and (b) contains such other terms and conditions as the Committee may specify, including terms that condition the issuance, vesting, or payment of Restricted Stock Unit Awards upon the achievement of one or more specified Performance Goals. 
11. Stock Appreciation Rights.
11.1. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may award SARs in tandem with an Option (at or after the award of the Option), or alone and unrelated to an Option. SARs in tandem with an Option shall terminate to the extent that the related Option is exercised, and the related Option shall terminate to the extent that the tandem SARs are exercised. SARs granted in tandem with Options shall have an Exercise Price not less than the Exercise Price of the related Option. SARs granted alone and unrelated to an Option shall have an Exercise Price not less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of such Award. 
11.2. Any SAR related to an Option, which SAR can only be exercised upon or during limited periods following a change in control of the Company, may entitle the Participant to receive an amount based upon the highest price paid or offered for Common Stock in any transaction relating to the change in control or paid during the thirty-day period immediately preceding the occurrence of the change in control in any transaction reported in the stock market in which the Common Stock is normally traded. No SAR may be exercised more than ten years from the date of Award. 
12. Other Stock-Based Awards.   The Committee may in its discretion grant stock-based awards of a type other than those otherwise provided for in the Plan, including the issuance or offer for sale of unrestricted Shares ("Other Stock-Based Awards"). Other Stock-Based Awards shall cover such number of Shares and have such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine, including terms that condition the payment or vesting of the Other Stock-Based Award upon the achievement of one or more Performance Goals. Shares awarded in connection with Other Stock Awards shall be issued for no cash consideration or such minimum consideration as may be required by Applicable Laws. 
13. Dividends and Dividend Equivalents.   The terms of an Award may provide a Participant with the right, subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify, to receive dividend payments or dividend equivalent payments with respect to Shares covered by such Award, which payments (a) may be either made currently or credited to an account established for the Participant, (b) may be made contingent upon the achievement of one or more Performance Goals, and (c) may be settled in cash or Shares, as determined by the Committee; provided, however, that any Shares or other securities distributed as a dividend or otherwise with respect to any Restricted Shares as to which the restrictions have not yet lapsed, shall be subject to the same restrictions as those on such Restricted Shares and provided further that for any such Restricted Shares that are part of a Performance Award any such dividends shall be earned by the Participant only to the extent the Performance Goals underlying such are achieved and such Award is earned. 
14. Capital Events and Adjustments.
14.1 In the event of an Adjustment Event, the Committee shall provide for a substitution for or adjustment in: (a) the number and class of securities subject to outstanding Awards or the type of consideration to be received upon the exercise or vesting of outstanding Awards, (b) the Exercise Price of Options, (c) the aggregate number and class of Shares for which Awards thereafter may be granted under the Plan, and (d) the maximum number of Shares with respect to which an Employee may be granted Awards during any calendar year. 
14.2 Any provision of the Plan or any Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event of a Transaction, the Committee shall take such actions, and make such changes and adjustments to outstanding Awards as it deems equitable, and may in its discretion, cause any Award granted hereunder to (a) vest in whole or in part, (b) be assumed or continued by any successor or acquirer, and/or (c) be canceled (in whole or in part) in consideration of a payment (or payments), in such form as the Committee may specify, equal to the fair value of the canceled Award (or portion thereof), as determined by the Committee in its discretion. The fair value of an Option shall be deemed to be equal 
A-6
TABLE OF CONTENTS
to the product of  (a) the number of Shares the Option covers (and has not previously been exercised) and (b) the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of a Share as of the date of cancellation over the Exercise Price of the Option. For sake of clarity and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (a) the fair value of an Option would be zero if the Fair Market Value of a Share is equal to or less than the Exercise Price and (b) payments in cancellation of an Award in connection with a Transaction may be delayed to the same extent that payment of consideration to holders of Shares in connection with the Transaction is delayed as a result of escrows, earn-outs, holdbacks, or any other contingencies. 
14.3 The Committee need not take the same action under Section 14 with respect to all Awards or with respect to all Participants and may, in its discretion, take different actions with respect to vested and unvested portions of an Award. No fractional shares or securities shall be issued pursuant to any adjustment made pursuant to Section 14, and any fractional shares or securities resulting from any such adjustment shall be eliminated by rounding downward to the next whole share or security, either with or without payment in respect thereof, as determined by the Committee. All determinations required to be made under Section 14 shall be made by the Committee in its discretion and shall be final and binding.
15. Termination or Amendment.   The Board may amend or terminate the Plan in any respect at any time; provided, however, that after the stockholders of the Company have approved the Plan, the Board shall not amend or terminate the Plan without approval of  (a) the Company's stockholders to the extent Applicable Laws require stockholder approval of the amendment or termination, and (b) each affected Participant if the amendment or termination would adversely affect the Participant's rights or obligations under any Award granted prior to the date of the amendment or termination. 
16. Modification, Substitution of Awards.
16.1. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Committee may modify the terms of any outstanding Awards; provided, however, that (a) no modification of an Award shall, without the consent of the Participant, alter or impair any of the Participant's rights or obligations under such Award, and (b) except as approved by the Company's stockholders pursuant to Section 17, or in connection with an Adjustment Event, the Committee may not modify the terms of outstanding Awards to reduce the Exercise Price of outstanding Options or SARs or cancel outstanding Options or SARS in exchange for cash, other Awards or Options or SARs with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Options or SARs. 
16.2. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Awards may, in the discretion of the Committee, be granted under the Plan in substitution for stock options and other awards covering capital stock of another corporation which is merged into, consolidated with, or all or a substantial portion of the property or stock of which is acquired by, the Company or an Affiliate. The terms and conditions of the substitute Awards so granted may vary from the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan to such extent as the Committee may deem appropriate in order to conform, in whole or part, to the provisions of the awards in substitution for which they are granted. Such substitute Awards shall not be counted toward the Share limit imposed by Section 5.3, except to the extent the Committee determines that counting such Awards is required in order for Awards granted hereunder to be eligible to qualify as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. 
17. Stockholder Approval.   The Plan, and any amendments hereto requiring stockholder approval pursuant to Section 15 are subject to approval by vote of the stockholders of the Company at the next annual or special meeting of stockholders following adoption by the Board. If the adoption of the Plan is not so approved by the Company's stockholders, any Awards granted under the Plan shall be cancelled and void ab initio immediately following such next annual or special meeting of stockholders. 
18. Withholding.   The Company's obligation to issue or deliver Shares or pay any amount pursuant to the terms of any Award granted hereunder shall be subject to satisfaction of applicable federal, state, local, and foreign tax withholding requirements. To the extent authorized by the Committee, and in accordance with such rules as the Committee may prescribe, a Participant may satisfy any withholding tax requirements by one or any combination of the following means: (a) tendering a cash payment, (b) authorizing the Company to withhold Shares otherwise issuable to the Participant, or (c) delivering to the Company already-owned and unencumbered Shares.

19. Term of Plan.   Unless sooner terminated by the Board pursuant to Section 15, the Plan shall terminate on the date that is ten (10) years after the Effective Date, and no Awards may be granted or awarded after such date. The termination of the Plan shall not affect the validity of any Award outstanding on the date of termination. 
20. Indemnification of Committee.   In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have as members of the Board or Committee, the Company shall indemnify members of the Committee against all reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal therein, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or failure to act under or in connection with the Plan or any Award granted hereunder, and against all amounts reasonably paid by them in settlement thereof or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, if such members acted in good faith and in a manner which they believed to be in, and not opposed to, the best interests of the Company. 
21. General Provisions.
21.1. The establishment of the Plan shall not confer upon any Eligible Person any legal or equitable right against the Company, any Affiliate or the Committee, except as expressly provided in the Plan. Participation in the Plan shall not give an Eligible Person any right to be retained in the service of the Company or any Affiliate. 
21.2. Neither the adoption of the Plan nor its submission to the Company's stockholders shall be taken to impose any limitations on the powers of the Company or its Affiliates to issue, grant or assume options, warrants, rights, restricted stock or other awards otherwise than under the Plan, or to adopt other stock option, restricted stock, or other plans, or to impose any requirement of stockholder approval upon the same. 
21.3. The interests of any Eligible Person under the Plan and/or any Award granted hereunder are not subject to the claims of creditors and may not, in any way, be transferred, assigned, alienated or encumbered except to the extent provided in an Agreement. 
21.4. The Plan shall be governed, construed and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to conflict of laws principles. 
21.5. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Agreement to the contrary, Awards and any Shares issued or payments made under Awards shall be subject to any compensation claw-back or recoupment policy (or policies) that the Company may have in effect from time to time, subject to such terms and conditions of such policy (or policies). 
21.6. The Committee may require each person acquiring Shares pursuant to Awards granted hereunder to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that such person is acquiring the Shares without a view to distribution thereof. The certificates for such Shares may include any legend which the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer. All certificates for Shares issued pursuant to the Plan shall be subject to such stock transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under Applicable Laws. The Committee may place a legend or legends on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions. 
21.7. The Company shall not be required to issue any certificate or certificates for Shares with respect to Awards granted under the Plan, or record any person as a holder of record of Shares, without obtaining, to the complete satisfaction of the Committee, the approval of all regulatory bodies the Committee deems necessary, and without complying to the Board's or Committee's complete satisfaction, with all Applicable Laws. 
21.8. To the extent that the Plan provides for issuance of stock certificates to reflect the issuance of Shares, the issuance may be given effect on a non-certificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable Laws. No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award. The Committee shall determine whether cash, other Awards, or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of any fractional Shares or whether any fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
21.9. Each type of Award may be made alone, in addition to or in relation to any other type of Award. The terms of each type of Award need not be identical, and the Committee need not treat Participants uniformly. Except as otherwise provided by the Plan or a particular Award, any determination with respect to an Award may be made by the Committee at the time of award or at any time thereafter. 
21.10. Except as specifically provided herein or in the provisions of the applicable Award, no Participant or Designated Beneficiary shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any Shares to be distributed under the Plan until he or she becomes the holder thereof. A Participant to whom Common Stock is awarded shall be considered the holder of the Share at the time of the Award except as otherwise provided in the applicable Award. 
21.11. Awards granted under this Plan are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code (including the exceptions thereto), to the extent applicable, and shall be interpreted in accordance with such requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the issuance of shares or payment of cash under an Agreement constitutes the payment to a Participant of nonqualified deferred compensation for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and the Participant is a "specified employee" (as determined under Treas. Reg. §1.409A-1(i)), then such issuance of Shares or payment of cash shall, to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, be made on the later of   (a) the date specified in the Agreement or (b) the date that is six (6) months after the date of the Participant's separation from service (or, if earlier, the date of the Participant's death). In no event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates have any liability to any Participant with respect to any Award failing to qualify for any specific tax treatment (such as an Option designated as an incentive stock option failing to qualify for treatment as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code) or for any taxes or penalties incurred by a Participant under Section 409A of the Code with respect to any Award. The Committee may grant Awards that qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) and awards that do not so qualify. 
The Board of Directors amended this Plan on March 6, 2018 to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock available for issuance hereunder by 3,750,000 and stockholders approved the amendment on May 8, 2018. The Board of Directors amended and restated this Plan on March 12, 2019 to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock available for issuance hereunder by 2,750,000.
