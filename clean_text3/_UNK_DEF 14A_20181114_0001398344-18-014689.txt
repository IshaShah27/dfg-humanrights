PROPOSAL 1
ELECTION OF class iI DIRECTOR
The Board is divided into three classes (Class I, Class II, and Class III), with each class having a term of three years. Each year the term of one class expires and the successor(s) elected to such class will serve until the Fund's annual meeting of stockholders in the third year following their election or until their successors are duly elected and qualified.
Richard I. Barr's and Steven K. Norgaard's terms as Class III Directors expire at this Annual Meeting. Based on the recommendations made by the Fund's Nominating Committee at its meeting held on August 2, 2018, the Board, including the Independent Directors, has nominated Mr. Barr and Mr. Norgaard to stand for election at the Annual Meeting as Class III Directors to each serve a three-year term until the Fund's 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or until their successor has been duly elected and qualified.
Mr. Barr and Mr. Norgaard (the "Director Nominees") have consented to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve as a Director of the Fund if elected at the Annual Meeting for the terms as indicated above. The Board knows of no reason why the Director Nominees will be unable to serve, but in the event of any such inability, the proxies received will be voted for such substituted nominees as the Board may recommend.
THE BOARD, INCLUDING ALL OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF THE DIRECTOR NOMINEES.

Certain of these business and professional experiences are set forth in detail in the narratives below. In addition, each Director has served on the Board for a number of years.

The Board annually conducts a "self-assessment" wherein the effectiveness of the Board is reviewed.
Set forth below is a brief discussion of the particular qualifications, experience, attributes or skills that led the Board to conclude that each person identified below should serve as a Director. The information provided below, and in the chart above, is not all-inclusive. Many of the Directors' and Director Nominees' attributes involve intangible elements, such as intelligence, work and investment ethic, diversity in terms of background or experiences, an appreciation of and commitment to the long-term investment approach of the Fund, and the ability to work together collaboratively, to communicate effectively, to exercise judgment, to ask incisive questions, to manage people and problems or to develop solutions. In conducting its annual self-assessment, the Board has determined that the Directors and Director Nominees have the appropriate qualifications, experience, attributes and skills to continue to serve effectively as Directors of the Fund.

The Board has elected various senior individuals employed by certain of these service providers as officers of the Fund, with the responsibility to monitor and report to the Board on the Fund's operations. In conducting its oversight, the Board is provided regular reports from the various officers and service providers regarding the Fund's operations. For example, the treasurer provides reports as to financial reporting matters and the portfolio managers provide reports on the performance of the Fund's portfolio. The Board has appointed a chief compliance officer ("CCO") for the Fund who administers the Fund's compliance program and regularly reports to the Board as to compliance matters. Some of these reports are provided as part of formal Board meetings which typically are held quarterly, in-person, and involve the Board's review of recent Fund operations. In addition to quarterly in-person meetings, telephonic Board meetings are held regularly, as necessary to ensure appropriate oversight of the Fund. From time to time, one or more members of the Board may also meet with management in less formal settings, between formal board meetings, to discuss various topics. In all cases, however, the role of the Board and of any individual Director is one of oversight and not of management of the day-to-day affairs of the Fund.
Board Leadership Structure. The Board has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate given the business and nature of the Fund. The Board has established three standing committees: An Audit Committee, a Nominating Committee, and a Qualified Legal Compliance Committee (collectively, the "Committees"). The Board does not have a Compensation Committee. Sixty percent of the members of the Board are Independent Directors, and each Committee is comprised entirely of Independent Directors. The Board has determined that the Committees help ensure that the Fund has effective and independent governance and oversight. The Board also believes that the Committees and leadership structure facilitate the orderly and efficient flow of information to the Independent Directors of the Fund from management, including the Advisers. Where deemed appropriate, from time to time, the Board may constitute ad hoc committees.
The Chairman of the Board is the same individual who serves as the Principal Executive Officer of the Fund. The Chairman is an Interested Director as he is the President of the Sub-Adviser. The Board has considered that the Chairman's position with RMA can provide valuable input based on his experience in the types of securities in which the Fund invests. The Board has also determined that the structure, function and composition of its Committees are appropriate means to provide effective oversight and address any potential conflicts of interest that may arise from the Chairman's status as an Interested Director.
The Board has a Lead Independent Director who acts as the primary liaison between the Independent Directors and management (the "Lead Independent Director"). The Lead Independent Director plays an important role in setting the Board meeting agendas and may help identify matters of special interest to be addressed by management with the Board. The Independent Directors have also engaged their own independent counsel to advise them on matters relating to their responsibilities in connection with the Fund. The Board reviews its structure annually. The Board has determined that the structure of the Lead Independent Director and the function and composition of the Committees are appropriate means to address any potential conflicts of interest that may arise.
Board Oversight and Management. Oversight of the risk management process is part of the Board's general oversight of the Fund and its service providers. The Board exercises oversight of the risk management process through the Audit Committee. The Board also may be apprised of particular risk management matters in connection with its general oversight and approval of various Fund matters brought before the Board.
Page 7 
As part of its oversight function, the Board receives various reports relating to risk management. The Fund faces a number of risks, such as investment risk, counterparty risk, valuation risk, reputational risk, risk of operational failure or lack of business continuity, cybersecurity risk and legal, compliance and regulatory risks. Under the Board's overarching supervision, the Fund and management, the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser, and other service providers to the Fund employ a variety of processes, procedures and controls to identify various risks, to lessen the probability of their occurrence and/or to mitigate the effects of such events or circumstances if they do occur. Different processes, procedures and controls are employed by different service providers with respect to different types of risks. Various personnel, including the Fund's CCO, as well as various other personnel of the Adviser and Sub-Adviser and other service providers, such as the Fund's independent accountants, make periodic reports to the Board and appropriate Committees with respect to various aspects of risk management, as well as events and circumstances that have arisen and responses thereto. For example, the full Board of the Fund regularly receives reports from the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser and their portfolio managers as to investment risks. Also, because cybersecurity risk is at the forefront of the ever-changing risk landscape facing registered investment companies, on a periodic basis, the Board requests and receives reports from Fund management and the Fund's primary service providers regarding cybersecurity risk management, the potential for cybersecurity attacks that might impact the Fund and the measures Fund management and Fund service providers take to mitigate such risk.
The Board recognizes that not all risks that may affect the Fund can be identified, that it may not be practical or cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, that it may be necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve the Fund's goals, and that the processes, procedures and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness. Moreover, reports received by the Directors as to risk management matters are typically summaries of the relevant information. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the Fund's ability to manage risk is subject to substantial limitations and the function of the Board with respect to risk management is one of oversight and not one of active involvement in, or coordination of, day-to-day risk management activities for the Fund.
Audit Committee. The purpose of the Board's audit committee (the "Audit Committee") is to assist the Board in its oversight of the integrity of the Fund's financial statements, the Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the independent accountants' qualifications and independence and the performance of the Fund's independent accountants. The Audit Committee reviews the scope and results of the Fund's annual audit with the Fund's independent accountants and recommends the engagement of such accountants. Management, however, is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Fund's financial statements, and the independent accountants are responsible for planning and carrying out proper audits and reviews. The Board has adopted a charter for the Audit Committee that is available on the Fund's website at www.boulderfunds.net.
The Audit Committee is composed entirely of the Fund's Independent Directors, consisting of Dr. Jacobson and Messrs. Barr and Norgaard. The Board has determined that Mr. Norgaard qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert," as defined under SEC Regulation S-K, Item 407(d). The Audit Committee is in compliance with applicable rules of the listing requirements for closed-end fund audit committees including the requirement that all members of the audit committee be "financially literate" and that at least one member of the audit committee have "accounting or related financial management expertise," as determined by the Board. The Audit Committee is required to conduct its operations in accordance with applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Fund's independent publicly registered accounting firm is required to comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The members of the Audit Committee are subject to the fiduciary duty to exercise reasonable care in carrying out their duties. Members of the Audit Committee are independent, as that term is defined by the NYSE Listing Standards. The Audit Committee met six times during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2017.
Report of Audit Committee. At a meeting held on January 26, 2018, and in connection with the audit of the Fund's financial statements for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2017, the Audit Committee: (i) reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management, (ii) discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the Statement on Auditing Standards ("SAS") No. 114, which supersedes SAS No. 61, (iii) received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from the independent accountant required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and (iv) discussed with the independent accountant its independence.
Page 8 
The members of the Audit Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not employed by the Fund in any accounting, financial management or internal control capacity. Moreover, the Audit Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it or representations made by management or the independent accountants. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies, or internal controls and procedures, designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not provide assurance that the audit of the Fund's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Based on the foregoing reviews and discussions, and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of the Audit Committee set forth in the Audit Committee Charter and those discussed above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Fund's audited financial statements be included in the Fund's Annual Report to Stockholders for the year ended November 30, 2017.
Submitted by the Audit Committee of the Fund's Board:
Richard I. Barr
Dean L. Jacobson
Steven K. Norgaard
Qualified Legal Compliance Committee. The Audit Committee also serves as the Qualified Legal Compliance Committee ("QLCC") for the Fund for the purpose of compliance with Rules 205.2(k) and 205.3(c) of the Code of Federal Regulations, regarding alternative reporting procedures for attorneys retained or employed by an issuer who appear and practice before the SEC on behalf of the issuer (typically referred to as the "issuer attorneys"). An issuer's attorney who becomes aware of evidence of a material violation by the Fund, or by any officer, director, employee, or agent of the Fund, may report evidence of such material violation to the QLCC as an alternative to the reporting requirements of Rule 205.3(b) (which requires reporting to the chief legal officer and potentially "up the ladder" to other entities). The QLCC did not independently meet outside of the Audit Committee meetings in the year ended November 30, 2017.
Nominating Committee. The purpose of the Board's nominating committee (the "Nominating Committee") is to identify and recommend to the Board those individuals that are qualified to become Board members. It also makes recommendations to the Board regarding the size and composition of the Board. The Nominating Committee is composed of the Independent Directors, consisting of Dr. Jacobson and Messrs. Barr and Norgaard. Each member of the Nominating Committee is independent, as that term is defined by the NYSE Listing Standards. The Nominating Committee met once during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2017. The Board has adopted a charter for its Nominating Committee that is available on the Fund's website at www.boulderfunds.net.
The Nominating Committee does not have a formal process for identifying candidates. The Nominating Committee does not have established specific minimum qualifications that must be met by a candidate to be considered for nomination as a director. The Nominating Committee takes into consideration such factors as it deems appropriate when nominating candidates. These factors may include judgment, skill, diversity, experience with investment companies and other organizations of comparable purpose, complexity, size and subject to similar legal restrictions and oversight, the interplay of the candidate's experience with the experience of other Board members, and the extent to which the candidate would be a desirable addition to the Board and any committees thereof. The Nominating Committee will consider all qualified candidates in the same manner. The Nominating Committee may modify its policies and procedures for director nominees and recommendations in response to changes in the Fund's circumstances, and as applicable legal or listing standards change.
Page 9 
Although the Nominating Committee does not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director candidates, as a matter of practice, the Nominating Committee typically considers the overall diversity of the Board's composition when identifying candidates. Specifically, the Nominating Committee considers the diversity of skill sets desired among the Board members in light of the Fund's characteristics and circumstances and how those skill sets might complement each other. The Nominating Committee also takes into account the personal background of current and prospective Board members of the Fund in considering the composition of the Board. In addition, as part of its annual self-evaluation, the Directors of the Fund have an opportunity to consider the diversity of the Board, both in terms of skill sets and personal background, and any observations made by the Board during the self-evaluation assist the Nominating Committee in its decision-making process.
The Nominating Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders of the Fund (if a vacancy were to exist) and submitted in accordance with applicable law and procedures as described in this Proxy Statement (see "Submission of Stockholder Proposals" below). In reviewing such stockholder director-nominees, the Nominating Committee may generally rely on the provisions set forth in the charter of the Nominating Committee and other information as deemed necessary to adjudge the appropriateness and character of such director-nominee(s).
Ownership of Securities of the Fund by Directors and Director Nominees. The following table sets forth the aggregate dollar range of equity securities beneficially owned by each Director and Director Nominee of the Fund as of the Record Date.
[BEGIN TABLE]

None of the Independent Directors, or their immediate family members, owned beneficially or of record any securities of the Adviser, Sub-Adviser or any person (other than a registered investment company) directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Adviser or Sub-Adviser.
Director and Officer Compensation. The following table sets forth certain information regarding the compensation of the Directors. No persons (other than the Independent Directors, as set forth below) currently receive compensation from the Fund for acting as a Director or officer; however, Director and officers of the Fund may also be officers or employees of AAI (or an affiliate of AAI) or RMA and may receive compensation from such entities for acting in such capacities. Directors and executive officers of the Fund do not receive pension or retirement benefits from the Fund. In addition to the amounts stated below, Independent Directors receive reimbursement for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attending Board and Board committee meetings.

Each Director of the Fund who is not a director, officer or employee of the Adviser, Sub-Adviser or an affiliate of the Adviser or Sub-Adviser, receives a fee of $10,000 per quarter plus $5,000 for each in-person meeting, $3,000 for each audit committee meeting, $1,000 for each nominating committee meeting and $1,000 for each telephonic meeting of the Board. The chairman of the Audit Committee receives an additional $3,000 per meeting and the Lead Independent Director receives an additional $3,125 for each regular quarterly meeting. The Board held eight (8) meetings, four (4) of which were held by telephone conference call during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2017. Each Director currently serving in such capacity for the entire fiscal year attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Directors of the Fund and any committee of which he is a member. The aggregate remuneration paid to the Directors of the Fund for acting as such during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2017 amounted to $243,500.
Board Attendance at Stockholders' Meetings. The Fund does not have a formal policy regarding Board member attendance at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Joel Looney and Stephen Miller attended the November 15, 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Communications with the Board. Stockholders of the Fund who wish to send communications to the Board of the Fund should send them to the address of the Fund, to the attention of the Board. All such communications will be directed to the Board's attention.

SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
On November 9, 2017, the Fund's Board of Directors approved Cohen & Company Ltd. ("Cohen") as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund's fiscal year ending November 30, 2018.
Previously, Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") has been engaged as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Fund's financial statements. Deloitte issued reports on the Fund's financial statements for the years ended November 30, 2017 and November 30, 2016. Such reports did not contain adverse opinions or disclaimers of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. The decision to replace Deloitte as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm with Cohen was approved by the Fund's Audit Committee and ratified by the Fund's Board. Dismissal of Deloitte was effective on January 26, 2018.
During the Fund's fiscal years ended November 30, 2017 and November 30, 2016, there were no disagreements with Deloitte on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports, nor were there any "reportable events" as that term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
Neither Deloitte nor Cohen are expected to have a representative be present at the Annual Meeting. Set forth below are the aggregate fees billed to the Fund for professional services received from Deloitte for the Fund's fiscal years ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2017.
The Audit Committee Charter requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent accountants to the Fund. Pre-approval for a permitted non-audit service shall not be required if: (1) the aggregate amount of all such non-audit services is not more than 5% of the total revenues paid by the Fund to the auditor in the fiscal year in which the non-audit services are provided; (2) such services were not recognized by the Fund at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services; and (3) such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and approved prior to the completion of the audit by the Audit Committee or by one or more members of the Audit Committee to whom authority to grant such approvals has been delegated by the Audit Committee.
Also, the Audit Committee shall pre-approve the auditor's engagements for non-audit services with the Fund's Advisers and any service providers controlling, controlled by or under common control with an Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Fund (the "Fund Affiliates") in accordance with the foregoing paragraph, if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund, unless the aggregate amount of all services provided constitutes no more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid to the auditor by the Fund, an Adviser and any affiliate of the Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Fund during the fiscal year in which the services are provided that would have to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to this paragraph (without regard to this exception).
Additionally, the auditor may not perform contemporaneously any of the following non-audit services for the Fund: bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the Fund; financial information systems design and implementation; appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-in-kind reports; actuarial services; internal audit outsourcing services; management functions or human resources; broker or dealer, investment adviser, or investment banking services; legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit; and any other service that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board determines, by regulation, is impermissible.
Page 13 
All of the audit, audit-related and tax services fees described above for which Deloitte billed the Fund were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. Pre-approval has not been waived by the Audit Committee with respect to such services. Both Deloitte and Cohen have informed the Fund that neither has a direct or indirect financial interest in the Fund. For the Fund's fiscal years ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2017, Deloitte did not provide any non-audit services or bill any fees for such services to RMA or SIA (or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with RMA and SIA).
INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROXY AND ANNUAL MEETING
Quorum. A quorum of the Fund's stockholders is required for the conduct of business at the Annual Meeting. A quorum is constituted by the presence in person or by proxy of the stockholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast (without regard to class). Each of the outstanding shares of the Fund is entitled to cast one vote, with no cumulative voting rights. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Annual Meeting, the Chairman or the stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting may adjourn the Annual Meeting to a date not more than 120 days after the Record Date without notice other than an announcement at the meeting. With respect to the Fund, in the event that a quorum is present but sufficient votes to approve one or more proposals are not received, the persons named as proxies may propose and vote for one or more adjournments of the Annual Meeting with respect to such to permit further solicitation of proxies with respect to any proposal that did not receive the votes necessary for its passage. Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast on the matter at the Annual Meeting. With respect to those proposals for which there is represented a sufficient number of votes in favor, actions taken at the Annual Meeting will be approved and implemented irrespective of any adjournments with respect to any other proposals.
Vote Required. The election of each Director Nominee to the Board requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of all the votes cast by stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to so vote.
Voting; Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions. With regard to the election of Director Nominees, votes may be cast "FOR" each individual nominee, or votes may be "WITHHELD" with respect to each individual nominee. A proxy for shares held by brokers or nominees as to which (i) instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or the persons entitled to vote and (ii) the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power on a particular matter, is a broker "non-vote." Proxies that reflect abstentions or broker non-votes will be counted as shares that are present and entitled to vote on the matter for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum; however, they will not constitute a vote and will be disregarded in calculating the votes cast as to such matter. Thus, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting results in the election of the Director Nominees, as only votes cast "FOR" count toward the required plurality.
Other Matters to Come Before the Annual Meeting. The Fund does not intend to present any other business at the Annual Meeting, nor is the Fund aware that any stockholder intends to do so. If, however, any other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy will vote thereon in accordance with their discretion.
Proxy Solicitation. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, Directors and officers of the Fund and officers and regular employees of Computershare Trust Company, NA ("Computershare"), the Fund's transfer agent, the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser and affiliates of Computershare or other representatives of the Fund may also solicit proxies by telephone, Internet, facsimile, personal interviews or through e-mail communications with stockholders who have enrolled in the Fund's electronic stockholder communications service. Any cost of proxy solicitation and expenses incurred in connection with the preparation of this Proxy Statement and its enclosures will be paid by the Fund. The Fund also will reimburse brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding solicitation material to the beneficial owners of their shares.
Page 14 
Submission of Stockholder Proposals. Stockholders who, in accordance with Rule 14a-8 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), wish to present proposals for inclusion in the proxy materials to be distributed by the Fund in connection with its 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, must submit their proposals to the Fund's Secretary on or before June 11, 2019.
Apart from the Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 that addresses the inclusion of stockholder proposals in the Fund's proxy materials, under the Fund's Bylaws, a stockholder must follow certain procedures in order to nominate persons for election as directors or to propose an item of business at an annual meeting of stockholders. These procedures provide that nominations for director nominees and/or an item of business to be proposed at an annual meeting of stockholders must be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the Fund at 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203. To be timely, a stockholder's written notice of such nominations or proposals must be received:
Assuming that the Fund's 2019 annual meeting is held within 30 days of the anniversary of the 2018 annual meeting, the Fund must receive a stockholder's notice to introduce a nomination or other item of business at the 2019 annual meeting by June 11, 2019.
There are additional requirements regarding proposals of stockholders, and a stockholder contemplating submission of a proposal is referred to Exchange Act Rule 14a-8. In addition, stockholders wishing to make proposals should refer to the Fund's Bylaws for proper procedure and notice content. A copy of the Fund's Bylaws is available upon request, without charge, by writing to the Secretary of the Fund at 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203.
The timely submission of a proposal does not guarantee its inclusion in the Fund's proxy materials. Additionally, approval of a stockholder proposal by the stockholders may still be subject to review, including whether such proposal(s) is legal or comports with general rules and regulations governing the operations of the Fund.
Householding. One Proxy Statement is being delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address, unless the Fund has received contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders. The Fund will deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the Proxy Statement to any stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the document was delivered. Requests to receive a separate copy should be made in writing to the Fund at 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203 or by calling (866) 228-4853. Requests to receive separate copies, or single copies in the case of stockholders sharing an address, of the Fund's future proxy statements, annual reports to security holders or notices of internet availability of proxy materials should also be made in the same manner.
Contact Information. If you have questions or need more information about the Annual Meeting, you may write to the Fund at 1290 Broadway, Suite 1100, Denver, CO 80203 or call (866) 228-4853.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance. Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act requires the Fund's Directors and officers, persons affiliated with the Fund's investment advisers, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Fund's securities, to file reports of ownership and changes of ownership with the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. Directors, officers and greater-than-10% stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Fund with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based solely upon the Fund's review of the copies of such forms it received and written representations from such persons, the Fund believes that all such filing requirements applicable to such persons were complied with during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2017.
