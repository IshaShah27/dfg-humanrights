General
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Schlumberger Limited (Schlumberger N.V.) of proxies to be voted at its 2019 annual general meeting of stockholders, which will be held at the Avila Beach Hotel, Penstraat 130, Willemstad, Curaçao, on Wednesday, April 3, 2019 beginning at 10:00 a.m., Curaçao time, and at any postponement(s) or adjournment(s) thereof.
In this Proxy Statement, we may also refer to Schlumberger Limited and its subsidiaries as "we," "our," "the Company" or "Schlumberger."
To be admitted to the meeting, stockholders of record and beneficial owners as of the close of business on the record date for the meeting, February 13, 2019, must present a passport or other government-issued identification bearing a photograph and, for beneficial owners, proof of ownership as of the record date, such as the Notice of Internet Availability, top half of the proxy card or voting instruction card that was sent to you with this proxy statement.
The mailing date of this proxy statement is February 21, 2019. Business at the meeting will be conducted in accordance with the procedures determined by the Chairman of the meeting and will be limited to matters properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our Board of Directors or by a stockholder.
We are providing our 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders concurrently with this proxy statement. You should refer to its contents in considering agenda Item 3.
Proxy Materials are Available on the Internet
This year we are using an SEC rule that allows us to use the internet as the primary means of furnishing proxy materials to shareholders. We are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice of Internet Availability") to our stockholders with instructions on how to access the proxy materials online or request a printed copy of the materials.
Stockholders may follow the instructions in the Notice of Internet Availability to elect to receive future proxy materials in print by mail or electronically by email. We encourage stockholders to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials online to help reduce the environmental impact of our annual meetings.
Our proxy materials are also available at http://investorcenter.slb.com.
Record Date; Proxies
Each stockholder of record at the close of business on the record date, February 13, 2019, is entitled to one vote for each director nominee and one vote for each of the other proposals to be voted on with respect to each share registered in the stockholder's name. A stockholder of record is a person or entity who held shares on that date registered in its name on the records of Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare"), Schlumberger's stock transfer agent. Persons who held shares on the record date through a broker, bank or other nominee are referred to as beneficial owners.
Shares cannot be voted at the meeting unless the owner of record is present in person or is represented by proxy. Schlumberger is incorporated in Curaçao and, as required by Curaçao law, meetings of stockholders are held in Curaçao. Because many stockholders cannot personally attend the meeting, it is necessary that a large number be represented by proxy.
Shares Outstanding
On February 13, 2019, there were 1,385,972,615 shares of Schlumberger common stock outstanding and entitled to vote.
Quorum
Holders of at least one-half of the outstanding shares entitling the holders thereof to vote at the meeting must be present in person or by proxy to constitute a quorum for the taking of any action at the meeting.
Abstentions and proxies submitted on your behalf by brokers, banks or other holders of record that do not indicate a vote because they do not have discretionary voting authority and have not received instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares as to how to vote on a proposal (so-called "broker non-votes") will be considered as present for quorum purposes. If a quorum is not present at the meeting, the Board may call a second general meeting of stockholders, at which the quorum requirement will not apply.
Votes Required to Adopt Proposals
To be elected, director nominees must receive a majority of votes cast (the number of votes cast "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that nominee). Approval of each of the other matters on the agenda also requires the affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast.
Important Voting Information for Beneficial Owners
If your Schlumberger shares are held for you in street name (i.e. you own your shares through a brokerage, bank or other institutional account), you are considered the beneficial owner of those shares, but not the record holder. This means that you vote by providing instructions to your broker rather than directly to Schlumberger. Unless you provide specific voting instructions, your broker is not permitted to vote your shares on your behalf, except on Item 3 and Item 4.
Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
Brokers holding shares must vote according to specific instructions they receive from the beneficial owners of those shares. If brokers do not receive specific instructions, brokers may in some cases vote the shares in their discretion. However, the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") precludes brokers from exercising voting discretion on other proposals without specific instructions from the beneficial owner, as follows:
Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered as votes cast and will not be counted in determining the outcome of the vote on the election of directors or on any of the other proposals, except that for purposes of satisfying NYSE rules, abstentions are counted in the denominator for determining the total votes cast on Item 5.
How to Vote
Stockholders with shares registered in their names with Computershare may authorize a proxy:
The internet and telephone voting facilities for stockholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesday, April 2, 2019. The internet and telephone voting procedures have been designed to authenticate stockholders and to allow you to vote your shares and to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded.
A number of banks and brokerage firms participate in programs that also permit beneficial stockholders to direct their vote by the internet or telephone. If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held in an account at a bank or brokerage firm that participates in such a program, you may direct the vote of those shares by the internet or telephone by following the instructions on the voting form.
All shares entitled to vote and represented by properly executed proxies received prior to the meeting and not revoked will be voted at the meeting in accordance with your instructions. If you are a stockholder with shares registered in your name with Computershare and you submit a properly executed proxy card but do not direct how to vote on each item, the persons named as proxies will vote as the Board recommends on each proposal.
By providing your voting instructions promptly, you may save us the expense of a second mailing.
Changing Your Vote or Revoking Your Proxy
If you are a stockholder of record, you can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time by timely delivery of a properly executed, later-dated proxy (including an internet or telephone vote) or by voting by ballot at the meeting. If you hold shares through a broker, bank or other holder of record, you must follow the instructions of your broker, bank or other holder of record to change or revoke your voting instructions.
All of our directors are elected annually at our annual general meeting of stockholders. Our stockholders are requested to elect 10 nominees to the Board, each to hold office until the next annual general meeting of stockholders and until a director's successor is elected and qualified or until a director's death, resignation or removal. Each of the nominees is now a director and was previously elected by our stockholders at the 2018 annual general meeting of stockholders, except for Dr. Mitrova and Mr. Papa, who were both appointed by the Board to serve as directors effective October 2018, based upon the recommendations of the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board.
Having exceeded the normal retirement age of 70 under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, V. Maureen Kempston Darkes will not be standing for re-election at our annual general meeting of stockholders. Our Board extends gratitude to Ms. Kempston Darkes for four years of service as a member of the Board. Michael Marks also will not stand for re-election at our annual general meeting of stockholders. Our Board extends gratitude to Mr. Marks for 13 years of service as a member of the Board.
All of the nominees for election have consented to being named in this proxy statement and to serve if elected. If any nominee is unable or unwilling to serve, the Board may designate a substitute nominee. If the Board designates a substitute nominee, proxies may be voted for that substitute nominee. The Board knows of no reason why any nominee will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected.
Shares represented by properly executed proxies will be voted, if authority to do so is not withheld, for the election of each of the 10 nominees named below.
At our 2016 annual general meeting of stockholders, our stockholders voted to fix the number of directors constituting the Board at 12, as permitted under our Articles of Incorporation. However, because Ms. Kempston Darkes and Mr. Marks are not standing for re-election, only 10 directors have been nominated for election at the 2019 annual general meeting of stockholders. The Board believes that it is advisable and in the best interest of our stockholders for the authorized number of directors constituting the Board to remain at 12. This will allow the Board to conduct a search for, and add, up to two additional directors during the year who have not yet been identified at the time of our 2019 annual general meeting.
At this annual general meeting, votes may not be cast for a greater number of persons than the number of director nominees named in this proxy statement.
Required Vote
Each director nominee must receive a majority of the votes cast to be elected. If you hold your shares in street name, please be aware that brokers, banks and other holders of record do not have discretion to vote on this proposal without your instruction. If you do not instruct your broker, bank or other holder of record how to vote on this proposal, they will deliver a non-vote on this proposal.
Director Nominees
The Board believes that each director nominee possesses the qualities and experience that the Nominating and Governance Committee believes that nominees should possess, as described in detail below in the section entitled "Corporate Governance—Director Nominations" beginning on page 17. The Board seeks out, and the Board is comprised of, individuals whose background and experience complement those of other Board members. The nominees for election to the Board, together with biographical information furnished by each of them and information regarding each nominee's director qualifications, are set forth on the following pages.
There are no family relationships among any executive officers and directors of the Company.

Dr. Reif provides the Board with  a critical U.S. scientific perspective, which is of immense value in the oversight of the Company's strategy.

Corporate Governance
The following are some highlights of our corporate governance practices and policies:
Board Independence; Committees Structure
Majority Voting; Stockholder Rights
Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines
We have executive stock ownership guidelines, which are designed to align executive and stockholder interests. For a description of the guidelines applicable to our executive officers and other senior members of management, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines" starting on page 46.
Risk Oversight
The Board of Directors and the its Committees oversee Schlumberger's risk management policies, processes and practices to ensure that the Company employs the appropriate risk management systems. The Board and its Committees exercise their risk oversight responsibilities in a variety of ways, including the following:
Prohibition on Hedging or Pledging of Schlumberger Stock
Our directors and executive officers are prohibited from using any strategies or products (such as derivative securities or short-selling techniques) to hedge against the potential changes in the value of Schlumberger common stock. In addition, our directors and executive officers, and other key employees, are prohibited from holding Schlumberger securities in a margin account or pledging Schlumberger securities as collateral for a loan. Our insider trading policy strongly discourages, but does not prohibit, other employees from engaging in speculative transactions, including hedging or other financial mechanisms, holding Schlumberger securities in a margin account or pledging Schlumberger securities.
Policy Against Lobbying and Political Contributions
Schlumberger has a strong culture of being politically neutral, and has a long-standing policy against lobbying and making financial or in-kind contributions to political parties or candidates, even when permitted by law. This policy, as set forth in Schlumberger's code of conduct, entitled The Blue Print and The Blue Print in Action (our "Code of Conduct"), prohibits the use of Company funds or assets for political purposes, including for contributions to any political party, candidate or committee, whether federal, state or local. In addition, the Company does not lobby. As a result of the Company's policy of political neutrality, Schlumberger does not have a political action committee, nor does it contribute to any third-party political action committees or other political entities organized under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code.
In 2018, the Center for Political Accountability ("CPA"), a non-profit, non-partisan organization, assessed our disclosure for its annual CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability ("CPA-Zicklin Index"). The CPA-Zicklin Index measures the transparency, policies and practices of the Standard & Poor's 500. As a result of our enhanced disclosure regarding our prohibition on political lobbying and contributions, we achieved a perfect score of 100% in the 2018 CPA-Zicklin Index.
Our Commitment to Stewardship
Our Board, along with our customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, understands that a modern approach to running our Company must be aligned with a commitment to global stewardship. Our stewardship journey, which has evolved over the past decades, is gaining momentum as we continue to work with our customers to address their environmental, social, and governance objectives; mitigate social and environmental risks; and lower their greenhouse gas emissions in field operations. We endeavor to be at the forefront of change, leading technology innovation and training and development of our employees. For example, most recently, we adopted a requirement that all of our employees receive sustainability and stewardship training every two years.
We believe our more than 90 years of industry experience and leadership will be invaluable to the ongoing worldwide energy transition. We have engaged three main strategies to this end:
Endeavoring to make stewardship a part of our operations
We do this through several risk assessment and mitigation programs in aspects of our operations where we have determined that we can have the most effective impact. For example, to assist us in an environmental impact review of our operations in one country where we have sizable operations, we engaged an independent consultant specializing in helping companies implement positive change in response to climate and carbon challenges, while also driving commercial performance. The independent consultant analyzed the various climate risks, including sea level change, that would reasonably be expected to affect the location, and provided us with mitigation options to address those risks.
Similarly, we chose 11 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ("SDGs") at the corporate level that we believe we can impact as a company. From this portfolio of 11 SDGs that we chose, each of our GeoMarket regions will select SDGs to focus on and will further set targets related to each SDG that we expect will measurably improve environmental and social conditions in the countries and regions where we operate. To find out more about our Global Stewardship Program, and how we seek to align ourselves with the United Nations SDGs, see our annual Global Stewardship Report, which is available at www.slb.com/globalstewardship.
(bolded items are part of Schlumberger portfolio of goals)
Promoting technological growth with positive environmental outcomes
We believe that our ability to develop cutting-edge technology differentiates us from our competitors. We have a global network of six research centers and 10 technology centers that develop products and processes that both maximize the recovery from a given well, as well as reduce the impact of our operations on the environment. For example, we began our research on geologic storage of carbon in the mid 1990's. An environmental benefit of carbon sequestration is that it can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Our carbon services employees have published 229 technical papers and journal articles. They also currently lead or participate in more than 60 carbon sequestration projects globally, including nine of the 13 projects under development by the U.S. Department of Energy's
Carbon Storage Assurance Facility Enterprise (CarbonSAFE). One environmental benefit of carbon sequestration is that it can help mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. In 2018, we continued this work by partnering with Stanford University, ExxonMobil and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) to test 12 different methane detectors and the ability to mount these detectors on trucks, aircraft or drones. While current methane detectors can monitor a single location like a well site, these new technologies can identify and characterize leaks over a large area of otherwise unmonitored land and allow for remediation.
Engaging in a global dialogue
We have an active voice in the global energy and sustainability dialogue. In 2016, we hosted a global conference on the future of energy at our research facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The conference addressed topics such as the evolution of the energy transition; the future of world energy after the international climate agreement at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference (COP21); and climate change. At the conference, more than 40 thought leaders in engaged in open, frank discussions regarding climate change and related issues. Some of the attendees included representatives from the MIT Energy Initiative; the Yale Climate and Energy Institute; the U.S. Department of Energy; the International Energy Agency; the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and scientists and other policy makers from various other institutions and governmental agencies.
We also share our views with several influential educational and policy studies organizations. Some of these include The Aspen Institute; the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House); Energy Intelligence Group; SustainAbility; the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Resources for the Future; the Bloomberg Sustainable Business Forum, and other sustainability forums.
In addition, we are a part of, or otherwise support, numerous industry groups including the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA); the American Geosciences Institute; the National Ocean Industries Association; the Permian Strategic Partnership; the American Petroleum Institute; the Center for Strategic and International Studies; the National Petroleum Council; the Petroleum Equipment & Services Association; the Independent Petroleum Association of America; and the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers. Finally, we provide educational and advisory services to governmental organizations such as the United States Department of Energy, the United States Department of the Interior and the Texas Railroad Commission.
Communication with Board
The Board recommends that stockholders initiate communications with the Board, the Chairman, the Lead Independent Director or any Board committee by writing to our Corporate Secretary. This process assists the Board in reviewing and responding to stockholder communications. The Board has instructed our Corporate Secretary to review correspondence directed to the Board (including the Chairman, the Lead Independent Director and any Board committee) and, at the Secretary's discretion, to forward those items that he deems appropriate for the Board's consideration. Stockholders can send communications to the following address:
Shareholder Engagement
Our relationship and on-going dialogue with our stockholders is an important part of our Board's corporate governance commitment. Our Investor Relations, Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG"), Legal and Human Resources teams engage with stockholders to seek their views on key matters and to inform our management and our Board about the issues and emerging governance trends that our stockholders tell us matter most to them. Our Lead Independent Director and the chairman of our Compensation Committee also participate in our engagement efforts when requested. These engagements routinely cover governance, social, environmental, compensation, safety, human rights and other current and emerging issues.
We typically reach out to our largest institutional stockholders annually in the fall. We then report the feedback we receive from stockholders to the Board and relevant committees, allowing the Board to better understand our stockholders' priorities and perspectives. In addition to this annual outreach, we may engage with our large institutional stockholders at other times in the year when we believe that there are appropriate topics to discuss. For more detail on our 2018 engagement with our stockholders, see pages 26-27.
Corporate Governance Guidelines
Schlumberger is committed to adhering to sound principles of corporate governance and has adopted corporate governance guidelines that the Board believes are consistent with Schlumberger's values, and that promote the effective functioning of the Board, its committees and the Company. Our Board periodically, and at least annually, reviews and revises, as appropriate, our Corporate Governance Guidelines to ensure that they reflect the Board's corporate governance objectives and commitments. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are on our website at http://www.slb.com/ about/guiding_principles/corpgovernance/corpgov_guidelines.aspx.
Board Independence
Schlumberger's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that at least a majority of the Board must consist of independent directors. This standard reflects the NYSE corporate governance listing standards.
Our Board has adopted director independence standards, which can be found in Attachment A to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and which meet or exceed the independence requirements in the NYSE listing standards. Based on the review and recommendation by the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Board has determined that each current director and director nominee listed above under "Election of Directors" is "independent" under the listing standards of the NYSE and our director independence standards, except Mr. Kibsgaard, who is our CEO and therefore does not qualify as independent, and Messrs. Galuccio and Papa. Additionally, Mr. Helge Lund and Mr. Tore Sandvold were independent throughout the period in 2018 that each served on the Board.
In addition to the Board-level standards for director independence, each member of the Audit Committee meets the heightened independence standards required for audit committee members under the NYSE's listing standards and SEC rules, and each member of the Compensation Committee meets the heightened independence standards for compensation committee members under NYSE listing standards adopted in 2013, which Schlumberger implemented in advance of the required compliance date.
Transactions Considered in Independence Determinations
The Board's independence determinations included a review of transactions that occurred since the beginning of 2016 with entities associated with our directors or members of their immediate family. In making its independence determinations, the Board considered that  Ms. Kempston Darkes, Mr. Kudryavtsev, Mr. Marks, Dr. Mitrova, Ms. Nooyi, Ms. Olayan, Dr. Reif and Mr. Sandvold each have served as directors, executive officers, trustees, outside consultants or advisory board members at companies and universities that have had commercial business relationships with the Company, all of which were ordinary course commercial transactions involving significantly less than the greater of $1 million or 2% of the other entity's annual revenues. The Board also considered that the Company made charitable contributions in 2018 to the Moscow School of Management SKOLKOVO, where Dr. Mitrova is Director of the Energy Centre, of approximately $500,000, relating to educational grants and sponsored fellowships, for which Dr. Mitrova received no personal benefit. This amount was significantly less than the greater of $1 million or 2% of the university's consolidated gross revenues for any of the past three years.
Board Tenure
We believe that Board tenure diversity is important and directors with many years of service provide the Board with a deep knowledge of our company, while newer directors lend fresh perspectives. The chart below reflects the Board tenure of our current director nominees.
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, non-executive directors are eligible to be nominated or renominated to the Board up to their 70th birthday, and executive directors are eligible to be nominated or renominated up to their 65th birthday, after which directors may no longer be nominated or renominated to the Board. Our Board may waive this policy on a case-by-case basis on the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee if it deems a waiver to be in the best interest of the Company. The Board waived this policy for Mr. Papa upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee because it believes that retaining the expertise of Mr. Papa is in the best interest of our Company and our stockholders.
Diversified Director Nominee Tenure
Director Nominations
The Nominating and Governance Committee believes that director nominees should, in the judgment of the Board, be persons of integrity and honesty, be able to exercise sound, mature and independent business judgment in the best interests of our stockholders as a whole, be recognized leaders in business or professional activity, have background and experience that will complement those of other Board members, be able to actively participate in Board and Committee meetings and related activities, be able to work professionally and effectively with other Board members and Schlumberger management, be available to remain on the Board long enough to make an effective contribution and have no material relationship with competitors, customers or other third parties that could present realistic possibilities of conflict of interest or legal issues.
The Nominating and Governance Committee also promotes Schlumberger's diversity policy that the Board should ensure that qualified candidates reflecting gender, cultural and geographical diversity are considered as potential director nominees. Schlumberger has approximately 100,000 employees worldwide, representing more than 140 nationalities, and values gender, cultural and geographical diversity in its directors as well. We also have a culture of recruiting, hiring and training where we operate, as described in our Code of Conduct. This culture also influences the composition of our Board. Three of our 10 director nominees are women. Of the 10 director nominees, four are citizens of the United States of America, two are citizens of Russia, and one is a citizen of each of Norway, France, and Saudi Arabia, while one of our directors is a dual citizen of both Argentina and the United Kingdom.
Our geographically diverse Board also evidences the Board's commitment to have directors who represent countries where Schlumberger operates. In addition, the exceptionally broad and diverse experience of our Board nominees is in keeping with the goal of having directors whose background and experience complement those of other directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee's evaluation of director nominees takes into account their ability to contribute to the Board's diversity, and the Nominating and Governance Committee annually reviews its effectiveness in balancing these considerations in the context of its consideration of director nominees.
One of the other goals of our Nominating and Governance Committee is to ensure that the nominees have experience, skills and other attributes that complement the whole of our Board as a governing body. We believe that the nominees are able to provide a well-rounded set of expertise that will assist in effective oversight of management at Schlumberger. The following matrix identifies the primary skills, core competencies and other attributes that each director brings to bear in their service to our Board and committees. Each director possesses numerous other skills and competencies not identified below. We believe identifying primary skills is a more meaningful presentation of the key contributions and value that each director nominee brings to their service on the Board and to our stockholders. Further information on each director nominee, including some of their specific experience, skills and other attributes is set forth in the biographies beginning on page 8 of this proxy statement.
Applying the criteria above, the Nominating and Governance Committee recommends to the Board the number and names of persons to be proposed by the Board for election as directors at our annual general meeting of stockholders. In obtaining the names of possible nominees, the Nominating and Governance Committee makes its own inquiries and will receive suggestions from other directors and management. From time to time, the Committee retains executive search and board advisory consulting firms to assist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees. To further our diversity policy, we request that such firms retained by us include women and ethnically diverse candidates in the proposals they present to us. During 2018, the Committee used the services of Spencer Stuart, a third-party executive search firm, for this purpose. Consideration of new Board candidates typically involves a series of internal discussions, review of information concerning candidates, and interviews with selected candidates. Our CEO suggested each of Dr. Mitrova and Mr. Papa as prospective Board candidates.
The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider nominees recommended by stockholders who meet the eligibility requirements for submitting stockholder proposals for inclusion in the next proxy statement and submit their recommendations in writing to:
Chair, Nominating and Governance Committee c/o Secretary, Schlumberger Limited
5599 San Felipe, 17th Floor
Houston, Texas 77056.
Such recommendations must be submitted by the deadline for stockholder proposals referred to at the end of this proxy statement. Unsolicited recommendations must contain all of the information that would be required in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of the candidate as a director, a description of all direct or indirect arrangements or understandings between the recommending security holder and the candidate, all other companies to which the candidate is being recommended as a nominee for director, and a signed consent of the candidate to cooperate with reasonable background checks and personal interviews, and to serve as a member of our Board, if elected.
Board Adoption of Proxy Access
Although we had not received a stockholder proposal requesting a proxy access bylaw, we proactively adopted proxy access bylaw provisions in January 2017. These provisions permit a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least three percent (3%) of our outstanding common stock, for at least three (3) years, to include two (2) director nominees, or 20% of the current Board, whichever is greater, in our proxy for the annual general meeting.
Board Leadership Structure
The Board recognizes that one of its key responsibilities is to evaluate and determine an appropriate board leadership structure to provide for independent oversight of management. The Board believes that there is no single, generally accepted board leadership structure that is appropriate for all companies, and that the right structure may vary for a single company as circumstances change. As such, our independent directors consider the Board's leadership structure at least annually, and may modify this structure to best address the Company's unique circumstances and advance the best interests of all stockholders, as and when appropriate.
From 2011 to 2015, the Board was led by a non-executive chairman of the Board. In connection with the chairman's retirement in 2015, the independent members of the Board gave thoughtful consideration to the Board's leadership structure and determined that recombining the Chairman and CEO positions under the leadership of Mr. Kibsgaard upon the independent chair's retirement was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. This determination was based on the Board's strong belief that, as the individual with primary responsibility for managing the Company's day-to-day operations and with extensive knowledge and understanding of the Company, Mr. Kibsgaard was best positioned to chair regular Board meetings as the directors discuss key business and strategic issues and to focus the Board's attention on the issues of greatest importance to the Company and its stockholders. Furthermore, the Board believed that combining the roles of Chairman and CEO in Mr. Kibsgaard created a clear line of authority that promotes decisive and effective leadership, both within and outside the Company. In making this judgment, the Board took into account its evaluation of Mr. Kibsgaard's performance as CEO and as a then-current member of the Board, his positive relationships with the other directors, and the strategic perspective he would bring to the role of Chairman.
In considering its leadership structure, the Board also took into account that Schlumberger's current governance practices provide for strong independent leadership, active participation by independent directors and independent evaluation of, and communication with, many members of senior management. These governance practices are reflected in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our various committee charters, which are available on our website. The Board believes that its risk oversight programs, discussed immediately below, are effective under a variety of board leadership frameworks and therefore do not materially affect the Board's choice of leadership structure.
Roles and Responsibilities of our Lead Independent Director
The Board recognizes the importance of having a board structure that promotes the appropriate exercise of independent judgment by the Board. When the Chairman/CEO roles are combined as they currently are, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that we have a lead independent director to complement the Chairman's role, and to serve as the principal liaison between the non-employee directors and the Chairman. Mr. Currie currently serves as our Lead Independent Director, providing effective, independent leadership of our Board through the following clearly defined and robust leadership authority and responsibilities:
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight
As set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board routinely assesses major risks facing the Company and options for their mitigation, in order to promote the Company's stockholders' and other stakeholders' interests in the long-term health and the overall success of the Company and its financial strength.
The full Board is actively involved in overseeing risk management for the Company. We believe that our Board composition provides the Company with robust experience in several areas of risk oversight. Several of our Board members, including Messrs. Galuccio, Kibsgaard, and Papa and Dr. Mitrova have valuable experience in the regulatory, economic and commodity risks that are specific to our industry, while Messrs. Kudryatsev, Reif and Seydoux have valuable experience in science and technology issues. In addition, many members of our Board, including Messrs. Currie, Reif and Seydoux and Msses. Nooyi and Olayan, all provide expertise in general business governance, capital allocation, management and economic trends relevant to our business.
The Board also manages risk in part through its oversight of the Company's Executive Risk Committee (the "ERC") comprised of more than half a dozen top executives of the Company from various functions, each of whom supervises day-to-day risk management throughout the Company. The ERC is not a committee of the Board. The ERC ensures that the Company identifies all potential material risks facing the Company and implements appropriate mitigation measures. The Company's risk identification is performed annually at two levels: the ERC performs a corporate-level risk mapping exercise, which involves the CEO and several other members of senior management, and while maintaining oversight, delegates operational (field-level) risk assessment and management to the Company's various GeoMarkets, Technologies and Functions and to its Research, Engineering, Manufacturing and Sustaining organization. To the extent that the ERC identifies recurring themes from the operational risk mapping exercises, they are acted on at the corporate level. Members of the ERC meet formally at least once a year, and more frequently on an ad hoc basis, to define and improve the risk mapping process, and to review and monitor the results of those exercises and those that have been delegated. The ERC reports directly to the CEO and to the full Board, and annually presents to the full Board a comprehensive report as to its risk mapping efforts for that year.
In addition, each of our Board committees considers the risks within its areas of responsibility. For example, the Finance Committee considers finance-related risks on a quarterly basis and recommends guidelines to control pension and other investments, banking relationships and currency exposures. The Compensation Committee reviews and assesses the Company's overall compensation program and its effectiveness at linking executive pay to performance, aligning the interests of our executives and our stockholders and providing for appropriate incentives. The Science and Technology Committee reviews and assesses risks affecting the Company's technology direction and research and development. The Nominating and Governance Committee oversees governance- and compliance-related risks, related person transactions, and reviews and discusses the Company's Ethics and Compliance Program's quarterly statistical report and the various allegations, disciplinary actions and training statistics brought to its attention. The Nominating and Governance Committee also considers ESG risks. The Audit Committee reviews and assesses risks related to financial reporting. The Audit Committee also discusses all significant finance-related violations of Company policies brought to its attention from time to time, and annually reviews a summary of all finance-related violations. Additionally, the outcome of the Company's Audit Risk assessment is presented to the Audit Committee annually; this assessment identifies internal controls risks and drives the internal audit plan for the coming year. All significant violations of the Company's Code of Conduct and related corporate policies are reported to the Nominating and Governance Committee and (if finance-related) to the Audit Committee, and, when appropriate, are reported to the full Board. Once a year, the Director of Compliance delivers to the full Board a comprehensive Annual Compliance Report. The risks identified within the Ethics and Compliance Program are incorporated into the ERC's enterprise risk management program described above.
Meetings of the Board of Directors and its Committees
During 2018, the Board held 5 meetings. Schlumberger has an Audit, a Compensation, a Nominating and Governance, a Finance, and a Science and Technology Committee. During 2018, each of our committees met four times.
Each of our current directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served in 2018 (held during the period he or she served).
From time to time between meetings, Board and committee members confer with each other and with management and independent consultants regarding relevant issues, and representatives of management may meet with such consultants on behalf of the relevant committee.
Board Committees

Director Attendance at 2018 Annual General Meeting
The Board's policy regarding director attendance at annual general meetings of stockholders is that directors are welcome, but not required, to attend, and that the Company will make all appropriate arrangements for directors who choose to attend. No director attended our annual general meeting of stockholders in 2018.
Policies and Procedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions
In January 2007, the Board formally adopted a written policy with respect to "related person transactions" to document procedures pursuant to which such transactions are reviewed, approved or ratified. Under SEC rules, "related persons" include any director, executive officer, director nominee, or greater than 5% stockholder of the Company since the beginning of the previous fiscal year, and their immediate family members. The policy applies to any transaction in which:
The Nominating and Governance Committee, with assistance from the Company's Secretary and General Counsel, is responsible for reviewing and, where appropriate, approving or ratifying any related person transaction involving Schlumberger or its subsidiaries and related persons. The Nominating and Governance Committee approves only those related person transactions that are in, or are not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
Since the beginning of 2018, there were no related person transactions under the relevant standards.
Code of Conduct
Schlumberger has adopted a code of conduct entitled The Blue Print and The Blue Print in Action, which applies to all of its directors, officers and employees. Together, these documents describe the purpose, ambition and mindset of the Company and expectations for its employees. Both documents are located at www.slb.com/about/codeofconduct.aspx.
We are asking our stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the Company's executive compensation as reported in this proxy statement. As described below in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement, the Compensation Committee has structured our executive compensation program to achieve the following key objectives:
We urge stockholders to read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 26 of this proxy statement, which describes in more detail how our executive compensation policies and procedures operate and are designed to achieve our compensation objectives, as well as the Summary Compensation Table and other related compensation tables and narrative, appearing on pages 49-61, which provide detailed information on the compensation of our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that the policies and procedures articulated in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" are effective in achieving our goals and that the compensation of our named executive officers reported in this proxy statement has contributed to the Company's long-term success.
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, and as a matter of good corporate governance, we are asking stockholders to approve the following advisory resolution at the 2019 annual general meeting of stockholders:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Schlumberger Limited (the "Company") approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the related compensation tables, notes and narrative in the Proxy Statement for the Company's 2019 annual general meeting of stockholders.
This advisory resolution, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" resolution, is non-binding on our Board. Although non-binding, our Board and the Compensation Committee will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation program.
The Board has adopted a policy providing for an annual "say-on-pay" advisory vote. Unless the Board of Directors modifies its policy on the frequency of holding "say-on-pay" advisory votes, the next "say-on-pay" advisory vote will occur in 2020.
Required Vote
A majority of the votes cast is required to approve this Item 2.
If you hold your shares in street name, please note that brokers, banks and holders of record do not have discretion to vote on this proposal without your instruction. If you do not instruct your broker, bank or holder of record how to vote on this proposal, they will deliver a non-vote on this proposal.
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") describes Schlumberger's compensation policies and practices as they relate to our executive officers identified in the Summary Compensation Table below (the "named executive officers," or the "NEOs"). The purpose of the CD&A is to explain what the elements of their compensation are; why the Compensation Committee selects these elements; how the Compensation Committee determines the relative size of each element of compensation; the decisions the Compensation Committee made with respect to the 2018 compensation of the NEOs, and the reasons for those decisions.
2018 — Executive Overview
2018 was a difficult year for Schlumberger, as well as for oilfield services companies as a whole. Our common share price suffered a 46% decline year-over-year. This was very similar to the average year-over year share price decline of all companies, including our largest competitors, comprising the Philadelphia Oil Service Sector Index. The year was characterized by — and our share price was affected by — continued industry uncertainty, muted customer spending, sluggish pricing improvement and a dramatic decrease in oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our named executive officers' 2018 cash incentive payouts, which were subject primarily to achievement of rigorous quantitative Company 2018 financial goals, paid out at less than 38% of target, underscoring the alignment between our shareholders' experience and our executives' 2018 cash incentive compensation. See "Elements of Total Direct Compensation; 2018 Decisions—Annual Cash Incentive Awards" beginning on page 34.
Against this backdrop, however, our senior management team delivered strong operational results in 2018. Our consolidated revenues grew for a second year in a row, increasing 8% over our 2017 revenue. We also generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow in 2018, representing a 48% increase year-over-year.(1) Over the course of 2018, our management set a solid foundation for our 2019 plans, including improving our liquidity through our focus on revenue growth, incremental margins, capital discipline and careful management of working capital.
Our strong results in the first half of 2018 were led by our OneStim® business in North America. The vertical integration of our supply chain gave us a competitive advantage in our hydraulic fracturing service lines and ensured supply-chain security in a volatile market. Also in 2018, we continued to ramp up our integrated drilling services (IDS) business in the international market, capitalizing on one of our core strengths. We believe this will result in higher margins and faster returns for these projects in 2019. Our OneSubsea product line booked $1 billion in orders during the second half of 2018, providing a solid platform for growth.
We continued our transformation by modernizing all of our internal workflows, as well as our organizational structure. This included further professionalizing our support functions, introducing cutting-edge planning, execution and collaboration tools, and adjusting our operations to increase teamwork and functional accountability. Our modernized operating platform will allow us to significantly improve our efficiency and reduce operating costs of our asset base through improved planning, distribution and maintenance. We believe that this will maximize our operational agility and competitiveness for the long-term.
Stockholder Outreach; Changes to our Executive Compensation Program
In 2018, 66.2% of the votes cast at our annual general meeting of stockholders voted in favor of our executive compensation program. Prior to our annual meeting, we contacted 20 of our largest stockholders, representing 47% of our outstanding stock, and met with 14 of them, representing 35% of our outstanding common stock, to seek their views on our executive compensation program.
Further, in August 2018, we reached out to 18 of our largest stockholders, representing 41% of our outstanding stock, and spoke to eight of these stockholders, representing 24% of our outstanding common stock. Senior members of our management team engaged these stockholders in frank and productive discussions regarding our executive compensation program and some of the alternatives we were considering in light of the stockholder feedback we received prior to the annual meeting. Our Lead Independent Director and the chairman of our Compensation Committee also participated in our engagement efforts when requested. Our management team then reported on these discussions to our Compensation Committee and our Board. In response to stockholder feedback, the Compensation Committee approved three changes to our executive compensation program, which we summarize below. One of these changes is effective for our 2018 executive compensation program, while the other two went into effect this year. Thus, the full impact of these decisions will be reflected in our 2019 executive compensation program, and will be presented in next year's proxy statement.
Annual Cash Incentive
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Some stockholders said our NEOs' key personal objectives constituted too large      a portion of their annual cash incentive opportunity, and preferred that a larger portion of their annual cash incentive awards      be based on achieving quantitative Company results.• We          reduced the weighting of our NEOs' key personal objectives under our annual cash incentive plan from 50% to 30%,          and correspondingly increased the weighting of quantitative Company financial objectives under that plan. As a result:• 50%          of our NEOs' 2018 cash incentive plan continued to be based on achievement of adjusted EPS targets;• 10%          of our NEOs' 2018 cash incentive plan was based on revenue targets; and• 10%          of our NEOs' 2018 cash incentive plan was based on pre-tax operating income ("PTOI") targets.

Long-Term Incentive ("LTI") Equity Awards
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Some          stockholders encouraged us to incorporate a total shareholder return ("TSR") metric into our performance-based          equity awards. The rationale for including this metric would be to better tie our executives' compensation to the          creation of stockholder value.• We      introduced a modifier based on relative TSR to all of our 2019 performance share unit     ("PSU") awards. Under      this modifier, the number of shares earned upon vesting will be reduced by 25 percentage     points if our cumulative      TSR during the three-year TSR performance period is ranked in the bottom 33rd percentile     relative to the TSR      of the companies comprising the Philadelphia Oil Service Sector (OSX) Index. The relative TSR modifier will only     reduce      the number of shares earned under a PSU award, but will not increase the number of shares earned.

Other PSUs          are subject to a three-year return on capital employed ("ROCE") performance condition in addition to the three-year TSR          modifier. As a result, all 2019 PSUs will vest, if at all, only after a three-year performance period.

Overview of Compensation Decisions for 2018
In 2018, the Compensation Committee continued to focus on strengthening the link between pay and performance; retaining and motivating our top executives; and appropriately compensating them for outperforming our competitors and increasing long-term stockholder value.
In this context, and as more fully discussed elsewhere in this CD&A, the Compensation Committee approved the following actions for our NEOs' 2018 compensation:
Our Executive Compensation Best Practices
The following is a summary of some of our executive compensation best practices and policies.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Pay          for Performance. 100% of our NEOs' annual equity-based compensation is performance-based, using a variety          of performance measures.  At          Risk Pay. A significant portion of our NEOs' pay is at risk, and is based on a mix of absolute and relative          financial and operational metrics. 88% of our CEO's 2018 total direct compensation was at risk.  Short-Term          Incentive. At least 70% of our NEOs' annual cash incentive plan is based on achievement of rigorous quantitative,          financial goals.  Clawback          Policy. Our clawback policy, and the terms of our equity awards, allow our Board to recoup performance-based cash          and equity awards in specified instances.  Robust          Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines. Our CEO must own our stock valued at six times his annual base salary; our          executive vice presidents and CFO must own at least three times their annual base salary; and all other executive officers          must own at least two times their annual base salary.  Annual          Peer Compensation Review. We review the compensation opportunities for all of our officers against our peer groups          annually.  Limit          on Maximum Incentive Payouts. We cap the amount that can be earned under our incentive compensation arrangements          as a multiple of target.     Our          executive officers have no employment, severance or change-in-control agreements.  No          gross-ups on excise taxes.  No          hedging or pledging of Schlumberger stock by directors or executive officers.  No          automatic acceleration of equity awards upon a change in control.  Our          executive officers receive only very limited perquisites.  No          executive pension or insurance plans exclusively for executive officers.  We          do not dilute our shareholders with excessive equity grants to employees. Our 2018 "burn rate," or stock awards          granted as a percentage of common shares outstanding, was only 0.37%.  No          repricing or exchange of underwater options without stockholder approval.

Framework for Setting Executive Compensation in 2018
Executive Compensation Philosophy and Goals
Our compensation program is designed so that the higher an executive's position in the Company, the greater the percentage of compensation that is "at risk" — that is, contingent on our financial performance, long-term stock price performance and individual performance. See "—Relative Size of Direct Compensation Elements" beginning on page 30. The Company believes that having a significant portion of our executives' compensation at risk more closely aligns their interests with the long-term interests of Schlumberger and its stockholders.
The table below sets out the elements of our NEOs' 2018 total direct compensation; certain key features of each element; how we determine their size; and why we use these elements.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   ROCE Performance    Share Units• Relative performance metric• Based on our average annual ROCE compared to that of several          major oilfield service competitors• See ROCE payout/performance      matrix on page 40• Motivates and rewards      executives for relative outperformance on a key financial metric

[END TABLE]
In setting our executives' compensation, we believe that:
Promotion from within the Company is a key principle at Schlumberger, and all of our named executive officers have reached their current positions through career development within the Company. Schlumberger sees diversity of its workforce as both a very important part of its cultural philosophy and a business imperative, as it enables the Company to serve clients anywhere in the world. Schlumberger believes that its use of a consistent approach to compensation at all levels irrespective of nationality is a strong factor in achieving a diverse workforce comprising top global talent.
Relative Size of Direct Compensation Elements
Our executive compensation program consists of three primary elements, comprising our executives' total direct compensation:
These elements allow the Company to remain competitive and attract, retain and motivate top executive talent with current and potential future financial rewards. At the same time, this relatively simple compensation program is applied and communicated consistently to our exempt employees of more than 140 nationalities operating in more than 85 countries.
The Compensation Committee reviews the elements of total direct compensation for the NEOs throughout the year, to evaluate whether each element of direct compensation remains at levels that are competitive with companies in Schlumberger's two main peer groups as described in "Other Aspects of our Executive Compensation Framework – Peer Group Companies" below. The Compensation Committee relies on its own judgment in making these compensation decisions after its review of external market practices of companies in our executive compensation peer groups, including the size and mix of direct compensation for executives in those companies. The Compensation Committee seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between annual cash rewards that encourage achievement of annual financial and non-financial objectives, and LTI awards that encourage positive long-term stock price performance, with a greater emphasis on LTI awards for more senior executives.
While external market data provide important guidance in making decisions on executive compensation, the Compensation Committee does not set compensation based on market data alone. When determining the size and mix of each element of an NEO's total direct compensation, the Compensation Committee also considers the following factors:
The charts below show the percentage of 2018 base salary, target annual cash incentive and LTI compensation established by the Compensation Committee in January 2018 for our CEO and other NEOs. Approximately 88% of the direct compensation of our CEO and 83% for our other NEOs was at risk, demonstrating management's alignment with our stockholders. In 2018, the portion of our CEO's total compensation, as well as that of our other NEOs as a group, that was at risk is as follows:
Based on market data provided by our independent compensation consultant, Schlumberger's pay mix is generally more weighted toward long-term incentive compensation than that of the companies in our main comparator groups. The Compensation Committee may, at its discretion, modify the CEO's, or any other NEO's mix of base pay, annual cash incentive and LTIs, or otherwise adjust an NEO's total compensation, to best fit their specific circumstances. This has historically provided flexibility to the Compensation Committee to compensate NEOs appropriately as they near retirement, when they might not receive any LTI awards for their final years of service. The Compensation Committee may also increase the size of an LTI award to an NEO if the aggregate career LTI awards granted do not adequately reflect the executive's current position and level of responsibility within the Company, taking into account external market practices and the other factors described above.
The Competition for our Executive Talent
A primary consideration of the Compensation Committee in overseeing our executive compensation program is the need to motivate and retain what it considers to be the best executive talent in the energy industry. We are the world's largest oilfield services company and a constituent of Standard & Poor's S&P 100 Index. The Compensation Committee believes that our success in delivering strong long-term stockholder returns and financial and operational results is a result of our ability to attract, develop and retain the best talent globally. A highly competitive compensation package is critical to this objective and, to this end, the Compensation Committee generally seeks to target total direct compensation for our NEOs between the 50th and 75th percentiles of the Company's executive compensation comparator groups. An NEO's target total direct compensation depends on a variety of factors, including tenure in a particular position, individual and Company performance, and internal pay equity. For example, the Compensation Committee generally seeks to position an executive with a relatively short tenure in a position at the 50th percentile of the Company's executive compensation comparator groups.
Our Compensation Committee believes that the 50th to 75th percentiles is an appropriate range to target because of Schlumberger's leading position in the oilfield services industry; because competition for our executive talent in the oil and gas industry is exceptionally fierce; and because our executives are very highly sought after, not only by our direct oilfield service competitors but by other leading companies.
In approving this target range and when setting compensation in 2018, the Compensation Committee considered that many current and former senior executive officers of leading companies in the energy industry have previously served as senior executives at Schlumberger.
The Compensation Committee retains the flexibility to set elements of target compensation at higher percentiles based on strong business performance, retention needs, for key skills in critical demand, and for positions that are of high internal value. Elements of our executives' total direct compensation and actual payments may also be below our main comparator groups' median as a result of our pay-for-performance philosophy, as discussed below.
Pay-for-Performance — Executive Pay and Alignment
As part of the Compensation Committee's annual review of our executive compensation program, in July 2018 the Committee directed its independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance LLC ("Pay Governance"), to prepare a comparative pay-for-performance assessment against companies in our oil industry executive compensation peer group as identified in the section entitled "Other Aspects of our Executive Compensation Framework—Peer Group Companies" beginning on page 41. The purpose of the comparative assessment was to determine the degree of alignment between our NEOs' total realizable compensation and our performance relative to these companies as measured by TSR, free cash flow growth and ROCE. We selected these metrics for their effectiveness in assessing long-term Company performance. TSR reflects share price appreciation, adjusted for dividends and stock splits.
We assessed performance on a three- and five-year basis ending on December 31, 2017, because the Compensation Committee believes that alignment of pay and performance is more effectively assessed over the mid- and long-term. The Compensation Committee reviewed the total realizable compensation of our CEO against that of other CEOs in our oil industry compensation peer group. It then separately reviewed the total realizable compensation of our NEOs as a group against that of named executive officers at other companies comprising that peer group.
As a result of the assessment, the Committee determined that the total realizable compensation of our CEO and the other NEOs was generally aligned with performance, with especially strong alignment between their realizable compensation and ROCE performance over both periods.
"Total realizable compensation" for each period consisted of the following:
CEO Realized Pay
In the course of the Compensation Committee's review of our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee noted that for the past several years, the realized pay of Mr. Kibsgaard, our CEO, was, in general, substantially less than his total compensation as reported in in the Summary Compensation Table of our proxy statements (his "reported pay"). This is because the largest element of Mr. Kibsgaard's pay consists of LTI awards, which are reported in the Summary Compensation Table based on their grant date accounting value, and thus do not reflect the value that could be earned or is actually received from these grants. Realized pay, on the other hand (also known as actual pay), is what Mr. Kibsgaard received during a given fiscal year. As a result, we believe that it is useful to compare his realized pay for each year, with his reported pay for the same period as illustrated in the chart below.
We calculate "realized pay" for a given year by adding together:
The chart below shows the actual compensation received by our CEO from 2014 to 2018, and demonstrates that his realized pay was significantly lower than his reported pay for all but one year during this period. Most of the compensation of our CEO, like that of our other NEOs, was at risk.
CEO Reported Pay vs. Realized Pay
For the years 2014-2018, our CEO's realized pay was 102.3%, 48.6%, 62.3%, 30.3% and 19.6% of his reported pay, respectively. Our CEO's 2014 realized pay was comparable to his 2014 reported pay because he exercised stock options in 2014, some of which were granted as early as 2006, and because one-time transitional PSUs that were awarded in 2013 vested in 2014.
In addition, the following chart compares the realized pay of our CEO for the years 2014-2018 to our TSR over the same period, and demonstrates that his realized pay generally correlates to our TSR over that period.
CEO Realized Pay and TSR
Pay Mix and Internal Pay Equity Review
In January 2018, the Compensation Committee analyzed the mix of our executives' compensation elements. In carrying out its analysis, the Compensation Committee considered the relative size of direct compensation elements of companies in Schlumberger's two main executive compensation comparator groups in the section entitled "Other Aspects of our Executive Compensation Framework—Peer Group Companies" as well as internal factors. With regard to pay mix, the Compensation Committee also reviewed the elements of compensation for the Company's NEOs, both in relation to one another and in comparison with the average pay mix of the Company's executive officers. Based on its review, the Compensation Committee concluded that the mix of base salary, target annual cash incentive and LTI was appropriate for each of Schlumberger's NEOs.
The Compensation Committee also reviewed internal pay equity at its January 2018 and October 2018 meetings. Our executive officers operate as a team. Therefore, the Compensation Committee considers internal pay equity to be an important factor in its executive compensation decisions. The Compensation Committee reviewed the compensation of the CEO in relation to the compensation of our other executive officer positions, and our executives' compensation both in relation to one another and compared to the average compensation of our other executive officer positions. The Compensation Committee noted that the ratio of target total direct compensation between the CEO and the second-highest paid executive officer was similar to that in the three prior years. The Compensation Committee also noted that the levels of target total direct compensation for the third- to the fifth-highest paid officers were very closely clustered together, consistent with their relative positions within the Company. As a result, the Compensation Committee concluded that internal pay equity was appropriate.
Elements of Total Direct Compensation; 2018 Decisions
Base Salary
Base salary is the fixed portion of an executive's annual compensation, which provides some stability of income since the other compensation elements are variable and not guaranteed. On appointment to an executive officer position, base salary is set at a level that is competitive with base salaries in the applicable peer compensation groups for that position and takes into account other factors described below.
Base salaries for each executive officer position are compared annually with similar positions in the applicable compensation peer groups. Base salary changes for executive officers, except the CEO, are recommended by the CEO and subject to approval by the Compensation Committee, taking into account:
The Compensation Committee reviews the base salary of the CEO in executive session and recommends his base salary to the non-executive members of our Board for approval, based on the criteria described above. In addition to periodic reviews based on the factors described above, the Compensation Committee may adjust an executive officer's base salary during the year if he or she is promoted or if there is a significant change in his or her responsibilities. In this situation, the CEO (in the case of executive officers other than himself) and the Compensation Committee carefully consider these new responsibilities, external pay practices, retention considerations and internal pay equity, as well as past performance and experience. Base salary may also be reduced when an executive officer moves to a position of lesser responsibility in the Company. Alternatively, an executive's base salary can be frozen for a number of years until it falls in line with comparable positions in the applicable compensation peer groups.
Base Salary Decisions in 2018
The Compensation Committee reviewed the compensation of each of our NEOs in January 2018. Upon review of comparative market data, the Compensation Committee determined to maintain the base salaries of our CEO and CFO at their current levels, and to increase the base salary of Messrs. Al Mogharbel and Gatt Floridia by $70,000 each in recognition of their promotions. Two of our current NEOs have had their base salaries frozen since 2011, and our CEO's base salary has been frozen since 2015.
Annual Cash Incentive Awards
The Company pays annual performance-based cash incentives to its executives to foster a results-driven, pay-for-performance culture and to align their interests with those of our stockholders.
The Compensation Committee selects performance-based measures that it believes strike a balance between motivating an executive to increase near-term operating and financial results and driving profitable long-term Company growth and value for stockholders. Annual cash incentive awards are earned according to the achievement of financial, strategic, operational and personal objectives, as described below. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the financial and other objectives applicable to the NEOs (and, in the case of the CEO, recommends to the independent directors of the Board the financial objectives applicable to the CEO). The Compensation Committee believes that, with regard to Company financial targets or performance goals, as well as our NEOs' personal objectives, it is important to establish criteria that, while very difficult to achieve in an uncertain global economy, are realistic.
As discussed above, based on stockholder feedback, the Compensation Committee tied 70% of our NEOs' 2018 annual cash incentive payout opportunity to the achievement of quantitative financial goals, while the remaining 30% is based on our NEOs' achievement of pre-established personal objectives, which typically contain key strategic, operational and individual goals ("KPOs").
In making this change, we introduced two new financial measures to our 2018 cash incentive program: revenue and PTOI. Each of these metrics accounted for 10% of our NEOs' 2018 cash incentive opportunity. The Compensation Committee believes using PTOI as a performance metric incentivizes our executives to increase earnings by entering into contracts that generate strong returns for the Company. The Compensation Committee also believes that, in this stage of the industry recovery, using revenue as a performance metric incentivizes our executives to continue to grow the business and gain market share for the long-term. In addition to these financial performance measures, 50% of the 2018 cash incentive opportunity continued to be tied to adjusted EPS.
As a result of these changes, the quantitative financial component of our 2018 annual cash incentive program included three different metrics: adjusted EPS, revenue and PTOI, as reflected by the following chart:
Adjusted EPS
The maximum cash incentive opportunity for our NEOs under the adjusted EPS portion of our annual cash incentive plan can be up to 300% of target, based on achievement of superior financial results. However, the remaining objectives are not subject to a maximum performance multiplier, meaning the maximum payout with respect to this half of the target annual cash incentive is 100% of target. As a result, an executive's maximum annual cash incentive payment cannot exceed 200% of target.
The Compensation Committee determined that it was appropriate in 2018 to continue to tie a substantial portion of our NEOs' annual cash incentive opportunity to achievement of adjusted EPS goals, because it best reflects stockholder value creation and aligns the interests of management with those of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee selected adjusted EPS as an absolute measure because it is the primary absolute basis on which we set our performance expectations for the year. We believe that consistent adjusted EPS growth leads to long-term stockholder value.
As a general matter, when considering the Company's operating results for purposes of the financial portion of the annual cash incentive, the Compensation Committee may take into account unusual or infrequent charges or gains, depending on the nature of the item. The Compensation Committee may make adjustments when it believes that our executives would be inappropriately penalized by, or would inappropriately benefit from, these items. For example, the Compensation Committee may determine to exclude charges that arise from actions that management takes to proactively address events beyond its control, such as the recent industry downturn. Consistent with prior years, the Compensation Committee evaluated our 2018 performance based on adjusted EPS. For purposes of the adjusted EPS portion of our 2018 cash incentive program, the Compensation Committee believed that it was appropriate to modify earnings per share based on GAAP for items that did not reflect Schlumberger's operating trends, such as a gain on divestiture of a business and certain asset impairment charges.
Key Personal Objectives
Our NEOs' personal objectives are approved at the start of the fiscal year. The Compensation Committee reviews and, subject to approval by the independent directors of the Board, approves the strategic personal objectives of the CEO. and assesses his performance against those objectives in determining a portion of his annual cash incentive award, taking into account performance for the just-completed fiscal year versus predefined commitments for the fiscal year; unforeseen financial, operational and strategic issues of the Company; and any other information it determines is relevant. The CEO reviews and approves the personal strategic objectives of the other NEOs, and assesses their performance against their pre-approved objectives in a similar way.
Each NEO's annual cash incentive opportunity is tied to achievement of quantitative and qualitative goals that are specific to that NEO's position, and may relate to:
2018 Annual Cash Incentive Results
Upon review of market data of the applicable compensation peer groups, and taking into consideration internal pay equity and that the target annual cash incentive of our NEOs was already positioned competitively from a market perspective, the Compensation Committee determined in January 2018 to leave the target annual cash incentive opportunity for all NEOs unchanged from 2017. As a result, the 2018 target annual cash incentive for our CEO was 150% of his base salary and 100% of base salary for our other NEOs.
All of our NEOs earned less than 38% of their respective annual cash incentive opportunity in 2018. In addition, the 2018 total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, was approximately $4.5 million less than his 2017 total compensation. This was largely as a result of the zero payout under the adjusted EPS and PTOI portions of our annual cash incentive program.
2018 Adjusted EPS Targets and Results
The process used to set annual adjusted EPS targets starts at the end of each year with an extensive review of plans and projections for the following year following bottom-up planning from the field. Adjusted EPS targets are subject to increase or decrease year-over-year, taking into account:
At the January 2018 meeting, the Compensation Committee approved the following full-year adjusted EPS targets and corresponding payouts for 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
2018 Adjusted EPS Performance Targets% of Adjusted EPS Portion (Payout%) 
2018 Adjusted EPS Performance Targets% of Adjusted EPS Portion (Payout%) 
[END TABLE]
For adjusted EPS results between any two targets, payout is prorated. No cash incentive is earned if we do not achieve the minimum adjusted EPS target.
For 2018, the Compensation Committee approved adjusted EPS targets at levels that reflected expected improvement from adjusted EPS of $1.50 achieved in 2017, which took into account factors that would potentially limit adjusted EPS gains, such as market conditions, management's low visibility as to when customer spending would meaningfully improve, and its view that our business would not immediately recover pricing concessions extended to customers in the recent downturn.
Our 2018 adjusted EPS(2) was $1.62, while 2018 earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $1.53. Because we did not achieve our threshold adjusted EPS target, our NEOs earned no payout under the adjusted EPS component of the 2018 cash incentive plan.
2018 Revenue Targets and Results
The process used to set annual revenue targets starts with a review of plans and projections following analysis of expected customer spend, projects and internal planning. Revenue targets may increase or decrease year-over-year, taking into account the same factors listed under adjusted EPS above.
The Compensation Committee set the following full-year revenue targets and corresponding payouts for 2018. In setting these goals for 2018, the Compensation Committee approved revenue targets at levels that reflected expected improvement from 2017 revenue of $30.4 billion.
For revenue results between the minimum and maximum target, payout is prorated. No cash incentive is earned if we do not achieve the minimum revenue target.
Our 2018 revenue was $32.82 billion, representing achievement of 97% of target. This resulted in a payout of 78.1% of the revenue portion of the 2018 cash incentive plan.
2018 PTOI Targets and Results
The process used to set annual consolidated PTOI targets starts with a review of plans and projections following bottom-up planning from the field. PTOI targets may increase or decrease year-over-year, taking into account the same factors listed under adjusted EPS above.
The Compensation Committee set the following full-year PTOI targets and corresponding payouts for 2018. In setting these goals, the Compensation Committee approved PTOI targets at levels that reflected expected improvement from 2017 revenue of $3.9 billion.
For PTOI results between any two targets, payout is prorated. No cash incentive is earned if we do not achieve the minimum PTOI target.
Our 2018 PTOI was $4.19 billion. Because we did not achieve our threshold PTOI target, our NEOs earned no payout under the PTOI component of the 2018 cash incentive plan.

2018 Annual Cash Incentive Results
Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards
LTI awards are designed to give NEOs and other high-value employees a long-term stake in the Company, provide incentives for the creation of sustained stockholder value, act as long-term retention and motivation tools, and directly tie employee and stockholder interests over the long term.
Based on feedback from our stockholders, beginning in 2017 the Compensation Committee granted 100% of our executives' LTI awards in the form of PSUs, with payouts contingent on achievement of both absolute and relative Company financial performance goals. In prior years, our NEOs and other executive officers received 50% of their target LTI compensation in the form of performance-based equity awards and 50% in the form of stock options.
The Compensation Committee believes that granting solely PSUs serves the following objectives:
Awards of PSUs are currently limited to our NEOs and other senior executive officers. No shares will vest under the PSUs awarded to our NEOs if we do not achieve pre-established threshold performance levels. No dividends will accrue or be paid on any unvested PSUs during the applicable performance periods.
Payouts under 2016 Three-Year ROCE PSUs and 2017 Two-Year Free Cash Flow PSUs
In early 2016, our Compensation Committee granted PSUs to our NEOs and conditioned payout based on our average annual ROCE achieved over a three-year performance period as compared to the average annual ROCE of key oilfield services competitors taken together over the same period (the "2016 ROCE PSUs"). These competitors were Halliburton, Baker Hughes, a GE company, Weatherford, National Oilwell Varco and TechnipFMC.
In early 2017, our Compensation Committee granted PSUs to our NEOs and conditioned payout based on the cumulative free cash flow generated from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018, as a percentage of net income generated over that same period, excluding charges and credits (the "2017 FCF PSUs").
At its meeting in early 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the results of (a) the three-year performance period for the 2016 ROCE PSUs and (b) the two-year performance period for the 2017 FCF PSUs, both relative to the performance criteria that the Committee had previously approved. Specifically:
How We Determined the Value of 2018 LTI Equity Awards
The value of an executive's LTI grant increases with the level of an executive's responsibility at the Company. For the CEO and our other NEOs, it is the largest element of their total direct compensation package. In determining the value of LTI awards granted to NEOs, the Compensation Committee (in recommending approval by the Board of the CEO's awards) and the CEO (in recommending awards for the other NEOs) first considers market data regarding the LTI value for the most comparable positions in the Company's executive compensation comparator groups, as well as several other factors, which may include:
The Compensation Committee approved the target dollar value of LTI awards for our NEOs in 2018 at its January meeting, based on the relevant factors above.
LTI Grants to our NEOs in 2018
The Compensation Committee decided to hold 2018 target LTI grant values flat for all our NEOs, based on its review of comparator peer group data and the current market environment. The actual grant date fair value of each grant, computed in accordance with applicable accounting standards, is disclosed in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards for Fiscal Year 2018 table below. The tables below detail the estimated grant date fair value and number of ROCE PSUs and FCF PSUs granted to the NEOs.
In January 2018, the Compensation Committee approved (and in the case of our CEO, the non-executive members of the Board approved) PSUs with a three-year performance period. They will vest, if at all, based on our average annual ROCE achieved over a three-year performance period commencing in 2018 as compared to the average annual ROCE of several oilfield services competitors taken together, over the same period (the "2018 ROCE PSUs"). The Compensation Committee selected Halliburton, Baker Hughes, a GE company, Weatherford, National Oilwell Varco and TechnipFMC as the comparator group of oilfield services companies for the 2018 ROCE PSUs. The 2018 ROCE PSUs constitute 50% of our executives' 2018 target LTI dollar value. See "—2018 ROCE PSUs: Performance Measure and Goals."
Also in January 2018, the Compensation Committee approved (and in the case of our CEO, the non-executive members of the Board approved) PSUs with a two-year performance period and an additional mandatory one-year hold period. These will vest, if at all, based on the percentage of our cumulative net income, excluding charges and credits, that we are able to convert to free cash flow in 2018 and 2019 (the "2018 FCF PSUs"). The 2018 FCF PSUs constitute the other 50% of our executives' 2018 target LTI dollar value. Any 2018 FCF PSUs earned will be issued in the form of restricted stock during the mandatory one-year hold period. They will convert to non-restricted shares at the conclusion of the one-year hold period, contingent on continued employment with us as of that date. See "—2018 Free Cash Flow PSUs: Performance Measure and Goals."
The following table shows the grant values of the NEOs' 2018 LTI awards and the year-over-year percentage change between the two amounts.
2018 ROCE PSUs: Performance Measure and Goals
In January 2018, the Compensation Committee set goals for the 2018 ROCE PSUs based on our average annual ROCE over a three-year performance period as compared to the average annual ROCE of the oilfield services competitors previously described, taken together over the same period. ROCE is a measure of the efficiency of our capital employed and is a comprehensive indicator of long-term Company and management performance. The performance period for the 2018 ROCE PSUs began on January 1, 2018 and ends on December 31, 2020.
We selected a ROCE metric that is relative because it allows us to directly compare how we deploy our capital against these key comparator companies in oilfield services. This is also the metric that the Compensation Committee approved for the PSUs issued to our NEOs in 2017.
Our selection of ROCE as the performance metric for the 2018 ROCE PSUs is also consistent with our strategic direction and transformation initiatives. Furthermore, ROCE measures performance in a way that is tracked and understood by many of our investors. The Compensation Committee believes that tying a part of our senior executives' LTI pay to our efficiency goals and comparing them to that of key comparator companies in oilfield services will motivate our executives to continue to be innovative. The Compensation Committee also believes that improvements in efficiency through innovation will increase revenue and improve margins through our continued focus on pricing and cost control.
Vesting of the 2018 ROCE PSUs is conditioned on the Company's achievement of a pre-determined threshold of relative annual ROCE of no fewer than 600 basis points below the average of all companies comprising the comparator group for the performance period. In calculating this achievement, the Compensation Committee will certify the average ROCE for each of the Company and the comparator group as a whole, in each case over the three-year performance period. If the relative ROCE achieved is less than or equal to 600 basis points below the average of the competitor group, no shares will be earned.
The number of PSUs that will vest and convert to shares as of the vesting date can range from 0% to 250% of the number of 2018 ROCE PSUs awarded. In no event will payout exceed 250%. The percentage achieved will depend on our performance compared to that of our competitors during the performance period as illustrated in the following graph. At the end of the performance period, the Compensation Committee will determine the percentage of shares earned based on the graph below.
2018 ROCE PSU Payout Matrix
We calculate ROCE as a ratio, the numerator of which is (a) income from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits plus (b) after-tax net interest expense, and the denominator of which is (x) stockholders' equity, including non-controlling interests (average of beginning and end of each quarter in the year), plus (y) net debt (average of beginning and end of each quarter in the year). The Compensation Committee may adjust the Company's income from continuing operations to take into account the effect of significant impacts or activities that are not representative of underlying business operations, such as acquisitions, divestitures, asset impairments and restructurings. Furthermore, the Compensation Committee evaluates, and may adjust for, the effect of acquisitions or divestments on a case-by-case basis for purposes of the ROCE calculation.
As stated previously, the ROCE PSUs issued to our NEOs in January 2019 are subject to a three-year relative TSR modifier.
2018 Free Cash Flow PSUs: Performance Measure and Goals
In January 2018, the Compensation Committee set goals for the 2018 FCF PSUs based on the percentage of our cumulative net income, excluding charges and credits, that we are able to convert to free cash flow over a two-year performance period. Free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company and is useful to investors and to management as a measure of the Company's ability to generate cash. The performance period for the FCF PSUs began on January 1, 2018 and ends on December 31, 2019. The Committee believed it was appropriate to set two-year performance FCF goals due to the difficulty in setting meaningful performance targets over longer periods of time in our cyclical industry. The Compensation Committee set the target FCF conversion goal at 70% due to higher year-over-year capital expenditures and mobilization costs expected to be required to capture new business in 2018.
Our selection of free cash flow as a percentage of net income as the performance metric for the 2018 FCF PSUs is also part of our goal to align executive compensation with stockholder return. We present free cash flow to our investors as a measure of our ability to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the Company for future growth or to return to stockholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. The Compensation Committee believes that tying a part of our NEO's LTI pay to our efficiency in converting net income to free cash flow will incentivize our management to seek out appropriate opportunities to increase the liquidity of the Company in accordance with our transformation goals.
Free cash flow represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, SPM investments and multiclient seismic data costs capitalized. For purposes of the 2018 FCF PSUs, free cash flow will also exclude the acquisition of baseline production and investments up to first production for SPM projects. Not excluding these payments would create a potential disincentive to invest in the SPM business because such costs would reduce free cash flow. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to adjust the Company's income from continuing operations to take into account the effect of significant impacts or activities that are not representative of underlying business operations, such as acquisitions, divestitures, asset impairments and restructurings. Furthermore, the Compensation Committee evaluates, and may adjust for, the effect of acquisitions or divestments on a case-by-case basis for purposes of the free cash flow calculations.
Vesting of the 2018 FCF PSUs requires us to convert no less than 50% of our net income to free cash flow over the performance period. In calculating this achievement, the Compensation Committee will certify the cumulative free cash flow and net income generated by the Company over the two-year performance period. If the percentage of free cash flow conversion is less than or equal to 50%, no shares of our common stock will be earned.
The number of PSUs that will convert to shares at the end of the performance period can range from 0% to 250% of the number of 2018 FCF PSUs awarded. In no event will payout exceed 250%. The percentage achieved will depend on our performance over the performance period as illustrated in the following table. At the end of the performance period, the Compensation Committee will determine the number of shares earned based on the table below.
Any 2018 FCF PSUs earned will initially be issued in the form of restricted common stock and be subject to a mandatory one-year hold period. The restricted shares will convert to non-restricted shares at the end of the one-year hold period, contingent on continued employment with us as of that date. We believe this mandatory hold period fosters retention of our executive talent and better aligns the interests of our executives with that of our stockholders.
As stated previously, the FCF PSUs issued to our NEOs in January 2019 are subject to a three-year relative TSR modifier (but not a one-year hold period). As a result of the relative TSR modifier applicable to the 2019 FCF PSUs, all performance-based equity awards issued to our NEOs in 2019 will vest, if at all, only after a full three-year performance period.
Other Aspects of our Executive Compensation Framework
Peer Group Companies
The Compensation Committee considers formal executive compensation survey data prepared by Pay Governance when it reviews and determines executive compensation. The Compensation Committee also reviews information on the executive compensation practices at various "peer group" companies when considering changes to the Company's executive compensation program. To prepare for its executive compensation analysis, the Company's executive compensation department works with Pay Governance to match Company positions and responsibilities against survey positions and responsibilities and to compile the annual compensation data for each executive officer.
The Company has two main executive compensation peer groups, the oil industry and general industry peer groups (our "main comparator groups"). The survey data prepared by Pay Governance summarize the compensation levels and practices of our main comparator groups, as follows:
The Compensation Committee's selection criteria for companies comprising the main comparator groups include:
The Compensation Committee, with the assistance of Pay Governance, annually reviews specific criteria and recommendations regarding companies to add to or remove from the comparator groups. As a general matter, the Company selects suitable comparator companies such that companies in each of our two main comparator groups, at the median, approximate Schlumberger's estimated revenue in the then-current year and its then-current market capitalization. The Compensation Committee modifies the peer group criteria as appropriate while seeking a satisfactory degree of stability, to provide a consistent basis for comparison. A challenge facing the Company in determining the companies appropriate for inclusion in our two main comparator peer groups for 2018 executive compensation decisions was the Company's high market capitalization relative to its revenue, rendering it difficult to position Schlumberger at the median of each group.
Oil Industry Peer Group
The oil industry peer group comprises companies in the oil services industry with revenues greater than $5.7 billion, as well as E&P companies and integrated oil and gas companies, all with annual revenues between $7.5 billion and $103 billion. The broad revenue range is due to the limited number of peer companies in Schlumberger's immediate revenue range, and the fact that all other oilfield service companies have lower revenue than Schlumberger. Because of Schlumberger's significant international operations, this peer group includes non-U.S. energy and energy-related companies that also meet the criteria set forth above. Some members of this peer group frequently target Company executives for positions at the peer company. See "—The Competition for our Executive Talent," on page 31.
The Compensation Committee decided to include E&P companies in this peer group based on a number of factors. First, because Schlumberger was significantly larger than all of its direct competitors in the oilfield services industry in terms of revenue and market capitalization, the Compensation Committee believed that the addition of E&P companies provided a more appropriate and complete comparator group. In addition, the Compensation Committee believed that the inclusion of E&P companies is appropriate because our executives have been hired by E&P companies in the past, and market consolidation has reduced the number of direct competitors in the oilfield services industry, thus increasing the prominence of E&P companies as competitors for executive talent.
In July 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed the companies constituting our two main comparator groups effective for 2018 executive compensation decisions, based on the criteria set forth above. At the time of its review, Schlumberger's full-year 2017 revenue was forecast to be approximately $30 billion. Applying the selection criteria set forth above, the Compensation Committee approved the removal of Apache Corporation from the oil industry peer group because it did not meet the revenue criterion described above. The Compensation Committee also approved the addition of Petrofac and TechnipFMC to this group based on the selection criteria set forth above, effective for 2018 compensation decisions.
As a result of the foregoing, Schlumberger was in the 71st percentile of the oil industry peer group in terms of revenue, and in the 95th percentile of the oil industry peer group in terms of market capitalization.
The following companies constitute the oil industry peer group effective for relevant 2018 compensation decisions:
Oil Industry Peer Group
Oil services, E&P, and integrated oil and gas companies with annual revenues between $5.7B and $103B
General Industry Peer Group
The Compensation Committee considers data from the general industry peer group as it deems necessary or advisable to the extent that data from the first peer group may not exist, or may be insufficient, for some executive officer positions. The second group is also particularly relevant for non-operations positions, where the skills and experience may be easily transferable to other industries outside the oil and gas industry.
The general industry peer group provides data from large companies with significant international operations, and supplements the compensation data from the oil industry peer group, whose companies are closer to Schlumberger in industry type but have widely varying revenue sizes. The general industry peer group:
In July 2017, the Compensation Committee, applying the selection criteria set forth above, approved the addition of 10 companies — Abbott, AbbVie, Eli Lily, Emerson Electric, Freeport-McMoRan, Gilead Sciences, HP, HP Enterprise, Medtronic and SAP — to the general industry peer group, effective for 2018 compensation decisions. Seven companies were removed from this peer group. The Compensation Committee approved the removal of Coca-Cola and Unilever because these companies did not meet the technology focus criterion above. Alphabet, Airbus, Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble were removed because they did not meet the revenue criteria described above.
As a result of the foregoing, Schlumberger was positioned at the 46th percentile of the general industry peer group in terms of revenue, and the 77th percentile of that peer group in terms of market capitalization.
The following companies constitute the general industry peer group effective for relevant 2018 compensation decisions:
General Industry Peer Group
Annual revenues between $13B and $62B with technical and global focus
Additional Peer Groups for Select Positions
The Compensation Committee refers to two additional executive compensation peer groups, which were effective for 2018 compensation decisions only as to our EVP Technology. These are:
These two additional peer groups serve as points of reference for the Compensation Committee, given the scope and level of responsibility of executive positions as to which the Compensation Committee requires additional compensation data. Prior to the introduction of these two peer groups, the Compensation Committee had determined that select executives who held very senior positions within the Company (including our EVP Technology) could, by virtue of their leadership experience and professional background at Schlumberger, become chief executives of other, smaller companies in the oil and gas industry.
The Compensation Committee applies the same selection criteria for companies comprising these two peer groups as for the main comparator groups; however, the global scope of international operations criteria does not apply to the lower-revenue oil industry peer group.
Lower-Revenue Oil Industry Peer Group
Among our NEOs, the lower-revenue oil industry peer group is relevant only for the compensation of our EVP Technology. In July 2017, the Compensation Committee decided to make no changes to the lower-revenue oil industry peer group, effective for 2018 compensation decisions.
As a result of the foregoing, the following companies constitute this peer group effective for relevant 2018 compensation decisions:
Smaller Oil Industry Companies Peer Group
Oil services, E&P, refining and pipeline companies with annual revenue between $0.9B and $8.9B
R&D Focused Peer Group — Similar R&D Expenditures
The R&D-focused peer group comprises large companies with significant international operations, some of which also are in our general industry peer group. While the 2016 consolidated revenue of these companies varied greatly, their R&D expenditures, at the median, approximated Schlumberger's R&D expenditures in that year. As with the lower-revenue oil industry peer group, this peer group is relevant only for the compensation of our EVP Technology.
In July 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed the criteria for the R&D-focused peer group. The Compensation Committee made substantial changes to this peer group, removing 21 companies from the list and adding 21 new companies. The 21 companies removed were 3M, Allergan, AT&T, Biogen, Broadcom Limited, Caterpillar, Dell EMC, Delphi Automotive, Exxon Mobil, Gilead Sciences, Harris Corporation, Honeywell International, HP Enterprise, Lockheed Martin, Medtronic, PepsiCo, Proctor & Gamble, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Rockwell Collins, Textron and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.
The following 50 companies constitute the R&D-focused peer group effective for relevant 2018 compensation decisions:
General Industry Peer Group Companies with R&D Focus
Median R&D expenses similar to Schlumberger's R&D expenses
Role of the Independent Executive Compensation Consultant
The Compensation Committee has retained Pay Governance as its independent consultant with respect to executive compensation matters. Pay Governance reports only to, and acts solely at the direction of, the Compensation Committee. Schlumberger's management does not direct or oversee the activities of Pay Governance with respect to the Company's executive compensation program. Pay Governance prepares compensation surveys for review by the Compensation Committee at its October meeting. One of the purposes of the October meeting is to assess compensation decisions made in January of that year in light of comparative data to date; another purpose of the October meeting is to prepare for the annual executive officer compensation review the following January.
Pay Governance works with the Company's executive compensation department to compare compensation opportunities of the Company's executive officers with compensation opportunities for comparable positions at companies included in the compensation surveys conducted by Pay Governance at the direction of the Compensation Committee. Pay Governance and the Company's executive compensation department also compile annual compensation data for each executive officer. The Compensation Committee has also instructed Pay Governance to prepare an analysis of each named executive officer's compensation. The Compensation Committee has also retained Pay Governance as an independent consulting firm with respect to non-employee director compensation matters. Pay Governance prepares an analysis of competitive non-employee director compensation levels and market trends using the same two main peer groups as those used in the executive compensation review.
The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Pay Governance pursuant to SEC rules and has concluded that its work did not raise any conflict of interest that would prevent Pay Governance from independently representing the Compensation Committee.
Procedure for Determining Executive Compensation; Role of Management
The Compensation Committee evaluates all elements of executive officer compensation each January, after a review of the achievement of financial and personal objectives with respect to the prior year's results. The purpose is to determine whether any changes in an officer's compensation may be appropriate. The CEO does not participate in the Compensation Committee's deliberations with regard to his own compensation. At the Compensation Committee's request, the CEO reviews with the Compensation Committee the performance of the other executive officers, but no other named executive officer has any input in executive compensation decisions. The Compensation Committee gives substantial weight to the CEO's evaluations and recommendations because he is particularly able to assess the other executive officers' performance and contributions to the Company. Our Vice President of Human of Resources assists the CEO in developing the executive officers' performance reviews and reviewing market compensation data to determine compensation recommendations for our executives. The Compensation Committee independently determines each executive officer's mix of total direct compensation based on the factors described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Other Aspects of our Executive Compensation Framework—Relative Size of Direct Compensation Elements." Early in the calendar year, financial and personal objectives for each executive officer are determined for that year. The Compensation Committee may, however, review and adjust compensation at other times as the result of new appointments or promotions during the year.
The following table summarizes the approximate timing of significant executive compensation events:
Long-Term Equity Awards — Granting Process
The Compensation Committee is responsible for granting long-term equity-based compensation under our omnibus stock incentive plans. The Compensation Committee approves a preliminary budget for equity-based grants for the following year at each October meeting. Management determines the allocation for groups within the Company and individual recommendations are made by the heads of the Groups and approved by the CEO. The Compensation Committee approves all equity-based awards, including executive officer awards, which are recommended by the CEO, except for his own. Awards for executive officers other than the CEO are granted by the Compensation Committee and discussed with the Board. Awards for the CEO are granted by the Compensation Committee following approval by the full Board.
In addition to considering the value of each equity-based award, management and the Compensation Committee also consider the overall potential stockholder dilution impact and "burn rate," which is the rate at which awards are granted as a percentage of common shares outstanding. Each year, the Compensation Committee reviews a budgeted grant date value of equity-based awards to our executives and other eligible employees and makes a recommendation to the Board for approval. This review and recommendation process includes an analysis of potential dilution levels and burn rates resulting from the potential grant of such awards. The Compensation Committee and management use this analysis regarding dilution levels and burn rates as an additional factor in approving long-term equity awards.
The regular Board and Compensation Committee meeting schedule is set at least a year in advance with Board meetings held quarterly, generally toward the end of January, April, July and October. The timing of these committee meetings is not determined by any of the Company's executive officers and is usually two days in advance of the Company's announcement of earnings. The Compensation Committee sets the equity award grant date as the day of the Board meeting. The Company does not time the release of material non-public information for the purpose of affecting the values of executive compensation. At the time equity grant decisions are made, the Compensation Committee is aware of the earnings results and takes them into account, but it does not adjust the size or the mix of grants to reflect possible market reaction.
Annual grants of equity-based awards to the NEOs, other stenior executive officers and the rest of the Company's eligible employees are made at the January meeting of the Compensation Committee. However, specific grants may be made at other regular meetings, to recognize the promotion of an employee, a change in responsibility or a specific achievement. The exercise price for all stock options granted to executive officers and other employees is the average of the high and low trading prices of the Schlumberger common stock on the NYSE on the date of grant, which has been Schlumberger's practice for many years. The Board and the Compensation Committee have the discretion to grant equity awards with different vesting schedules as they deem appropriate or necessary.
Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Compensation Committee and management believe strongly in linking executive long-term rewards to stockholder value. Our Board, upon recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Compensation Committee, adopted revised executive stock ownership guidelines in early 2019 applicable to executive officers and other key position holders.
Senior executives are required to hold the numbers of shares equal to the multiple of base salary set forth below.
All executives subject to the guidelines must retain 50% of net shares acquired upon the exercise of stock options and after the vesting of PSUs and RSUs, after payment of applicable taxes, until they achieve the required ownership level.
The guidelines provide that executives have five years to satisfy the ownership requirements. After the five-year period, executives who have not met their minimum stock ownership requirement must retain 100% of the net shares acquired upon stock option exercises and any PSU and RSU vesting until they achieve their required ownership level. Stock ownership for the purpose of these guidelines does not include shares underlying vested or unvested stock options, unvested RSUs or unvested PSUs.
As of January 31, 2019, all of our NEOs were in compliance with our stock ownership guidelines.
Other Executive Benefits and Policies
Retirement Benefits
In line with Schlumberger's aim to encourage long-term careers with the Company and to promote retention, retirement plans are provided, where possible, for all employees, including named executive officers, according to local market practice. Schlumberger considers long-term benefit plans to be an important element of the total compensation package. The pension plans provide for lifetime benefits for certain employees upon retirement after a specified number of years of service and take into account local practice with respect to retirement ages. They are designed to complement but not be a substitute for local government plans, which may vary considerably in terms of the replacement income they provide, and other Company sponsored savings plans. Employees may participate in multiple retirement plans in the course of their career with the Company or its subsidiaries, in which case they become entitled to a benefit from each plan based upon the benefits earned during the years of service related to each plan. The qualified plans are funded through cash contributions made by the Company and its subsidiaries based on actuarial valuations and/or regulatory requirements.
Some of the Schlumberger U.S. retirement plans are non-qualified plans that provide an eligible employee with additional retirement savings opportunities that cannot be achieved with tax-qualified plans due to limits on annual compensation that can be taken into account or annual benefits that can be provided under qualified plans.
Officers and other employees in the United States whose compensation exceeds the qualified plan limits are eligible to participate in non-qualified excess benefit programs for 401(k), profit-sharing and pension, whereby they receive correspondingly higher benefits. Employees and executive officers assigned outside the United States are entitled to participate in the applicable plans of the country where they are assigned, including supplemental plans where available.
Retirement Practices
The Company has a practice of phased retirement, which, at the discretion of the Company, may be offered to executive officers from time to time (other than the CEO) who are approaching retirement. This practice involves a transition into retirement whereby the individual ceases being an executive officer and relinquishes primary responsibilities. He or she remains an employee and generally receives lesser salary over time for reduced responsibilities and reduced working time. The arrangements are typically in place for an average of two to three years, as agreed at the start of the term. The purpose is to allow the outgoing executive officer to support the incoming executive officer for a period of time to provide for a smooth succession and to provide resources to the Company in particular areas of expertise while agreeing not to join a competitor during the employment period. In these circumstances, the Company maintains pension contributions and other benefits such as medical and insurance, and the executive officer continues to vest in previously-granted LTI awards. During this period, however, the executive officer is no longer eligible for additional equity incentive compensation or, once his or her work time is reduced, for an annual cash incentive opportunity.
Other Benefits
Schlumberger seeks to provide benefit plans, such as medical coverage and life and disability insurance, on a country-by-country basis in line with market conditions. Where the local practice is considered to be less than the Schlumberger minimum standard, the Company generally offers the Schlumberger standard. Our named executive officers are eligible for the same benefit plans provided to other employees, including medical coverage and life and disability insurance as well as supplemental plans chosen and paid for by employees who wish additional coverage. There are no special insurance plans for our named executive officers.
Limited Perquisites
Schlumberger provides only limited perquisites to its named executive officers, which are identified in the narrative notes to the Summary Compensation Table.
No Employment Agreements or Other Arrangements
Our named executive officers do not have employment, severance or change-in-control agreements, but serve at the will of the Board. This enables the Company to terminate their employment using judgment as to the terms of any severance arrangement and based on specific circumstances at the time they cease being executive officers.
Recoupment of Performance-Based Cash and Equity Awards (Clawback)
In January 2019, our Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, adopted a revised policy regarding recoupment of performance-based incentive compensation, whether paid in the form of equity or cash, in the event of specified restatements of financial results. Under the revised policy, if financial results are restated due to fraud or other intentional misconduct, the Compensation Committee will review any performance-based or incentive compensation paid to executive officers who are found to be personally responsible for the fraud or other intentional misconduct that caused, in whole or in part, the need for the restatement. Based on that review, the Committee will take such actions as it deems appropriate or necessary, including recoupment of any amounts paid in excess of the amounts that would have been paid based on the restated financial results. In addition, our performance-based equity awards and any shares of stock that are issued as a result of vesting of these awards are subject to recoupment under the terms of those awards.
Prohibition on Hedging or Pledging of Schlumberger Stock
Our directors and executive officers are prohibited from using any strategies or products (such as derivative securities or short-selling techniques) to hedge against the potential changes in the value of Schlumberger common stock. In addition, our directors and executive officers, and other key employees, are prohibited from holding Schlumberger securities in a margin account or pledging Schlumberger securities as collateral for a loan. Our insider trading policy strongly discourages, but does not prohibit, other employees from engaging in speculative transactions, including hedging or other financial mechanisms, holding Schlumberger securities in a margin account or pledging Schlumberger securities.
Impact of Tax Treatment
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the amount of compensation that may be deducted per covered employee to $1 million per taxable year. Following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, beginning with the 2018 calendar year, this $1 million annual deduction limitation applies to all compensation paid to any individual who is the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or one of the other three most highly compensated executive officers for 2017 or any subsequent calendar year. There is no longer any exception to this limitation for qualified performance-based compensation (as there was for periods prior to 2018). Thus, it is expected that compensation deductions for any covered individual will be subject to a $1 million annual deduction limitation (other than for certain compensation that satisfies requirements for grandfathering under the new law). Although the deductibility of compensation is a consideration evaluated by the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee believes that the lost deduction on compensation payable in excess of the $1 million limitation for the named executive officers is not material relative to the benefit of being able to attract and retain talented management. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee will continue to retain the discretion to pay compensation that is not deductible.
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with the Company's management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this proxy statement. Based on that review and discussion, the Compensation Committee has recommended to our Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

Pension Benefits for Fiscal Year 2018
Schlumberger maintains the following pension plans for its named executive officers and other employees, which provide for lifetime pensions upon retirement, based on years of service:
The following table and narrative disclosure set forth certain information with respect to pension benefits payable to the named executive officers.
Tax-Qualified Pension Plans
The SLB Pension Plan, the STC Pension Plan and the SLB USAB Pension Plan are all U.S. tax-qualified pension plans. The SLB Pension Plan and the STC Pension Plan have substantially identical terms. The SLB USAB Pension Plan, the material terms of which are described below, has similar, but not identical, terms. Employees may participate in any one of these plans in the course of their careers with Schlumberger, in which case they become entitled to a pension from each such plan based upon the benefits accrued during the years of service related to such plan. These plans are funded through cash contributions made by the Company and its subsidiaries based on actuarial valuations and regulatory requirements. Benefits under these plans are based on an employee's admissible compensation (generally base salary and cash incentive) for each year in which an employee participates in the plan, and the employee's length of service with Schlumberger.
Since January 1, 1989, the benefit earned under the SLB Pension Plan and the STC Pension Plan has been 1.5% of admissible compensation for service prior to the employee's completion of 15 years of active service and 2% of admissible compensation for service after completion of 15 years of active service. Since 2009, the benefit earned under the SLB USAB Pension Plan has been 3.5% of admissible compensation for all service. Normal retirement under these plans is at age 65; however, early retirement with a reduced benefit is possible at age 55 or as early as age 50 with 20 years of service. Additionally, under the "rule of 85," an employee or executive officer who terminates employment after age 55 and whose combined age and service is 85 or more, is eligible for retirement with an unreduced pension. Messrs. Ayat and Belani are eligible for retirement with an unreduced pension under the rule of 85. The benefits are usually paid as a lifetime annuity.
In 2004, we amended the SLB Pension Plan and the STC Pension Plan to generally provide that employees hired on or after October 1, 2004 would not be eligible to participate. Newly-hired employees are eligible to participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan, which provides a Company contribution, depending on an employee's 401(k) contribution and the profitability of the Company in a given year.
Schlumberger Supplementary Benefit Plans—Nonqualified Pension
The SLB Supplementary Plan and the STC Supplementary Plan each provide non-tax-qualified pension benefits. Each of these plans, which have substantially identical terms, provides an eligible employee with benefits equal to the benefits that the employee is unable to receive under the applicable qualified pension plan due to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), limits on (i) annual compensation that can be taken into account under qualified plans and (ii) annual benefits that can be provided under qualified plans.
The retirement age under nonqualified pension plans is the same as under the tax-qualified pension plans. These benefits are subject to forfeiture if the employee leaves the Company or its subsidiaries before the age of 50 with five years of service, engages in certain dishonest acts or has violated a confidentiality arrangement involving the Company or its affiliates. Messrs. Ayat and Belani are eligible for retirement with an unreduced pension under the rule of 85, described above. Nonqualified plan reduced benefits are paid to an employee upon separation from service, provided the employee has attained the age of 55, or if earlier, the age of 50 with 20 years of service. Payment is made as a joint and survivor annuity,if married; otherwise, payment is made as a life-only annuity. Payment to key employees is delayed six months following separation from service. These nonqualified plan benefits are payable in cash from the Company's general assets and are intended to qualify as "excess benefit plans" exempt from certain requirements of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
French Supplementary Pension Plan
Effective January 2006, the Company adopted the SLB French Supplementary Plan for exempt employees in France. The plan complements existing national plans and provides a pension beginning after age 60 when an employee retires from Schlumberger and is eligible for a French state pension under the current rules at the time of retirement. The benefit is equivalent to 1.5% of admissible compensation (generally base salary and cash incentive) above the earnings cap for fewer than 15 years of service and 2% of admissible compensation for more than 15 years of service. No employee contributions are required or permitted. The benefit is paid as a lifetime annuity. If an eligible employee were to leave the Company before the minimum age of 60 to receive his or her French pension, then the employee would not receive a benefit under the plan. If the eligible employee is terminated after age 55, is not subsequently employed and is otherwise entitled to a French pension, then the employee would receive a benefit under the plan. The Company does not grant and does not expect to grant extra years of credited service under the supplementary pension plans to its named executive officers.
International Staff Pension Plan
Recognizing the need to maintain a high degree of mobility for certain of the Company's employees who otherwise would be unable to accumulate any meaningful pension because they are required to work in many different countries, the Company maintains the SLB International Staff Pension Plan for such employees. All of the Company's named executive officers have either been in the SLB International Staff Plan at some time during their career prior to becoming an executive officer or are in the plan because of their current assignment. This plan provides for a lifetime annuity upon retirement based on a specified number of years of service. The plan is funded through cash contributions made by the Company or its subsidiaries, along with mandatory contributions by employees.
Prior to January 2010, benefits under this plan were based on a participant's admissible compensation (base salary, geographical or rotational coefficient, as applicable, and cash incentive) for each year in which the employee participated in the plan and the employee's length of service. The benefit earned up to December 31, 2009 is 2.4% of admissible compensation prior to completion of 15 years of service, and 3.2% of admissible compensation for each year of service after 15 years. Following the completion of 20 years of service, the benefit earned with respect to the first 15 years of service is increased to 3.2%. Benefits are payable upon normal retirement age, at or after age 55, or upon early retirement with a reduction, at or after age 50 with 20 years of service. Messrs. Ayat and Belani are eligible for normal retirement with no reduction.
Since January 1, 2010, the benefit earned has been equal to 3.5% of admissible compensation regardless of an employee's years of service. Benefits earned on or after this date are payable upon normal retirement age, at or after age 60, or upon early retirement with a reduction, at or after age 55.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2018
The following table and narrative disclosure set forth certain information with respect to nonqualified deferred compensation payable to the NEOs.
SLB Supplementary Benefit Plan—Non-Qualified Profit Sharing
The SLB Supplementary Plan provides certain non-tax-qualified defined contribution benefits for eligible employees, including named executive officers. Schlumberger Technology Corporation, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, maintains the STC Supplementary Plan with substantially identical terms.
The SLB Supplementary Plan and the STC Supplementary Plan provide an eligible employee with discretionary Company profit sharing contributions that are not permissible under the applicable tax-qualified plan due to Code limits on (1) annual compensation that can be taken into account under the qualified plan and (2) annual benefits that can be provided under the qualified plan. These nonqualified plan benefits are credited with earnings and losses as if they were invested in the qualified plan, with the same employee investment elections as the qualified plan. An employee forfeits all rights under the non-qualified plans if the employee terminates employment before completing four years of service, engages in certain dishonest acts or has violated a confidentiality arrangement involving the Company or its affiliates. These nonqualified plan benefits are paid in a lump-sum payment following the end of the year in which the employee terminates active service, or the employee can elect to receive payment in installments of five or ten years following the termination of service. If the employee dies before full payment of these benefits, the unpaid benefits are paid in a lump sum to the beneficiaries designated under the applicable qualified plan. Payment to key employees is delayed six months following separation from service.
SLB Restoration Savings Plan
The SLB Restoration Savings Plan, a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, provides certain defined contribution benefits for the named executive officers and other eligible employees. The SLB Restoration Savings Plan allows an eligible employee to defer compensation (and receive an associated employer match) that the employee cannot defer under the applicable tax-qualified plan because of Code limits on the amount of compensation that can be taken into account. Schlumberger Technology Corporation maintains the STC Restoration Savings Plan with substantially identical terms.
An eligible employee may elect in advance to defer a percentage (from 1% to 50%) of his or her compensation (generally base salary and cash incentive) over the Code annual compensation limits. The election cannot be changed during the year. The Company makes an annual matching contribution with respect to each employee's deferrals for a year, if the employee is still employed by the Company or an affiliate on the last day of the year. For employees who participate in a Schlumberger pension plan, the amount of the matching contribution is equal to one-half of the first 6% deferred by the employee in profitable years. For employees who do not participate in a Schlumberger pension plan, the matching contribution is 100% of the first 6% deferred by the employee. The match is made each payroll period and is not contingent on profitability of the Company. Employees' accounts are credited with earnings, calculated to mirror the earnings of the relevant funds under the Schlumberger Master Profit Sharing Trust as chosen by the employee. If the employee is eligible for the SLB Savings and Profit Sharing Plan, matching contributions and related earnings vest based on the employee's years of service, as follows:
If the employee is eligible for the SLB Savings and Profit Sharing Plan for U.S. Taxpayers Employed Abroad, matching contributions and related earnings vest based on the employee's years of service, as follows:
An employee's account fully vests on his or her death, his or her 60th birthday or plan termination. An employee's vested account balance is paid in a single lump sum (subject to tax withholding) following the participant's death, qualifying disability, retirement or other qualifying termination of employment or the employee can elect to receive payment in installments of five or ten years for contributions made after June 30, 2017, following the termination of employment. However, an employee forfeits all benefits under the plan if a determination is made that the employee has engaged in certain dishonest acts or violated a confidentiality arrangement involving Schlumberger or its affiliates. Payment to key employees is delayed six months following separation from service.
SLB International Staff Profit-Sharing Plan
Schlumberger maintains the SLB International Staff Profit-Sharing Plan, which provides for an annual employer contribution based on admissible compensation (base salary, geographical or rotational coefficient, as applicable, and cash incentive). Amounts allocated to the participants' accounts share in investment gains and/or losses of the trust fund and are generally distributed in a lump sum upon the satisfaction of certain conditions on termination of employment. Benefits earned under the SLB International Staff Profit-Sharing Plan will be forfeited upon a determination by the SLB International Staff Profit-Sharing Plan's administrator that the employee's separation from service was due to circumstances of fraud or misconduct detrimental to the Company, an affiliate or any customer.
Pay Ratio of CEO to Median Employee
The following information is a reasonable estimate of the annual total compensation of our employees as relates to the 2018 total compensation of our CEO. Based on the methodology described below, our CEO's 2018 total compensation was 216 times that of our median employee.
To calculate the ratio above, we used an employee in the same pay grade and in a similar position to the median employee that we had identified as of October 1, 2017. We believe there have been no changes in our employee population or our compensation arrangements in 2018 that would result in a material change in our pay ratio disclosure or our median employee. However, we did not use the same median employee for 2018 as we did in 2017, because the employee used in 2017 for our pay ratio disclosure was promoted.
As in 2017, our median employee was a full-time, salaried employee working in Colombia as a Field Engineer. We calculated all of the elements of that employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. We converted the compensation of the median employee using a blended exchange rate representing the average exchange rate from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018, resulting in an exchange rate of 2,969 Colombian Pesos to each U.S. dollar. The resulting annual total compensation or our median employee was $75,134. With respect to the 2018 total compensation of our CEO, we used $16,199,200, being the amount reported in the "Total" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control for Fiscal Year 2018
No Additional Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
Our named executive officers generally receive the same benefits as our other employees. As is the case with other compensation arrangements, any differences are generally due to local (country-specific) requirements. In line with this practice, our named executive officers do not have employment agreements, "golden parachutes" or change in control agreements. The Company's executive officers serve at the will of the Board, which enables the Company to terminate their employment using judgment as to the terms of any severance arrangement and based on specific circumstances at the time they cease being executive officers.
All employees who receive equity awards, including our NEOs, are subject to the same terms and conditions in the event of a termination or change in control, except for certain options that were assumed in connection with our acquisition of Cameron, none of which are held by the NEOs.
Phased Retirement
Schlumberger has a practice of phased retirement, which may be offered to executive officers (other than the CEO) approaching retirement, at the discretion of the Company. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Other Executive Benefits and Policies—Retirement Practices" on page 47.
Termination of Employment
Stock Options
This section summarizes the consequences for NEOs and other employees under our omnibus incentive plans and standard form of stock option award agreement in the event an option holder's employment terminates.
Notwithstanding the vesting and exercisability provisions described above, an option holder may forfeit his or her right to exercise stock options, and may have certain prior option exercises rescinded, if he or she engages in "detrimental activity" within one year after termination of employment (or five years after termination of employment in the event of retirement or disability).
If an option holder dies following termination of employment, but during the period in which he or she would otherwise be able to exercise the option, then the person entitled under the option holder's will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution will be entitled to exercise an outstanding option until the earlier of (i) 60 months following the date of his or her termination of employment or (ii) the expiration of the original term. Death following termination of employment will not result in any additional vesting, so that the option will be exercisable to the extent provided in the matrix above based on the circumstances of his or her termination of employment.
PSUs
This section summarizes the consequences for NEOs holding PSUs granted under the Company's 2010 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, 2013 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and 2017 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and subject to the Company's standard form of two-year PSU award or three-year PSU award, as applicable, in the event the PSU holder's employment terminates.
Three-Year PSUs
All PSUs awarded prior to January 1, 2016 are three-year PSUs, and are treated as follows upon the holder's termination of employment with the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the vesting date (i.e., the three-year anniversary of the grant date).
Three-year PSUs granted after January 1, 2016 are treated as follows upon the holder's termination of employment with the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the vesting date (i.e., the third anniversary of the grant date).
Two-Year PSUs
Two-year PSUs are treated as follows upon the holder's termination of employment with the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the conversion date (the second anniversary of the grant date, when PSUs are converted, if at all, into shares of restricted stock based on performance) or the vesting date (the first anniversary of the date that restricted shares are received following the conversion date).
For these purposes "retirement" is defined as termination of employment with the Company and its subsidiaries either at or after (i) age 60 and completion of at least 25 years of service with the Company and its subsidiaries or (ii) age of 55 and completion of at least 20 years of service with the Company and its subsidiaries subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee; "special retirement" is defined as termination of employment with the Company and its subsidiaries either at or after (i) age 55 or (ii) age 50 and completion of at least 10 years of service with the Company and all subsidiaries; and "disability" is defined as a disability (whether physical or mental impairment) which totally and permanently incapacitates the holder from any gainful employment in any field which the holder is suited by education, training, or experience, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
Change in Control
Stock Options
Pursuant to Schlumberger's omnibus incentive plans and standard form of stock option award agreement (other than awards issued under the 2010 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, the 2013 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and the 2017 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan), in the event of any reorganization, merger or consolidation wherein Schlumberger is not the surviving corporation, or upon the liquidation or dissolution of Schlumberger, all outstanding stock option awards will, unless alternate provisions are made by Schlumberger in connection with the reorganization, merger or consolidation for the assumption of such awards, become fully exercisable and vested, and all holders will be permitted to exercise their options for 30 days prior to the cancellation of the awards as of the effective date of such event. Under our 2010 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, our 2013 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and 2017 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee retains the discretion to adjust outstanding awards in the event of corporate transactions and outstanding options may be, but are not required to be, accelerated upon such a transaction.
The following table sets forth the intrinsic value of the unvested stock options held by each NEO as of December 31, 2018 that would become vested upon the occurrence of death, disability or a change in control in which Schlumberger is not the surviving entity and alternative provisions are not made for the assumption of awards, as described in the preceding paragraphs. Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon these events, any amounts actually paid or distributed may be different. Factors that could affect these amounts include the time during the year of any such event and the price of Schlumberger common stock.
If Schlumberger merges or consolidates with another entity and is the surviving entity, then a holder of stock options granted pursuant to Schlumberger's stock options plans will be entitled to receive, upon exercise or vesting, in lieu of the number of shares with respect to which the award is exercisable or vested, the number and class of shares of stock or other securities that the holder would have been entitled to receive under the terms of such merger or consolidation if, immediately prior to such event, such holder had been the holder of record of the number of shares of Schlumberger common stock equal to the number of shares as to which such award is then exercisable or vested.
PSUs and RSUs
Under our 2010 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, 2013 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and 2017 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, in the event of a merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation, spinoff, reorganization or liquidation, our Board may, in its sole discretion, (1) provide for the acceleration of the vesting of any awards, including RSUs and PSUs, or (2) decide to cancel any awards, including RSUs and PSUs, and deliver cash to the holders in an amount that our Board determines in its sole discretion is equal to the fair market value of such awards on the date of such event. However, no current agreement with respect to the RSUs and PSUs currently provides for any definitive special treatment upon such a merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation, spinoff, reorganization or liquidation.
The following table sets forth the value of the unvested RSUs and unvested PSUs at target held by each NEO at December 31, 2018 that would become vested upon the occurrence of a merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation, spinoff, reorganization or liquidation assuming that the Board elects to accelerate the vesting of RSUs and PSUs as provided in the previous paragraph. Due to the various factors that could affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon these events, any amounts actually paid or distributed may be different. Factors that could affect these amounts include the price of Schlumberger common stock and achievement by the Company of the relevant performance metric.
Retirement Plans
Schlumberger's pension plans and non-qualified deferred compensation plans include the same terms and conditions for all participating employees in the event of a termination or change in control. Other than the Schlumberger Restoration Savings Plan, none of Schlumberger's non-qualified plans provide for the accelerated payment of benefits upon a change in control. For more information on these plans, see the Pension Benefits for Fiscal Year 2018 table and accompanying narrative above and the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2018 table and accompanying narrative above.
The following table sets forth the amounts as of December 31, 2018 of benefit payments that would be accelerated under the Schlumberger Restoration Savings Plan upon a change in control.
Retiree Medical
Subject to satisfying certain age, service and contribution requirements, most U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a retiree medical program. Generally, this program provides comprehensive medical, prescription drug and vision benefits for retirees and their dependents until attaining age 65. Historically, for Schlumberger employees who turned age 40 prior to 2014, and excluding those employees who became Schlumberger employees as a result of the Smith acquisition, retiree medical benefits continue beyond age 65, at which time Medicare becomes primary and the Schlumberger plan becomes secondary, paying eligible charges after Medicare has paid. However, effective April 1, 2015, participants who reach age 65 no longer continue in Schlumberger medical coverage after reaching age 65, but instead receive a monthly contribution to a health reimbursement arrangement that can be used to purchase Medicare supplemental coverage and pay other tax-deductible expenses.
Director Compensation in Fiscal Year 2018
Our director compensation philosophy is to appropriately compensate our non-employee directors for the time, expertise and effort required to serve as a director of a large and complex global company and to align the interests of directors and long-term stockholders.
Annual payments are made after the non-employee directors are elected by stockholders. Non-employee directors who begin their Board or committee chair service other than at the annual meeting of stockholders receive a prorated amount of annual compensation. Directors who are employees of Schlumberger do not receive compensation for serving on the Board.
Director Pay Components
Non-employee directors receive an annual cash retainer of $115,000 plus an additional annual fee of $10,000 for membership on a committee. The chair of each committee receives an additional annual fee of $20,000 in lieu of the additional annual fee of $10,000 for committee membership. Mr. Currie earns an additional $50,000 annually, reflecting his additional responsibilities as the Board's lead independent director. Additionally, Schlumberger's practice is to grant each newly-appointed or elected non-employee director (including non-employee directors re-elected at the annual general meeting) shares of Schlumberger common stock valued at approximately $190,000 each April. Effective May 1, 2018, Schlumberger granted each such non-employee director 2,771 shares of Schlumberger common stock.
2018 Director Pay Review
Our Compensation Committee annually reviews and periodically recommends updates to our non-employee director compensation program to our Board for approval. The Committee's recommendation takes into account our director compensation philosophy, changes in market practices, and consultation with the Committee's independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance. In 2018, the Committee reviewed non-employee director compensation taking into account multiple factors including director pay practices at publicly-traded companies and continued expansion of director and independent committee chair responsibilities. Based on that review, and in light of the 2017 increase in non-employee director compensation, the Committee determined that no changes in non-employee director compensation were necessary for 2018.
Director Deferral Plan
Non-employee directors may elect to defer all or a portion of their annual stock or cash awards through the Schlumberger 2004 Stock and Deferral Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Directors Stock Plan").When directors elect to defer their stock award, their deferred compensation account is credited with a number of "stock units." Each stock unit is equal in value to a share of our common stock but because it is not an actual share of our common stock it does not have any voting rights. When directors elect to defer their cash award, they may choose to invest such deferred cash compensation into either (i) Schlumberger Common Stock, (ii) money market equivalents, or (iii) a S&P 500 equivalent. Deferrals into a stock account are credited with dividend equivalents in the form of cash to be paid at the time of vesting and deferrals into the cash account are credited with gains or losses based on the monthly performance of the various investment options described above. Following retirement from our Board and depending on the director's election, a non-employee director may receive the deferred compensation on the date of the director's retirement or a date that is one year following the date of the director's retirement.
Although our Directors Stock Plan provides that annual stock awards to non-employee directors may be in the form of shares of common stock, shares of restricted common stock or restricted stock units, our practice has been to issue only shares of common stock. Our directors have never received restricted common stock or restricted stock units as director compensation.
The following table provides information on the compensation paid to our non-employee directors in 2018.
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Board believes that ownership of Schlumberger stock by Board members aligns their interests with the interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, the Board has established a guideline that each non-employee Board member must, within five years of joining the Board, own at least 10,000 shares of Schlumberger common stock. As of December 31, 2018, each of our non-employee director nominees who have been Board members for at least five years is in compliance with these stock ownership guidelines.
Equity Compensation Plan Information
The table below sets forth the following information as of December 31, 2018 for all equity compensation plans approved and not approved by our stockholders.
Equity compensation plans approved by Schlumberger stockholders include the 2017 Schlumberger Omnibus Incentive Plan; the 2013 Schlumberger Omnibus Incentive Plan; the 2010 Schlumberger Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan; the French Sub Plan under the 2010 Schlumberger Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, as amended; the Schlumberger Discounted Stock Purchase Plan, as amended; the Schlumberger 2004 Stock and Deferral Plan for Non-Employee Directors, as amended; the Schlumberger 2008 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended; the Schlumberger 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended; the Schlumberger 2001 Stock Option Plan, as amended; and the Schlumberger 1998 Stock Option Plan, as amended.

The Audit Committee also discussed with Company management and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP the evaluation of the Company's reporting and internal controls undertaken in connection with certifications made by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in the Company's periodic SEC filings pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.The Audit Committee also reviewed and discussed such other matters as it deemed appropriate, including the Company's compliance with Section 404 and other relevant provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules adopted or proposed to be adopted by the SEC and the NYSE. The Audit Committee also reviewed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP the matters required to be discussed by the independent registered public accounting firm with the Audit Committee under applicable rules adopted by the PCAOB.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP provided the Audit Committee with the required PCAOB disclosures and letters concerning its independence with respect to the Company, and the Committee discussed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's independence with them.

SUBMITTED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE SCHLUMBERGER BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Proposal
We are requesting that our stockholders vote in favor of approving an amendment and restatement of the Schlumberger Limited 2004 Stock and Deferral Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Plan"), which would:
Our Board approved the proposed amendment and restatement of the Plan on January 17, 2019; however, the increase in shares available under the Plan is subject to stockholder approval. No other substantive changes are being made to the Plan.
Our Board and our stockholders originally approved the Plan in 2004. In 2007, we amended and restated the Plan to allow non-employee directors to defer the receipt of cash compensation, and to make other administrative changes. The Plan was further amended on January 1, 2009 to make further administrative and compliance changes. In 2012, we amended and restated the Plan to increase the number of shares available under the Plan and to increase the limit on annual awards that may be granted to individual directors. The following summary of the material features of the Plan is subject to the specific provisions contained in the full text of the Plan set forth as Appendix B. The specific amendments proposed to be made to the Plan are marked within Appendix B.
The Purpose of the Plan
The Plan is intended to:
Administration
The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee"), as designated by our Board. The Committee has full and exclusive power and authority to:
The Committee may delegate duties under the Plan to the Chief Executive Officer and other senior officers of Schlumberger, other than its granting authority.
Key Terms
The following is a summary of the key provisions of the Plan.
Material Tax Consequences
The following discussion describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to non-employee directors with respect to awards granted under the Plan. This summary is based on statutory provisions, Treasury regulations, judicial decisions and rulings of the Internal Revenue Service in effect on the date hereof. This summary does not describe any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences.
In general, a non-employee director will recognize ordinary compensation income as a result of the receipt of common stock pursuant to a stock award in an amount equal to the fair market value of the common stock when such stock is received. Upon the disposition of the common stock acquired pursuant to a stock award, the non-employee director will recognize a capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the sale price of the common stock and the non-employee director's tax basis in the common stock. This capital gain or loss will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for more than one year. For this purpose, the holding period begins on the day after the shares of common stock are received by the non-employee director.
A non-employee director will not have U.S. taxable income upon the grant of a stock award in the form of units denominated in common stock but rather will generally recognize ordinary compensation income at the time the non-employee director receives shares of common stock or cash in satisfaction of such stock unit award in an amount equal to the fair market value of the common stock or cash received.
For compensation attributable to services, Code Section 457A requires that any compensation paid under a deferred compensation plan of a nonqualified entity must be included in the service provider's income at the time such amounts are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. Accordingly, because non-employee directors are always vested in the amounts deferred under the Plan, if Schlumberger is a nonqualified entity and the compensation is not otherwise excludible from Section 457A, stock or cash compensation deferred by non-employee directors who are U.S. citizens or residents in accordance with the procedures established under the Plan will be included in U.S. income by the non-employee director in the year for which the compensation is earned despite a timely election to defer receipt of such compensation.
Dividends paid on shares of outstanding common stock held by a non-employee director will be taxed as dividend income. Cash payments of dividend equivalents with respect to stock units under the Plan will be subject to taxation as ordinary compensation income when received by the non-employee director.
To the extent allowable by relevant laws and regulations, we may be entitled to a deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes that corresponds as to timing and amount with the compensation income recognized by the participant under the foregoing rules. No deduction will be available on any dividends which are paid on outstanding shares of stock and taxable as dividend income to the recipient.
Unless otherwise required by applicable laws or regulations, Schlumberger will not withhold or otherwise pay on behalf of any non-employee director any taxes arising in connection with an award under this Plan. The payment of any such taxes will be the sole responsibility of each non-employee director. We, however, have the authority to satisfy any withholding obligations from funds or shares of common stock deliverable pursuant to the Plan or other cash compensation due a participant, if applicable.
Plan Benefits
No awards under the Plan have been made contingent on approval of the amendment and restatement of the Plan. If the amendment and restatement of the Plan is approved, we expect to continue to make annual grants of awards to non-employee directors as described above under "Director Compensation in Fiscal Year 2018" beginning on page 62, subject to the limitations set forth in the Plan and to periodic adjustments based on the Committee's review of director compensation from time to time in its discretion.
Required Vote
A majority of the votes cast is required to approve this Item 5. Brokers do not have discretion to vote on this proposal without your instruction. If you do not instruct your broker how to vote on this proposal, your broker will deliver a non-vote on this proposal. For Item 5, abstentions are counted in the denominator for determining the total votes cast.
Stock Ownership Information
Security Ownership by Certain Beneficial Owners
The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2018 (except as otherwise noted) with respect to persons known by us to be the beneficial owners of more than 5% of our common stock, based solely on the information reported by such persons in their Schedule 13D and 13G filings with the SEC.
For each entity included in the table below, percentage ownership is calculated by dividing the number of shares reported as beneficially owned by such entity by the 1,386,229,439 shares of our common stock outstanding on January 31, 2019.
BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK
Security Ownership by Management
The following table sets forth information known to Schlumberger with respect to beneficial ownership of the Company's common stock as of January 31, 2019 by (i) each director and director nominee, (ii) each of the named executive officers and (iii) all directors and executive officers as a group.
Beneficial ownership is determined under the rules of the SEC and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities. Except as indicated in the footnotes to the table below and subject to applicable community property laws, to Schlumberger's knowledge the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to the securities listed. None of the shares are subject to any pledge.
The number of shares beneficially owned by each person or group as of January 31, 2019 includes shares of common stock that such person or group has the right to acquire within 60 days of January 31, 2019, including upon the exercise of options to purchase common stock or the vesting of RSUs or PSUs. References to options in the footnotes to the table below include only options outstanding as of January 31, 2019 that are currently exercisable or that become exercisable within 60 days of January 31, 2019. References to any restricted stock, RSUs or PSUs (collectively, "restricted stock") in the footnotes to the table below include only restricted stock outstanding as of January 31, 2019 and that are currently vested or that vest within 60 days of January 31, 2019.
For each individual and group included in the table below, percentage ownership is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person or group by the sum of the 1,386,229,439 shares of common stock outstanding on January 31, 2019, plus the number of shares of common stock that such person or group had the right to acquire on or within 60 days after January 31, 2019.
As of January 31, 2019, no director, director nominee or named executive officer owned more than 1% of the outstanding shares of Schlumberger's common stock. All directors and executive officers as a group owned less than 1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of January 31, 2019.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), requires our executive officers and directors, among others, to file an initial report of ownership of Schlumberger common stock on Form 3 and reports of changes in ownership on Form 4 or Form 5. Persons subject to Section 16 are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they file. The Company believes, based solely on a review of the copies of such forms in its possession and on written representations from reporting persons, that three transactions required to be filed under Section 16(a) were not timely filed during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. One Form 4 required to be filed by Mr. Ayat relating to a sale of shares was not timely filed, but was filed on October 30, 2018. One Form 4 required to be filed by Mr. Poupeau relating to a gift of shares was not timely filed, but was filed on September 13, 2018. Finally, one Form 4 required to be filed by Mr. Marks relating to a purchase of shares was not timely filed, but was filed on December 3, 2018.

Appendix A
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to financial results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), our 2019 proxy statement includes non-GAAP financial measures (as defined under the SEC's Regulation G). Net income, excluding charges and credits, and earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, are non-GAAP financial measures. The following is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures. Management believes that the exclusion of charges and credits from these financial measures enables it to evaluate more effectively Schlumberger's operations period-over-period and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked by the excluded items. These measures are also used by management in determining certain incentive compensation.
The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, SPM investments and multiclient seismic data costs capitalized. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of the ability of our business to generate cash. Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the Company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.
