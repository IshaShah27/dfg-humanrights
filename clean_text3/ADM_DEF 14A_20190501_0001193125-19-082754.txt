General Information About the Annual Meeting and Voting 
Proxy Statement 
GENERAL MATTERS 
The Board of Directors asks that you complete the accompanying proxy for the annual stockholders' meeting. The meeting will be held at the time, place, and location mentioned in the Notice of Annual Meeting included in these materials. We will be using the "Notice and Access" method of providing proxy materials to stockholders via the internet. We will mail to our stockholders (other than those described below) a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions on how to access our proxy statement and the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and how to vote electronically via the internet. This notice will also contain instructions on how to request a paper copy of the proxy materials. Stockholders holding shares through the ADM 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan for Salaried Employees (the "401(k) and ESOP") and those stockholders who previously have opted out of participation in notice and access procedures will receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail or an electronic copy of the proxy materials by email. We are first providing our stockholders with notice and access to, or first mailing or emailing, this proxy statement and a proxy form around March 22, 2019. 
We pay the costs of soliciting proxies from our stockholders. We have retained Georgeson LLC to help us solicit proxies. We will pay Georgeson LLC a base shareholder meeting services fee of approximately $24,000 plus reasonable project management fees and expenses for its services. Our employees or employees of Georgeson LLC may also solicit proxies in person or by telephone, mail, or the internet at a cost which we expect will be nominal. We will reimburse brokerage firms and other securities custodians for their reasonable fees and expenses in forwarding proxy materials to their principals. 
We have a policy of keeping confidential all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders. Such documents are available for examination only by the inspectors of election, our transfer agent, and certain employees associated with processing proxy cards and tabulating the vote. We will not disclose any stockholder's vote except in a contested proxy solicitation or as may be necessary to meet legal requirements. 
Our common stockholders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2019, are the only people entitled to notice of the annual meeting and to vote at the meeting. At the close of business on March 11, 2019, we had 560,090,583 outstanding shares of common stock, each share being entitled to one vote on each of the director nominees and on each of the other matters to be voted on at the meeting. Our stockholders and advisors to our company are the only people entitled to attend the annual meeting. We reserve the right to direct stockholder representatives with the proper documentation to an alternative room to observe the meeting. 
All stockholders will need a form of photo identification to attend the annual meeting. If you are a stockholder of record that received a paper copy of the proxy materials and plan to attend, please detach the admission ticket from the top of your proxy card and bring it with you to the meeting. The number of people we will admit to the meeting will be determined by how the shares are registered, as indicated on the admission ticket. If you are either a stockholder whose shares are held by a broker, bank, or other nominee or a stockholder of record that did not receive a paper copy of the proxy materials, please request an admission ticket by writing to our office at Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Investor Relations, 4666 Faries Parkway, Decatur, Illinois 62526-5666. Your letter to our office must include evidence of your stock ownership. If you are not a stockholder of record, you can obtain evidence of ownership from your broker, bank, or nominee. The number of tickets that we send will be determined by the manner in which shares are registered. If your request is received by April 15, 2019, an admission ticket will be mailed to you. Entities such as a corporation or limited liability company that are stockholders may send one representative to the annual meeting, and the representative should have a pre-existing relationship with the entity represented. All other admission tickets can be obtained at the registration table located at the James R. Randall Research Center lobby beginning at 7:30 A.M. on the day of the meeting. Stockholders who do not pre-register will be admitted to the meeting only upon verification of stock ownership. 
General Information About the Annual Meeting and Voting 
Principal Holders of Voting Securities 
The use of cameras, video or audio recorders, or other recording devices in the James R. Randall Research Center is prohibited. The display of posters, signs, banners, or any other type of signage by any stockholder in the James R. Randall Research Center is also prohibited. Firearms are also prohibited in the James R. Randall Research Center. 
Any request to deviate from the admittance guidelines described above must be in writing, addressed to our office at Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Attention: Secretary, 77 West Wacker Drive, Suite 4600, Chicago, Illinois 60601, and received by us by April 15, 2019. We will also have personnel in the lobby of the James R. Randall Research Center beginning at 7:30 A.M. on the day of the meeting to consider special requests. 
If you properly execute the enclosed proxy form, your shares will be voted at the meeting. You may revoke your proxy form at any time prior to voting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  delivering written notice of revocation to our Secretary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  delivering to our Secretary a new proxy form bearing a date later than your previous proxy; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  attending the meeting and voting in person (attendance at the meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy).   
[END TABLE]
Under our bylaws, stockholders elect our directors by a majority vote in an uncontested election (one in which the number of nominees is the same as the number of directors to be elected) and by a plurality vote in a contested election (one in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected). Because this year's election is an uncontested election, each director nominee receiving a majority of votes cast will be elected (the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that nominee). Approval of each other proposal presented in the proxy statement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on that matter. Shares not present at the meeting and shares voting "abstain" have no effect on the election of directors. For the other proposals to be voted on at the meeting, abstentions are treated as shares present or represented and voting, and therefore have the same effect as negative votes. Broker non-votes (shares held by brokers who do not have discretionary authority to vote on the matter and have not received voting instructions from their clients) are counted toward a quorum, but are not counted for any purpose in determining whether a matter has been approved.

Proposal No. 1 
Proposal No. 1 — Election of Directors for a One-Year Term 
The Board of Directors has fixed the size of the current board at twelve. Eleven of the twelve nominees proposed for election to the Board of Directors are currently members of the Board and have been elected previously by our stockholders. The new nominee for election is Lei Z. Schlitz. Dr. Schlitz was identified by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee as a potential nominee, with assistance from a third-party search firm retained to identify director candidates, and was recommended by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee after it completed its interview and vetting process. Daniel T. Shih, a current member of the Board, has determined not to stand for re-election. As of March 11, 2019, Mr. Shih beneficially owned 19,989 shares of our common stock, all of which consisted of stock units allocated under our Stock Unit Plan for Nonemployee Directors (the "Stock Unit Plan"). Unless you provide different directions, we intend for board-solicited proxies (like this one) to be voted for the nominees named below. 
If elected, the nominees would hold office until the next annual stockholders' meeting and until their successors are elected and qualified. If any nominee for director becomes unable to serve as a director, the persons named as proxies may vote for a substitute who will be designated by the Board of Directors. Alternatively, the Board of Directors could reduce the size of the board. The Board has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable to serve as a director. 
Our bylaws require that each director be elected by a majority of votes cast with respect to that director in an uncontested election (where the number of nominees is the same as the number of directors to be elected). In a contested election (where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected), the plurality voting standard governs the election of directors. Under the plurality standard, the number of nominees equal to the number of directors to be elected who receive more votes than the other nominees are elected to the Board, regardless of whether they receive a majority of the votes cast. Whether an election is contested or not is determined as of the day before we first mail our meeting notice to stockholders. This year's election was determined to be an uncontested election, and the majority vote standard will apply. If a nominee who is serving as a director is not elected at the annual meeting, Delaware law provides that the director would continue to serve on the Board as a "holdover director." However, under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, each director annually submits an advance, contingent, irrevocable resignation that the Board may accept if the director fails to be elected through a majority vote in an uncontested election. In that situation, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee would make a recommendation to the Board about whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board will act on the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days after the date the election results are certified. The Board will nominate for election or re-election as director, and will elect as directors to fill vacancies and new directorships, only candidates who agree to tender the form of resignation described above. If a nominee who was not already serving as a director fails to receive a majority of votes cast at the annual meeting, Delaware law provides that the nominee does not serve on the Board as a "holdover director." 
The information below describes the nominees, their ages, positions with our company, principal occupations, current directorships of other publicly owned companies, directorships of other publicly owned companies held within the past five years, the year in which each first was elected as a director, and the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned as of March 11, 2019, directly or indirectly. Unless otherwise indicated, and subject to community property laws where applicable, we believe that each nominee named in the table below has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated as beneficially owned. Unless otherwise indicated, all of the nominees have been executive officers of their respective companies or employed as otherwise specified below for at least the last five years. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the election of the twelve nominees named below as directors. Proxies solicited by the Board will be so voted unless stockholders specify a different choice.

DIRECTOR EXPERIENCES, QUALIFICATIONS, ATTRIBUTES, AND SKILLS; BOARD DIVERSITY 
In assessing an individual's qualifications to become a member of the Board, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee may consider various factors including education, experience, judgment, independence, integrity, availability, and other factors that the Committee deems appropriate. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee strives to recommend candidates that complement the current board members and other proposed nominees so as to further the objective of having a board that reflects a diversity of background and experience with the necessary skills to effectively perform the functions of the Board and its committees. In addition, the Committee considers personal characteristics of nominees and current board members, including race, gender, and geographic origin, in an effort to obtain a diversity of perspectives on the Board. 
The specific experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills that qualify each of our directors to serve on the Board are described in the biographies above and in the Proxy Summary under "Director Nominee Qualifications and Experience" on pages 8 – 11 and "Director Nominee Diversity, Age, Tenure, and Independence" on page 4. 
DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS FROM STOCKHOLDERS 
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will consider nominees recommended by a stockholder, provided that the stockholder submits the nominee's name in a written notice delivered to our Secretary at our principal executive offices not less than 60 nor more than 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual stockholders' meeting. However, if the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, the notice must be received at our principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made (whichever first occurs). Different notice delivery requirements may apply if the number of directors to be elected at an annual meeting is being increased, and we do not make a public announcement naming all of the nominees or specifying the size of the increased board at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. Any notice of a stockholder nomination must set forth the information required by Section 1.4(c) of our bylaws, and must be accompanied by a written consent from the proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected, and a written statement from the proposed nominee as to whether he or she intends, if elected, to tender the advance, contingent, irrevocable resignation that would become effective should the individual fail to receive the required vote for re-election at the next meeting of stockholders. Stockholders may also have the opportunity to include nominees in our proxy statement by complying with the requirements set forth in Section 1.15 of our bylaws. All candidates, regardless of the source of their recommendation, are evaluated using the same criteria. 
Board Leadership and Oversight 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our company's Board of Directors does not have a current requirement that the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board be either combined or separated, because the Board believes it is in the best interest of our company to make this determination based on the position and direction of the company and the constitution of the Board and management team. The Board regularly evaluates whether the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board should be combined or separated. The Board's implementation of a careful and seamless succession plan over the past several years demonstrates that the Board takes seriously its responsibilities under the Corporate Governance Guidelines to determine who should serve as Chairman at any point in time in light of the specific circumstances facing our company. After careful consideration, the Board has determined that having Mr. Luciano, our company's Chief Executive Officer, serve as Chairman is in the best interest of our stockholders at this time. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day-to-day management of our company and the development and implementation of our company's strategy, and has access to the people, information, and resources necessary to facilitate board function. Therefore, the Board believes at this time that combining the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman contributes to an efficient and effective board. 
The independent directors elect a Lead Director at the Board's annual meeting. Mr. Felsinger is currently serving as Lead Director. The Board believes that having an independent Lead Director provides the Board with independent leadership and facilitates the independence of the Board from management. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee regularly evaluates the responsibilities of the Lead Director and considers current trends regarding independent board leadership. In the last few years, the Board has enhanced the Lead Director's responsibilities, as set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, in connection with determining performance criteria for evaluating the Chief Executive Officer, evaluating the Board, committees, and individual directors, and planning for management succession. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines as so revised, the Lead Director: (i) presides at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors, and regularly meets with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for discussion of appropriate matters arising from these sessions; (ii) coordinates the activities of the other independent directors and serves as liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors; (iii) consults with the Chairman and approves all meeting agendas, schedules, and information provided to the Board, and may, from time to time, invite corporate officers, other employees, and advisors to attend Board or committee meetings whenever deemed appropriate; (iv) interviews, along with the Chairman and the Chair and members of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, all director candidates and makes recommendations to the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee; (v) advises the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee on the selection of members of the board committees; (vi) advises the board committees on the selection of committee chairs; (vii) works with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to propose a schedule of major discussion items for the Board; (viii) guides the Board's governance processes; (ix) provides leadership to the Board if circumstances arise in which the role of the Chairman or Chief Executive Officer may be, or may be perceived to be, in conflict; (x) has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors; (xi) if requested by major stockholders, ensures that he or she is available for consultation and direct communication; (xii) leads the non-management directors in determining performance criteria for evaluating the Chief Executive Officer and coordinates the annual performance review of the Chief Executive Officer; (xiii) works with the Chair of the Compensation/Succession Committee to guide the Board's discussion of management succession plans; (xiv) works with the Chair and members of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee to facilitate the evaluation of the performance of the Board, committees, and individual directors; (xv) works with the Chair and members of the Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee to set sustainability and corporate responsibility objectives; and (xvi) performs such other duties and responsibilities as the Board may determine. 
In addition to electing a Lead Director, our independent directors facilitate the Board's independence by meeting frequently as a group and fostering a climate of transparent communication. The high level of contact between our Lead Director and our Chairman between board meetings and the specificity contained in the Board's delegation of authority parameters also serve to foster effective board leadership. 
Board Leadership and Oversight 
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
Management is responsible for day-to-day risk assessment and mitigation activities, and our company's Board of Directors is responsible for risk oversight, focusing on our company's overall risk management strategy, our company's degree of tolerance for risk, and the steps management is taking to manage our company's risks. While the Board as a whole maintains the ultimate oversight responsibility for risk management, the committees of the Board can be assigned responsibility for risk management oversight of specific areas. The Audit Committee currently maintains responsibility for overseeing our company's enterprise risk management process and regularly discusses our company's major risk exposures, the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, and guidelines and policies to govern our company's risk assessment and risk management processes. The Audit Committee periodically reports to the Board of Directors regarding significant matters identified with respect to the foregoing. 
Management has established an Enterprise Risk Management Committee consisting of a Chief Risk Officer and personnel representing multiple functional and regional areas within our company, with broad oversight of the risk management process.

Board Leadership and Oversight 
Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility 
Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility 
Our commitment to change and growth goes beyond our products and services. At ADM, sustainable practices and a focus on environmental responsibility aren't separate from our primary business: they are integral to the work we do every day to serve customers and create value for stockholders. We have aligned our efforts with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals which serve as a road map to achieve a better future for all. Specifically, we are focusing our efforts toward Zero Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, Climate Action, and Life On Land. 
Our sustainability efforts are led by our Chief Sustainability Officer who is supported by a Sustainability Council comprised of ADM Executive Committee members. Sustainability-related risks are reviewed quarterly through the Enterprise Risk Management process. Our company's Board of Directors has approved the creation of a Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee. This new committee will have oversight of sustainability and corporate responsibility matters. Sustainability topics are also presented to the full Board annually. 
The RobecoSAM Sustainability Yearbook 2018 named ADM as an Industry Mover in recognition of ADM's focus on sustainable practices and environmental responsibility. See the table below for additional information and highlights related to our sustainability efforts.

Board Role in Overseeing Political Activities 
The Board of Directors believes that participation in the political process is important to our business. We and our political action committee (ADMPAC) therefore support candidates for political office and organizations that share our pro-growth vision, our aspirations for the future of global agriculture, and our commitment to the people who depend on it for their lives and livelihoods. Decisions to support particular candidates and/or organizations are subject to fixed policies and determined by the company's best interests, not the personal political preferences of our company's executives. ADMPAC submits to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) regular, detailed reports on all federal political contributions, which reports are available to the public on the FEC's website. Similarly, contributions to state candidates are disclosed to relevant state authorities and typically disclosed on individual states' websites. 
In addition to our contributions to individual candidates for public office and candidate committees, we also support a small number of so-called "527" groups, including the Democratic Governors Association, the Republican Governors Association, Ag America, and the Republican State Leadership Committee. We have not supported independent political expenditures or 501(c)(4) organizations. Finally, we have memberships in several industry, trade, and business associations representing agriculture and the business community. If a trade association engages in political activity, the amount of dues associated with this political advocacy is reported in our quarterly LD2 filings. 
We engage in a centralized, deliberative process when making decisions about the company's political participation to ensure that it complies with all applicable laws and makes appropriate disclosures. Contributions of greater than $1,000 typically require the approval of the board of directors of ADMPAC, a political action committee funded by our employees' voluntary contributions. The ADMPAC board of directors is chaired by the vice president of state government relations and composed of employees who represent various areas of the company. Contributions of less than $1,000 may be authorized by the company's vice president of government relations and vice president of state government relations. 
The Board of Directors provides oversight of ADMPAC's and the company's political activities, political contributions, and compliance with relevant laws. At each quarterly board meeting, ADM management provides the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee with a detailed report on our political contributions in the previous quarter. Any member of the Board may obtain further detailed information concerning political contributions, trade associations, compliance with federal and state laws, or any other related topic. 
For more information on ADM's political policies and activities, please see https://www.adm.com/our-company/us-political-contributions.
Director Evaluations; Section 16(a) Reporting Compliance 
Board, Committee, and Director Evaluations 
The Board believes that a robust annual evaluation process is a critical part of its governance practices. Accordingly, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee oversees an annual evaluation of the performance of the Board of Directors, each committee of the Board, and each individual director. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee approves written evaluation questionnaires which are distributed to each director. The results of each written evaluation are provided to, and compiled by, an outside firm. Individual directors are evaluated by their peers in a confidential process. Our Lead Director works with the Chair and members of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee to facilitate the evaluation of the performance of the Board, committees, and individual directors, and delivers and discusses individual evaluation results with each director. The chair of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee delivers and discusses the Lead Director's individual evaluation with him or her. Results of the performance evaluations of the committees and the Board are discussed at appropriate committee meetings and with the full board. 
The Board utilizes the results of these evaluations in making decisions on board agendas, board structure, committee responsibilities and agendas, and continued service of individual directors on the board. 
Evaluation Questionnaires are distributed Outside firm collects results Results are delivered and discussed with each director Other evaluations are discussed at committee meetings and With the full board 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") requires our directors and executive officers to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4, and 5 with the SEC. Based on our review of Forms 3, 4, and 5 that we have received from, or have filed on behalf of, our directors and executive officers, and on written representations from those persons that they were not required to file a Form 5, we believe that, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, our directors and executive officers complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.

Corporate Governance Guidelines 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that govern the structure and functioning of the Board and set forth the Board's policies on governance issues. The guidelines, along with the written charters of each of the committees of the Board and our bylaws, are posted on our website, www.adm.com, and are available free of charge upon written request to Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Attention: Secretary, 77 West Wacker Drive, Suite 4600, Chicago, Illinois 60601. 
Independent Executive Sessions 
In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the non-management directors meet in executive session at least quarterly. If the non-management directors include any directors who are not independent pursuant to the Board's determination of independence, at least one executive session each year includes only independent directors. The Lead Director, or in his or her absence, the chairman of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, presides at such meetings of independent directors. The non-management directors met in independent executive session four times during fiscal year 2018. 
Information Concerning Committees and Meetings 
Board Meetings and Attendance at Annual Meetings of Stockholders 
During the last fiscal year, the Board of Directors held twelve meetings. All incumbent directors attended 75% or more of the combined total meetings of the Board and the committees on which they served during such period. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that all directors standing for election are expected to attend the annual meeting of stockholders. All director nominees standing for election at our last annual stockholders' meeting held on May 3, 2018, attended that meeting. 
Information Concerning Committees and Meetings 
The Board's standing committees for the year ended December 31, 2018, consisted of the Audit, Compensation/Succession, Nominating/Corporate Governance, and Executive Committees. In February 2019, the Board approved the establishment of a Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee, which will have oversight responsibility for sustainability and corporate responsibility matters. Each committee operates pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Board (except for the Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee, for which the Board has not yet adopted a written charter), available on our website, www.adm.com. Upon adoption by the Board, the written charter for the Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee will also be available on our website. 
The Audit Committee consists of Mr. Crews (Chairman), Mr. Dufour, Mr. Moore, Mr. Sanchez, and Ms. Sandler. The Audit Committee met nine times during the most recent fiscal year. All of the members of the Audit Committee were determined by the Board to be independent directors, as that term is defined in our bylaws, in the NYSE listing standards, and in Section 10A of the Exchange Act. No director may serve as a member of the Audit Committee if such director serves on the audit committees of more than two other public companies unless the Board determines that such service would not impair such director's ability to serve effectively on the Audit Committee.

The Compensation/Succession Committee provides reports to the Board of Directors and, where appropriate, submits actions to the Board of Directors for ratification. Members of management attend meetings of the committee and make recommendations to the committee regarding compensation for officers other than the Chief Executive Officer. In determining the Chief Executive Officer's compensation, the committee considers the evaluation prepared by the non-management directors. 
In accordance with the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the committee may delegate to one or more officers the authority to grant stock options to other officers and employees who are not directors or executive officers, provided that the resolution authorizing this delegation specifies the total number of options that the officer or officers can award. The charter for the Compensation/Succession Committee also provides that the committee may form subcommittees and delegate tasks to them.

Stockholder Outreach and Engagement; Code of Conduct 
Stockholder Outreach and Engagement 
As part of our commitment to effective corporate governance practices, in 2018 we reached out to many of our largest institutional stockholders to hold formal discussions with them to help us better understand the views of our investors on key topics. Our Lead Director (who, as provided in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, ensures that he is available for consultation and direct communication with major stockholders) and senior management participated in these meetings to discuss and obtain feedback on corporate governance, executive compensation, and other related issues important to our stockholders. We share stockholder feedback with the Board and its committees to enhance both our governance practices and transparency of these practices to our stockholders. We review the voting results of our most recent annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholder feedback received through our engagement process, the governance practices of our peers and other large companies, and current trends in governance as we consider enhancements to our governance practices and disclosure. We value our dialogue with our stockholders and believe our outreach efforts, which are in addition to our other communication channels available to our stockholders and interested parties, help ensure our corporate governance, compensation, and other related practices continue to evolve and reflect the insights and perspectives of our many stakeholders. We welcome suggestions from our stockholders on how the Board and management can enhance this dialogue in the future. 
COMMUNICATIONS WITH DIRECTORS 
We have approved procedures for stockholders and other interested parties to send communications to individual directors or the non-employee directors as a group. You should send any such communications in writing addressed to the applicable director or directors in care of the Secretary, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, 77 West Wacker Drive, Suite 4600, Chicago, Illinois 60601. All correspondence will be forwarded to the intended recipients. 
CODE OF CONDUCT 
The Board has adopted a Code of Conduct that sets forth standards regarding matters such as honest and ethical conduct, compliance with law, and full, fair, accurate, and timely disclosure in reports and documents that we file with the SEC and in other public communications. The Code of Conduct applies to all of our directors, employees, and officers, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer. The Code of Conduct is available at our website, www.adm.com, and is available free of charge upon written request to Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Attention: Secretary, 77 West Wacker Drive, Suite 4600, Chicago, Illinois 60601. Any amendments to certain provisions of the Code of Conduct or waivers of such provisions granted to certain executive officers will be disclosed promptly on our website. 
Executive Stock Ownership 
Executive Stock Ownership Policy 
The Board of Directors believes that it is important for each member of our senior management to acquire and maintain a significant ownership position in shares of our common stock to further align the interests of senior management with the stockholders' interests. Accordingly, we have adopted a policy regarding ownership of shares of our common stock by senior management. The policy calls for members of senior management to own shares of common stock with a fair market value within a range of one to six times that individual's base salary, depending on each individual's level of responsibility with our company; no sales can be made until guidelines are met. The stock ownership guidelines applicable to the named executive officers (as defined herein) are set forth below.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Section 1 — Executive Summary 
Section 1 — Executive Summary 
OUR COMPENSATION ELEMENTS 
In 2018, the three key elements of our pay program continued to be base salary, annual cash incentive awards, and long-term incentive (LTI) awards. We refer to the combination of these three elements as "total direct compensation." 
We believe our salaries and performance-based annual cash incentives awards encourage and reward current business results while our LTI awards and stock ownership guidelines reward sustained performance. 
2018 COMPENSATION CHANGES 
For 2018, the Compensation/Succession Committee approved the addition of three levels of performance (threshold, target, and stretch) to the strategic goals of our 2018 annual cash incentive program to drive participant engagement and positive outcomes, including an opportunity to increase the percentage of Adjusted EBITDA in excess of a specified threshold amount used to fund the bonus pool by up to an additional 1.35% in the aggregate. See Section 2 — Annual Cash Incentive for additional detail. 
2018 ADM PERFORMANCE 
In 2018, we grew earnings per share, improved returns on invested capital, and generated positive economic value added. Our focus on efficiency and costs helped to increase adjusted earnings per share to $3.50 in 2018, a 44% increase from 2017. In 2018, we achieved a trailing four-quarter average adjusted return on invested capital (Adjusted ROIC) of 8.3%, 205 basis points above our 2018 weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 6.25%. Our 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $3.634 billion. The Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted ROIC metrics used to determine the 2018 performance compensation metric below is lower than the Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted ROIC used in financial reporting. We continued executing the most sweeping portfolio transformation in 116 years by acquiring, investing in, or partnering with around 24 companies and divesting 9 businesses since 2014 to expand and focus our product portfolio. 
2018 PERFORMANCE COMPENSATION CALCULATIONS 
We used the Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted ROIC metrics (as noted above) to calculate the 2018 annual cash incentive target levels but excluded the 2017 biodiesel blender's tax credit which was paid in 2018 as we included this credit in our 2017 performance compensation calculation. The charts below show the performance compensation calculations for FY2016 – FY2018. 
Adjusted EBITDA ($ Billions) Adjusted ROIC 
(1) Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted to exclude the impact of certain items) and Adjusted ROIC (return on invested capital, adjusted to exclude the impact of certain items) are financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), and are referred to as non-GAAP financial measures. Attached as Annex A to this Proxy Statement are more detailed definitions of these terms, a reconciliation of each to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and related disclosures about the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Section 2 — Components of Executive Compensation 
IMPACT OF 2018 ADM PERFORMANCE ON EXECUTIVE PAY 
ADM executive total direct compensation is delivered through a mix of cash and equity awards that emphasize multiple performance factors tied to stockholder value creation over near-, mid- and longer-term time horizons. 
In 2018, we actively managed our business portfolio to further advance the largest portfolio transformation in the history of the company, which began in 2014. We accomplished this portfolio transformation while taking billions of dollars in run-rate costs out of the business, including $302 million in 2018. We also have returned $8.6 billion to shareholders since 2014, $835 million of that being in 2018. 
Section 2 — Components of Executive Compensation 
The company's executive compensation program is built on a structure that balances short and long-term performance. We believe our salaries and performance-based annual cash incentives awards encourage and reward current business results while our LTI awards and stock ownership guidelines reward sustained performance. The company's executive compensation levels also rely on data on compensation for comparable executives at other similarly situated companies, as ADM competes with these companies for executive talent. As described in greater detail in Section 6 —Peer Group, the Compensation/Succession Committee chose a broad external market peer group in the S&P 100 Industrials so as to ensure a wide spectrum of compensation levels. Finally, our Compensation/Succession Committee is also determined to take into account internal equity when determining the pay of the CEO and the company's other Named Executive Officers ("NEOs"). The Compensation/Succession Committee is provided with data on the compensation of other ADM non-executive employees in other pay grades and/or salary ranges and reviews such data when setting CEO and NEO pay. The following chart summarizes the components and associated objectives of our fixed and performance-based pay for executives in 2018:

SALARY 
The Compensation/Succession Committee establishes base salaries based on an executive's position, skills, performance, experience, tenure, and responsibilities. The Committee annually assesses the competitiveness of base salary levels relative to salaries within the marketplace for similar executive positions. The Committee also considers factors such as individual performance, changes in responsibilities, and/or changes in competitive marketplace levels in assessing any salary changes to executives. 
ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE 
We pay an annual cash incentive only if the company meets certain specified performance goals. The company's annual cash incentive program emphasizes company-wide performance objectives to encourage the executives to focus on overall company success and leadership to generate the most value across the entire company. Our assessment of company performance is directly tied to stockholder expectations by ensuring the delivery of threshold levels of forward-looking metrics such as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted ROIC before awards may be earned.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Section 2 — Components of Executive Compensation 
Compensation/Succession Committee's informed judgment are incorporated to ensure actual awards appropriately reflect the company's operating environment and individual executive contributions. 
The company's 2018 annual cash incentive program was primarily based on two key measures of financial performance which are Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted ROIC relative to annual WACC, with final awards based on company and individual performance, as well as achievements related to the company's strategic and business objectives. The annual cash incentive program includes a variable percentage of Adjusted EBITDA achieved and the achievement of three specific strategic goals at three levels of performance (threshold, target and stretch). The three strategic goals for 2018 were: (i) achieve between $100 million (threshold) and $250 million (stretch) in run rate savings; (ii) realize operating profit improvements of between $100 million (threshold) and $150 million (stretch) in key target segments; and (iii) realize revenue growth between $350 million (threshold) and $450 million (stretch) in year-on-year revenue from recent acquisitions and major projects. For 2018, the recent acquisitions and major projects included Ingredients, Processing & Value Added, Grain & Logistics, WFSI, including Health & Wellness, Animal Nutrition & S&S initiatives, Destination Marketing, and Oilseeds RPBO. Depending on the achievement of the three goals and Adjusted EBITDA, the percentage of Adjusted EBITDA in excess of a specified threshold amount used to fund the bonus pool could range from 1.6% to 4.2%. Each strategic goal also can increase the Adjusted EBITDA percentage by 0.45% at the stretch level, making the total range of Adjusted EBITDA 1.6% to 5.55%. 
LTI AWARDS 
The company's LTI program is designed to reward sustained performance and to attract and retain talented executives and employees. Historically, the Compensation/Succession Committee has reviewed company performance by incorporating perspectives on company and market factors, including relative and absolute stockholder return and strategic, operating, and financial milestones. 
For awards granted in 2018, LTI award grant sizes were based upon market-based equity awards. The performance-based LTI awards granted in 2018 used a mix of PSUs (50%) and RSUs (50%) to continue the alignment of the interests of the NEOs and stockholders.

BENEFITS 
In addition to these direct elements of pay, the company provides benefits to our NEOs to provide for basic health, welfare, and income security needs and to support the attraction, retention, and motivation of these employees. With few exceptions, such as supplemental benefits provided to employees whose benefits under broad-based plans are limited under applicable tax laws, the company's philosophy is to offer the same benefits to all U.S. salaried employees as are offered to the company's NEOs.

Perquisites. Consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy, we limit executive perquisites. Perquisites are an additional form of income to the NEOs, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table, and the NEOs are individually responsible for any taxes related to this income. The Compensation/Succession Committee allows our Chairman and CEO to have access to the aircraft for personal use for security and efficiency reasons. Use of the company-owned aircraft by other NEOs is by exception only. See the notes to the Summary Compensation Table for a description of other perquisites provided to the NEOs.

Section 4 — Oversight of Executive Compensation 
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
Results of 2018 Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we held the company's eighth advisory vote on executive compensation. Approximately 94% of the advisory votes cast were in favor of our executive compensation. The Compensation/Succession Committee believes that this strong level of support, and the similarly strong levels of support manifested in prior years' advisory votes, affirm broad stockholder agreement with the alignment of existing executive compensation programs with stockholder interests and the Compensation/Succession Committee's approach. After making significant changes to the executive compensation program in 2017 to more closely align with stockholder interests, the Committee considered this outcome in determining that no substantive changes in the executive compensation programs would occur for 2019. At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 1, 2019, we will again hold an advisory vote on executive compensation. The Compensation/Succession Committee will continue to consider stockholder feedback and the results from this year's and future advisory votes on executive compensation. 
Our company routinely conducts extensive proactive outreach to engage with key institutional shareholders to understand and address the key issues that are important to our shareholders as well as fostering long-term relationships. During the course of the year, an engagement team consisting of our Lead Director, Compensation/Succession Committee Chair, SVP of Human Resources, General Counsel, and Investor Relations and Sustainability staff met with several institutional shareholders to discuss matters of governance, compensation, environmental, and other issues. 
EXECUTIVE STOCK OWNERSHIP 
The Board of Directors believes that it is important for each member of our senior management to acquire and maintain a significant ownership position in shares of our common stock to further align the interests of senior management with the stockholders' interests. Accordingly, we have adopted a policy regarding ownership of shares of our common stock by senior management. The policy calls for members of senior management to own shares of common stock with a fair market value within a range of one to six times that individual's base salary, depending on each individual's level of responsibility with our company; no sales can be made until guidelines are met. The stock ownership guidelines applicable to our NEOs are set forth on page 24 under "Executive Stock Ownership." As of March 11, 2019, each of our NEOs is in compliance with our stock ownership guidelines. 
Section 4 — Oversight of Executive Compensation 
THE ROLE OF THE COMPENSATION/SUCCESSION COMMITTEE 
The Compensation/Succession Committee is composed solely of independent directors and is responsible to the board of directors and the company's stockholders for establishing the company's compensation philosophy and establishing and administering the company's compensation policies and programs consistent with this philosophy. The Compensation/Succession Committee's responsibilities are set forth in its charter, which is available on the company's website, www.adm.com. Additional information regarding the Compensation/Succession Committee's authority to determine compensation can be found under the caption "Compensation/Succession Committee" elsewhere in this proxy statement. 
THE ROLE OF THE BOARD 
The Board approves the company's business plan, which is one of the factors used to set financial business objectives for the annual cash incentive plan. The independent directors establish and approve all performance criteria for evaluating the Chairman and 
 CEO and annually evaluate the performance of the Chairman and CEO based on these criteria. The non-management directors also ratify the Chairman and CEO's compensation. The board can also provide input and ratification on any additional compensation-related issues. The Board also conducts an annual review of the company's performance. 
THE ROLE OF THE COMPENSATION/SUCCESSION COMMITTEE CONSULTANT 
The Compensation/Succession Committee retained Pay Governance LLC as its independent executive compensation consultant. Pay Governance provides no other services to the company. The independent compensation consultant reports directly to the Compensation/Succession Committee, and provides the Compensation/Succession Committee with objective and expert analyses and independent advice on executive and director compensation and other matters in support of the Compensation/Succession Committee's responsibilities under its charter. Each Compensation/Succession Committee meeting includes an executive session where the Compensation/Succession Committee meets exclusively with the independent consultant; company management is not included in 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Section 4 — Oversight of Executive Compensation these sessions. Outside of these sessions, the independent consultant interacts with the company's management team solely on behalf of the Compensation/Succession Committee to assist the Compensation/Succession Committee in fulfilling its duties and responsibilities. The Compensation/Succession Committee will only retain consultants that it believes will provide independent advice. The Compensation/Succession Committee has assessed the independence of Pay Governance pursuant to the SEC's and NYSE's rules and concluded that the work Pay Governance has performed does not raise any conflict of interest. 
THE ROLE OF EXECUTIVES 
To assist the Compensation/Succession Committee in determining compensation for the NEOs other than himself, the company's Chairman and CEO participates in discussions with the Compensation/Succession Committee regarding the other officers' performance and compensation. The Chairman and CEO provides the Compensation/Succession Committee with an assessment of the other NEOs' performance, both in terms of individual performance and with respect to the functions or business units they oversee. The Chairman and CEO also recommends to the Compensation/Succession Committee, but does not vote on, annual base salary adjustments, individual and group performance factors, and short and long-term incentive award target levels that involve the other NEOs. 
The company's Senior Vice President of Human Resources oversees all employee compensation and the administration of benefits programs, under the oversight and direction of the Compensation/Succession Committee. He prepares the majority of the materials for the Compensation/Succession Committee meetings and provides analyses that assist the Compensation/Succession Committee with its decisions, such as summaries of competitive market practices, summaries of the company's succession planning actions, and reports regarding the company's performance. In addition, throughout the year, he facilitates meetings with management to help the Compensation/Succession Committee gain a better understanding of company performance. He ensures that the Compensation/Succession Committee is provided a rigorous assessment of year-to-date performance at each of its meetings. At the direction of the Chairman of the Compensation/Succession Committee, the company's Senior Vice President of Human Resources involves other members of management in portions of the Compensation/Succession Committee meetings to participate in discussions related to company and individual performance and the company's compensation and benefit programs. The company's executives leave meetings during discussions of individual compensation actions affecting them personally and during all executive sessions, unless requested to attend by the Compensation/Succession Committee.

[END TABLE]
Of the total direct compensation that we consider attributable to 2018 performance, the company's NEOs received, on average, 88% of actual total direct compensation in variable pay and 60% of actual total direct compensation in equity awards for 2018. Although the Compensation/Succession Committee has not adopted a policy for allocating the various elements of total direct compensation, we do place greater emphasis on variable pay for executives with more significant responsibilities, reflecting their greater capacity to affect the company's performance and results. For these purposes, we consider the base salary paid in 2018, the annual cash incentive earned in 2018 (paid in early 2019), and the award value of equity granted early in 2018 with a look at performance from 2018 to 2020. The equity award value represents the dollar amount of such awards as approved by the Compensation/Succession Committee. 
The charts below present the mix of actual total direct compensation attributed to 2018 performance. 
INDIVIDUAL COMPENSATION DECISIONS 
The Compensation/Succession Committee reviews the total compensation of our NEOs annually. Any changes to base salary, annual incentives, and long-term incentives are based on competitiveness versus the external market, individual performance, internal equity, and the Committee's informed judgment as described in Section 4 — Oversight of Executive Compensation. 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Section 5 — 2018 Executive Compensation 
The following tables summarize compensation decisions made by the Compensation/Succession Committee with respect to each of the NEOs. Details regarding our compensation programs and related decisions may be found following the summaries for the executives. Due to timing differences in measuring the company's equity award approval and grant date fair value, the equity award amounts presented in the Summary Compensation Table may differ slightly from those set forth below.

2018 ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVES 
Annual cash incentives are determined by the degree to which company financial performance expectations are achieved and the Compensation/Succession Committee's independent assessment of the company's performance as well as the individual performance of the NEO, which makes up 25% of the annual cash bonus target. This outcome may then be adjusted within a range of –25% to +25% based on the Compensation/Succession Committee's assessment of individual and group performance. For 2018 annual cash incentive payout, the biodiesel blender's tax credit the company recognized in 2017 was deducted from the 2018 performance compensation calculations so as not to double count the effects of such credit in 2018. The formula used to calculate an annual cash incentive payout for NEOs can be expressed as follows: 
Company Performance Payout Percentage (75%)    +    Individual Performance Percentage (25%)    =    Overall Payout Percentage 
4.4% of Adjusted EBITDA Above $1.3B (Dividends & Interest) = $97.3M 2018 Actual Adj. EBITDA= $3.511B ($3.511B-$1.3B) x 4.4% = $97.3M ROIC Factor 1.1 = Adj. ROIC = WACC+2% 1.0 = Adj. ROIC = WACC 0.9 = Adj. ROIC = WACC-2% ROIC Factor = 1.0825 WACC = 6.25%; ROIC = 7.9% Bonus Pool $105.3M $97.3M x 1.0825 Total Challenge Award Level(1) $53.36M Full Bonus Payments at Target Company Payout% 197.4% 75% Company Performance = 148.1% 197.4% x 75% [G] Individual Payout%(2) 25% Overall Cash Bonus Payout% 173.1% 148.1% + 25% 
(1) Total Challenge Award Level is defined as full bonus payments at target. 
(2) For illustrative purposes, a 25% individual performance percentage is used. Individual performance may vary by NEO by +/- 25% based on the Compensation/Succession Committee's assessment of individual performance and contribution to the company's success. 
INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE COMPONENTS 
Based on business results and the economic environment for 2018 performance, the Compensation/Succession Committee elected to award the Chairman and CEO a 45% individual performance percentage based on accomplishments described above. The Compensation/Succession Committee incorporated its and the full board's assessment of the Chairman and CEO's performance and full company performance when approving Mr. Luciano's individual performance percentage. Mr. Young, Mr. Taets and Mr. Morris also received an individual 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Section 5 — 2018 Executive Compensation performance percentage of 45%, in recognition of their performance against individual and company goals described above. Mr. Cuddy received an individual performance percentage of 35% in recognition of his performance against individual and company goals described above. Individual performance can range from 0% to 50% based upon performance against goals for the year. The 25% individual performance percentage is used for target performance. Our leaders are responsible for driving performance company-wide and their individual performance rating is a result of their performance for the year. 
THE RESULTING ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE FOR EACH NEO 
The purpose of the annual cash incentive program is to reward performance based on the achievement of company, business, and individual objectives. At the start of each fiscal year, the Compensation/Succession Committee approves minimum, target, and maximum annual cash incentive levels for each NEO. Target annual cash incentive levels are expressed as a percentage of salary. Based on company and individual performance, annual cash incentive payouts can range between 0% and 200% of the target annual cash incentive. Based on the determination of the company and individual performance factors as described above, each NEO, excluding Mr. Cuddy, received an annual cash incentive for 2018, payable in Q1 of 2019, equal to 193.1% (197.4% company performance making up 75% of the total annual cash incentive award plus individual award amounts of 45%) of his respective target annual cash incentive. Mr. Cuddy received an annual cash incentive equal to 183.1% of his total target based upon 35% individual performance.

EQUITY-BASED LONG-TERM INCENTIVES & HOW THEY WERE DETERMINED FOR 2018 
The company's LTI Program aligns the interests of executives with those of stockholders by rewarding the achievement of long-term stockholder value, supporting stock ownership, and encouraging long-term service with the company. In the following sections, we discuss the process for determining equity grants delivered under the company's LTI Program. 
In terms of grant size and grant form, the company's LTI awards in 2017 transitioned from awards based upon a historical review of past performance to awards based on the results of forward-looking metrics measured over a three-year performance period. Our LTI awards consist of performance share units (PSUs) and restricted stock units (RSUs) with three-year vesting. The overall LTI award value was allocated 50% to PSUs and 50% to RSUs. The transition to the forward-looking LTI program was made to better align our equity program with market practice and strengthen the focus of our equity program on growth and future value creation for shareholders. The February 2018 grants appear in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table and are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table information for FY2018.

Terms of the company's equity awards granted in February 2018 generally are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PSUs will vest in three years if the company achieves certain performance goals over a three-year performance  period (2018 – 2020). Payout can range for 0% to 200% and fluctuate based upon share price. The 2018 PSU metrics are: (i) the company's relative TSR as compared to the companies in the S&P 100 Industrials Index (25%  weighting), (ii) the degree to which the company achieves specified Adjusted ROIC goals (25% weighting), and (iii) the degree to which the company's Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 – 2020 exceeds its specified cumulative  Adjusted EBITDA goals for the same period (50% weighting). Before the PSU can pay out, the company's cumulative Adjusted EBITDA for the period 2018 – 2020 must exceed a specific threshold amount. If this does not occur, there  will be no payout for the other metrics.

• RSUs typically vest three years after the date of grant.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Upon the death of the executive, RSUs granted under the LTI Program vest immediately and PSUs will vest based on  actual performance during the truncated performance period and on a pro rata basis based on the target number of units for the year following the truncated performance period. RSUs and PSUs continue to vest if the executive leaves the company  because of disability or retirement (age 55 or greater with 10 or more years of service). A detailed description of the change-in-control provisions is contained in  Section 8 below. For grants issued in 2012 and subsequent years, award agreements include forfeiture and clawback provisions as described in Section 8.

OUR POLICY FOR WHEN GRANTS ARE MADE 
The Compensation/Succession Committee grants all equity awards to NEOs, and no attempt is made to time the granting of these awards in relation to the release of material, non-public information. The exercise price of all stock options is set at fair market value on the grant date. Under the 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan, fair market value is the closing market price of the company's common stock on the last trading day prior to the date of grant. The Compensation/Succession Committee meets during the first fiscal quarter of each fiscal year and determines the annual equity awards granted to NEOs. These awards are issued promptly following the date of the Compensation/Succession Committee's meeting and approval. In addition to annual awards, the NEOs may receive awards when they join the company or change their job status, including promotions. 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Section 6 — Peer Group 
Section 6 — Peer Group 
The Compensation/Succession Committee utilizes the S&P 100 Industrial Index as a peer group to evaluate whether executive officer pay levels are aligned with performance on a relative basis. We believe the larger peer group is the most relative peer group for ADM because we compete for talent across a wide range of industries. The difference between ADM's relative revenue and ADM's relative market cap is one of the reasons why we use a larger peer group than other companies. We use the S&P 100 Industrials as a peer group to emphasize a broader representative market peer group to ensure a wide spectrum of compensation levels are reviewed to arrive at our NEO compensation.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Section 7 — Employment Agreements, Severance, and Change-in-Control Benefits 
Section 7 — Employment Agreements, Severance, and Change-in-Control Benefits 
NO EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS 
None of our NEOs has an employment contract or separation agreement. Consistent with our approach of rewarding performance, employment is not guaranteed, and either ADM or the NEO may terminate the employment relationship at any time. 
ADM maintains a severance program that serves as a guideline for severance benefits that may be provided to various levels of employees upon termination of their employment without cause, but the program does not create a contractual right to receive any severance benefits on the part of the employee. The Compensation/Succession Committee generally requires the employee to enter into a non-competition and/or non-solicitation agreement in exchange for receiving severance under the program. 
CHANGE-IN-CONTROL PROVISIONS 
Upon a change in control of the company, NEOs may receive certain protections related to their LTI awards, as described more fully below, and other compensation as detailed in the sections titled "Pension Benefits," "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation," and "Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements." NEOs are not eligible to receive any other cash severance, continued health and welfare benefits, tax gross ups or other change-in-control benefits. 
The Archer-Daniels-Midland Company 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan provides non-employee directors and all employees, including executive officers, change-in-control protections for their LTI awards. For awards granted in 2017 and onward, if a change-in-control occurs with respect to the company, the equity grants held by the company's executive officers generally will vest immediately in full in the case of RSUs and on a modified pro rata basis for PSUs if the equity award does not continue because it is not assumed or replaced, or the award is assumed or replaced, but the executive officer's employment is terminated for reasons other than cause or good reason within 24 months of the change in control (referred to as "double trigger" vesting). The double trigger accelerated vesting had been adopted to provide the executives with some assurance that they will not be disadvantaged with respect to their equity awards in the event of a change-in-control of the company. This assurance increases the value of these awards to the executives, which in turn enhances retention. 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Section 8 — Governance Features of Our Executive Compensation Programs 
Section 8 — Governance Features of Our Executive Compensation Programs 
CLAWBACK PROVISIONS 
We have included clawback provisions in the company's long-term incentive award agreements that provide us with the ability to recover long-term incentive compensation for a broad range of reasons. This aggressive approach to recoupment of long-term incentive compensation reflects the company's commitment to protecting stockholder value. 
For awards granted in August 2012 and beyond, we have implemented an additional clawback policy for all cash and equity-based long-term incentive awards. Specifically, this policy provides for the recoupment of any cash or equity incentive awards for a period of three years from the date of award. We have the right to clawback incentive payments made to NEOs and certain other members of senior management in the event of a financial restatement or ethical misconduct. In 2015 and in 2017, additional language was added to equity awards which includes post-vesting non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions prohibiting competitive activity and solicitation of ADM customers and employees. 
PROHIBITION ON INSIDER TRADING 
Pursuant to the company's Insider Trading Policy, employees and directors may not engage in short selling, speculative trading, or hedging transactions involving the company's stock, including writing or trading in options, warrants, puts and calls, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps or collars, or entering into other transactions that are designed to hedge or offset decreases in the price of the company's securities. In addition, employees and directors are required to review any pledging of company securities with the company's General Counsel prior to engaging in such activity. 
The company's Insider Trading Policy also provides that all transactions in our company's securities by the company's directors, the NEOs, and certain other officers and employees must be pre-cleared by the company's law department. 
SECTION 162(M) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE EFFECTS ON THE COMPANY 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code precludes the company from taking a federal income tax deduction for compensation paid in excess of $1 million to our "covered employees" (which as of 2018 includes the CEO, CFO, and our three other most highly compensated executive officers). Prior to 2018, this deduction limitation did not apply to qualified "performance-based" compensation and a company's CFO was not considered to be a "covered officer." 
Despite these new limits on the deductibility of performance-based compensation, the Compensation/Succession Committee continues to believe that a significant portion of our executives' compensation should be tied to the company's performance and that shareholder interests are best served if its discretion and flexibility in structuring and awarding compensation is not restricted. The Compensation/Succession Committee also believes that the amount of any expected loss of a tax deduction under Section 162(m) will be insignificant to the company's overall tax position. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the changes to Section 162(m) will significantly impact the design of our compensation program going forward. 
THE COMPANY'S EVALUATION OF ITS COMPENSATION PROGRAMS AS THEY RELATE TO RISK 
On an ongoing basis, the Compensation/Succession Committee, with input from management, assesses potential risks associated with compensation decisions and discusses them with our board of directors if warranted. To date, we have not identified any incentive compensation programs that encourage inappropriate risk taking. We have established a policy under which we engage an outside consultant every other year to review the company's programs and independently assess the risk in them. 
In 2017, ADM engaged an outside consultant, The Korn Ferry Hay Group ("Hay"), to assist the Compensation/Succession Committee in evaluating the risk in the company's compensation programs. In conducting an independent assessment, Hay reviewed all of the company's incentive compensation programs and determined that none of our compensation programs encouraged inappropriate risk-taking or the manipulation of earnings. The detailed findings of this review were discussed with management and presented to the Compensation/Succession Committee in November 2017. 
Another independent review of the company's incentive programs will be conducted during 2019 and reported to the Compensation/Succession Committee. 
THE COMPANY'S MINDFUL APPROACH TO ADDRESSING LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH RETIREMENT PROGRAMS 
The Compensation/Succession Committee is mindful that the non-qualified deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans create financial statement liabilities. We generally do not set amounts aside in a "rabbi" trust for the benefit of participants in the 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Section 8 — Governance Features of Our Executive Compensation Programs deferred compensation or supplemental retirement plans. However, the deferred compensation plans have "rabbi" trust funding triggers in the event of a potential change in control of the company. This trigger provides some measure of assurance to employees that amounts they have chosen to defer from their current compensation will be held for their benefit, although still subject to creditor claims as required under the applicable tax law. In maintaining the non-qualified plans, the Compensation/Succession Committee has duly considered that the federal income tax deduction available to the company occurs at the same time that participants are paid benefits from the applicable plan. 
The company is required to fund its qualified pension plans in a manner consistent with the minimum funding requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Historically, the company has made contributions in excess of the minimum to maintain its plans at or near a full funding level relative to the accrued benefit obligation. 
COMPENSATION/SUCCESSION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation/Succession Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based upon this review and discussion, the Compensation/Succession Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

(2) The amounts reported in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the option awards for fiscal year 2016. No options were issued in 2017 or 2018. We calculated these amounts in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718 utilizing the assumptions discussed in Note 11 to our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. 
(3) The amounts reported in this column represent amounts earned under our annual incentive plan during each of the respective fiscal periods shown. In each case, the amounts were paid shortly after the close of the applicable fiscal period. 
(4) The amounts reported in this column for 2018 represents the aggregate change in actuarial present value of each NEO's accumulated benefit under all defined benefit and actuarial pension plans from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018, using the same assumptions used for financial reporting purposes except that retirement age is assumed to be the normal retirement age (65) specified in the plans. No NEO received above market or preferential earnings on deferred compensation. To derive the change in pension value for financial reporting purposes, the assumptions used to value pension liabilities on December 31, 2018 were an interest rate of 4.44% for the ADM Retirement Plan, an interest rate of 4.27% for the ADM Supplemental Retirement Plan, and mortality was determined using the RP2014 mortality table, with a white collar adjustment, projected generationally using Scale MP-2018. The assumptions used to value pension liabilities on December 31, 2017 were an interest rate of 3.73% for the ADM Retirement Plan, an interest rate of 3.61% for the ADM Supplemental Retirement Plan, and mortality was determined using the RP2014 mortality table, with a white collar adjustment, projected generationally using Scale MP-2017. 
(5) The amounts reported in this column for 2018 include costs for personal use of company aircraft, imputed value of company-provided life insurance, costs for executive healthcare services, spousal travel and lodging, company contributions under the 401(k) and ESOP, charitable gifts pursuant to the company's matching charitable gift program which is available to substantially all full-time employees and non-employee directors, and, for Mr. Taets, certain expenses related to his overseas assignment as well as foreign tax payments and tax gross up related to the same. Specific perquisites and other items applicable to each NEO listed are identified below by an "X". Where a perquisite or benefit exceeded $10,000 for an individual, the dollar amount is given.

Aggregate incremental cost to our company of perquisites and personal benefits is determined as follows. In the case of payment of expenses related to items such as executive healthcare services and relocation expenses, incremental cost is determined by the amounts paid to third-party providers. In the case of personal use of company-owned aircraft, incremental cost is based solely on the cost per hour to the company to operate the aircraft, and does not include fixed costs that do not change based on usage, such as purchase costs of the aircraft and non-trip-related hangar expenses. Our direct operating cost per hour of an aircraft is based on the actual costs of fuel, on-board catering, aircraft maintenance, landing fees, trip-related hangar and parking costs, and smaller variable costs, divided by the number of hours the aircraft was operated during the year.

All of the awards in the table above were granted under our 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan. The awards shown in the columns designated "Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards" were made pursuant to our annual cash incentive plan. The amounts actually paid with respect to these awards are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Section 5 — 2018 Executive Compensation — 2018 Annual Cash Incentives" for more information about our annual cash incentive plan. 
The awards shown in the column designated "Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards" in the table above are PSU awards and vest in three years if the company achieves certain performance goals over a three-year performance period (2018 – 2020). The 2018 PSU metrics are: (i) the company's relative TSR as compared to the companies in the S&P 100 Industrials Index (25% weighting), (ii) the degree to which the company achieves specified Adjusted ROIC goals (25% weighting), and (iii) the degree to which the company's Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 – 2020 exceeds its specified cumulative Adjusted EBITDA goals for the same period (50% weighting). Before the PSU can pay out, the company's cumulative Adjusted EBITDA must exceed a certain threshold. If this does not occur, there will be no payout for the other metrics. 
All of the awards shown in the "All Other Stock Awards" column in the table above are RSUs awards and vest in full three years after the date of the grant. Under the terms of the RSU award agreements, the recipient of the award may receive cash dividend equivalents on RSUs prior to their vesting date, but may not transfer or pledge the units in any manner prior to vesting. Dividend equivalents on RSUs are paid at the same rate as dividends to our stockholders generally. 
The 2018 RSU and PSU awards are subject to double trigger accelerated vesting and payout upon a change in control only if the award recipient's employment is terminated without cause or if the award recipient resigns for good reason, in each case, within 24 months after the change in control, or if the surviving entity in the change-in-control transaction refuses to continue, assume, or replace the awards. In such instance the 2018 RSU awards will vest in full immediately, and the 2018 PSU awards will vest based on actual performance during the truncated performance period and on a pro rata basis based on a target number of units for the year following the truncated performance period. Upon the death of an award recipient, vesting of the RSU awards will accelerate in full while the vesting of the PSU awards will accelerate in the manner described in the preceding sentence. If an award recipient's employment ends as a result of disability or retirement, both the RSU and PSU awards will continue to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedule. If an award recipient's employment ends for any other reason, unvested RSU and PSU awards will be forfeited. With respect to each of the RSU and PSU awards described above, if an award recipient's employment is terminated for cause, or if the recipient breaches a non-competition, non-solicitation, or confidentiality restriction or participates in an activity deemed by us to be detrimental to our company, the recipient's unvested units will be forfeited, and any shares issued in settlement of units that have already vested must be returned to us or the recipient must pay us the amount of the shares' fair market value as of the date they were issued. 
The impact of a termination of employment or change-in-control of our company on RSU and PSU awards held by our named executive officers is quantified in the "Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements" section below.

[END TABLE]
(1) The number of years of credited service was calculated as of the pension plan measurement date used for financial statement reporting purposes, which was December 31, 2018. For each of the named executive officers, the number of years of credited service is equal to the number of actual years of service with our company. 
(2) The assumptions used to value pension liabilities as of December 31, 2018 were an interest rate of 4.44% for the ADM Retirement Plan and 4.27% for the ADM Supplemental Retirement Plan and mortality was determined under the RP2014 mortality table, with a white collar adjustment, projected generationally using scale MP-2018. Mr. Cuddy, Mr. Morris and Mr. Taets participate in the final average pay formula under the ADM Retirement Plan and the ADM Supplemental Retirement Plan, while Mr. Luciano and Mr. Young participate in the cash balance formula under those plans. The amounts reported for Mr. Luciano and Mr. Young are the present value of their respective projected normal retirement benefit under the Retirement and Supplemental Plans at December 31, 2018. The amounts reported are calculated by projecting the balance in the accounts forward to age 65 by applying a 3.34% interest rate, converting to a single-life annuity as of age 65, and then discounting back to December 31, 2018 using the assumptions specified above. The total account balance for Mr. Luciano at December 31, 2018 under the Retirement and Supplemental Plans was $254,771 and the total account balance for Mr. Young at December 31, 2018 under the Retirement and Supplemental Plans was $192,553, which are the amounts that would have been distributable if such individuals had terminated employment on that date. 
QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLAN 
We sponsor the ADM Retirement Plan (the "Retirement Plan"), which is a qualified defined benefit plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Retirement Plan covers eligible salaried employees of our company and its participating affiliates. 
Effective January 1, 2009, the Retirement Plan was amended to provide benefits determined under a cash balance formula. The cash balance formula applies to any participant entering or re-entering the plan on or after January 1, 2009 and to any participant who had less than five years of service prior to January 1, 2009. For a participant with an accrued benefit and five years of service or more prior to January 1, 2009, an account was established on January 1, 2009 with an opening balance equal to the present value of his or her accrued benefit determined under the final average pay formula. The accrued benefits of all other participants to whom the cash balance formula does not apply continue to be determined under the traditional final average pay formula. Messrs. Luciano and Young participate in the cash balance formula, while Messrs. Cuddy, Morris, and Taets participate in the final average pay formula. 
A participant whose accrued benefit is determined under the cash balance formula has an individual hypothetical account established under the Retirement Plan. Pay and interest credits are made on an annual basis to the participant's account. Pay credits are equal to a percentage of the participant's earnings for the year based on the sum of the participant's age and years of service at the end of the year under the schedule to the right. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 AGE +  SERVICE          PAY           
 Less than 40   2.00% 
 at least 40 but less  than 50   2.25% 
 at least 50 but less  than 60   2.50% 
 at least 60 but less  than 70   3.00% 
 at least 70 but less  than 80   3.50% 
 80 or more   4.00% 
[END TABLE]
Interest credits are made at the end of the year and are calculated on the balance of the participant's account as of the first day of the plan year, using an interest rate based upon the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, subject to a minimum annual interest rate of 1.95%. The participant's pension benefit will be the amount of the balance in the participant's account at the time that the pension becomes payable under the Retirement Plan. The pension payable to a participant 
Executive Compensation 
Supplemental Retirement Plan whose accrued benefit under the final average pay formula was converted to the cash balance formula at January 1, 2009, if paid in annuity form, will be increased to reflect any additional benefit which the participant would have received in that form under the traditional formula, but only with respect to the benefit accrued by the participant prior to January 1, 2009. A participant under the cash balance formula becomes vested in a benefit under the Retirement Plan after three years of service. There are no special early retirement benefits under the cash balance formula. 
For a participant whose accrued benefit is determined under the final average pay formula, the formula calculates a life annuity payable at a normal retirement age of 65 based upon a participant's highest average earnings over 60 consecutive months during the last 15 years of employment. The final average pay formula provides a benefit of 36.0% of a participant's final average earnings, plus 16.5% of the participant's final average earnings in excess of Social Security "covered compensation." This benefit accrues ratably over 30 years of service. A participant accrues an additional benefit of 0.5% of final average earnings for years of service in excess of 30. Early retirement is available at age 55 with 10 years of service. The life annuity payable at early retirement is subsidized relative to the normal retirement benefit. The payment amount in life annuity form is 97% of the full benefit amount at age 64, and 50% at age 55, with adjustments between those two ages. All participants under the final average pay formula are vested in their benefits under the Retirement Plan, based on five years of service. 
Earnings for purposes of the cash balance and the final average pay formulas generally include amounts reflected as pay on Form W-2, increased by 401(k) Plan pre-tax deferrals and elective "cafeteria plan" contributions, and decreased by bonuses, expense allowances/reimbursements, severance pay, income from stock option and restricted stock awards or cash payments in lieu thereof, merchandise or service discounts, amounts paid in a form other than cash, and other fringe benefits. Annual earnings are limited as required under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
When a participant is eligible for a pension, the participant has a choice of a life annuity, a joint and 50% survivor annuity, a joint and 75% survivor annuity, or a joint and 100% survivor annuity. Each joint and survivor annuity form is the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity payable at the same age, with actuarial equivalence determined using the IRS prescribed mortality table under Section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code and an interest rate assumption of 6%. Cash balance participants may also elect a lump-sum payment option. 
In December 2017, the Retirement Plan was amended to freeze final average pay formula benefit accruals as of December 31, 2021 for all active final average pay formula participants in the Retirement Plan on that date. Final average pay accrued benefits would be calculated as if the participant terminated employment on the earlier of their actual termination date or December 31, 2021. The final average pay benefit will not be converted to a cash balance benefit, but will remain subject to the final average pay benefit rules. As of January 1, 2022, all Retirement Plan participants will accrue future benefits under the cash balance formula, based on their age and total years of service. 
SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN 
We also sponsor the ADM Supplemental Retirement Plan (the "Supplemental Plan"), which is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Supplemental Plan covers participants in the Retirement Plan whose benefit under such plan is limited by the benefit limits of Section 415 or the compensation limit of Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Supplemental Plan also covers any employee whose Retirement Plan benefit is reduced by participation in the ADM Deferred Compensation Plan. Participation by those employees who otherwise qualify for coverage is at the discretion of the Board, the Compensation/Succession Committee or, in the case of employees other than executive officers, the Chief Executive Officer. The Supplemental Plan provides the additional benefit that would have been provided under the Retirement Plan but for the limits of Section 415 or 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code, and but for the fact that elective contributions made by the participant under the ADM Deferred Compensation Plan are not included in the compensation base for the Retirement Plan. A participant is not vested in a benefit under the Supplemental Plan unless and until the participant is vested in a benefit under the Retirement Plan, which requires three years of service for a cash balance formula participant and five years of service for a final average pay formula participant for vesting. A separate payment form election is required with respect to the Supplemental Plan benefit from among the same options available under the Retirement Plan, subject to the limitations of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

(2) The amount reported in this column was not reported in the Summary Compensation Table as part of Mr. Taets' compensation for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 because the earnings were negative. 
(3) Of the amount shown in this column, $674,977 was previously reported as compensation to Mr. Taets in the Summary Compensation Table in previous years, not all of which is reflected in this column due in part to the distribution to Mr. Taets of $369,697 during 2017 and $117,129 during 2018. 
We sponsor two nonqualified deferred compensation plans — the ADM Deferred Compensation Plan for Selected Management Employees I and II (referred to as "Deferred Comp Plan I" and "Deferred Comp Plan II", respectively). Deferred Comp Plan I was frozen as to new participants and new deferrals effective January 1, 2005, and is maintained as a separate "grandfathered" plan under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Deferred Comp Plan II is structured to comply with Section 409A. Deferred Comp Plan II covers salaried employees of our company and its affiliates whose annualized base salary is $175,000 or more. Participation by those employees who otherwise qualify for coverage is at the discretion of the Board, the Compensation/Succession Committee or, in the case of employees other than executive officers, the Chief Executive Officer. 
A participant in Deferred Comp Plan II can defer up to 75% of his or her base salary and up to 100% of his or her bonus. Earnings credits are added based upon hypothetical investment elections made by participants. A participant can elect each year when to be paid the base salary or bonus amounts deferred for that year, by electing to be paid upon a specified future date prior to separation from service or following retirement, in the form of a lump sum or in installments over a period of two to twenty years. If a participant separates from service prior to the elected payment date (or prior to qualifying for retirement), the payment will be made in a lump sum after separation from service, subject to the six month "specified employee" payment delay required by Section 409A. Withdrawals are allowed upon a showing of "hardship" by the participant in accordance with Section 409A. Small account balances of $10,000 or less are paid in a lump sum only. 
Deferred Comp Plan II provides for "make-whole" company credits to the extent that a participant's election to defer under the Deferred Comp Plan II causes a loss of company contributions under the 401(k) and ESOP. No "make-whole" company credits were made on behalf of the named executive officers for fiscal year 2018. 
A participant with an account balance remaining under Deferred Comp Plan I continues to receive earnings credits on such account based upon hypothetical investment elections made by the participant. A participant can establish up to two "scheduled distribution accounts" that are payable upon dates specified by the participant in either a lump sum or installments over a period of two to four years. A participant also can take unscheduled withdrawals of up to 25% of the balance of his or her accounts, subject to a withdrawal penalty of 10% of the withdrawn amount. Only one such unscheduled withdrawal is allowed in any year. Withdrawals also are allowed upon a showing of "hardship" by the participant. A participant's account under Deferred Comp Plan I is paid following termination of employment. Payment following termination of employment is in a lump sum, except that a participant can elect to have installments paid over a period of two to 20 years if termination of employment occurs after retirement eligibility or due to disability. 
Deferred Comp Plan I balances are fully-vested. A participant becomes vested in his or her company credits to Deferred Comp Plan II after two years of service. Unpaid amounts at death are paid to designated beneficiaries. 
The hypothetical investment options available under Deferred Comp Plans I and II are determined by us and correspond with the investment options (other than our company's common stock) that are made available to participants in the qualified 401(k) and ESOP. These investment options are listed below, and the plan earnings 
Executive Compensation 
Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements credited to each participant's account in these plans correspond to the earnings performance of the investment selected. Participants in the Deferred Comp Plans I and II may reallocate the amount of new deferrals and existing account balances among these investment options at any time. We do not set assets aside for the benefit of plan participants, but the Deferred Comp Plans I and II provide for full funding of all benefits upon a change-in-control or potential change-in-control, as defined in the plans. 
In fiscal year 2018, the investment options available under Deferred Comp Plans I and II and their respective notional rates of return were as follows:

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS 
We have entered into certain agreements and maintain certain plans that will require us to provide compensation to our named executive officers in the event of a termination of employment or a change in control of our company. See the tabular disclosure and narrative description under the "Pension Benefits" and "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" sections above for detail regarding payments that would result from a termination of employment or change-in-control of our company under our pension and nonqualified deferred compensation plans. 
Under the terms of our stock option agreements, vesting and exercisability accelerate upon the death of the recipient or change in control of our company, and continue in accordance with the original vesting schedule if employment ends as a result of disability or retirement. If employment ends for reasons other than death, disability, retirement, or cause, a recipient forfeits any interest in the unvested portion of any option but retains the right to exercise the previously vested portion of any option for a period of three months. In addition, if an award recipient's employment is terminated for cause, or if the recipient breaches a non-competition or confidentiality restriction or participates in an activity deemed by us to be detrimental to our company, the recipient's right to exercise any unexercised options will terminate, the recipient's right to receive option shares will terminate, and any shares already issued upon exercise of the option must be returned to us in exchange for the lesser of the shares' then-current fair market value or the price paid for the shares, or the recipient must pay us cash in the amount of the gain realized by the recipient from the exercise of the option. 
Executive Compensation 
Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control Arrangements 
Under the terms of our 2017 and 2018 RSU award agreements, vesting accelerates upon a change in control of the company only if the award recipient's employment is terminated without cause or if the award recipient resigns for good reason, in each case, within 24 months after the change in control, or if the surviving entity in the change-in-control transaction refuses to continue, assume, or replace the awards. Under the terms of our pre-2017 time-vested RSU award agreements, vesting accelerates upon a change in control of our company. Under all of our RSU award agreements, vesting accelerates upon death and continues in accordance with the original vesting schedule if employment ends as a result of disability or retirement. If employment ends for other reasons, the unvested portion of each award is forfeited. In addition, if an award recipient's employment is terminated for cause, or if the recipient breaches a non-competition or confidentiality restriction or participates in an activity deemed by us to be detrimental to our company, the recipient's unvested awards will be forfeited, and any award shares that have already been issued in settlement must be returned to us or the recipient must pay us the amount of the shares' fair market value as of the date the award vested. 
Under the terms of our PSU award agreements, vesting accelerates upon the death of the award recipient or upon a change in control of our company only if the award recipient's employment is terminated without cause or if the award recipient resigns for good reason, in each case, within 24 months after the change in control, or if the surviving entity in the change-in-control transaction refuses to continue, assume, or replace the awards. In all such instances, the PSU awards will vest based on actual performance during the truncated performance period and on a pro rata basis based on a target number of units for the year following the truncated performance period. If employment ends as a result of disability or retirement, vesting will continue in accordance with the original vesting schedule. If employment ends for other reasons, the unvested portion of each award is forfeited. In addition, if an award recipient's employment is terminated for cause, or if the recipient breaches a non-competition or confidentiality restriction or participates in an activity deemed by us to be detrimental to our company, the recipient's unvested awards will be forfeited, and any award shares that have already been issued in settlement must be returned to us or the recipient must pay us the amount of the shares' fair market value as of the date the award vested.

(1) Pursuant to the terms of the stock option and RSU awards issued under the 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan, vesting and exercisability of these equity awards are accelerated in full upon death. The amount shown with respect to RSU awards was calculated by multiplying the number of units as to which accelerated vesting and settlement occurs by $40.97, the closing sale price of a share of our common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2018. The amounts shown with respect to stock options were calculated with respect to options that were "in the money" as of December 31, 2018 and were determined by multiplying the number of shares subject to each option as to which accelerated vesting occurs by the difference between $40.97, the closing sale price of a share of our common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2018, and the exercise price of the applicable stock option. 
Pursuant to the terms of the PSU awards issued under the 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan, vesting of the PSU awards will accelerate upon death in an amount equal to the sum of (i) the number of units deemed to have been earned and entitled to vest during the truncated performance period based on the company's actual performance and 
 (ii) the target number of units multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the number of fiscal years not included in the original performance period that were not included in the truncated performance period and whose denominator is three. The amount shown with respect to PSU awards, assuming that the Relative TSR as well as the levels of both Adjusted ROIC and Adjusted EBITDA achieved for applicable portion of the performance period equate to a 100% payout of the total number of target shares, was calculated (1) with respect to the 2018 PSUs, by (i) deeming 33% of the target number of shares earned and entitled to vest and (ii) multiplying the target number of shares by 66% of the remaining target share amount and finally (iii) multiplying the sum of (i) and (ii) by $40.97, and (2) with respect to the 2017 PSUs, by (i) deeming 66% of the target number of shares earned and entitled to vest and (ii) multiplying the target number of shares by 33% of the remaining target share amount and finally (iii) multiplying the sum of (i) and (ii) by $40.97. 
(2) Pursuant to the terms of the stock option, RSU award and PSU award agreements issued under the 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan, vesting of these equity awards 
Executive Compensation 
CEO Pay Ratio generally continues on the same schedule after retirement or termination of employment due to disability. 
(3) Pursuant to the terms of the stock option and RSU awards issued prior to 2017 under the 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan, vesting and exercisability of these equity awards are accelerated in full upon a change in control. However, beginning in 2017, the company made the RSU awards as well as the PSU awards subject to a double trigger vesting and payout mechanism upon a change in control, meaning that only if (i) within 24 months after the change in control, one of our executive officer's employment is terminated without cause or he or she resigns for good reason or (ii) the surviving entity in the change of control does not continue, assume, or replace the awards, the RSU awards will accelerate in full and the PSU awards will accelerate on a pro rata basis as described in footnote 1 above. Therefore, this column excludes the 2017 RSU and PSU awards as well as the 2018 RSU and PSU awards and only includes unvested 2016 RSU awards. The amounts shown with respect to 2016 RSU awards were calculated by multiplying the number of units as to which accelerated vesting and settlement occurs by $40.97, the closing sale price of a share of our common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2018. The amounts shown with respect to stock options were calculated with respect to options that were "in the money" as of December 31, 2018 and were determined by multiplying the number of shares subject to each option as to which accelerated vesting occurs by the difference between $40.97, the closing sale price of a share of our common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2018, and the exercise price of the applicable stock option. 
(4) Pursuant to the terms of the stock option and RSU awards issued prior to 2017 under the 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan, vesting and exercisability of these equity awards are accelerated in full upon a change in control. However, beginning in 2017, the company made the RSU awards as well as the PSU awards subject to a double trigger vesting and payout mechanism upon a change in control, meaning that only if (i) within 24 months after the change in control, one of our executive officer's employment is terminated without cause or he or she resigns for good reason or (ii) the surviving entity in the change of control does not continue, assume, or replace the awards, the RSU awards will accelerate in full and the PSU awards will accelerate on a pro rata basis as described in footnote 1 above. Therefore, this column includes (i) all unexercisable options, (ii) all unvested RSU awards, and (iii) a portion of the unvested PSU awards (calculated in the manner set forth in footnote 1). The amounts shown with respect to stock options were calculated with respect to options that were "in the money" as of December 31, 2018 and were determined by multiplying the number of shares subject to each option as to which accelerated vesting occurs by the difference between $40.97, the closing sale price of a share of our common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2018, and the exercise price of the applicable stock option. The amounts shown with respect to RSU and PSU awards was calculated by multiplying the number of units as to which accelerated vesting and settlement occurs by $40.97, the closing sale price of a share of our common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2018. 
(5) Because this named executive officer is not yet eligible for retirement under the terms of the ADM Retirement Plan, no current termination of employment would be considered "retirement" under any of the applicable equity-based compensation plans. 
CEO PAY RATIO 
For our fiscal year 2018 pay ratio analysis, we determined that we could use the same median employee that we identified last year, as permitted by SEC rules. There has been no change in either our employee population or our employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact our fiscal year 2018 pay ratio disclosure. Similarly, there has been no change in our median employee's circumstances that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change to our fiscal year 2018 pay ratio disclosure. 
Our median employee's annual total compensation for fiscal year 2018 was $51,087. The annual total compensation of our Chairman and CEO for fiscal year 2018 was $19,657,304. The ratio between the Chairman and CEO's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our median employee is 385:1. 
With respect to our median employee, we identified and calculated the elements of the employee's annual total compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K and also included $6,034 as the estimated value of the median employee's 2018 employer-paid health care and basic life and short-term disability insurance premiums. With respect to the annual total compensation of our Chairman and CEO, we used the amount reported in the Summary Compensation Table and also included $19,770 as the estimated value of our Chairman and CEO's 2018 employer-paid health care and basic life and short-term disability insurance premiums. 
Director Compensation 
Director Compensation for Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019 
For fiscal year 2018, our standard compensation for non-employee directors consists of an annual retainer in the amount of $300,000. With respect to the $300,000 annual retainer, $175,000 must be paid in stock units pursuant to our Stock Unit Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The remaining portion of the annual retainer may be paid in cash, stock units, or a combination of both, at the election of each non-employee director. Each stock unit is deemed for valuation and bookkeeping purposes to be the equivalent of a share of our common stock. In addition to the annual retainer, our Lead Director received a stipend in the amount of $30,000, the chairman of the Audit Committee received a stipend in the amount of $25,000, the chairman of the Compensation/Succession Committee received a stipend in the amount of $20,000, and the chairman of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee received a stipend in the amount of $15,000. All such stipends are paid in cash. We do not pay fees for attendance at board and committee meetings. Directors are reimbursed for out-of-pocket traveling expenses incurred in attending board and committee meetings. Directors may also be provided with certain perquisites from time to time. 
Stock units are credited to the account of each non-employee director on a quarterly basis in an amount determined by dividing the quarterly amount of the retainer to be paid in stock units by the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the last business day of that quarter, and are fully-vested at all times. As of any date on which cash dividends are paid on our common stock, each director's stock unit account is also credited with stock units in an amount determined by dividing the dollar value of the dividends that would have been paid on the stock units in that director's account had those units been actual shares by the fair market value of a share of our stock on the dividend payment date. For purposes of this plan, the "fair market value" of a share of our common stock on any date is the average of the high and low reported sales prices for our stock on the NYSE on that date. Each stock unit is paid out in cash on the first business day following the earlier of (i) five years after the end of the calendar year that includes the quarter for which that stock unit was credited to the director's account, and (ii) when the director ceases to be a member of the Board. The amount to be paid will equal the number of stock units credited to a director's account multiplied by the fair market value of a share of our stock on the payout date. A director may elect to defer the receipt of these payments in accordance with the plan. 
We currently contemplate that the director compensation for fiscal 2019 will remain the same as fiscal 2018. 
The following table summarizes compensation provided to each non-employee director for services provided during fiscal year 2018.

Director Compensation 
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
(1) As described above, $175,000 of the annual retainer of $300,000 is paid in stock units, which are reported in the "Stock Awards" column. In addition, our directors may elect to receive the remaining portion of the annual retainer in the form of cash, stock units, or a combination of both. For fiscal year 2018, Mr. Boeckmann elected to receive his entire annual retainer in the form of stock units. 
(2) The amounts set forth in this column represent the grant date fair value of stock unit grants to each of the listed directors computed in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718. Each of the listed directors is a non-employee director and the fair value of services provided by each director has been used to calculate the number of stock units credited to each director by dividing the quarterly fair value of the services provided by the fair market value of a share of our company's common stock on the last business day of the quarter. For purposes of this plan, the "fair market value" of a share of our common stock on any date is the average of the high and low reported sales prices for our stock on the NYSE on that date. The fair value of services provided by each of the directors has been determined to be $75,000 per quarter. The aggregate number of stock units credited to the account of each non-employee director as of December 31, 2018 (including mandatory stock unit grants, voluntary elections to receive stock units, and the deemed reinvestment of dividends) was as follows:

(4) Mr. Burke was elected to the Board of Directors at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 3, 2018, and his annual non-employee director compensation was prorated to reflect his period of service during 2018. 
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Our company has guidelines regarding ownership of shares of our common stock by our non-employee directors. These guidelines call for non-employee directors to own shares of common stock (including stock units issued pursuant to the Stock Unit Plan for Non-Employee Directors) over time with a fair market value of not less than five times the amount of the maximum cash portion of the annual retainer. Application of these guidelines will consider the time each director has served on the Board of Directors, as well as stock price fluctuations that may impact the achievement of the five times cash retainer ownership guidelines. 
We prohibit non-employee directors from pledging company securities if they have not met stock ownership guidelines, and we require our non-employee directors to obtain approval from our General Counsel before pledging company securities.

REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Various policies and procedures of our company, including our Code of Conduct, our bylaws, the charter of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, and annual questionnaires completed by all of our directors and executive officers, require the directors and executive officers to disclose and otherwise identify to the company the transactions or relationships that may constitute conflicts of interest or otherwise require disclosure under applicable SEC rules as "related person transactions" between our company or its subsidiaries and related persons. For these purposes, a related person is a director, executive officer, nominee for director, or 5% stockholder of the company since the beginning of the last fiscal year and their immediate family members. 
Although the company's processes vary with the particular transaction or relationship, in accordance with our Code of Conduct, directors, executive officers, and other company employees are directed to inform appropriate supervisory personnel as to the existence or potential existence of such a transaction or relationship. To the extent a related person is involved in the relationship or has a material interest in the transaction, the company's practice, although not part of a written policy, is to refer consideration of the matter to the Board or the Audit Committee. The transaction or relationship will be evaluated by the Board or the Audit Committee, which will approve or ratify it if it is determined that the transaction or relationship is fair and in the best interests of the company. Generally, transactions and series of related transactions of less than $120,000 are approved or ratified by appropriate company supervisory personnel and are not approved or ratified by the Board or a committee thereof.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the brother of C. Cuddy, one of our executive officers, was employed by our company as a vice president of our Golden Peanut and Tree Nut business. Such relationship was considered by the Audit Committee and found to be fair and in the best interests of our company. 
Report of the Audit Committee 
Report of the Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee provides assistance to the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility to the stockholders relating to the Company's (i) financial statements and the financial reporting process, (ii) preparation of the financial reports and other financial information provided by the Company to any governmental or regulatory body, (iii) systems of internal accounting and financial controls, (iv) internal audit functions, (v) annual independent audit of the Company's financial statements, (vi) major risk exposures, (vii) legal compliance and ethics programs as established by management and the Board, (viii) related-party transactions, and (ix) performance of the compliance function. 
The Audit Committee assures that the corporate information gathering, analysis and reporting systems developed by management represent a good faith attempt to provide senior management and the Board of Directors with information regarding material acts, events, and conditions within the Company. In addition, the Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent auditor. The Audit Committee ensures that the Company establishes, resources, and maintains a professional internal auditing function and that there are no unjustified restrictions or limitations imposed on such function. The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of the internal audit function and reviews and approves the actions relating to the Company's General Auditor, including performance appraisals and related base and incentive compensation. The Audit Committee is comprised of five independent directors, all of whom are financially literate and one of whom (T. K. Crews, the Chairman) has been determined by the Board of Directors to be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 
Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal controls. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements in the annual report with management, including a discussion of the quality — not just the acceptability — of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. Also, the Audit Committee discussed with management education regarding compliance with the policies and procedures of the Company as well as federal and state laws. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with the independent auditor, who is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, and the matters required to be discussed by the applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") standards including their judgment as to the quality — not just the acceptability — of the Company's accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. In addition, the Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditor required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent auditor the auditor's independence from management and the Company. The Audit Committee has adopted an Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the independent auditor's independence. The Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board of Directors approved) a hiring policy related to current and former employees of the independent auditor. 
The Committee discussed the Company's major risk exposures, the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, and guidelines and policies to govern the Company's risk assessment and risk management processes. 
The meetings of the Audit Committee are designed to facilitate and encourage communication among the Audit Committee, the Company, the Company's internal audit function and the Company's independent auditor. The Audit Committee discussed with the internal and independent auditors the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee met with the internal and independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the accounting and financial controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. The Audit Committee met individually with members of management in executive session. The Audit Committee held nine meetings during fiscal year 2018. 
Report of the Audit Committee 
Report of the Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee recognizes the importance of maintaining the independence of the Company's independent auditor, both in fact and appearance. Each year, the Audit Committee evaluates the qualifications, performance, tenure and independence of the Company's independent auditor and determines whether to re-engage the current independent auditor. In doing so, the Audit Committee considers the quality and efficiency of the services provided by the auditors, the auditors' global capabilities and the auditors' technical expertise and knowledge of the Company's operations and industry. Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as independent auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. The members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe that, due to Ernst & Young LLP's knowledge of the Company and of the industries in which the Company operates, it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to continue retention of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Company's independent auditor. Although the Audit Committee has the sole authority to appoint the independent auditors, the Board is submitting the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board of Directors approved) that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

Proposal No. 2 
Proposal No. 2 — Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit the company's financial statements. The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as our company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Ernst & Young LLP, or its predecessor firms, has served as our independent registered public accounting firm for more than 85 years. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with our company's retention of Ernst & Young LLP. In order to assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be regular rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm. In conjunction with the required rotation of Ernst & Young LLP's lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its Chairman are directly involved in the selection of Ernst & Young LLP's new lead engagement partner. 
We are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Although ratification is not required by our bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to our stockholders as a matter of good corporate practice. The members of the Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors, believe that the continued retention of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the company's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of our company and its stockholders. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will attend the annual meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Proxies solicited by the Board will be so voted unless stockholders specify a different choice.

AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES 
The Audit Committee has adopted an Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy. This policy provides that audit services engagement terms and fees, and any changes in such terms or fees, are subject to the specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The policy further provides that all other audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and permitted non-audit services are subject to pre-approval by the Audit Committee. All of the services Ernst & Young LLP performed for us during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. 
Proposal No. 3 
Proposal No. 3 — Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the following proposal provides our stockholders with an opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement. In considering your vote, you may wish to review the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" discussion herein, which provides details as to our compensation policies, procedures, and decisions regarding the named executive officers, as well as the Summary Compensation Table and other related compensation tables, notes, and narrative disclosures in this proxy statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific element of our executive compensation program, but rather the overall compensation program for our named executive officers. 
The Compensation/Succession Committee, which is comprised entirely of independent directors, and the Board of Directors believe that the executive compensation policies, procedures, and decisions made with respect to our named executive officers are competitive, are based on our pay-for-performance philosophy, and are focused on achieving our company's goals and enhancing stockholder value. 
Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above and in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement, the Board asks our stockholders to vote FOR the adoption of the following resolution to be presented at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2019: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the compensation tables, and the related narrative disclosure in this Proxy Statement. 
Although this advisory vote is not binding on the Board of Directors, the Board and the Compensation/Succession Committee will review and expect to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the advisory resolution on the compensation of our company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement. Proxies solicited by the Board will be so voted unless stockholders specify a different choice. 
Submission of Stockholder Proposals and Other Matters 
Deadline for Submission of Stockholder Proposals 
Proposals of stockholders, including nominations for director, intended to be presented at the next annual meeting and desired to be included in our proxy statement for that meeting must be received by the Secretary, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, 77 West Wacker Drive, Suite 4600, Chicago, Illinois 60601, no later than November 23, 2019, and, in the case of nominations for director, no earlier than October 24, 2019, in order to be included in such proxy statement. These proposals and nominations must also meet all the relevant requirements of our bylaws in order to be included in our proxy statement. Generally, if written notice of any stockholder proposal intended to be presented at the next annual meeting, and not included in our proxy statement for that meeting, is not delivered to the Secretary at the above address between February 1, 2020 and March 2, 2020 (or, if the next annual meeting is called for a date that is not within the period from April 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020, if such notice is not so delivered by the close of business on the tenth day following the earlier of the date on which notice of the date of such annual meeting is mailed or public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting is made), or if such notice does not contain the information required by Section 1.4(c) of our bylaws, the chair of the annual meeting may declare that such stockholder proposal be disregarded. 
STOCKHOLDERS WITH THE SAME ADDRESS 
Individual stockholders sharing an address with one or more other stockholders may elect to "household" the mailing of the proxy statement and our annual report. This means that only one annual report and proxy statement will be sent to that address unless one or more stockholders at that address specifically elect to receive separate mailings. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. Also, householding will not affect dividend check mailings. We will promptly send a separate annual report and proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address on request. Stockholders with a shared address may also request us to send separate annual reports and proxy statements in the future, or to send a single copy in the future if we are currently sending multiple copies to the same address. 
Requests related to householding should be made in writing and addressed to Investor Relations, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, 4666 Faries Parkway, Decatur, Illinois 62526-5666, or by calling our Investor Relations at 217-424-5656. If you are a stockholder whose shares are held by a bank, broker, or other nominee, you can request information about householding from your bank, broker, or other nominee. 
OTHER MATTERS 
It is not contemplated or expected that any business other than that pertaining to the subjects referred to in this proxy statement will be brought up for action at the meeting, but in the event that other business does properly come before the meeting calling for a stockholders' vote, the named proxies will vote thereon according to their best judgment in the interest of our company.

Annex A 
Definition and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures 
DEFINITION AND RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES 
We use Adjusted ROIC to mean "Adjusted ROIC Earnings" divided by "Adjusted Invested Capital". Adjusted ROIC Earnings is the Company's net earnings attributable to controlling interests adjusted for the after-tax effects of interest expense, changes in the LIFO reserve, and other specified items. Adjusted Invested Capital is the average of quarter-end amounts for the trailing four quarters, with each such quarter-end amount being equal to the sum of the Company's equity (excluding noncontrolling interests), interest-bearing liabilities, the after-tax effect of the LIFO reserve, and other specified items. Management uses Adjusted ROIC to measure the Company's performance by comparing Adjusted ROIC to the Company's weighted average cost of capital, or WACC. 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization, adjusted for specified items. Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of certain specified items. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are useful measures of the Company's performance because they provide investors additional information about the Company's operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. 
Adjusted economic value added (EVA) is the Company's trailing four-quarter economic value added adjusted for LIFO and other specified items. The Company calculates economic value added by comparing ADM's trailing four-quarter adjusted returns to its Annual WACC multiplied by adjusted invested capital. Adjusted EVA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace or be an alternative to GAAP financial measures. 
Adjusted ROIC, Adjusted ROIC Earnings, Adjusted Invested Capital, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures and are not intended to replace or be alternatives to GAAP financial measures. The following tables present reconciliations of Adjusted ROIC Earnings to net earnings attributable to controlling interests, the most directly comparable amount reported under GAAP; of Adjusted Invested Capital to Total Shareholders' Equity, the most directly comparable amount reported under GAAP; of Adjusted EBITDA to earnings before income taxes, the most directly comparable amount reported under GAAP; of Adjusted EPS to diluted EPS, the most directly comparable amount reported under GAAP; and the calculations of Adjusted EVA and Adjusted ROIC for the period ended December 31, 2018.
