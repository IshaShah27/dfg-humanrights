Proxy Statement
Annual Meeting of Shareholders
April 18, 2019
INTRODUCTION
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Board of Directors ("Board") of           Eagle Capital Growth Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Fund"), to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders ("Meeting"), to be held at the Milwaukee Bar Association, Board Conference Room, 747 North Broadway Street, Milwaukee,           Wisconsin 53202, at 9:30 A.M. local time on Thursday, April 18, 2019.  The approximate mailing date of this Proxy Statement is March 8, 2019.                      
All properly executed proxies received prior to the Meeting will be voted at the Meeting in accordance with the instructions marked           thereon or otherwise as provided therein.  Unless instructions to the contrary are marked, proxies will be voted "FOR" the election of three directors to 3-year terms as described in this Proxy Statement (Proposal 1) and "FOR" the ratification of           the independent registered public accountants (Proposal 2).   Any shareholder giving a proxy has the power to revoke it at any time before it is exercised by filing a later dated proxy with us, by attending the meeting and voting in person, or by           notifying us of the revocation in writing to our Secretary at the Fund, 225 East Mason Street, Suite 802, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202-3657.
The Fund's Board has fixed the close of business on February 22, 2019, as the Record Date for the determination of shareholders           entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting, and at any adjournment thereof.  Shareholders on the Record Date will be entitled to one vote for each share held, with no shares having cumulative voting rights.  As of the Record Date, the Fund           had outstanding 3,892,707 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Common Stock").  One-third of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, present or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum.  For purposes of a quorum, abstentions and           broker non-votes are included.  A quorum must exist to conduct business at the Meeting.  A "broker non-vote" occurs when you own shares through a bank or broker in "street" name and you fail to provide your bank or broker with voting instructions           and the bank or broker does not have the discretionary authority to vote your shares on a particular proposal.  A broker non-vote may also occur if your broker fails to vote your shares for any reason.
Brokers, banks and other nominees are not permitted to vote on the election of directors without specific instructions from the           beneficial owner.  Therefore, if your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee, they will not be voted in the election of directors unless you affirmatively vote your shares in one of the ways described below.  If you are a           beneficial owner, your broker, bank or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on the ratification of Plante & Moran, PLLC as the Fund's independent registered public accountants even if the broker, bank or other nominee does not           receive specific voting instructions from you. Under the NYSE's Proxy Rules, NYSE member organizations may vote discretionarily on all matters to be acted upon at this           Meeting.  This is based upon the assumption that no contest will arise as to any of the matters being considered and beneficial owners are advised as to this discretionary action.
The Fund will pay all the expenses of preparing, assembling, printing and mailing the material used in the solicitation of proxies by           the Board.  In addition to the solicitation of proxies by use of the mails, our officers may solicit proxies on behalf of the Board, by telephone, telegram or personal interview, and the Fund will bear these expenses.  The Fund may arrange with           brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward soliciting materials to the beneficial owners of Fund shares, and the Fund will pay or reimburse these expenses.
The Board knows of no business, other than as identified in Proposals 1 and 2 of the Notice of Meeting, which will be presented for           consideration at the Meeting.  If any other matter is properly presented, the persons named in the enclosed proxy intend to vote in their discretion.
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be Held on           Thursday, April 18, 2019, at 9:30 A.M. local time at Milwaukee Bar Association, Board Conference Room, 747 North Broadway Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202.  Our Notice of Annual Meeting, Proxy Statement, form of proxy card and annual report are           available at http://www.eaglecapitalgrowthfund.com/proxy

PROPOSAL NO. 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Three (3) Class III directors will be elected at the Meeting for 3-year terms, and until their successors are elected and qualified.            The Board is divided into three classes (Class I, Class II, and Class III).   The Class III directors, Mr. Luke E. Sims, Mr. Donald G. Tyler, and Mr. Neal F. Zalenko are up for reelection at the Meeting.
Unless authorization to do so is withheld, proxies will be voted for the election of the nominees named below.  Each nominee has           consented to being named in this Proxy Statement and to continue to serve as a director if elected.  Directors will be elected by a plurality of votes cast at the Meeting.  Thus, assuming the presence of a quorum, those nominees for election as           director receiving the highest number of votes will be elected, regardless of the number of votes which for any reason, including abstentions, broker non-votes or withholding of authority to vote, are not cast for the election of such nominee.            If any nominee becomes unavailable for election, an event not now anticipated by the Board, the proxies may be voted for such other nominee as may be designated by the Board.
Listed below are all nominees and their backgrounds. An "interested person" of the Fund ("Interested Person") is a person who is an           Interested Person of the Fund within the meaning of Section 2(a) (19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.   Nominee Luke E. Sims is an Interested Person.

Nominee and Director Qualifications
The Fund believes that Warren Buffett and Charles Munger of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. have succinctly identified the key           qualifications for corporate directors and nominees for director:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  High integrity;  
  2.  Business savvy;  
  3.  A shareholder orientation; and  
  4.  A genuine interest in the company.  
[END TABLE]
We believe that all of our nominees and continuing directors satisfy these requirements.  In addition, the Board concluded           that the experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills of the nominees, set forth below, qualify the nominees to serve as directors of the Fund in light of the Fund's business and structure.
The Fund does not have a diversity policy for its Board members, based upon gender, race or similar physical characteristics           because those characteristics are not necessarily relevant to the traits that the Fund looks for in its directors.  The Fund considers a person's experience, qualifications, skills, and attributes generally, including, but not limited to, a           person's professional, academic, and business background.
As noted elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, the non-executive position of Chairman and the position of Chief Executive           Officer (CEO) are held by different individuals.  The Chairman of the Board is not an Interested Person.  The Fund believes that the separation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles provides constructive checks and balances for           shareholders of the Fund.

Board Meetings and Committees; Annual Meeting Attendance
          The Board held three (3) meetings during 2018.  Each director attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and committees of           the Board on which he or she served during 2018.  The Fund has only one committee, the Audit Committee.  The Fund has no nominating or compensation committees.  The Board does not currently have a policy with regard to the attendance of directors           at its annual meeting of shareholders.  All of the directors attended the Fund's 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, either in person or by telephone.
Shareholder Communications
Shareholders may send communications to the Board (to the attention of the Fund's Secretary) at the Fund's principal executive           office.  All shareholder communications shall be compiled by the Secretary and forwarded directly to the Board or the director as indicated in the letter.  The Board reserves the right to revise this procedure in the event that it is abused or           becomes unworkable.
Nominating Committee
The Board does not have a standing nominating committee or committee performing similar functions as the Board has determined, given           its relatively small size, to perform this function as a whole.  The Board does not currently have a charter or other written policy with regard to the nomination process, or a formal policy with respect to the consideration of director           candidates.  The nominations of the directors standing for reelection at the Meeting were approved by the Board. Messrs. Bilkie, Hanrahan, Holth, Tyler and Zalenko and Ms. Schmeltz are independent directors under the rules of the NYSE American           LLC.   Mr. Luke E. Sims, who is the Fund's President and Chief Executive Officer, is an Interested Person and is not an independent director under the rules of the NYSE American LLC.  Mr. David C. Sims, who is an officer of the Fund and a           director of the Fund, is an Interested Person and is not an independent director under the rules of the NYSE American LLC.
Qualifications for consideration as a Board nominee may vary according to the particular areas of expertise being sought as a           complement to the existing Board composition.  In making its nominations, the Board considers relevant factors, including an individual's business experience, breadth of knowledge about issues and matters affecting the Fund, time availability for           meetings and consultation regarding Fund matters, and other particular skills and experience.  The Board desires of candidates who possess the background, skills and expertise to make a significant contribution to the Board, the Fund and its           shareholders.  In the event of a need for a new or additional director, the Board will evaluate potential nominees by reviewing their qualifications, results of personal interviews and such other information as the Board may deem relevant.
The Fund does not employ an executive search, firm, or pay a fee to any other third party, to assist in identifying or evaluating           potential qualified candidates for director.  Since 1989, the Board has nominated the current directors for reelection at each annual meeting of shareholders, except that starting with the Fund's 2013 annual meeting directors have been nominated           and elected to staggered terms.  Ms. Schmeltz and Mr. Holth have served as directors since 1989.   Mr. Luke E. Sims has served as a director since 2002.  Mr. Bilkie has served as a director since 2006, and previously served as a Fund director           from July 1990 through May 1996.  Messrs. Hanrahan and Zalenko have each served as directors since 2008.  Mr. Tyler has served as director since 2010.  Mr. David C. Sims has served as a director since 2015.
The Board has not established special procedures for shareholders to submit director recommendations.  If the Secretary were to           receive a recommendation of a candidate from a Fund shareholder, he would submit it to the Board, and the Board would consider such recommendations in the same manner as all other candidates.
Audit Committee; Risk Management
The Fund has an Audit Committee, established in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, comprised of Messrs. Zalenko           (Chairman), Hanrahan, Holth and Tyler.
The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the Fund's independent           accountants.   Each of Messrs. Zalenko, Hanrahan, Holth and Tyler meets the requirements for independence set forth in the rules of the NYSE American LLC.  The Fund's Board has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee.  The charter can           be found on the Fund's website at http://eaglecapitalgrowthfund.com under "Corporate Governance".  The Audit Committee reviews and considered the Audit Committee           charter at least annually.
The Audit Committee met twice during 2018. The current members of the Audit Committee, Messrs. Zalenko, Hanrahan, Holth and Tyler meet           the requirements for independence set forth in the rules of the NYSE American Exchange.  They are not Interested Persons of the Fund as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940.  Under the Fund's By-laws, the Chairman is a non-executive,           non-officer position.  Each of Messrs. Zalenko, Hanrahan, Holth and Tyler has been determined to be an "audit committee financial expert" as such term is defined in SEC rules.  A copy of the report of the Audit Committee is attached hereto as           Exhibit A.
Investment funds generally face a number of risks, including investment risk, compliance risk, and valuation risk.  The           Fund, as a diversified regulated investment company, doesn't have any unique or unusual risks that it needs to manage.  The Fund attempts to minimize risks.  All of the Fund's cash and securities are held by its independent custodian.  Moreover,           the Fund's investments consist solely of marketable securities, and primarily large capitalization companies.   The Board as a whole receives reports about the Fund's transactions and discusses such transactions with management and its investment           advisor.  At such meetings the Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Board about the Fund's compliance status.
Investment Advisor
The Fund's investment advisor is Sims Capital Management LLC.  Luke E. Sims, a director, President and Chief Executive Officer of the           Fund, and David C. Sims, a director, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Treasurer and Secretary of the Fund, are the managers of the Advisor.  See the earlier discussion in this Proxy Statement for further information about Luke           E. Sims and David C. Sims, respectively.  At the Fund's 2007 annual meeting of shareholders, the shareholders approved the investment advisory agreement ("Advisory Agreement") between the Fund and the Advisor.  The Advisory Agreement has been           mutually extended by the Fund and the Advisor through February 2020.
The Advisor's address is the same as that of the principal executive office of the Fund.  The Fund is one of the Advisor's two           institutional advisory clients.  No other person provided any significant administrative or business affairs management services to the Fund during 2018.  No continuing director or nominee for election as director, who is not an Interested           Person, nor any of their immediate family members, is the record or beneficial owner of any securities in the Advisor or any of its affiliates.
The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the election of the three (3) nominees, Mr. Luke E.           Sims, Mr. Donald G. Tyler and Mr. Neal F. Zalenko, for the 3-year terms identified above.
PROPOSAL NO. 2 – SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
Plante & Moran, PLLC, independent registered public accountants, has been selected by the Audit Committee to examine the Fund's           financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019.  Unless a contrary specification is made, the accompanying proxy will be voted in favor of ratifying the selection of such accountants.  A majority vote of the shares cast is required to           approve the ratification of the selection of accountants.  Under Maryland law, abstentions do not constitute a vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" a matter and will be disregarded in determining the votes cast.  Broker non-votes with respect to shares           entitled to vote will have no effect on the vote on this proposal.  Representatives of Plante & Moran, PLLC are not expected to be available at the Meeting.  If any Fund shareholder wishes to pose a question to Plante & Moran PPLC, we           recommend that you put it in writing and direct it to the Fund's Secretary at: dave@simscapital.com . We will see that you receive an approximate written response.
Audit Fees.  The Fund paid Plante & Moran, PLLC           $17,000 for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, and $18,000 for the calendar year ended December 31, 2017, for audit fees.
Audit-Related Fees.  The Fund did not pay Plante &           Moran, PLLC any audit-related fees in either of the last two calendar years.
Tax Fees.  The Fund paid Plante & Moran, PLLC $5,500           for the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, and $5,500 for the calendar year ended December 31, 2017, for tax fees in connection with the preparation of the Fund's tax returns and assistance with Internal Revenue Service notice and tax           matters.
All Other Fees.  The Fund did not pay Plante & Moran,           PLLC any other amounts in either of the last two calendar years.
"Audit fees" are fees paid by the Fund to Plante & Moran, PLLC for professional services for the audit of our financial           statements, or for services that are usually provided by an auditor in connection with statutory and regulatory filings and engagements. "Audit-related fees" are fees for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the           performance of the audit or review of financial statements. "Tax fees" are fees for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. All other Fund fees are fees billed for any services not included in the first three categories.
None of the services covered under the captions "Audit-Related Fees," "Tax Fees," and "All Other Fees" with respect to Plante &           Moran, PLLC were provided under the de minimis exception to Audit Committee approval of 17 CFR 210.2-01(c) 7(i)(C) and (ii) Plante & Moran, PLLC was           not engaged during the last two calendar years to provide non-audit services to the Fund or to the Advisor or any of its affiliates that provide ongoing services to the Fund ("Other Non-Audit Services").  Under the Audit Committee charter, the           Audit Committee must approve in advance all non-audit services of the Fund and all Other Non-Audit Services.  The Audit Committee has not adopted "pre-approval policies and procedures" as such term is used in 17 CFR 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(B) and (ii).
The Board recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the ratification of Plante & Moran, PLLC as the independent           registered public accountants to examine the Fund's financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Directors and officers of the Fund and certain of its affiliates and beneficial owners of more than 10% of the Common Stock are           required to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of the Common Stock pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  The Fund has reviewed such reports received by it and written           representations of such persons who are known by the Fund and, based solely upon such review, the Fund believes that, during the year ended December 31, 2018, filings were timely filed, except two filings.  As of the Record Date, to the best of           the Fund's knowledge, all such filings are current.
PROPOSALS OF SHAREHOLDERS
Shareholder proposals for the 20202 annual meeting of shareholders must comply with applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange           Commission (including Rule 14a-8) and be received by the Fund at 225 East Mason Street, Suite 802, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202-3657 before the close of business on November 18, 2019, for consideration for inclusion in the Fund's proxy statement.            Shareholder proposals should be addressed to the attention of the Fund's Secretary.
MISCELLANEOUS
The Board is not aware of any other business that will be presented for action at the Meeting.  If any other business properly comes           before the Meeting, proxies received from shareholders will be voted at the discretion of the named individuals.

REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE

To the Board of Directors of the Eagle Capital Growth Fund, Inc.:
We have reviewed and discussed with management the Fund's audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.
We have discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1 AU Section 380) as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T.
We have received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accountants required by applicable requirements           of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and have discussed with the independent accountants the independent accountants'           independence.
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, we recommend to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements referred to above be           included in the Fund's annual report to shareholders required by Section 30(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 30d-1 thereunder for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
