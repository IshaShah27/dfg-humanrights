Proxy Forms
Registered stockholders may vote in person at the Annual Meeting by completing a ballot or by submitting their pre-printed proxy form. Beneficial stockholders that desire to vote in person at the Annual Meeting must obtain a legal proxy form from the brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee and present it to the inspector of election with their ballot. The inspector of election at the Annual Meeting has access to the registered stockholder's list to verify whether a registered stockholder is entitled to vote as of the Record Date. However, the inspector of election does not have access to the control number verification system that brokerage firms, banks, trusts and other nominees use to verify whether a beneficial stockholder is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. See "Frequently Asked Questions – 7. How do I vote if I am a beneficial stockholder?" for more information on voting shares held through a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee.

Fellow Stockholders:
 Although 2018 has been no less challenging than 2016 and 2017, we continue to weather the storm. Significant milestones this year include:
 (1)
Positive EBITDA-- For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, EBITDA(1)for refinery operations was positive at $2.8 million compared to a loss of $20.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. EBITDA for tolling and terminaling operations was also positive at $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. We did not report tolling and terminaling operations as a separate business segment in 2017;
 (2)
GEL Settlement Agreement -- In July 2018, GEL Tex Marketing, LLC ("GEL") and the Lazarus Parties(2)entered into a Settlement Agreement whereby all parties agreed to mutually release all claims against each other and to file a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice in connection with the final arbitration award, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement. The most critical condition is a one-time payment to GEL of $10.0 million in cash; and
 (3)
Arbitration Award Balance Reduction -- To date, Lazarus Energy, LLC ("LE") has paid $9.2 million to GEL towards reducing the outstanding balance of the final arbitration award. After the $3.7 million initial payment to GEL in September 2017, LE has been making payments to GEL at $0.5 million per month.
We certainly have a long way to go, but I am encouraged by the progress that we continue to make. As always, I want to thank you, our stockholders, for your continued support. I also want to thank the folks that keep the business running every day -- our people. Together we are making headway, and I remain optimistic about our future.
With regards,

General
This proxy statement and accompanying notice and proxy form are being furnished to the stockholders of Blue Dolphin Energy Company (referred to herein as "Blue Dolphin," "we," "us" and "our") in connection with the solicitation of proxies by Blue Dolphin's Board of Directors (the "Board") for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") and any adjournment or postponement thereof.
Date, Time and Place
The Annual Meeting will be held on Thursday, December 27, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time at Blue Dolphin's principal office, which is located at 801 Travis Street, 21st Floor, Houston, Texas 77002.
Purpose
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders are being asked to consider and vote upon proposals to:
(1)
elect five (5) directors, all of whom shall serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders, or in each case until their successors are duly elected and qualified, or until their earlier resignation or removal;
(2)
ratify the selection of UHY LLP ("UHY") as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018; and
(3)
transact any other business that may properly come before the Annual Meeting.
Record Date; Who Is Entitled to Vote
The Board has fixed the close of business on November 5, 2018 as the record date (the "Record Date") for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. A list of registered stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be open for examination by any stockholder during normal business hours for a period of ten (10) days prior to the Annual Meeting at our principal office, which is located at 801 Travis Street, 21st Floor, Houston, Texas 77002. On the Record Date, there were 10,975,514 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), outstanding. Stockholders are entitled to one (1) vote per share of Common Stock held on the Record Date on each matter presented at the Annual Meeting.
Material Delivery
This proxy statement, along with its accompanying notice and proxy form, are first being mailed to stockholders on or about November 16, 2018. We are also mailing an insert notifying stockholders that our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (the "Annual Report") is available online.
Quorum
The holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting and represented in person or by proxy shall constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting for the transaction of business. Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
 Abstentions – If a stockholder abstains from voting on a proposal, the shares are considered present and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Therefore, abstentions will count toward determining whether or not a quorum is present. Under Delaware law, a proxy marked "abstain" is not considered a vote cast. Accordingly, an abstention will have no effect on the proposal regarding the election of directors, as the nominees are elected by a plurality of the votes cast. Abstentions on proposals that require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote and represented at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, will, in effect, be a vote against such matter.
 Broker Non-Votes – Broker non-votes occur when brokers, banks or other nominees that hold shares on behalf of beneficial ("street name") stockholders do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial stockholders prior to the Annual Meeting and do not have discretionary voting authority to vote those shares. Broker non-votes are considered present and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Therefore, broker non-votes will count toward determining whether or not a quorum is present. However, under New York Stock Exchange Rule 452, which has been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), brokers are prohibited from voting shares of Common Stock for which they have not received instructions on non-routine matters, including the election of directors.
Votes Required for Approval
With the exception of the election of directors, our By-Laws, as amended and restated (the "By-Laws"), require an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders present, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting for the proposal to be approved. The votes required for approval, and the impact of abstentions and broker non-votes for each proposal stockholders are being asked to consider and vote upon are as follows:
Proposal (1) — Election of Directors: You may vote "FOR" any one, or all, of the nominees, or withhold your vote for any one or more of the nominees. As the nominees are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, withheld votes and abstentions will not affect the outcome of this proposal. This proposal is considered a non-routine matter and brokers will not have discretionary authority to vote shares for which they have not received instructions; and
Proposal (2) — Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm: You may vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" or abstain from voting. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock entitled to vote and represented at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, is required to approve the ratification of UHY as our independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the ratification. Under applicable SEC rules, this proposal is considered a routine matter and brokers will have the discretionary authority to vote shares of Common Stock for which they have not received instructions.
Voting Your Shares
All shares of Common Stock represented at the Annual Meeting by properly executed proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated on the proxies. If no instructions are indicated with respect to any shares for which properly executed proxies have been received, such proxies will be voted "FOR" Proposal Nos. (1) and (2). Revoking Your Proxy
Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before it is voted. Proxies may be revoked pursuant to the following actions:
  -
providing written or electronic notice of revocation;
  -
submitting a proxy of a later date; or
  -
voting in person at the Annual Meeting.
A written notice of revocation should be sent to Blue Dolphin Energy Company, Attention: Secretary, 801 Travis Street, Suite 2100, Houston, Texas 77002. Depending on how you hold your shares, you can submit a proxy of a later date via the Internet, by telephone, by fax, or by mail.
 Where to Direct Questions
To assist you with casting your vote, we have attempted to answer key questions you may have as a stockholder related to the proposals you are being asked to consider. Please review the frequently asked questions (FAQs) section, which is included as part of this proxy statement. If you have any additional questions, please contact Blue Dolphin, Investor Relations at (713) 568-4725.
Reimbursement of Solicitation Expenses
Blue Dolphin will bear all costs of this solicitation. Proxies will be solicited primarily by mail, but may also be solicited in person, by telephone or other electronic means by directors, officers and employees of Blue Dolphin in the ordinary course of business, for which they will not receive additional compensation. Blue Dolphin has requested that brokers, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians send proxy materials to the beneficial owners of Common Stock, for which Blue Dolphin will reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

The FAQs presented in this section are to assist you in understanding the proposals you are being asked to vote upon for the Annual Meeting. The items addressed may not answer all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder. For additional information, please refer to the more detailed discussion contained elsewhere in this proxy statement or contact Blue Dolphin, Investor Relations at (713) 568-4725.
 Procedural Matters
1.
Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
You are receiving this proxy statement because you hold shares of Blue Dolphin Common Stock as of the Record Date for the Annual Meeting.
2.
What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy?
If you receive more than one proxy form, it means that you hold shares of Common Stock in more than one account. For example, you may own your shares of Common Stock individually, jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust, or as custodian for a minor. To ensure that all of your shares of Common Stock are voted, you will need to sign and return each proxy form received because they are held in a different form of ownership.
3.
Who is entitled to attend and vote at the Annual Meeting?
If you owned shares of Common Stock as of the close of business on November 5, 2018, you are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were approximately 10,975,514 shares of Common Stock and outstanding.
4.
When and where will the Annual Meeting be held?
The Annual Meeting will be held on Thursday, December 27, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time at Blue Dolphin's principal office, which is located at 801 Travis Street, 21st Floor, Houston, Texas 77002.
5.
What do I need to do now?
After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement, please vote your shares of Common Stock as described below. You are entitled to one (1) vote for each share of Common Stock you own as of the Record Date.
6.
How do I vote if I am a registered stockholder?
If your shares of Common Stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Securities Transfer Corporation, you are considered, with respect to those shares, the stockholder of record or a "registered stockholder." Registered stockholders may vote as follows: (i) by mail by completing, signing and dating each proxy form received and returning it in the enclosed prepaid envelope, (ii) by fax by completing, signing and dating each proxy form received and faxing to (202) 521-3464, (iii) via the Internet at https://www.iproxydirect.com/BDCO by following the instructions, or (iv) in person by attending the Annual Meeting. If voting by mail, fax, or the Internet, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern/10:59 p.m. Central Time on the date prior to the date of the Annual Meeting. Voting by mail, fax, or the Internet will not prevent you from voting in person at the Annual Meeting. You are encouraged to submit a proxy by mail, fax, or the Internet even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person to ensure that your shares of Common Stock are present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. 7.
How do I vote if I am a beneficial stockholder?
If your shares of Common Stock are held by a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, you are considered the "beneficial stockholder" of the shares of Common Stock being held in "street name." These proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other holder of record who is considered, with respect to those shares of Common Stock, the stockholder of record. As the beneficial stockholder, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other holder of record on how to vote your shares of Common Stock and you are invited to attend the Annual Meeting. Your broker, bank, trustee or nominee is obligated to provide you with a voting instruction form for voting purposes.
As a beneficial stockholder, you cannot vote your shares of Common Stock directly and must instead instruct the brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee on how to vote your shares of Common Stock. With specific instructions on how to vote, your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee will be permitted to vote shares of Common Stock on your behalf for any matter, including non-routine matters under SEC Rules. Proposal (1), regarding the election of directors, is considered a non-routine matter. Without instructions on how to vote, your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee will only be permitted to vote shares of Common Stock on your behalf for routine matters under applicable SEC rules. Proposal (2), regarding the ratification of UHY as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2018, is considered a routine matter. Therefore, it is important that you promptly follow the directions provided by your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee regarding how to instruct them to vote your shares of Common Stock. If you wish to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy form from the brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee and present it to the inspector of election with your ballot. If you hold some shares of Common Stock as a registered stockholder and some shares of Common Stock as a beneficial stockholder, the shares of Common Stock cannot be combined for voting purposes because the shares of Common Stock held beneficially list the brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee as the stockholder of record.
8.
What if I fail to instruct my brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee how to vote?
Because your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on non-routine matters, failure to provide your broker or other nominee with voting instructions on how to vote your shares of Common Stock will result in a broker non-vote for Proposal (1).
9.
What are the proposals that will be voted on at the Annual Meeting?
You are being asked to consider and vote upon proposals to: (1) elect five (5) directors, (2) ratify the selection of UHY as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2018, and (3) transact any other business that may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof.
10.
How does Blue Dolphin's Board recommend that I vote on the proposals?
The Board has determined that each of the proposals presented in the proxy statement are in the best interests of you -- our stockholder -- and unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" each proposal presented in the proxy statement.
11.
How many votes are required to approve an adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting to a later time, if necessary or appropriate, to obtain a quorum or solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposals?
If a quorum is not met, the Board may submit a proposal to adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting to a later date or dates until a quorum is met. If a quorum is met but there are insufficient votes to adopt the proposals, our By-Laws require the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in order to adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting to a later time. Withheld votes, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on this matter.
12.
How are votes counted?
The inspector of election that is appointed for the Annual Meeting will count the votes. Such person will separately count "FOR," "WITHHELD" and "AGAINST" votes, as well as abstentions and broker non-votes. 13.
What constitutes a quorum for the Annual Meeting?
The presence, in person or by proxy, of stockholders representing a majority of the shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum for the Annual Meeting. Shares of Common Stock held by registered stockholders that submit a properly executed proxy form will be counted as part of the quorum. Shares of Common Stock held by beneficial stockholders that either provide their brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee with voting instructions or obtain a legal proxy form for voting in person at the Annual Meeting will be counted as part of the quorum.
14.
Am I entitled to appraisal rights?
Under Delaware law, stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights with respect to any of the proposals presented at the Annual Meeting.
15.
What happens if I sell my shares of Blue Dolphin Common Stock before the Annual Meeting?
The date of record to determine whether stockholders are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is earlier than the date of the Annual Meeting. If you transfer or sell your shares of Common Stock after the Record Date but before the Annual Meeting, you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at the Annual Meeting.
16.
Who can answer further questions?
For additional questions, please contact Blue Dolphin, Investor Relations at (713) 568-4725. For assistance in submitting proxies or voting shares of Common Stock, registered stockholders should contact Securities Transfer Corporation by phone at (469) 633-0101 or visit their website at http://www.stctransfer.com. Beneficial stockholders should contact their brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee for additional information.
 Selection of UHY as Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 17.
 How long has UHY been our independent registered public accounting firm?
UHY has been engaged as our independent registered public accounting firm since 2002. Although ratification of UHY as our independent registered public accounting firm by our stockholders is not required by our By-Laws, the Board believes that submitting this matter to a vote reflects good corporate practice.
 18.
 What happens if UHY's selection is not ratified?
In the event of a negative vote on such ratification, the Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") will consider whether it is appropriate to select another independent registered public accounting firm. Even if this appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in our best interest and that of our stockholders.

 Director Nominees
The Board has affirmatively determined that each of Ryan A. Bailey, Amitav Misra, and Christopher T. Morris, each an outside director, is considered an "Independent Director" as such term is defined by OTCQX and SEC rules. Jonathan P. Carroll, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Herbert N. Whitney, are not considered independent directors. The independent members of the Board have nominated Messrs. Bailey, Misra, Morris, Carroll and Whitney to serve as directors until the next annual meeting of stockholders. Each director that has been nominated (each a "Director Nominee") shall serve as a director until the next annual meeting of stockholders, or in each case until their successors have been duly elected and qualified, or until their earlier resignation or removal.
Each Director Nominee has consented to being nominated and has expressed a willingness to serve if elected. The Board has no reason to believe that any of the Director Nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected. However, should any Director Nominee become unable or unwilling to serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, the person or persons exercising the proxies will vote for the election of a substitute Director Nominee designated by the Board.
This table shows, as of the Record Date, each Director Nominee's name, age, principal occupation and directorships during the past five (5) years, as well as their relevant knowledge and experience that led to their nomination to the Board:

    (2) RATIFICATION OF  INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  
[END TABLE]
 For additional information related to this matter, refer to the FAQs provided as part of this proxy statement.
For purposes of determining whether to select UHY as our independent registered public accounting firm to perform the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee conducted a thorough review of UHY's performance. The Audit Committee considered:
  -
UHY's performance on previous audits, including the quality of the engagement team and the firm's experience, client service, responsiveness and technical expertise;
  -
the firm's leadership, management structure and client and employee retention;
  -
the firm's financial strength and performance; and
  -
the appropriateness of fees charged.
UHY has acted as our principal independent registered public accounting firm since 2002. We are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection of UHY as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Although ratification is not required by our By-Laws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of UHY to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the selection is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Blue Dolphin and our stockholders.
A representative of UHY is expected to be available during the Annual Meeting, with the opportunity to make a statement if he or she decides to do so, and will respond to appropriate questions.

 MATTERS 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD
 MATTERS 
[END TABLE]
 Board
The Board consists of Messrs. Carroll, Bailey, Misra, Morris and Whitney, with Mr. Carroll serving as Chairman. During 2017, the Board met five (5) times and acted by written consent once. All directors participated in the meetings and acted by written consent. The Board has two standing committees, the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee.
 Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of Messrs. Morris, Bailey, and Misra, with Mr. Morris serving as Chairman. During 2017, the Audit Committee met five (5) times. The Board has affirmatively determined that all members of the Audit Committee are independent under OTCQX and SEC rules and that each of Messrs. Morris and Bailey qualifies as an Audit Committee Financial Expert. The Audit Committee's duties include overseeing financial reporting and internal control functions. The Audit Committee's written charter is available on our corporate website (http://www.blue-dolphin-energy.com). The Audit Committee charter is also included in this proxy statement as  Appendix A.
 Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee consists of Messrs. Morris, Bailey, and Misra, with Mr. Morris serving as Chairman. During 2017, the Compensation Committee did not meet. The Board has affirmatively determined that all members of the Compensation Committee are independent under OTCQX rules. The Compensation Committee's duties include setting and overseeing our compensation policies, as well as reviewing and recommending to the Board for its approval all compensation for the Chief Executive Officer, other senior executives, and directors. The Compensation Committee's written charter is available on our corporate website (http://www.blue-dolphin-energy.com). The Compensation Committee charter is also included in this proxy statement as  Appendix B.
 Master Limited Partnership ("MLP") Conversion Special Committee
The MLP Conversion Special Committee was formed by the Board in 2013 to determine the feasibility of optimizing stockholder value by potentially converting Blue Dolphin from a publicly traded "C" corporation to a publicly traded MLP. Due to a shift in market conditions, the MLP Conversion Special Committee was dissolved in March 2018. The MLP Conversion Special Committee did not meet during 2017.
 Nominating Committee
Given the small size of the Board, the Board adopted a "Board Nomination Procedures" policy in lieu of appointing a standing nominating committee. Using the "Board Nomination Procedures" policy, the Audit Committee, which is comprised of independent directors, uses the policy to perform in a similar function as a standing nominating committee. The policy is used by the independent directors when choosing nominees to stand for election. The Board will consider for possible nomination qualified nominees recommended by stockholders in accordance with Blue Dolphin's Certificate of Incorporation. As addressed in the "Board Nomination Procedures" policy, the manner in which independent directors evaluate nominees for director as recommended by a stockholder is the same as that for nominees received from other sources. (See "Director Nomination and Stockholder Proposals by Stockholders for Annual Meeting of Stockholders" in this proxy statement for more information). The Board endeavors to nominate qualified directors that will make important contributions to the Board and to Blue Dolphin. The Board generally requires that nominees be persons of sound ethical character, be able to represent all stockholders fairly, have demonstrated professional achievements, have meaningful experience, and have a general appreciation of the major business issues facing Blue Dolphin. The Board also considers issues of diversity and background in its selection process, recognizing that it is desirable for its membership to have differences in viewpoints, professional experiences, educational backgrounds, skills, race, gender, age and national origin.
 Director Attendance at Annual Meeting
 Given the small size of the Board, director attendance at our annual meeting of stockholders is encouraged but not required. Only Mr. Carroll was present at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders.
 Leadership Structure
Blue Dolphin is led by Mr. Carroll, who has served as Chairman of the Board since 2014 and as our Chief Executive Officer and President since 2012. Having a single leader for the Company is commonly utilized by other public companies in the United States, and we believe it is effective for Blue Dolphin as well. This leadership structure demonstrates to our personnel, customers and stockholders that we are under strong leadership, with a single person setting the tone and having primary responsibility for managing our operations, and eliminates the potential for confusion or duplication of efforts. We do not believe that appointing an independent Board chairman, or a permanent lead director, would improve upon the performance of the Board.
 Risk Oversight
Our Board is involved in overseeing Blue Dolphin's risk management. The two standing Board committees provide appropriate risk oversight. The Audit Committee oversees the accounting and financial reporting processes, as well as compliance, internal control, legal and risk matters. The Compensation Committee oversees compensation policies, including the approval of compensation for directors and management. We believe that the processes established to report and monitor systems for material risks applicable to us are appropriate and effective.
 Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct
In compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Board adopted a code of ethics policy and a code of conduct policy. The Audit Committee established procedures to enable anyone who has a concern about our conduct, policies, accounting, internal control over financial reporting, and/or auditing matters to communicate that concern directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The code of ethics and code of conduct policies are available to any stockholder, without charge, upon written request to Blue Dolphin Energy Company, Attention: Audit Committee Chairman, 801 Travis Street, Suite 2100, Houston, Texas 77002 or such other contact information for the Audit Committee Chairman that we may post on our website from time to time. Our code of ethics and code of conduct policies are also available on our website (http://www.blue-dolphin-energy.com). Any amendments or waivers to provisions of our code of ethics or code of conduct will be disclosed on Form 8-K as filed with the SEC and/or posted on our website.  Communicating with Directors
As the Board does not receive a large volume of correspondence from stockholders, at this time, there is no formal process by which stockholders can communicate with the Board. Instead, any stockholder who desires to contact the Board or specific members of the Board may do so by writing to: Blue Dolphin Energy Company, Attention: Secretary for the Board, 801 Travis Street, Suite 2100, Houston, Texas 77002. Currently, all communications addressed in such manner are sent directly to the indicated directors. In the future, if the Board adopts a formal process for determining how communications are to be relayed to directors, that process will be disclosed on Form 8-K as filed with the SEC and/or posted on our website (http://www.blue-dolphin-energy.com).

AUDIT COMMITTEE
 REPORT 
AUDIT COMMITTEE
 REPORT 
AUDIT COMMITTEE
 REPORT 
[END TABLE]
The duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set forth in a written charter adopted by the Board. The Audit Committee is comprised solely of independent directors who have the requisite financial experience and expertise and meet the requirements of OTCQX rules and SEC Rule 10A-3. The Audit Committee reviews and reassesses its written charter annually and recommends any changes to the Board for approval. In addition, the Audit Committee periodically reviews relevant requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as proposed and adopted rules of the SEC regarding Audit Committee procedures and responsibilities to ensure compliance. The Audit Committee charter is available on our website (http://www.blue-dolphin-energy.com). The Audit Committee charter is also included in this proxy statement as  Appendix A.
The Audit Committee's primary duties and responsibilities are to:
  -
assess the integrity of our financial reporting process and systems of internal control regarding accounting;
  -
assess the independence and performance of our independent registered public accounting firm; and
  -
provide an avenue of communication between our independent registered public accounting firm, management, and the Board.
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, management represented to the Audit Committee that: (i) our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted by the United States of America and (ii) our internal control over financial reporting were effective. UHY, our independent registered public accounting firm, performed an audit as of December 31, 2017, that determined that our consolidated financial statements were free of material misstatement. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to have an audit of our internal control over financial reporting. However, UHY's audit as of December 31, 2017, included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management and UHY our audited consolidated financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
Pursuant to Public Company Accounting Oversight Board guidance, UHY:
  -
communicates to the Audit Committee its responsibilities in relation to the audit and establishes an understanding of the terms of the audit engagement with the audit committee;
  -
obtains information from the Audit Committee relevant to the audit;
  -
communicates to the Audit Committee an overview of the overall audit strategy and timing of the audit; and
  -
provides the Audit Committee with timely observations arising from the audit that are significant to the financial reporting process. With regard to determining UHY's performance and independence for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Audit Committee reviewed:
 Performance
  -
UHY's performance on previous audits, including the quality of the engagement team and the firm's experience, client service, responsiveness and technical expertise;
  -
UHY's leadership, management structure, and client and employee retention;
  -
UHY's financial strength and performance; and
  -
the appropriateness of fees charged by UHY.
 Independence
  -
the relationships between UHY and Blue Dolphin, as well as any relationships between UHY and our management and directors;
  -
whether any relationship with or service provided by UHY: (i) creates a mutual or conflicting interest with us, (ii) places UHY in the position of auditing its own work, (iii) results in UHY acting as management or an employee of us, or (iv) places UHY in a position of being an advocate for us; and
  -
whether UHY provides any prohibited non-audit services to us.
The Audit Committee discussed with UHY its performance and independence for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Based on its findings, the Audit Committee determined that the services provided by UHY are satisfactory and UHY is independent.
The Audit Committee holds a meeting at least quarterly in which management and UHY participate. Following the Audit Committee meeting, independent members of the Board meet separately in an executive session with representatives from UHY. As a result, an avenue of communication between UHY, management, and the Board is accomplished on a regular basis.
This table shows fees paid to UHY for the periods indicated:

Based on discussions with management and UHY, as well as review of UHY's report to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, be included in the Annual Report, as filed with the SEC.

Additional compensation is paid to non-employee directors for serving on the Audit Committee. The chairman of the Audit Committee receives an additional annual retainer of $5,000 in cash in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Members of the Audit Committee receive an additional annual retainer of $2,500 in cash in the second and fourth quarters of each year. During 2017, no additional compensation was paid to non-employee directors for serving on the MLP Conversion Special Committee. Non-employee directors serving on the Compensation Committee do not receive additional compensation. Non-employee directors are reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to in-person meeting attendance.
 Stock Awards. For service on the Board, non-employee directors are entitled to receive Blue Dolphin Common Stock with a fair market value of $10,000 for services rendered in the first and third quarters of each year. The number of shares of Common Stock issued is determined by the closing price of Blue Dolphin's Common Stock on the last trading day in the respective quarterly period in which services were rendered. The shares of Common Stock are subject to resale restrictions applicable to restricted securities and securities held by affiliates under federal securities laws.

[END TABLE]
Blue Dolphin and certain of its subsidiaries are party to several agreements with LEH and its affiliates. Management believes that these related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions.
 Related Parties.
 LEH. LEH is our controlling shareholder. Jonathan Carroll, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President of Blue Dolphin, is the majority owner of LEH. Together, LEH and Jonathan Carroll owned 79.8% of Blue Dolphin's Common Stock as of the Record Date. Related party agreements with LEH include: (i) an Amended and Restated Operating Agreement with Blue Dolphin and LE, (ii) a Jet Fuel Sales Agreement with LE, (iii) a Loan Agreement with Blue Dolphin Pipe Line Company ("BDPL"), (iv) an Amended and Restated Promissory Note with Blue Dolphin, and (v) a Debt Assumption Agreement with LE. Additionally, in June 2018, Blue Dolphin obtained 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interest of Nixon Product Storage, LLC ("NPS") from Lazarus Midstream Partners, L.P., an affiliate of LEH, pursuant to an Assignment Agreement.
 Ingleside Crude, LLC ("Ingleside"). Ingleside is a related party of LEH and Jonathan Carroll. Blue Dolphin is party to an Amended and Restated Promissory Note with Ingleside.
 Lazarus Marine Terminal I, LLC ("LMT"). LMT is a related party of LEH and Jonathan Carroll. LE is party to a Dock Tolling Agreement with LMT.
 Jonathan Carroll. Jonathan Carroll is Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President of Blue Dolphin. Related party agreements with Jonathan Carroll include: (i) Amended and Restated Guaranty Fee Agreements with LE and Lazarus Refining & Marketing, LLC and (ii) an Amended and Restated Promissory Note with Blue Dolphin. Currently, Blue Dolphin depends on LEH and its affiliates (including Jonathan Carroll and Ingleside) for financing when revenue from operations and borrowings under bank facilities are insufficient to meet liquidity needs. Such borrowings are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable, related party, and/or long-term debt, related party.
 Operations Related Agreements.
 Amended and Restated Operating Agreement. LEH operates and manages all Blue Dolphin properties pursuant to the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement. The Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, which was restructured in 2017 following cessation of crude supply and marketing activities under a Crude Supply Agreement and a Joint Marketing Agreement with GEL, expires: (i) April 1, 2020, (ii) upon written notice by either party to the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of a material breach by the other party, or (iii) upon 90 days' notice by the Board if the Board determines that the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement is not in our best interest. LEH receives an operating fee of 5% of Blue Dolphin's direct operating expenses. LEH's operating fee and Blue Dolphin's direct operating expenses are reflected within refinery operating expenses in Blue Dolphin's consolidated statements of operations.
 Jet Fuel Sales Agreement. LE sells jet fuel to LEH pursuant to a Jet Fuel Sales Agreement. LEH resells the jet fuel purchased from LE to a government agency. LEH bids for jet fuel contracts are evaluated under preferential pricing terms due to its HUBZone certification. The Jet Fuel Sales Agreement terminates on the earliest to occur of: (a) a one-year term expiring March 31, 2019 plus a 30-day carryover or (b) delivery of a maximum quantity of jet fuel as defined therein. Sales to LEH under the Jet Fuel Sales Agreement are reflected within refinery operations revenue in Blue Dolphin's consolidated statements of operations. (LRM previously leased petroleum storage tanks to LEH for the storage of the jet fuel under a Terminal Services Agreement. The Terminal Services Agreement was terminated as described below).
 Terminal Services Agreement. Pursuant to a Terminal Services Agreement, LEH leased petroleum storage tanks from LRM for the storage of LEH purchased jet fuel under the Jet Fuel Sales Agreement (as described above). The Terminal Services Agreement was terminated in June 2017. Rental fees received from LEH under the Terminal Services Agreement are reflected within tolling and terminaling revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.
 Amended and Restated Tank Lease Agreement. Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Tank Lease Agreement with Ingleside, LE leased petroleum storage tanks to meet periodic, additional storage needs. The Amended and Restated Tank Lease Agreement was terminated in July 2017. Rental fees owed to Ingleside under the tank lease agreement are reflected within long-term debt, related party, net of current portion in our consolidated balance sheets. Amounts expensed as rental fees to Ingleside under the Amended and Restated Tank Lease Agreement are reflected within refinery operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.
 Dock Tolling Agreement. In May 2016, LE entered a Dock Tolling Agreement with LMT to facilitate loading and unloading of petroleum products by barge at LMT's dock facility in Ingleside, Texas. The Dock Tolling Agreement has a five-year term and may be terminated at any time by the agreement of both parties. LE pays LMT a flat reservation fee monthly. The reservation fee includes tolling volumes up to 84,000 gallons per day. Excess tolling volumes are subject to an increased per gallon rate. Amounts expensed as tolling fees under the Dock Tolling Agreement are reflected in the cost of sales in Blue Dolphin's consolidated statements of operations.
 Financial Agreements.
 BDPL Loan Agreement (In Default). In August 2016, BDPL entered a loan and security agreement with LEH as evidenced by a promissory note in the original principal amount of $4.0 million (the "BDPL Loan Agreement"). The BDPL Loan Agreement matured on August 15, 2018. Interest is still accruing at a rate of 16.00%. The BDPL Loan Agreement is currently in default due to non-payment. The proceeds of the BDPL Loan Agreement were used for working capital. There are no financial maintenance covenants associated with the BDPL Loan Agreement. The BDPL Loan Agreement is secured by certain property owned by BDPL. Outstanding principal owed to LEH under the BDPL Loan Agreement is reflected in long-term debt, related party, current portion in Blue Dolphin's consolidated balance sheets. Accrued interest under the BDPL Loan Agreement is reflected in interest payable, related party, current portion in Blue Dolphin's consolidated balance sheets.
 Promissory Notes. We currently rely on LEH and its affiliates (including Jonathan Carroll) to fund our working capital requirements. During 2017, LEH and its affiliates (Ingleside and Jonathan Carroll) provided working capital to Blue Dolphin in the form of non-cash advances, such as conversions of accounts payable to debt. These non-cash advances are reflected in the below promissory notes. There can be no assurance that LEH and its affiliates will continue to fund our working capital requirements. Outstanding principal and accrued interest owed under these promissory notes are reflected in long-term debt, related party, current portion in our consolidated balance sheets.
 June LEH Note – In March 2017, Blue Dolphin entered a promissory note with LEH (the "March LEH Note"). In June 2017, the March LEH Note was amended and restated to increase the principal amount (the "June LEH Note"). The June LEH Note accrues interest at a rate of 8.00% and has a maturity date of January 2019. Interest under the June LEH Note, which is compounded annually and accrued at a rate of 8.00%, was paid in kind and added to the outstanding balance.
 March Ingleside Note – In March 2017, a promissory note between Blue Dolphin and Ingleside was amended and restated (the "March Ingleside Note") to increase the principal and extend the maturity date to January 2019. Interest under the March Ingleside Note, which is compounded annually and accrued at a rate of 8.00%, was paid in kind and added to the outstanding balance.
 March Carroll Note – In March 2017, a promissory note between Blue Dolphin and Jonathan Carroll was amended and restated (the "March Carroll Note") to increase the principal amount, revise the payment terms to reflect payment in cash and shares of Blue Dolphin Common Stock, and extend the maturity date to January 2019. Interest under the March Carroll Note, which is compounded annually and accrued at a rate of 8.00%, was paid in kind and added to the outstanding balance.
 Debt Assumption Agreement. On September 18, 2017, LEH paid, on LE's behalf, certain obligations totaling $3.6 million to GEL relating to arbitration proceedings with GEL and a September 2017 letter agreement with GEL. In exchange for such payments, LE agreed to assume $3.7 million of LEH's existing indebtedness pursuant to the Debt Assumption Agreement, entered on November 14, 2017 and made effective September 18, 2017, by and among LE, LEH and John Kissick. Debt held by John Kissick, including the debt associated with the Debt Assumption Agreement, is reported in Blue Dolphin's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2018 as the Notre Dame Debt (defined below) and is reflected in long-term debt less unamortized debt issue costs, current portion in Blue Dolphin's consolidated balance sheets, as it is currently in default.
 Amended and Restated Guaranty Fee Agreements. Pursuant to Amended and Restated Guaranty Fee Agreements, Jonathan Carroll earns fees for providing his personal guarantee on certain LE and LRM long-term debt. Jonathan Carroll was required to guarantee repayment of funds borrowed and interest accrued under certain LE and LRM loan agreements. Amounts owed to Jonathan Carroll under Amended and Restated Guaranty Fee Agreements are reflected within long-term debt, related party, net of current portion in Blue Dolphin's consolidated balance sheets. Amounts expensed related to Amended and Restated Guarantee Fee Agreements are reflected within interest and other expense in Blue Dolphin's consolidated statements of operations.  Financial Statements Impact.
 Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounts receivable, related party from LEH associated with the Jet Fuel Sales Agreement were $0 and $0.7 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

 Director Nominations and Proposals Process
We have tentatively set the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders for December 18, 2019. Accordingly, stockholders should submit nominations and proposals in accordance with the guidance set forth below.
 Director Nominations Deadline
Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that no person shall be eligible for nomination and election as a director unless written notice of such nomination is received from a stockholder of record by the Secretary of Blue Dolphin at least ninety (90) calendar days before the anniversary date of the previous year's annual meeting. Further, such written notice is to be accompanied by the written consent of the nominee to serve, the name, age, business and residence addresses, and principal occupation of the nominee, the number of shares beneficially owned by the nominee, and any other information which would be required to be furnished by law with respect to any nominee for election to the Board. In order to avoid controversy as to the date on which a director nomination is received, stockholders of record must make submissions to us at our principal executive office by certified mail, return receipt requested. Blue Dolphin's mailing address is located at our principal office: 801 Travis Street, Suite 2100, Houston, Texas 77002. (See "Corporate Governance and Board Matters – Nominating Committee" in this proxy statement for more information.)
We did not receive any director nominee submissions by September 7, 2017, the deadline for the 2018 Annual Meeting.
 Stockholder Proposals Deadline
Pursuant to SEC requirements, stockholders of record must submit stockholder proposals for inclusion in the printed proxy materials to us at least one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days before the date we released the previous year's proxy statement for our annual meeting of stockholders. However, if the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date of the previous year's meeting, then stockholders must submit their proposals a reasonable time before Blue Dolphin begins to print and send its proxy materials. We did not receive any stockholder proposal submissions.
As noted above we expect our 2019 annual meeting to be held on December 18, 2019, and we therefore will print and send proxy materials on or around November 11, 2019. Accordingly, stockholder proposals must be submitted a reasonable time before November 11, 2019. In order to avoid controversy as to the date on which a stockholder proposal is received, stockholders of record must make submissions to us at our principal executive office by certified mail, return receipt requested.

Each year, the Compensation Committee shall review succession planning and development strategies for the CEO and senior executives of Blue Dolphin and report its findings to the Board.
