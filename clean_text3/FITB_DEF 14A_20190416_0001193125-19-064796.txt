 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING     
 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING     
 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING     
[END TABLE]
What is this document? 
This document is called a proxy statement. This proxy statement includes information regarding the matters to be acted upon at the 2019 Fifth Third Bancorp Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") and certain other information required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the rules of the Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq"). 
When is the Annual Meeting and where will it be held? 
The Annual Meeting will be held on Tuesday, April 16, 2019, at the Renaissance Hotel, located at 36 East Fourth Street, Cincinnati, Ohio at 11:30 a.m. eastern daylight saving time. 
Why am I being provided this proxy statement? 
Fifth Third Bancorp (the "Company" or "Fifth Third") is required by the SEC to give you, or provide you access to, this proxy statement because it is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares of Fifth Third stock at the Annual Meeting. The enclosed proxy statement summarizes information you need in order to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
What is a proxy? 
A proxy is your designation of another person to vote stock you own. That other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document is also called a proxy or a proxy card. When you designate a proxy, you may also direct the proxy how to vote your shares. Three Fifth Third directors, Emerson L. Brumback, Greg D. Carmichael, and Marsha C. Williams, have been designated as the proxies to cast the votes of Fifth Third's shareholders at the Annual Meeting. 
What actions are shareholders approving at the Annual Meeting? 
Election of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors has recommended a slate of nominees for election to the Board of Directors. Information about these nominees may be found in the proxy statement section titled "Election of Directors." 
Company Proposal 1: Approval of Appointment of Auditors. This is a proposal to ratify the reappointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent external audit firm for 2019. This approval is not required by law to appoint an independent external audit firm, but the appointment is submitted by the Audit Committee in order to give shareholders a voice in the designation of the independent external audit firm. If this resolution is rejected by the shareholders, then the Audit Committee will reconsider its choice of independent external audit firm. Even if this resolution is approved, the Audit Committee, at its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent external audit firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in our best interests and the best interest of our shareholders. 
Company Proposal 2: Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation. Company Proposal 2 is an annual advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers ("NEOs"). The Board will strongly consider the outcome of this advisory vote in determining the compensation of such executives. In 2018, 95% of our shareholders who cast a vote on our executive compensation program voted to approve it. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING     
[END TABLE]
Company Proposal 3: Advisory Vote to Determine Frequency of Executive Compensation Votes. Company Proposal 3 is an advisory vote to determine how often shareholders will be given the opportunity to approve the compensation of our NEOs: either every one, every two, or every three years. The Board will strongly consider the outcome of these votes in determining how often the shareholders are provided a say on pay vote. At the 2018 Annual Meeting, our shareholders supported the Board's recommendation that shareholders be provided the option to cast an advisory vote every one year on the compensation of our NEOs. Accordingly, the Board decided to hold a "say on pay" vote annually. 
Company Proposal 4: Approval of the Fifth Third Bancorp 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan. This is a proposal to approve the Fifth Third Bancorp 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan, including the issuance of shares of common stock authorized thereunder. The 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan, if approved, will replace the 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan, which was approved by the shareholders on April 18, 2017. Information about the 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan may be found in the proxy statement section entitled "Company Proposal 4: Proposal to Approve the Fifth Third Bancorp 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan Including the Issuance of Shares of Common Stock Authorized Thereunder." 
Company Proposal 5: Approval of an Amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation to Authorize a New Class of Preferred Stock. This is a proposal to approve an Amendment to the Fifth Third Bancorp Amended Articles of Incorporation to authorize a new class of preferred stock. Information about the proposed amendment may be found in the proxy statement section entitled "Company Proposal 5: Proposal to Approve an Amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation to Authorize a New Class of Preferred Stock." 
What vote is required to approve the proposals considered at the Annual Meeting? 
Election of Directors. As long as cumulative voting is not in effect, in an uncontested election of directors, each nominee for director receiving a greater number of votes "for" his or her election than votes "against" his or her election will be elected as a director. In the event of a contested election or if cumulative voting is in effect, the nominees receiving the greatest number of votes "for" his or her election shall be elected. Abstentions and shares not voted by brokers and other entities holding shares on behalf of beneficial owners will not be counted and will have no effect on the outcome of the election. 
Company Proposals 1-4. Company proposals 1-4 at the Annual Meeting require the affirmative vote of a majority of the common shares present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. Abstentions have the same effect as a vote cast against a proposal. Shares not voted by brokers or other entities holding shares on behalf of beneficial owners will have no effect on the outcome. 
Company Proposal 5. Company Proposal 5 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds the voting power of the Company's outstanding common shares. Abstentions and shares not voted by brokers or other entities holding shares on behalf of beneficial owners will have the same effect as a vote cast against a proposal. 
It is important to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting.

[END TABLE]
Who may vote and what constitutes a quorum at the meeting? 
Holders of Fifth Third common stock on February 22, 2019 are entitled to vote on every matter that is to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. 
In order to conduct the Annual Meeting, a majority of shares of Fifth Third common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting on every matter that is to be voted on must be present in person or by proxy. This is called a quorum. Shareholders who deliver valid proxies or vote in person at the meeting will be considered part of the quorum. Once a share is represented for any purpose at the meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjourned meeting. Abstentions will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. Broker "non-votes" (which are explained below) are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. 
How many votes do I have? 
Each share of Fifth Third common stock outstanding on February 22, 2019 is entitled to one vote on all proposals at the meeting. As of the close of business on February 22, 2019, there were approximately 648,614,317 shares of Fifth Third common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. 
If notice in writing is given by any shareholder to our President, a Vice President, or the Secretary not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the time fixed for holding a meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing directors that a shareholder desires that the voting at such election shall be cumulative, and if an announcement of the giving of such notice is made upon the convening of the meeting by the Chair or Secretary or by or on behalf of the shareholder giving such notice, each shareholder shall have the right to cumulate such voting power as he or she possesses in voting for directors. This will not affect the voting procedures for the other proposals considered at the Annual Meeting. 
How do I vote? 
Record Shareholders. A shareholder who owns shares in Fifth Third directly, and not through a broker, bank, or other nominee ("record holder" or "record shareholder"), may vote in person at the Annual Meeting by filling out a ballot or may authorize a proxy to vote on his or her behalf. There are three ways to authorize a proxy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  Internet: You may access the proxy materials on the Internet at  www.cesvote.com and follow the instructions on the proxy card or on the Notice of Internet Availability.  
[END TABLE]

  2.  Telephone: You may call toll-free 1-888-693-8683, and follow the instructions on the proxy card or on the Notice of Internet Availability.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  Mail: If you received your proxy materials by mail, you may vote by signing,  dating, and mailing the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided.  
[END TABLE]
Shareholders who vote over the Internet may incur costs, such as telephone and Internet access charges, for which the shareholder is responsible. The Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate a shareholder's identity and to allow a shareholder to vote his or her shares

 and confirm that his or her instructions have been properly recorded. You may use the Internet or telephone to submit your proxy until 11:00 a.m., eastern daylight saving time, on the morning of the Annual Meeting, April 16, 2019. 
Street Name Shareholders. Shareholders who hold shares in "street name," that is, through a broker, bank, or other nominee ("beneficial holder" or "street name shareholder"), should instruct their nominee to vote their shares by following the instructions provided by the nominee. Your vote as a shareholder is important. Please vote as soon as possible to ensure that your vote is recorded. See "Can my broker vote for me?" on the following page. 
What if I sign and date my proxy but do not provide voting instructions? 
A proxy that is signed and dated, but which does not contain voting instructions, will be voted as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of each of the directors nominated by the Fifth Third Bancorp Nominating and Corporate  Governance Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the approval of the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent external  audit firm (Company Proposal 1);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the advisory vote on executive compensation (Company Proposal 2);  
[END TABLE]

• "FOR" holding an advisory vote for approval of the compensation of the Company's executives every "1  Year" (Company Proposal 3);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the approval of Fifth Third Bancorp 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan, including the issuance of shares of  common stock authorized thereunder (Company Proposal 4); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the approval of the amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation to authorize a new class of  preferred stock (Company Proposal 5).  
[END TABLE]
Can my broker vote for me? 
If you are a beneficial holder of shares and do not provide the organization that holds your shares with specific voting instructions then, under applicable rules, the organization that holds your shares generally has discretionary authority to vote on "routine" matters without receiving instructions from you but cannot vote on "non-routine" matters unless you provide instructions. If the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, that organization will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on that matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote." 
All proposals at the Annual Meeting except Company Proposal 1 (Approval of the Selection of Auditors) are considered non-routine matters under applicable rules. A broker, bank, or other nominee cannot vote without instructions on non-routine matters, and therefore broker non-votes may exist in connection with the election of directors and Company Proposals 2, 3, 4, and 5. It is important to instruct your broker, bank, or other nominee to vote your shares. 
The approval of the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent external audit firm for 2019 (Company Proposal 1) is considered a routine matter under applicable rules. A broker or other

 nominee generally exercises its discretionary authority to vote on routine matters without instructions. Although brokers and other nominees are not required to exercise discretionary authority, we expect that no broker non-votes will exist in connection with Company Proposal 1. 
Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy? 
You may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by filing with us an instrument revoking it, filing a duly executed proxy bearing a later date (including a proxy given over the Internet or by telephone), or by attending the meeting and electing to vote in person. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, you are encouraged to vote your shares by proxy. 
How are proxy materials delivered? 
We control costs by following SEC rules that allow for the delivery of proxy materials to our shareholders primarily through the Internet. In addition to reducing the amount of paper used in producing these materials, this method lowers the costs associated with mailing the proxy materials to shareholders. Record holders will have a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials delivered directly to their mailing address. Beneficial holders will have a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials forwarded to them by the intermediary that holds the shares. Shareholders who have requested paper copies of all proxy materials and certain institutional and other shareholders will also receive paper copies of the other proxy materials including this proxy statement, the 2018 Annual Report of Fifth Third Bancorp, and a proxy card or voting instruction sheet. 
If you received only a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials unless you request a copy by following the instructions on the notice. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also contains instructions for accessing and reviewing the proxy materials over the Internet and provides directions for submitting your vote over the Internet. 
What if I share an address and a last name with other Fifth Third shareholders? 
To reduce the expenses of delivering duplicate proxy materials to shareholders, we are relying upon SEC "householding" rules that permit delivery of only one set of applicable proxy materials to multiple shareholders who share an address and have the same last name, unless we receive contrary instructions from any shareholder at that address. Shareholders of record who have the same address and last name and have not previously requested electronic delivery of proxy materials will receive a single envelope containing the notices or the proxy statement and proxy card for all shareholders having that address. The notice or proxy card for each shareholder will include that shareholder's unique control number needed to vote his or her shares. This procedure reduces our printing costs and postage fees. If, in the future, you do not wish to participate in householding and prefer to receive your Notice or Proxy Statement in a separate envelope, or if your household currently receives more than one Notice or Proxy Statement and in the future, you would prefer to participate in householding, please call 1-800-488-8035 (toll-free) in the U.S., or inform us in writing at: Fifth Third Bancorp, c/o D.F. King & Co., Inc., 48 Wall Street—22nd Floor, New York, NY 10005, or by email at FITB@dfking.com. Requests will be responded to promptly.

For those shareholders who have the same address and last name and who request to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials by mail, we will send only one copy of such materials to each address unless one or more of those shareholders notifies us, in the same manner described above, that the shareholder(s) wish to receive a printed copy for each shareholder at that address.

[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors is soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held at the Renaissance Hotel, located at 36 East Fourth Street, Cincinnati, Ohio on Tuesday, April 16, 2019 at 11:30 a.m. eastern daylight saving time. Each of the approximately 648,614,317 shares of common stock outstanding on February 22, 2019 is entitled to one vote on all matters acted upon at the Annual Meeting. Only shareholders of record on our books at the close of business on February 22, 2019 will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, either in person or by proxy. The shares represented by all properly executed proxies that are sent to us will be voted as designated and each not designated will be voted and counted as described in this proxy statement. Each person giving a proxy may revoke it by giving notice to us in writing or in open meeting at any time before it is voted. 
The laws of Ohio under which we are incorporated provide that if notice in writing is given by any shareholder to our President, a Vice President, or the Secretary not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the time fixed for holding a meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing directors that such shareholder desires that the voting at such election shall be cumulative, and if an announcement of the giving of such notice is made upon the convening of the meeting by the Chair or Secretary or by or on behalf of the shareholder giving such notice, each shareholder shall have the right to cumulate such voting power as he or she possesses in voting for directors. This will not affect the voting procedures for the other proposals considered at the Annual Meeting. 
We will bear the expense of soliciting proxies. Proxies will be solicited principally by mail, but may also be solicited by our directors, officers, and other regular employees, who will receive no compensation therefore in addition to their regular compensation. Brokers and others who hold stock on behalf of others will be asked to send proxy materials to the beneficial owners of the stock, and we will reimburse them for their expenses. 
We have retained D.F. King & Co., Inc., a proxy solicitation firm, to assist us in soliciting proxies. We anticipate that the costs of D.F. King's proxy solicitation services will be approximately $13,000, plus reasonable out of pocket expenses. 
Our Annual Report for the year 2018, including financial statements, has been delivered or made available to all shareholders. Such report and financial statements are not a part of this proxy statement. This proxy statement, form of proxy, notice of Annual Meeting, Notice of Internet Availability, and the Annual Report are first being sent or made available to shareholders on or about March 6, 2019.

(Item 1 on Proxy Card) 
On May 20, 2018, Fifth Third and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Fifth Third Financial Corporation, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with MB Financial, Inc. ("MB Financial"). The Merger Agreement provides that upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, including all necessary regulatory approvals, MB Financial will merge (the "Merger") with and into a newly-formed subsidiary of Fifth Third, with MB Financial as the surviving corporation. At the effective time of this Merger (the "Effective Time"), each outstanding share of MB Financial common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("MB Financial Common Stock"), will be converted into the right to receive (i) 1.450 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of Fifth Third common stock, no par value ("Fifth Third Common Stock"), and (ii) $5.54 in cash (collectively, the "Merger Consideration"). 
In connection with the proposed Merger, Fifth Third has filed with the SEC a Registration Statement on Form S-4 that includes the Proxy Statement of MB Financial and a Prospectus of Fifth Third, as well as other relevant documents concerning the proposed transaction. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval related to the Merger. Investors and stockholders are urged to read the registration statement and the proxy statement/prospectus regarding the Merger and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents, because they will contain important information. 
A free copy of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as well as other filings containing information about Fifth Third and MB Financial, may be obtained at the SEC's Internet site (http://www.sec.gov). You will also be able to obtain these documents, free of charge, from Fifth Third at ir.53.com or from MB Financial by accessing MB Financial's website at investor.mbfinancial.com. 
Copies of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus can also be obtained, free of charge, by directing a request to Fifth Third Investor Relations at Fifth Third Investor Relations, MD 1090QC, 38 Fountain Square Plaza, Cincinnati, OH 45263, by calling 866-670-0468, or by sending an e-mail to ir@53.com or to MB Financial, Attention: Corporate Secretary, at 6111 North River Road, Rosemont, Illinois 60018, by calling 847-653-1992 or by sending an e-mail to dkoros@mbfinancial.com. 
As of the date of this proxy, Fifth Third's Board of Directors consists of 12 directors. The Merger Agreement includes a provision which requires two members of the MB Financial Board of Directors be appointed to the Fifth Third Board of Directors upon closing of the Merger. C. Bryan Daniels and Thomas H. Harvey have been designated to become members of the Fifth Third Board of Directors upon closing of the Merger. Therefore, if the Merger is completed prior to the Annual Meeting, Fifth Third will increase the size of the Board of Directors to 14 and a total of 14 nominees will be voted upon at the Annual Meeting for election to the Board of Directors: 12 of the nominees who will have served as directors since the last annual meeting and the remaining two who will have been appointed to the Fifth Third Board of Directors upon closing of the Merger. If the Merger is not completed prior to the Annual Meeting, the size of the Board of Directors will remain at 12 and votes cast for Mr. Daniels and Mr. Harvey will not be counted. 
Director candidates are nominated by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's charter directs it to investigate and assess the background and skills of potential candidates and to maintain an active file of suitable director candidates.

[END TABLE]
 The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee utilizes its pool of existing subsidiary and regional directors as well as the significant network of business contacts of its existing directors and executive management and also retains third party consultants to aid it in identifying potential director candidates. Upon identifying a candidate for serious consideration, our Chief Executive Officer and one or more members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee initially interview such candidate. If the candidate merits further consideration, the candidate subsequently interviews with other Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members (individually or as a group), and ultimately meets the remaining directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee elicits feedback from persons who meet the candidate and then determines whether or not to nominate the candidate. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth the following criteria for directors: independence (in order to compose a Board of Directors that has a majority of its members who are independent); highest personal and professional ethics and integrity; willingness to devote sufficient time to fulfilling duties as a director; impact on the diversity of the Board's overall experience in business, government, education, technology, and other areas relevant to our business; impact on the diversity of the Board's composition in terms of age, skills, ethnicity, and other factors relevant to our business; and number of other public company boards on which the candidate may serve. Generally, a director should not serve on more than three public company boards in addition to Fifth Third. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that shareholders may propose nominees to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee by submitting the names and qualifications of such persons to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee no later than December 31 of each year. Submissions are to be addressed to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee at our executive offices, which submissions will then be forwarded to the Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will then evaluate the possible nominee using the criteria outlined above and will consider such person in comparison to all other candidates, but is not obligated to nominate any such individual for election. No such shareholder nominations have been received by Fifth Third for this Annual Meeting. Accordingly, no rejections or refusals of such candidates have been made by Fifth Third. Shareholders may also nominate candidates directly for election by following the procedures in our Code of Regulations. These are summarized in the "2020 Shareholder Proposals" section of this proxy statement. 
In accordance with our Code of Regulations, directors are elected annually to a one (1) year term expiring at the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Any vacancies that occur after the directors are elected may be filled by the Board of Directors in accordance with law and our Code of Regulations for the remainder of the full term of the vacant directorship. If the Merger is completed prior to the Annual Meeting, shareholders will vote on the 14 persons listed below. If the Merger is not completed prior to the Annual Meeting, Mr. Daniels and Mr. Harvey will not stand for election to the Board of Directors and any votes cast for either Mr. Daniels or Mr. Harvey will not be counted.

Vote Required 
Under Ohio law, our Articles of Incorporation, and our Code of Regulations, as long as cumulative voting is not in effect, in an uncontested election of directors (i.e., an election where the number of candidates nominated for election to the Board of Directors equals the number of directors to be elected), each person receiving a greater number of votes "for" his or her election than votes "against" his or her election will be elected as a director. If the Merger is completed prior to the Annual Meeting, in the event of a contested election or if cumulative voting is in effect, the fourteen nominees receiving the greatest number of votes "for" their election shall be elected. If the Merger is not completed prior to the Annual Meeting, in the event of a contested election or if cumulative voting is in effect, votes cast in favor of Mr. Daniels and Mr. Harvey will not be counted and the twelve nominees receiving the greatest number of votes "for" their election shall be elected. 
We have also adopted provisions of our Corporate Governance Guidelines stating that, as long as cumulative voting is not in effect, in an uncontested election of directors, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "against" his or her election than votes "for" his or her election will promptly tender his or her resignation to the Chair of the Board following certification of the shareholder vote. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will promptly consider the tendered resignation and will recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation no later

 than 60 days following the date of the shareholders' meeting at which the election occurred. In considering whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider factors deemed relevant by the Committee members including, without limitation, the director's length of service, the director's particular qualifications and contributions to Fifth Third, the reasons underlying the majority "against" vote (if known) and whether these reasons can be cured, and compliance with stock exchange listing standards and the Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Board will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation no later than 90 days following the date of the shareholders' meeting at which the election occurred. In considering the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, the Board will consider the factors considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and such additional information and factors the Board believes to be relevant. 
If any nominee(s) shall be unable to serve, which is not now contemplated, the proxies will be voted for such substitute nominee(s) as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors recommends. If the Merger closes prior to the Annual Meeting, proxies in the form solicited hereby which are returned to us and not revoked will be voted in favor of the fourteen (14) nominees specified above unless otherwise instructed by the shareholder. If the Merger does not close prior to the Annual Meeting, votes cast in favor of Mr. Daniels and Mr. Harvey will not be counted and proxies in the form solicited hereby which are returned to us and not revoked will be voted in favor of the twelve (12) nominees specified above unless otherwise instructed by the shareholder. Abstentions and shares not voted by brokers or other entities holding shares on behalf of beneficial owners will not be counted and will have no effect on the outcome of the election in accordance with Ohio law and our Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" EACH

Board Governance. The Board of Directors has adopted the Fifth Third Bancorp Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Fifth Third Bancorp Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which applies to our directors; Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Controller; and our other employees. The Corporate Governance Guidelines delineate the responsibilities of our directors, Board, and Board Committees as well as standards for Board composition, service, and meetings and are reviewed annually to ensure standards remain consistent with evolving business needs and best practice. The Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics may be found in the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.53.com. 
Board Performance Evaluations. The Board of Directors and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee annually review directors' skills and expertise to ensure the Board represents a diverse skill set oriented to the historical and emerging needs of the business. Each director annually completes an anonymous evaluation of the Board and its committees, and, beginning in 2019, is interviewed by the Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chair review the results of these reviews with each Committee Chair and the full Board, after which the Chairs suggest action items to management. 
Board Leadership. The Board believes that our shareholders are best served by a Board that has the flexibility to establish a leadership structure that fits our needs at any particular point in time. Accordingly, under our Code of Regulations and Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board of Directors has the authority to combine or separate the positions of Chair and Chief Executive Officer as well as determine whether, if the positions are separated, the Chair is an affiliated director or an independent director. 
The Board's Chair is currently Fifth Third's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Carmichael, and Ms. Williams is the Lead Independent Director. The Board believes that this leadership structure is appropriate at this time given the contributions Mr. Carmichael has given to date in his role as CEO and his ability to provide strategic and operational leadership. The Board determined that leadership by our CEO coupled with our strong Lead Independent Director, experienced Committee Chairs, and our other well-qualified directors, all of whom are independent, will allow Fifth Third to grow and meet the challenges facing it and the industry. 
Under our Code of Regulations and Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Lead Independent Director will:

Risk Management Oversight. The role of the Board of Directors is to provide oversight to ensure an effective enterprise risk management program is in place, including an appropriate enterprise risk management framework and related governance structure. The Board sets our overall risk appetite, including the establishment and monitoring of risk tolerances. The formulation of risk appetite considers our operating capacity, which is represented by its available financial resources, defined as Tier 1 Capital less our largest capital buffer (Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Policy Target less the Basel III Buffered Common Equity Tier 1 Minimum), that sets an absolute limit on risk assumption in our annual financial and strategic plans. Our risk appetite is limited by policy to a maximum of 95 percent of operating capacity. Tolerances are the maximum amount of risk applicable to each of the eight specific risk categories included in the enterprise risk management framework. Through their oversight role, directors ensure that the risk management processes designed and implemented under this framework and governance structure are aligned to the Board's corporate strategy and are functioning as directed. The Board also considers the optimal organizational structure at both the Board and management levels. This may include delegating responsibility through Board committees, management committees, the Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Risk Officer. 
Risk management oversight and governance is provided primarily by the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and through the Enterprise Risk Management Committee.

The Risk and Compliance Committee currently consists of five outside directors and has responsibility for the oversight of our risk management, as well as ensuring that risks are properly controlled, quantified, and within our risk appetite. The Chief Risk Officer has a direct reporting relationship to the Chief Executive Officer and the Risk and Compliance Committee and has regular executive sessions with the Risk and Compliance Committee without other members of management present. In addition, the Director of Credit Risk Review reports directly to the Risk and Compliance Committee. 
The Risk and Compliance Committee is primarily responsible for the risk management policies of our global operation and oversight of its global risk management framework. This includes oversight of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Management's compliance with all regulatory obligations under federal and state banking laws, rules, and regulations;   
• Development and implementation of the Risk Management Framework, inclusive of risk appetite;  
• Fiduciary activities and policies of the Company and subsidiaries;  
• Risk processes to ensure they are supported by a risk governance structure, including oversight by the Board of Directors  and risk committees, policies, risk limits, and by a culture that supports risk management objectives and appropriate accountability by all lines of defense, and;  
• The Company's supervisory issues and enforcement actions and remediation efforts.  
[END TABLE]
The Enterprise Risk Management Committee is the executive-level committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer. Membership includes the Chief Executive Officer and senior level management, including risk experts and management from each line of business. The Enterprise Risk Management Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the risk Management Framework and policies, overseeing the management of all risk types to ensure that risks remain within our risk appetite, and fostering a culture that supports risk management objectives. In order to fulfill these responsibilities, the Enterprise Risk Management Committee reviews information on risk levels and trends, capital adequacy, top and emerging risks during each regularly scheduled meeting. 
The Risk and Compliance Committee charter outlines more specific responsibilities under all categories of risk.

Pursuant to the Fifth Third Bancorp Unfunded Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, such directors may annually elect to defer from one-half to all of their cash compensation. The deferred funds receive earnings based on the mutual fund(s) elected by each director. The directors do not receive any above-market or preferential earnings. Under the plan, directors may not defer their future cash compensation into Company stock. 
The Human Capital and Compensation Committee reviewed director compensation for 2019 in consultation with its independent compensation consultant in light of best practices, peer institution benchmarking, and other relevant factors. Based upon this review, the Committee determined that director pay is well-aligned with the market and their peers. 
The following table summarizes the compensation earned by or awarded to each non-employee director who served on the Board of Directors during 2018. The amounts listed in the "Stock Awards" column represent RSU awards that vest at the completion of a director's service on the Board. The award relates to the fiscal year in which it was granted. Directors did not receive any option awards, non-equity incentive compensation or earnings from nonqualified deferred compensation in 2018. The 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan establishes an annual limitation of $500,000 on the amount of the value of shares paid to directors in a calendar year.

Summary of Executive Compensation Programs 
At Fifth Third, we endeavor to attract and retain the best people and motivate them to fulfill the Company's vision of becoming the "One Bank that people most value and trust". We intend to accomplish this by aligning ourselves with our shareholders' long-term interests, by establishing compensation programs that reward our employees for delivering products and services our customers highly value and by avoiding excessive risk. Our compensation philosophy guides us in this endeavor. 
Our compensation is delivered through three primary elements:

The Company typically pays base salary and annual incentive compensation awards, through our Variable Compensation Plan, in cash. All long-term, equity-based incentive compensation awards are paid in shares of the Company's common stock. These three elements combined define our "Total Direct Compensation", which is referred to in the discussion that follows. 
When making pay decisions, the Human Capital and Compensation Committee (the "Committee") considers the aggregate and mix of an executive officer's Total Direct Compensation and reviews Company performance results, individual performance, and risk assessment information to ensure that pay decisions align with performance and ultimately shareholders' interests.

Highlights of 2018 Company Performance 
Project NorthStar. In 2018, we completed the vast majority of the initiatives outlined under Project NorthStar. We benefited from improved balance sheet resiliency, as our criticized commercial loans and our overall nonperforming assets declined to the lowest levels in nearly 20 years. We also generated profitable relationship growth in our commercial and consumer businesses. We achieved record commercial loan production during the year, with strength in both corporate and middle market banking; a reflection on the impact of our investments in our sales force and the increased efficiency in our mid-office and back-office functions through the Commercial Credit Experience Initiative ("CCEI"). We generated peer-leading deposit growth in our consumer business and, by the end of 2018, our total loan-to-core deposit ratio declined to the lowest level in more than fifteen years. We ended 2018 with the best underlying return metrics in over a decade. Also, we returned substantially all of our earnings to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and we raised our common dividend nearly 40% throughout the year.

In order to drive our business strategy and human capital plan, compensation must be competitive to attract and retain essential talent, reward high performance, and be internally equitable. The Company is committed to making compensation decisions that are fiscally responsible, such that we carefully consider the expected return on investment for those decisions. Our expected total compensation opportunities generally reflect the median pay levels of our compensation peer group, with variations based on specific talent needs, experience, and other internal factors. We believe that actual total compensation should vary with the performance of the organization so that outstanding performance results in above market compensation. Executive pay includes a heavy focus on long-term incentives. This facilitates collaboration among business units, ownership in the Company, and a focus on shareholder goals. 
The Human Capital team also conducts an annual review of pay equity for both gender and race for similarly situated roles as part of its annual compensation planning and makes efforts to appropriately address any issues identified through that process. Please refer to our Corporate Social Responsibility Report for further information regarding diversity and inclusion initiatives.

Compensation Risk Management. We believe it is critical to bring a multi-faceted strategy toward mitigating risk in our compensation programs and incentive plans. We incorporate formulaic and discretionary risk-balancing mechanisms, which include specific metrics for modifying payouts to discourage taking unnecessary or imprudent risks.

We believe it is critical that our people clearly understand how they are rewarded to ensure that pay facilitates the appropriate strategic and risk awareness behaviors. Because of this, we provide ongoing compensation communication and education to our employees, in addition to employee communications, and online training. 
In December 2018, the Committee met jointly with the Risk and Compliance Committee to review our executive and other incentive programs. Based in part on the provisions and actions above, the Committee concluded that the design and/or metrics of such programs do not encourage taking unnecessary or inappropriate risk. 
The Committee's Role. The Committee is composed of independent directors and is responsible for establishing, implementing, and monitoring the administration of compensation and benefits programs in accordance with the Company's compensation philosophy and strategy, along with approving executive compensation and equity plan awards. The Committee focuses on the attraction and retention of key executives. When making decisions, the Committee considers the Company's compensation philosophy, the achievement of business goals set by the Company, relevant peer data, recommendations made by the chief executive officer, and the advice of a respected, independent, external executive compensation consulting firm with financial services industry expertise hired by the Committee. This compensation consulting firm was Compensation Advisory Partners ("CAP") until the end of February 2018. As a result of a periodic vendor review process, the Committee began using the services of Frederic W. Cook and Co., Inc. ("FW Cook") at the beginning of March 2018. 
The Committee seeks to establish "Total Rewards" for the Company's executive officers that are fair, reasonable, risk-balanced, and competitive. The Total Rewards program includes Total Direct Compensation, benefits and certain perquisites. Generally, the types of compensation and benefits paid to Named Executive Officers are similar to those provided to other officers of the Company.

Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions. The chief executive officer annually reviews the performance of each of the other Named Executive Officers, which includes a risk performance assessment completed by the Company's chief risk officer. Based on this review, the chief executive officer makes compensation recommendations to the Committee, including recommendations for salary adjustments, Variable Compensation Plan awards, and long-term, equity-based incentive awards. In addition, the chief executive officer and certain other members of management annually assess performance for other executive officers and make compensation recommendations to the Committee. Although the Committee considers these recommendations along with data provided by its consultant, FW Cook, it retains full discretion to set all compensation for the Company's executive officers. The Committee works directly with its consultant to determine compensation for the chief executive officer. The chief executive officer has no input into his own compensation determinations. 
Additionally, the chief risk officer reviews and evaluates with the Committee all executive officer and employee incentive compensation plans. The purpose of the review is to confirm that the Company's incentive compensation plans do not incent or pose unnecessary or excessive risks to the Company.

The Company does not engage the Committee's compensation consultant for additional services outside of executive compensation consulting to the Board. The Committee conducted an assessment of potential conflicts of interest and independence issues for FW Cook and no conflicts of interest or independence issues relating to FW Cook's services were identified by the Committee. This was also true of CAP. 
Benchmarking Methodology. In making compensation decisions, the Committee compares Company performance and each element of each executive officer's Total Direct Compensation with the Compensation Peer Group. The Committee refers to this Compensation Peer Group for both compensation and performance-related benchmarks. Financial performance data is prepared either by the Committee's independent compensation consultant or by the Company, using data from public filings. Compensation data is generally prepared by the Committee's compensation consultants, using third-party survey data as provided by management and publicly available data from proxy statements. The Committee's compensation consultant reviews all financial and compensation data that is prepared by the Company and provided to the Committee. 
The Compensation Peer Group consists of companies with which the Committee believes the Company competes for talent and for shareholder investment, and which are generally similar in asset size and business mix. The following 11 companies were identified by the Committee as the 2018 Compensation Peer Group:

The Committee annually reviews the Compensation Peer Group and considers changes to the Compensation Peer Group deemed necessary to ensure that the business structure and size of the organizations continue to be appropriate. Based on the Committee's evaluation of the Compensation Peer Group, no changes were made for 2018. The Company's assets were at approximately the 55th percentile of its 2018 Compensation Peer Group as of September 2018. 
Tally Sheet. The Company annually prepares a tally sheet of all compensation and potential payouts for the Committee's use when considering compensation matters. The Committee reviews all components of compensation for the Company's chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and the other NEOs, including:

The Committee reviewed the above compensation components and the associated dollar amounts for 2017 compensation in June 2018. At that time, the Committee also reviewed a sensitivity analysis of the relationship between each NEO's 2017 Total Direct Compensation and the Company's performance, including both stock price performance and Company performance results. The Committee will perform the annual tally sheet review specific to 2018 compensation components in 2019. 
Non-Binding Advisory Say-on-Pay Proposal. The Committee annually reviews the results of the non-binding advisory say-on-pay proposal and considers them when approving plan design changes as well as pay decisions. 
The say-on-pay vote resulted in 95% approval from shareholders in 2018, an increase from 94% in 2017 and 92% in 2016. The Committee believes that the consistent increase of approval of compensation in the shareholder vote demonstrates a strong alignment with shareholders' interests. Additionally, these results indicate strong support among shareholders for our pay-for-performance approach. Future votes cast will be closely monitored to ensure that there is continued support for our pay programs and pay decisions among our shareholders.

Pay Mix and Pay for Performance. Our Named Executive Officers have approximately 50 percent or more of their target total compensation delivered in the form of equity-based compensation. 
2018 Total Compensation Pay Mix1 
(1)    The percentages reflect the Named Executive Officer's base salary as of December 31, 2018, target annual cash incentive award for 2018 and target long-term, equity-based incentive for 2018. 
The Committee considers several factors and objectives relevant to each program when determining compensation. The Committee also contemplates the impact of each award on the Total Direct Compensation package. Total Direct Compensation opportunities are intended to target the median (50th percentile) of the relevant market data, and actual compensation (both amount and mix) for executives varies based on their performance, prior experience, and other pertinent factors. In addition, for purposes of attracting and retaining key executives, the Committee may determine that an additional award, an above-median sign-on package, an incentive guarantee for a new hire, or a Total Direct Compensation package that is above market median, is appropriate.

As shown in the pay mix charts above, the annual cash incentive award and long-term, equity-based incentives constitute the majority of executive officers' Total Direct Compensation under our pay-for-performance structure. The actual amounts realized by executive officers under these incentive plans vary based on individual performance and the performance of the Company. 
Company performance under these incentive plans is evaluated from a variety of perspectives, including: 
2018 Executive Compensation Plan Design and Award Decisions 
As stated above, compensation is delivered through three primary elements: base salary, an annual cash incentive through our Variable Compensation Plan, and long-term, equity-based incentives. We review and assess our compensation practices and program on an annual basis, taking into account the Company's strategic objectives, compensation philosophy, regulatory guidance, risk culture, and external market practices. Each element of the senior executive's compensation program, along with any changes that were made to the program for 2018, are described in the following paragraphs. 
Base Salary. The Committee reviews individual base salaries of the Company's executive officers annually or at the time of promotion or hire, as applicable. The objectives of the Company's base salary program are to provide salaries at a level that allows the Company to attract and retain qualified executives and to recognize and reward individual performance. The following items are considered when determining base salary levels:

Mr. Carmichael received a 10 percent base salary increase in 2018, based on the conclusions of the Committee's annual review and in recognition of the Company's performance during the year, as well as Mr. Carmichael's individual performance and positioning relative to peers. 
2018 Variable Compensation Plan Design. The Variable Compensation Plan's objective is to reward executives for strong corporate, business unit, and individual performance. The design of our 2018 Variable Compensation Plan was structured as follows: 
It is the view of the Committee that this mix of Bancorp funding metrics provides executives with balanced incentive to increase the level of absolute earnings growth, ensures that shareholder capital is used efficiently to generate competitive returns, and assesses the cost efficiency of the Company's operations. The funding modifiers are useful as complementary metrics to add focus on best-in-class business processes. The Committee retains discretion to adjust pool funding upward or downward based on other factors, such as individual performance and risk assessment, as well. 
Variable Compensation Plan Performance Goals. The financial plan approved by the Board of Directors includes specific target goals for the Company in each of the Bancorp funding metrics as detailed below. When determining the available funding pool for all participants, including NEOs, of the Variable Compensation Plan, the Committee considers actual performance against these goals, in addition to the four funding modifiers.

 participant based on qualitative assessments of individual performance against a set of stated objectives and, additionally for executives, an individual risk assessment. Amounts realizable from prior compensation awards do not influence decisions relative to future awards. To determine the Variable Compensation Plan funding pool, performance against each target Bancorp funding metric is reviewed to determine the performance level that was achieved, with results between threshold and target, and target and maximum, being interpolated. The overall funding amount represents the sum of the weighted average score for each one of the Bancorp funding metrics. 
The Committee may use final results on the funding modifiers to increase or decrease the pool funding amount. The Committee may exercise discretion to increase the funding pool amount up to a maximum of 10 basis points; however, downward discretion is not capped and can be made in any amount deemed appropriate.

Performance against Variable Compensation Plan Goals. Company performance against the 2018 goals set for the Variable Compensation Plan were very strong. Consistent with our practice in evaluating performance against the Bancorp funding metrics, reported performance results were adjusted to exclude the financial effects of certain events not contemplated in the targets, the ("2018 VCP Adjusted Actual") amounts, in the plan year. In determining 2018 VCP Adjusted Actual performance for the plan, items related to the Company's Visa total return swap, 2018 sales of Worldpay, Inc. securities, branch optimization, securities gains and losses, an FDIC surcharge, the adoption of a new accounting methodology for low income housing transactions, MB merger costs, and a foundation donation were excluded.

The Committee believes that performance shares are an important piece of the equity-based incentive compensation opportunity because they create a clear connection between results achieved and compensation earned. In addition, the Committee believes that full-value awards in the form of performance shares and restricted stock units complement each other and are important for driving strong retention value and enhanced ownership-creation opportunities, which is why they are a meaningful portion of the long-term, equity-based incentive opportunity. The Committee also believes that a portion of the opportunity should come from a growth-oriented incentive, specifically Stock Appreciation Rights, or "SARs", which align executives' interests with those of the Company's shareholders. The Committee determined in 2017 that the mix of long-term incentives for grants to be made in 2018 was appropriate based on the Company's long-term incentive plan objectives, strategic objectives, compensation philosophy, regulatory guidance, risk culture, and competitive practice. 
Target award levels are established at the beginning of the year for each executive officer considering market median compensation for each position. Award levels are not automatically made at target. Actual award levels are based on Company performance, and the Committee includes qualitative assessments of individual performance of each Named Executive Officer in the areas shown in the graphic display above. Amounts realizable from prior compensation awards do not influence decisions relative to future awards.

The grant date is the date of the Committee's approval of the awards, which typically is at a first quarter meeting of the Committee or at the annual shareholder meeting in April. The grant dates for awards made in 2018 are detailed in the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table later in this proxy statement. The Company does not adjust the timing of its annual grant based on SEC filings or press releases. Rather, the annual grant date is established and communicated well in advance. 
Performance share grants made in 2018 were structured as follows: 
Performance share grants are granted at "target"; calculated by taking 45% of the LTI award amount divided by the Company's closing stock price on the date of grant. Executives have the opportunity to earn between zero and 150 percent of their target award based on the Company's three year cumulative result on Return on Average Common Equity ("ROACE") versus our Compensation Peer Group. 
RSUs have a three-year graded vesting schedule. These grants do not have voting rights during the vesting period, but are eligible for dividend equivalent payments, which are payable in cash concurrently with dividends. 
SARs are granted at the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and have a 10-year term. Grants made in 2018 have a three-year graded vesting schedule. The Company does not grant discounted stock options or SARs, re-price previously granted stock options, or SARs, or grant reload stock options. 
The Committee believes that the design of the long-term, equity-based incentive plan provides incentive for the creation of shareholder value since the full benefit of the grant to each Named Executive Officer can be realized only with an appreciation in the price of the Company's common stock or based on relative ROACE, depending on the type of award.

Payout of 2016 Performance Share Awards. The 2016 performance share grant measured the Company's performance on Return on Average Equity ("ROAE") versus our compensation peer group over the three year period beginning January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018. In its February 2019 meeting, the Committee reviewed final ROAE results showing the Company placed in the 75th percentile versus peers and the Committee approved a 140 percent payout. The grant paid out in Company stock and the shares were distributed on the vesting date of February 12, 2019. 
Other Long-term, Equity-based Plan Provisions. The Variable Compensation Plan and long-term, equity-based incentive compensation awards made in 2018 were authorized under the Company's 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), which was approved and adopted by the Company's shareholders in 2017. 
The Committee has delegated to certain Named Executive Officers, as well as to the chief human resources officer, the authority to grant ordinary course equity awards for recruiting and retention purposes up to specified limits. 
Determination of Long-term, Equity-based Incentive Awards. The chief executive officer recommends the award levels for each Named Executive Officer except for himself, and the Committee makes the final award determination for all Named Executive Officers, including the chief executive officer. The award considerations are not based on a formula. Rather, the Committee may choose to make the actual award higher or lower than the target award based on the qualitative assessment of performance against stated objectives as well as the individual's risk assessment results. The Committee believes that, by including a performance element as part of the up-front grant process, the Company is able to reinforce further the pay-for-performance objective of the Company's compensation structure. 
When making the final determination to grant long-term, equity-based incentive compensation awards in January 2018, the Committee considered information relating to market median compensation levels, Company financial performance during 2017, the qualitative performance assessment described below, and individual risk performance assessments. After reviewing this information for 2017, the Committee granted a 2018 long-term equity incentive compensation award of 123 percent of target for the chief executive officer and equity awards of 100 percent for each of the other Named Executive Officers. 
Qualitative Performance Assessments. The individual qualitative performance assessment is a review of each Named Executive Officer's performance against a set of stated objectives. This assessment is performed by the Board of Directors with respect to the chairman, president and chief executive officer's performance and by the chairman, president and chief executive officer with respect to the performance of the other NEOs. Each NEO was evaluated on the following objectives:

Key specific objectives considered for 2018 performance for each Named Executive Officer are as follows: 
For Mr. Carmichael: As chairman, president, and chief executive officer, Mr. Carmichael had responsibility for short and long-term financial results, the successful execution of NorthStar strategies, leadership of key growth, and innovation initiatives. He was also responsible for customer experience results, succession planning, the creation of an inclusive and diverse workforce, strong risk management and regulatory results, and Board leadership. 
The Variable Compensation Plan award was based on Mr. Carmichael's 2018 performance against these objectives and his overall contribution to Fifth Third's performance. The long-term, equity-based award granted in January 2018 was based on performance against 2017 objectives. 
For Mr. Tuzun: As chief financial officer, Mr. Tuzun had responsibility for managing the Company's financial performance against the 2018 plan, providing strategic advice and support of NorthStar initiatives, managing market and liquidity risks, managing the Company's capital plan, including 2018 CCAR submissions, and providing strategic and analytic support for M&A activity. 
The Variable Compensation Plan award was based on 2018 performance against these objectives. The long-term, equity-based award granted in January 2018 was based on performance against 2017 objectives. 
For Mr. Anderson: As chief operating officer, Mr. Anderson was responsible for achieving NorthStar financial results, leading the commercial line of business to achieve both organic and inorganic growth targets, managing operational, compliance, credit and market risks, and leading efforts to enhance customer satisfaction. 
The Variable Compensation Plan award was based on 2018 performance against these objectives. The long-term, equity-based award granted in January 2018 was based on performance against 2017 objectives. 
For Ms. Tanner: As chief administrative officer, Ms. Tanner had responsibility for leading key Bancorp operations processes, managing real estate and facilities, business process outsourcing, and supplier expenses, leading the $30B community commitment, managing compliance, operational and reputational risks and driving growth through effective marketing strategies. 
The Variable Compensation Plan award was based on Ms. Tanner's 2018 performance against these objectives. The long-term, equity-based award granted in January 2018 was based on performance against 2017 objectives. 
For Mr. Spence: As head of consumer bank, payments, and strategy, Mr. Spence was responsible for leading effective strategic planning, achieving NorthStar financial results, managing operational, compliance, credit and strategic risks, accelerating organic and inorganic growth, and driving the Fifth Third's digital transformation. 
The Variable Compensation Plan award was based on Mr. Spence's 2018 performance against these objectives. The long-term, equity-based award granted in January 2018 was based on performance against 2017 objectives.

In addition, an independent risk management assessment is performed by the chief risk officer for each of the NEOs, other than himself and by the chief executive officer for the chief risk officer. This assessment is used to determine if the NEOs are achieving risk-balanced results while consistently demonstrating behaviors that support an appropriate risk culture. 
The Variable Compensation Plan award was based on Mr. Forrest's 2018 performance against the qualitative objectives and risk management assessment. The long-term, equity-based award granted in January 2018 was based on performance against 2017 objectives and risk management assessments. 
The Committee's Considerations. The Committee considers both the aggregate amount and mix of an executive officer's Total Direct Compensation when making the decisions discussed above. The Committee assesses Total Direct Compensation relative to competitive market data annually during its December meeting. Recommendations for executive compensation are reviewed and approved as final during its first quarter meeting. 
Based on its most recent review of the competitive data, the Committee has determined that the compensation structure for executive officers is effective and appropriate. The structure reflects the Company's compensation philosophy in that its incentive payout ranges are aligned with the competitive market data; it has appropriate leverage to ensure a strong linkage between compensation, risk outcomes, and performance; and it drives rewards based on the most relevant performance measures for the Company and shareholders. 
The Committee also has reviewed the internal relationships between the compensation for the chief executive officer and for other executive officers and has deemed them to be appropriate. The Committee believes that the relative difference between the compensation of the chief executive officer and the compensation of the Company's other executive officers is consistent with such differences found in the Company's Compensation Peer Group. 
Tax and Accounting Impacts of Compensation Programs 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the tax deductibility of compensation for certain executive officers that is more than $1 million. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, Section 162(m) provided an exemption from this deduction limitation for compensation that qualified as "performance-based compensation". However, among other changes to Section 162(m), the exemption for performance-based compensation was repealed, effective for taxable years beginning December 31, 2017, subject to transition relief for certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. The Committee is not limited to paying compensation that is fully deductible and retains the flexibility to consider tax and accounting impacts as some factors among many in structuring compensation programs. For the year ending December 31, 2018, the tax impact related to non-deductible compensation expense was approximately $4.7 million. 
Accounting and Financial Reporting. The Company accounts for long-term, equity-based incentive compensation payments including SARs, RSUs, and performance shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).

2019 Executive Compensation Plan Design Changes 
2019 Variable Compensation Plan Changes. The Company and the Committee review the Variable Compensation Plan annually to determine if changes should be made to the plan for the next year. 
2019 Long-term, Equity-based Incentive Plan Changes. The Company and the Committee also reviews the long-term, equity-based incentive plan annually to determine if any changes need to be made to the plan (i.e., award mix, performance measures, modifiers, etc.) for the next year. During the review done in 2018, the Committee approved implementation of dividend equivalent payments on performance share grants to start with the February 2019 annual grant. Dividend equivalents will accrue in cash alongside the underlying award and will be subject to the same performance goals as the performance share grant. Payments will be paid only if, and at the same time as when, the shares are deemed earned and are approved for distribution. The Committee approved this change at its December 2018 meeting. 
Executive Benefits and Perquisites 
Summary of Eligibility for Benefits and Perquisites. The Company provides few benefits and perquisites to executive officers that are not available to the general employee population. Special benefits include health and fitness programs, a deferred compensation plan, financial planning reimbursement, nominal holiday gifts from time to time, and parking. Additionally, spouses or guests of executive officers may be provided travel and/or entertainment benefits related to business events at which their attendance is expected and appropriate, such as Company recognition events or trips, recruiting meals, or social events held for marketing or other business purposes. These benefits are often provided with little or no incremental cost to the Company. The Company does not provide tax gross-ups for these special perquisites. 
Retirement Benefits. The Company's retirement benefits are designed to assist employees in accumulating wealth to provide income during their retirement years. The retirement benefits are designed to attract and retain employees and to encourage employees to save money for their retirement while maintaining a competitive cost structure for the Company. Based on the Company's research using two national benefits surveys, its retirement benefits are positioned near the market median for similar employers. 
The Company's primary retirement benefit plan is a defined contribution 401(k) plan with a Company match. The same 401(k) plan is maintained for all eligible employees, including the Named Executive Officers. The 401(k) plan provides a match to employee contributions of 150 percent on the first 2 percent and 100 percent on the next 4 percent of eligible compensation an employee contributes to the plan, and is invested in the employee's selection of the plan's existing investment alternatives. This Company match is immediately 100 percent vested. All Named Executive Officers are eligible for this plan up to the IRS wage or contribution limits. Under the plan, NEOs may not defer their future cash compensation into Company stock. 
The Company offers employees at certain salary band levels, including its executive officers, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. This plan allows for the deferral of base salary and awards received under the

 Variable Compensation Plan. The plan also provides for the Company to make a contribution for loss of the qualified plan 401(k) match due to the deferral of pay into this plan or due to wage or contribution limitations under the qualified 401(k) plan. The deferred funds receive earnings based on the mutual funds elected by each executive. The executives do not earn any preferential or above-market returns on these earnings. Under the plan, NEOs may not defer their cash compensation into Company stock. 
The Company maintains a defined benefit pension plan which was frozen to new participants as of November 15, 1998. Employees who met the age and service requirement at that time are "grandfathered" and continue to accrue benefits under that plan. No Named Executive Officers are participants in this plan. 
Health and Welfare Benefits. The Company offers broad-based medical, dental, vision, life, and disability plans to all of its employees. The Company also provides to each Named Executive Officer a comprehensive physical exam program and access to an executive fitness facility. 
Severance and Change in Control Benefits. The Fifth Third Bancorp Executive Change in Control Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan") provides severance benefits to certain officers upon a qualifying termination after a change in control, subject to execution of a release and non-compete agreement. The plan covers approximately 43 officers, including all Named Executive Officers. 
Under the Severance Plan, certain executives will receive severance if, in connection with a change in control, the executive's employment is terminated without Cause (as defined in the Severance Plan) or the executive resigns for Good Reason (as defined in the Severance Plan). For this purpose, a change in control would occur in any of the following instances:

Executive Ownership and Capital Accumulation 
Stock Ownership Guidelines. The executive compensation program is designed, in part, to provide opportunities for executive officers to build ownership in the Company and to align performance with shareholder interests. Accordingly, the Company has established stock ownership guidelines for senior employees in the Company's salary band structure, including the executive officers. The amount of stock required to be retained varies based upon the assigned salary band and associated multiple of base salary.

[END TABLE]
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of Greg D. Carmichael, our chief executive officer ("CEO"), and the median annual total compensation of our employees. The Company believes that the ratio of pay included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
As of December 31, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than the CEO) was $64,186; and   
• The annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included on page 61, was  $11,173,652.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation for our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of our employees was 174 to 1. 
In order to determine this ratio, we first identified one of our employees as the median employee. Since only 11 percent of our employees receive equity compensation, we considered total cash compensation as a consistently applied compensation measure. As allowed by the rules, we excluded our CEO and our 8 employees located outside the United States (6 in Canada and 2 in the United Kingdom) who are less than 1 percent of our total 18,085 employee base. We then examined the total cash compensation (salary, wages, and bonus) for the remaining employees who were employed on December 31, 2018, as reflected in our payroll records and reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for 2018. In making this examination we annualized the salary of approximately 2,161 full-time employees hired in 2018 who did not work the entire year. We did not annualize the pay of any other type of employee (i.e. part-time, co-ops, etc.) or make any other adjustments to the payroll data. 
Once we identified the median employee, we then compared all elements of that employee's 2018 compensation in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K; the same methodology we used for our Named Executive Officers in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table on page 61 of this proxy statement, to comparable total compensation of our CEO in order to determine the ratio as shown below:

December 31, 2018 was the date selected to identify the median employee because it is the date consistent with the rest of the discussion included in this proxy statement and because our employee base does not materially change at any point during the year. 
As stated earlier in this discussion, we believe compensation must be competitive to attract and retain essential talent, reward high performance, and be internally equitable. Our expected total compensation opportunities for our employees are specific to the role they hold at the Company and generally reflect market median pay levels, with variations based on specific talent needs, experience, and other internal factors. We believe that actual total compensation should vary with the performance of the organization, such that outstanding performance results in above-market compensation. As discussed above in the "Performance Against Variable Compensation Plan Goals" section, the Company performed above target on the goals set under the Variable Compensation Plan and payouts reflect above target achievement. We attribute the year over year increase in ratio, from 145:1 in 2017 to 174:1 in 2018, to these above target payments under the Variable Compensation Plan.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation. As discussed above, the Company maintains a Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan ("NQDCP") that allows participant and Company contributions. 
The plan allows participants to defer up to 70 percent of their base salary and up to 100 percent of their Variable Compensation award. In addition, the Company makes contributions for loss of qualified 401(k) plan matching contributions for two reasons: (1) due to base salary or Variable Compensation Plan award deferrals into the NQDC plan and/or (2) due to wage and/or contribution limitations under the qualified 401(k) plan. The Company's contribution to this plan is determined by taking the participant's eligible wages above the qualified 401(k) plan compensation limits ($275,000 for 2018) and applying the Company's 401(k) match (7 percent). If other qualified plan 401(k) limitations applied, the participants would also have contributions made to the plan for those limitations. 
Distributions are made in a lump sum or in up to 10 annual installments. The Named Executive Officers may elect when the payments commence. The earliest distribution is August of the calendar year following the year of retirement. The entire distribution may be made no later than the 10th calendar year following the year of retirement. This plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409(A) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Voluntary or Without Cause. The Company does not currently have contracts with its Named Executive Officers that would require cash severance payments upon voluntary termination. Under the terms of the 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2017 Incentive Compensation Plans, if the Named Executive Officer meets certain retirement eligibility criteria, any exercisable SARs would remain outstanding and under certain other criteria outstanding equity awards may continue to vest. These values, as applicable, are included in the table below.

With Cause. The Company does not currently have contracts with its Named Executive Officers that would require cash severance payments upon involuntary termination by the Company for cause. Under the terms of the Company's 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2017 Incentive Compensation Plans, all equity-based awards would be immediately forfeited. 
Death and Disability. Under the terms of the 2008, 2011, 2014, and 2017 Incentive Compensation Plans, all unvested stock and option awards vest immediately and option awards remain outstanding for the remaining term of the grant. Performance shares are earned on a prorated basis determined by the Named Executive Officer's full months of service and are adjusted based on the achievement of the performance goals for the full performance period. The table below reflects an assumed payout each Named Executive Officer would be eligible to receive if the Company achieved 100 percent of its performance goals for each outstanding performance share award and paid out effective December 31, 2018. In the event of death, the defined benefit pension pays a 50 percent joint and survivor benefit and the 401(k) plan immediately vests. 
Change in Control. As described in the "Severance and Change in Control Benefits" section, the Company's Severance Plan provides for the payment of benefits upon a qualifying termination following a change in control (a "triggering event") for the Named Executive Officers and other officers of the Company. In exchange for the payments and benefits under the plan, the eligible Named Executive Officer would be required to sign an agreement at the time of the triggering event not to compete with, nor solicit employees or customers from, the Company for a period of three years following the executive's termination for Messrs. Carmichael, Tuzun, and Anderson and for a period of two years for Messrs. Spence and Forrest and Ms. Tanner. 
The cash severance payment would be equal to 2.99 times the Named Executive Officer's base salary plus his or her Variable Compensation amount for Messrs. Carmichael, Tuzun, and Anderson and 2 times base salary plus his Variable Compensation amount for Messrs. Spence and Forrest and Ms. Tanner. In addition, the Named Executive Officer would earn a prorated Variable Compensation award for the fiscal year of the termination. The table below reflects an assumed full-year Variable Compensation award at the amount each Named Executive Officer would be eligible to receive if the Company achieves 100 percent of its Variable Compensation Plan performance targets. 
Since April 2008, we have not granted any awards that provide for "single-trigger" vesting upon a change in control to our executives. Instead, as defined in our incentive compensation plans, any outstanding long-term, equity-based award (stock options, SARs, and restricted stock awards) would vest immediately only if there is a change in control and a subsequent qualifying termination of employment ("double-trigger" vesting). Performance share awards would be deemed earned and paid out based on the greater of (1) the extent to which applicable performance goals have been met through and including the effective date of the change in control or (2) the value on the date of the change in control of the number of target shares, in each case prorated based on the portion of the performance period elapsed at the time of the change in control. The value of performance share awards would be calculated based on current market value of the Company's stock on the date of the change in control times the earned number of shares. The table below reflects an assumed payout each Named Executive Officer would be eligible to receive if the Company achieved 100 percent of its performance goals for each outstanding performance share award and paid out effective December 31, 2018. The treatment of equity awards applies to all long-term, equity-based award recipients eligible for change in control benefits, not just for the Company's Named Executive Officers.

Upon a triggering event, Messrs. Carmichael, Tuzun, and Anderson would receive three, and Messrs. Spence and Forrest and Ms. Tanner would receive two, additional years of age and service credit under the qualified and nonqualified defined contribution plans; medical, dental, and life insurance benefits; and the additional value, if any, of the pension benefit at age 60. These benefits are reflected in the Other Benefits category below. The NEO's termination would not result in enhanced retirement benefits beyond the benefits described in the Pension Benefits section. Eligibility for these benefits, as well as any other benefits in a change in control scenario, is determined in a manner consistent with all eligible employees, not just the Company's Named Executive Officers. 
Material differences in circumstances relate to retirement eligibility, as described above. As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Carmichael, Tuzun, and Forrest meet one or more of the retirement eligibility criteria under outstanding long-term, equity-based compensation award agreements. All three of them have met the criteria in order to retain the exercisability of all vested SARs, except in a termination for cause scenario. In addition, Messrs. Carmichael and Forrest have met the criteria to allow all awards granted after January 1, 2016, to continue to vest, except in a termination for cause scenario. 
The tables below contain the total payments one would receive under each termination scenario if the Named Executive Officer separated on December 31, 2018. For all termination scenarios, the figures for long-term, equity-based incentive compensation awards are as of December 31, 2018, at the closing stock price of $23.53 on that date.

In 2018, the Human Capital and Compensation Committee members were Messrs. Akins, Heminger, and McCallister and Ms. Mallesch.

[END TABLE]
The Charter of the Company's Human Capital and Compensation Committee requires that the Human Capital and Compensation Committee pre-approve all related person or affiliate transactions between Fifth Third Bancorp and any of its affiliates, directors, officers, and/or employees or in which any of such persons directly or indirectly is interested or benefited, other than for extensions of credit otherwise covered by policies and procedures governed by Federal Reserve Regulation O. 
Certain of these related person transactions are required to be disclosed by Fifth Third Bancorp in this proxy statement: 
One of our directors, Katherine B. Blackburn, is the Executive Vice President of the Cincinnati Bengals professional football team. She and members of her immediate family own substantially all of the equity interests in the parent company of the Cincinnati Bengals. During 2018, we paid the Cincinnati Bengals approximately $1.7 million for sponsorship arrangements, tickets, and advertising expenses. Prior to Ms. Blackburn's appointment to the Board in September 2014, Fifth Third and the Cincinnati Bengals signed a five year contract extension for these arrangements that call for total payments by Fifth Third Bancorp during that period of over $7.9 million. By virtue of Ms. Blackburn's being an executive officer and a principal owner of the Cincinnati Bengals, she is deemed to be a related party having a direct material interest in these arrangements. 
Kevin Hipskind is employed by Fifth Third Bank as an Executive Vice President. He is the brother-in-law of Philip R. McHugh, who is an Executive Vice President of Fifth Third Bancorp. In 2018, Mr. Hipskind received compensation of approximately $741,874 including base salary and incentive and equity compensation as well as benefits generally available to similarly situated employees. 
The compensation package of Kevin Hipskind was established by Fifth Third Bancorp in accordance with its employment and compensation policies and practices applicable to employees with equivalent qualifications and responsibilities in similar positions. 
We have also engaged in transactions with certain entities that have reported beneficial ownership of over 5% of our common stock. In 2018 we paid BlackRock Financial Management, Inc. approximately $2,247,929 for tools used to manage an investment portfolio, including a trading platform, risk analytics, and daily reporting. All of these business relationships and transactions were conducted at arm's length in our ordinary course of business. 
Additionally, Fifth Third Bancorp has engaged and intends to continue to engage in the lending of money through its subsidiary bank to various of its directors, executive officers and shareholders, and corporations or other entities in which they may own a controlling interest. The loans to such persons and/or entities (i) were made in the ordinary course of business, (ii) were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the lender, and (iii) did not involve more than a normal risk of collectability or did not present other features unfavorable to Fifth Third Bancorp.

Certain Additional Transactions. In the event that the closing of the Merger with MB Financial, Inc. occurs prior to the Annual Meeting and Mr. Daniels and Mr. Harvey are thereby included in management's nomination for directors, the following additional information will also be relevant: 
Effective June 30, 2014, MB Financial, Inc. entered into a letter agreement (the "Escrow Letter Agreement") with certain principal stockholders of Taylor Capital (the "Principal Stockholders") pursuant to which the Principal Stockholders agreed to be responsible for repayment of 60% of the restitution payments made by Taylor Capital's subsidiary bank, Cole Taylor Bank, or MB Financial Bank, as successor to Cole Taylor Bank, under the Order to Cease and Desist and Order of Assessment of Civil Money Penalty Issued Upon Consent Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the Illinois Banking Act, As Amended (the "Consent Order") entered into by Cole Taylor Bank with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the State of Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, Division of Banking, for a specified period of time calculated on an after-tax basis if the Company realizes a tax benefit therefrom. 
The restitution payments are subject to a maximum of the lesser of: (i) $30,000,000; or (ii) the total amount of such restitution that relates to fees collected by the third party named in the Consent Order, with which Cole Taylor Bank previously had a deposit program relationship, from affected account holders between May 4, 2012 and June 30, 2014. Included among the Principal Stockholders are: Prairie Capital IV, L.P. and Prairie Capital IV QP, L.P. (collectively, the "Prairie Entities"), with which C. Bryan Daniels is affiliated as a managing member of the sole general partner of each of the Prairie Entities. Mr. Daniels has a 2.31% ownership interest in Prairie Capital IV, L.P. and Prairie Capital IV QP, L.P. 
Prairie Capital IV, L.P. and Prairie Capital IV QP, L.P. are obligated to contribute approximately 7.77% and 7.77%, respectively, toward the total repayment responsibility of the Principal Stockholders under the Escrow Letter Agreement. The Escrow Letter Agreement originally provided that, during the four-year period after the closing of the MB-Taylor Capital Merger, the payment obligation of the Principal Stockholders would be secured by their deposit into escrow of cash or, with respect to the Prairie Entities, a letter of credit. The Escrow Letter Agreement was amended on December 16, 2016 to terminate the escrow arrangement effective December 15, 2016 (the "Escrow Termination Date"). The Principal Stockholders, other than the Prairie Entities, will remain obligated for four years following the Escrow Termination Date on an unsecured basis. The Prairie Entities will remain obligated on an unsecured basis for three years following the Escrow Termination Date.

 REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE     
[END TABLE]
The following Report of the Audit Committee does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other Company filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent the Company specifically incorporates this Report by reference therein. 
In accordance with its written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, which may be found in the Corporate Governance Section of the Company's website at www.53.com, the Audit Committee of the Board assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing, and financial reporting practices of the Company. During 2018, the Committee met twelve (12) times, and the Committee discussed the interim financial and other information contained in each quarterly earnings announcement and periodic filings to the SEC with the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller, and the independent external audit firm prior to public release. 
In discharging its oversight responsibility as to the audit process, the Committee obtained from the independent external audit firm a formal written statement describing all relationships between the firm and the Company that might bear on the firm's independence consistent with applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) regarding the independent accountant's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent accountant the independent accountant's independence and satisfied itself as to the firm's independence. The Committee also discussed with management, the internal auditors, and the independent external audit firm the quality and adequacy of the Company's internal controls and the internal audit function's organization, responsibilities, budget, and staffing. The Committee reviewed both with the independent external audit firm and internal auditors, their audit plans, audit scope, and identification of audit risks. 
The Committee discussed and reviewed with the independent external audit firm all communications required by standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, and Rule 2-07, Communication with Audit Committees, of Regulation S-X, and, with and without management present, discussed and reviewed the results of the independent external audit firm's examination of the financial statements. The Committee also discussed the results of internal audits. 
The Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and management's assessment as to the effectiveness of Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 with management and the independent external audit firm. Management has the responsibility for the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements and their assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the independent external audit firm has the responsibility for the audits of those consolidated statements and of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. 
Based on the above-mentioned reviews and discussions with management and the independent external audit firm, the Committee recommended to the Board that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting be included in its

The Audit Committee is responsible for pre-approving all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by the independent external audit firm, except as described below. 
The Audit Committee will establish general guidelines for the permissible scope and nature of any permitted non-audit services in connection with its annual review of the audit plan and will review such guidelines with the Board of Directors. Pre-approval may be granted by action of the full Audit Committee or, in the absence of such Audit Committee action, by the Audit Committee Chair whose action shall be considered to be that of the entire Committee. Pre-approval shall not be required for the provision of non-audit services if (1) the aggregate amount of all such non-audit services constitute no more than 5% of the total amount of fees paid by the Company to the auditors during the fiscal year in which the non-audit services are provided, (2) such services were not recognized by the Company at the time of engagement to be non-audit services, and (3) such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and approved prior to the completion of the audit. No services were provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP during 2018 or 2017 pursuant to this exception.

Company Proposal 1: Independent External Audit Firm 
(Item 2 on Proxy Card) 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors proposes and recommends that the shareholders approve the selection by the Committee of the firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as its independent external audit firm for the Company for the year 2019. The firm has served as the independent external audit firm for Fifth Third Bank since 1970 and the Company since 1975. Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting to make such comments as they desire and to respond to questions from shareholders of the Company. Action by the shareholders is not required by law in the appointment of an independent external audit firm, but their appointment is submitted by the Audit Committee in order to give the shareholders a voice in the designation of the independent external audit firm. If the resolution approving Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent external audit firm is rejected by the shareholders, then the Audit Committee will reconsider its choice of independent external audit firm. Even if the resolution is approved, the Audit Committee at its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent external audit firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the Company's independent external audit firm. The Audit Committee is also responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with the Company's retention of Deloitte & Touche LLP. In order to assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent external audit firm. Additionally, the Audit Committee and its Chair are directly involved in the selection and mandated rotation of the lead engagement partner from Deloitte & Touche LLP. 
The members of the Audit Committee believe that the continued retention of Deloitte & Touche LLP to serve as the Company's independent external audit firm is in the best interest of the Company and its investors. 
Vote Required 
Proxies received by the Company and not revoked prior to or at the Annual Meeting will be voted in favor of the resolution unless otherwise instructed by the shareholder. Pursuant to the Company's Code of Regulations, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Company's common stock present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal is required to approve the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote cast against this proposal. Shares not voted on this proposal by brokers and other entities holding shares on behalf of beneficial owners will not be counted as present to vote on this proposal and will have no effect on the outcome.

Company Proposal 2: Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
(Item 3 on Proxy Card) 
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are seeking advisory shareholder approval of the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "Say-on-Pay" proposal, gives you, as a shareholder, the opportunity to endorse or not endorse our executive pay program through the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the shareholders advise that they approve the compensation of Fifth Third Bancorp's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to the disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (which disclosure shall include the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section and the compensation tables and any related material in the "Compensation of Named Executive Officers and Directors" section of this proxy statement for its 2019 Annual Meeting). 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board. However, the Human Capital and Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
As discussed in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the Human Capital and Compensation Committee has determined that the compensation structure for executive officers is effective and appropriate and has determined that the Company's aggregate 2018 Total Rewards package (and potential payouts in the severance and change-in-control scenarios) for its Named Executive Officers are reasonable and appropriate. Shareholders are encouraged to read the section of this proxy statement titled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" as well as the tabular disclosure regarding Named Executive Officer compensation together with the accompanying narrative disclosure. 
We are currently conducting "Say-on-Pay" advisory votes on an annual basis. The next "Say-on-Pay" vote is currently scheduled for the 2020 Annual Meeting. However, please see Company Proposal 3 regarding an advisory vote on the frequency of these "Say-on-Pay" votes. 
Vote Required 
Proxies received by Fifth Third Bancorp and not revoked prior to or at the Annual Meeting will be voted in favor of this non-binding advisory proposal unless otherwise instructed by the shareholder. Pursuant to our Code of Regulations, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal is required to approve this advisory proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote cast against this advisory proposal. Shares not voted on this advisory proposal by brokers and other entities holding shares on behalf of beneficial owners will not be counted as present to vote on this proposal and will have no effect on the outcome.

Company Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on Frequency of Votes on 
Executive Compensation 
(Item 4 on Proxy Card) 
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are seeking advisory shareholder approval of the frequency of advisory shareholder votes on compensation of the Named Executive Officers through the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the shareholders advise that an advisory resolution with respect to executive compensation should be presented to the shareholders every one, two, or three years as reflected by their votes for each of these alternatives in connection with this resolution. 
In voting on this resolution, you should mark your proxy for one, two, or three years based on your preference as to the frequency with which an advisory vote on executive compensation should be held. If you have no preference, you should abstain. 
The Board believes that current best corporate practices and governance trends favor an annual advisory vote and has determined to hold an annual advisory vote. This would give shareholders the opportunity to react promptly to emerging trends in compensation, and give the Board and the Human Capital and Compensation Committee the opportunity to evaluate compensation decisions in light of yearly feedback from shareholders. 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board. However, the Board will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering the frequency of advisory shareholder approval of the compensation of named executive officers. 
Although we are only required to conduct an advisory vote on the frequency of votes on executive compensation every six years, we believe that holding an annual vote will allow the shareholders and our Board to promptly consider this frequency as emerging corporate practices and governance trends develop. 
Vote Required 
Proxies received by Fifth Third Bancorp and not revoked prior to or at the Annual Meeting will be voted in favor of "every 1 year" unless otherwise instructed by the shareholder. Pursuant to our Code of Regulations, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal is required to approve one of the selections under this advisory proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote cast against each of the time periods presented in this advisory proposal. Shares not voted on this advisory proposal by brokers and other entities holding shares on behalf of beneficial owners will not be counted as present to vote on this proposal and will have no effect on the outcome.

If approved by the shareholders, the Plan will succeed the Fifth Third Bancorp 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan, adopted by the Company's Board of Directors on February 28, 2017 and approved by the Company's shareholders by vote at a meeting held on April 18, 2017 (the "2017 Plan"). If shareholders approve the Plan, we will file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8, as soon as reasonably practicable after the approval to register the shares available for issuance under the Plan. 
The Company is asking shareholders to authorize a number of shares of the Company's common stock available under the Plan at a level that the Company believes will, based on current grant practices and plan design, be sufficient for awards for approximately two to three years following shareholder approval. Approval of the Plan will authorize 40 million shares of the Company's common stock for award issuance. Under the Plan, shares, if any, issued as full-value awards will have the effect of reducing the aggregate shares available for issuance on a 2.5 to 1 basis. 
The following description sets forth the material terms of the Plan. It does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Plan attached as Annex A to this Proxy Statement. All capitalized terms that are not defined herein are defined in the Plan. 
Purpose of the Plan 
The Plan is intended to promote the success of the Company (and its subsidiaries) by providing incentives to its employees, directors, and consultants that link their personal interests to the financial success of the Company and to the growth in long-term shareholder value. The Plan is designed to provide flexibility to the Company in its ability to attract and retain the services of employees and directors upon whose judgment, interest, and special effort the successful outcome of its operations largely is dependent. 
Grant Practice Focuses on Performance-Based Awards 
The Company currently employs several types of long-term, equity-based incentive compensation awards: stock-settled stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock or restricted stock units ("restricted stock" or "RSUs", respectively), and performance shares and performance share units ("performance shares"). The Committee believes that the issuance of full-value share awards, in the form of restricted stock and performance shares, should comprise a meaningful portion of the long-term incentive. RSUs and performance shares complement each other, drive stronger retention value, and provide enhanced ownership creation opportunities. Performance shares also reinforce the Committee's objective to create a clear connection between results achieved and compensation earned. The Committee also believes that a portion of the long-term, equity-based incentive compensation opportunity for executives should come from a growth-oriented incentive (i.e., SARs) that aligns executives' interests with those of the Company's shareholders.

Key Considerations 
We are recommending that our shareholders approve the 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan because we believe the design of the Plan and the number of shares to be authorized for issuance thereunder will enable the Company to continue to maintain its strategic objectives and the corporate governance, regulatory, and competitive practices in granting equity to employees, directors, and consultants, which the Company believes are consistent with the interests of shareholders. We received assistance in the analysis of current trends, competitive practices, and investor perceptions relating to various aspects of the Plan, such as the number of shares authorized for issuance and usage of stock for long-term, equity-based incentive awards, including the following: 
Burn Rate. Burn rate, a measure of the speed at which companies use (or burn) shares available for grant in their equity compensation plans, is an important factor for investors concerned about shareholder dilution. The burn rate is defined as: the gross number of equity awards granted in a given year divided by the weighted average of common stock outstanding. Our burn rates for the past three years are shown in the table below. Full-value awards (awards other than stock appreciation rights and stock options) have been counted as 2 1⁄2 shares of common stock when calculating the burn rate, and performance shares have been excluded in the year of grant but included in the burn rate calculation in the year earned. Our average burn rate of 2.04 percent is in line with industry benchmarks.

   Three-year Average       2.04       
   Three-year Average       2.04       
[END TABLE]
As part of our ongoing review of our compensation plans, we use the annual usage of shares to help determine, among other things, the expected remaining life of a plan based on the remaining number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan. At similar annual usage levels, the additional 40 million shares to be authorized upon approval of the Plan are expected to cover awards for approximately two to three years starting in April 2019; a period that is within market practice. 
Overhang. Overhang is a commonly used measure of assessing the dilutive impact of equity programs such as the proposed Plan. A plan's overhang is equal to the number of equity award shares outstanding plus the number of shares available to be granted, divided by a company's total shares of common stock outstanding. Overhang shows how much existing shareholder ownership would be diluted if all outstanding stock and option awards and all authorized but unissued shares were introduced into the market. The additional 40 million shares being requested in this proposal would bring our aggregate overhang to 12 percent (as of February 7, 2019) which we believe aligns with the median levels at commercial banking organizations.

All of the Company's equity compensation plans have been approved by the Company's shareholders and the Company does not have any equity compensation plans that have not been approved by shareholders. 
On December 31, 2018 there were outstanding awards of approximately 26.2 million previously granted SARs, which have a weighted-average exercise price of $17.30 per share and a weighted-average term of 4.9 years; approximately 1.3 million performance shares1; and approximately 8.9 million shares of restricted stock under the 2017 Plan and prior plans (excluding options assumed in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions). 
On February 6, 2019, the Company granted an additional 4.3 million shares in connection with the Company's annual grant. On the date after the annual grant issuance, there were outstanding awards of approximately 26.2 million previously granted SARs, which have a weighted-average exercise price of $17.54 per share and a weighted-average term of 5.7 years; 1.5 million performance shares2; and approximately 11 million shares of restricted stock under the 2017 Plan and prior plans (excluding options assumed in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions). The February 6, 2019 annual grant, in combination with other plan activity that occurred since year-end 2018, left 3.2 million shares available for future issuance under the 2017 Plan. 
Administration 
The Committee will administer the Plan. The Committee is composed of three or more directors, each of whom qualifies as a "non-employee director" under Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Each member of the Committee also meets the director-independence criteria under the applicable Nasdaq Global Select Market listing rules. The Committee has broad discretion and authority to, among other things, select the officers, employees, directors, and consultants to whom awards may be granted, to determine the terms, conditions, form, and amount of the awards, to establish, where deemed applicable, performance goals with respect to awards and to measure and certify the achievement thereof, and to establish guidelines and procedures relating to awards. 
The Committee will have full power to administer and interpret the Plan and to adopt or establish, and to modify or waive, rules, regulations, agreements, guidelines, procedures, and instruments that it deems necessary or advisable for the administration and operation of the Plan. The Committee may delegate its authority to the chief executive officer, to other officers or to the Company's Pension, 401(k) and Medical Plan Committee (or any similar or successor committee), provided that such delegation will not extend to actions with respect to "officers" for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. 
Shares Available for Future Awards and Awards Outstanding 
Upon shareholder approval, the total number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to new awards under the Plan may not exceed 40 million. No additional awards will be made under the 2017 Plan and all remaining shares eligible for issuance under the 2017 Plan will be canceled. All prior plans have also been canceled and no awards may be made thereunder. Outstanding awards

 made under the 2017 Plan and prior plans will continue to be governed by the terms of those plans. Shares subject to those awards that are cash-settled, not issued, or are cancelled due to the failure to earn the shares under the award, or by reason of the cancellation, forfeiture or expiration of the award, will be once again available for issuance pursuant to awards made under the Plan. Shares of common stock shall not again be available if such shares are surrendered or withheld as payment of either the exercise price of an award or of withholding taxes in respect of an award. The exercise or settlement of an award of SARs reduces the shares of common stock available under the Plan in the gross number of SARs exercised or settled, not just the net amount of shares actually issued upon exercise or settlement of the award. Any shares acquired by the Company in the open market with proceeds received from option exercises will not be made available for awards under the Plan. 
The 40 million shares are approximately 6 percent of the Company's outstanding Common Stock as of December 31, 2018. 
Of the shares available for future awards under the Plan, shares issuable under full-value awards will be counted against the shares authorized on a 2.5 for 1 basis. 
Generally, no more than 5 percent of the shares of common stock may be issued with respect to awards with a vesting, restriction or performance period of less than one year. 
Shares of common stock issued in connection with awards that are assumed, converted or substituted pursuant to a merger, acquisition or similar transaction entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall not reduce the number of shares available to be issued under the Plan. 
The source of common stock issued, with respect to awards, may be authorized and unissued shares or shares that have been or may be reacquired in the open market, in private transactions, or otherwise. In the event of any corporate event or transaction, including, but not limited to, a change in the shares of common stock or the capitalization of the Company, such as may result from a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, separation, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split up, spin-off, or other distribution of stock or property of the Company, combination of shares, exchange of shares, dividend in kind, or other like change in capital structure or distribution, other than normal cash dividends, the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance, available for issuance, or covered by any outstanding award and the exercise price or other per share amounts applicable to any such award, and the various limitations described above, will be proportionately adjusted. 
Eligibility 
Any officer, employee, director, or consultant of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates is eligible to receive an award under the Plan. The basis for participation in the Plan is the Committee's decision, in its sole discretion, that an award to an eligible participant will further the Plan's purpose of promoting the success of the Company and its subsidiaries, which is generally set out in Section 1 of the Plan. In exercising its discretion, the Committee will consider the recommendations of management and the purposes of the Plan. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 18,085 employees and 11 Bancorp non-employee directors of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates eligible to participate in the Plan.

Award Types Under the Plan 
A participant in the Plan is permitted to receive multiple grants of awards of the various types under the Plan. The terms and provisions of a type of award with respect to any recipient need not be the same with respect to any other recipient of such award. The following types of awards may be granted under the Plan: 
SARs. The Committee may grant SARs independently of any stock option or in tandem with all or any part of a stock option granted under the Plan. Upon exercise, each SAR entitles a participant to receive an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) of a share of common stock on the date the SAR is exercised over an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of a share of common stock on the date the SAR is granted. No SAR shall be exercisable later than the tenth anniversary of the date of its grant. The Plan prohibits any reduction (re-pricing) of such grant date amount. The payment may be made in shares of common stock having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the amount due upon the exercise of the SAR, may be paid in cash, or in a combination. Upon exercise of a SAR granted in conjunction with a stock option, the option may be required to be surrendered. Except in the event of certain corporate events or transactions, once a SAR is granted, the Committee shall have no authority to reduce the price fixed at the date of grant, nor may any SAR granted under the Plan be surrendered to the Company as consideration for the grant of a new SAR with a lower price at the date of grant without the approval of the Company's shareholders. No dividend or dividend equivalent rights shall be paid or accrued on SARs. 
Restricted Stock and RSUs. An award of Restricted Stock is an award of shares of common stock that may not be sold or otherwise disposed of during a restricted period determined by the Committee. An award of RSUs is an award of the right to receive a share of common stock after the expiration of a restricted period determined by the Committee. The Committee may also impose additional restrictions on an award of Restricted Stock or RSUs, including, but not limited to, attainment of certain performance goals during the restricted period. To the extent provided by the Committee, Restricted Stock and RSUs may also include a dividend or dividend equivalent right, under which the recipient will be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such shares, which will be paid to such recipient in cash or in additional Restricted Stock or RSUs. 
Performance Shares and PSUs. Performance Shares and PSUs are awards of a fixed or variable number of shares or of dollar-denominated units that are earned by achievement of performance goals established by the Committee. The Committee may provide that a certain percentage of the number of Performance Shares or PSUs originally awarded may be earned based upon the attainment of the performance goals. Amounts earned under Performance Share and PSUs may be paid in common stock, cash or a combination of both. During the applicable performance period for an award, the Performance Shares and PSUs may be entitled to accrue dividend or dividend equivalent rights, which will only be paid if the underlying Performance Shares or PSUs are earned and a distribution is made, as approved by the Committee. Any such dividends or distributions whether paid in cash or shares, shall be subject to the same performance goals as the Performance Shares or PSUs with respect to which they relate and shall be paid only if and at the same time as the underlying shares are paid. 
Stock Options. Stock options may be nonqualified stock options or incentive stock options that comply with Code Section 422 of the Code. The exercise period for any stock option will be determined by the

 Committee at the time of grant. The exercise price per share for all shares of common stock issued pursuant to stock options under the Plan may not be less than 100 percent of the Fair Market Value of a share of common stock on the grant date. Each stock option may be exercised in whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, after the grant becomes exercisable. The Plan limits the term of any stock option to 10 years and prohibits re-pricing of options. No dividend or dividend equivalent rights shall be paid or accrued on options. No more than 5 million shares may be issued under the Plan as incentive stock options. 
Awards under Deferred Compensation or Similar Plans. Participants may receive the right to receive common stock or a fixed or variable share denominated unit granted under the Plan or any deferred compensation or similar plan established from time to time by the Company. 
Annual Incentive Awards. Participants in the Plan may receive annual incentive awards. Under an annual incentive award, the participant may receive an amount in cash based on the achievement of performance goals established by the Committee. 
Other Incentive Awards. The Committee may grant other types of awards of which may be based in whole or in part by reference to common stock or upon the achievement of performance goals or such other terms and conditions as the Committee may prescribe. 
The treatment of each award type held by a participant at termination of employment or service as a director or consultant, or in the event of a change in control, will be as determined by the Committee and set forth in the agreement applicable to such award or in any amendment or modification thereof. To the extent the award agreement does not expressly provide for such disposition, then the disposition of the award shall be determined as set forth in the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any award vest in less than one year from the date of grant except that, with limited exceptions, the Committee may grant awards that do not satisfy this minimum vesting period for up to an aggregate of five percent of the shares authorized for issuance under the Plan.

Performance Goals 
For purposes of awards under the Plan performance goals are objectives, determined by the Committee, which are to be satisfied or met as a condition to the receipt of any share or cash distribution under the award. The Committee may establish performance goals with respect to an award based upon one or more of the following performance criteria:

These performance goals may be measured for achievement or satisfaction during the period the Committee permits the participant to satisfy or achieve the performance goals and may be in absolute terms or measured against, or in relationship to, other companies comparably, similarly or otherwise situated or other external or internal measure and may be based on, or adjusted for, other objective goals, events or occurrences established by the Committee for a performance period. Performance goals may be particular to a line of business, subsidiary or other unit or the Company generally, and may, but need not be, based upon a change or an increase or positive result. Performance goals may include or exclude the effects of certain events including changes in accounting standards or principles, tax laws or other laws or provisions affecting reported results, a significant acquisition or divestiture, discontinued operations, litigation or claim judgments or settlements or other unusual, infrequently occurring or unplanned items such as restructuring expenses, acquisitions, acquisition expenses, including expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, stock offerings and stock repurchases, and loan loss provisions. 
Other Provisions 
Awards settled solely in cash shall not reduce the number of shares of common stock available for awards under the Plan. Any shares acquired by the Company in the open market with proceeds received from option exercises will not be made available for awards under the Plan. Shares of common stock issued in connection with awards that are assumed, converted or substituted pursuant to a merger, acquisition or similar transaction entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall not reduce the number of shares available to be issued under the Plan.

In general, except to the extent provided by the Committee in the specific terms of an award or with respect to certain transfers of nonqualified stock options to certain family members or foundations for no value or other consideration, no award will be assignable or transferable except by will, the laws of descent and distribution. 
The Committee may impose such restrictions and limitations on any awards granted under the Plan as it may deem advisable, including, but not limited to, share ownership or holding period requirements and requirements to enter into or to comply with confidentiality, non-competition and other restrictive or similar covenants. Additionally, the Committee may specify in any award agreement that the participant's rights, payments and benefits with respect to an award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment (clawback) upon the occurrence of certain specified events, such as payments based on financial statements or performance metrics that are determined subsequently to be erroneous, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions. 
The Company is subject to supervision and regulation by banking authorities. Regulations and guidance issued by banking authorities may from time to time impose certain compensation restrictions on the Company, its executive officers and certain other highly compensated employees. Awards made under the Plan will comply with such compensation restrictions to the extent applicable. 
The receipt of payment of cash or the delivery of shares that would otherwise be due to a participant under an award may be deferred at the election of the participant or the Company pursuant to an applicable deferral plan established by the Company or a subsidiary. A deferral also may be requested under applicable banking regulations. Awards made and deferral of any amounts payable under the Plan are intended to comply with deferred compensation rules under Code Section 409A. 
Effective Date, Amendment and Termination 
If approved by the shareholders, the Plan will become effective as of the date of such approval and will remain in effect until all shares subject to the Plan have been issued according to the provisions of the Plan, provided, however, that no awards may be granted on or after the 10th anniversary of such date. The Board of Directors may terminate the Plan at any time and may amend or modify the Plan from time to time provided that no such action shall materially adversely alter or impair any outstanding award without the consent of the participant affected thereby. In addition, unless approved by the Company's shareholders, no amendment or modification may increase the number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the Plan (except pursuant to an adjustment related to a corporate change affecting the common stock), expand the types of awards available to participants under the Plan, materially expand the class of persons eligible to participate in the Plan, delete or limit the provisions prohibiting the re-pricing of options or reduce the price at which shares may be offered under options, extend the termination date for making awards under the Plan, or become effective if such amendment or modification is required under the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Global Select Market or another national exchange on which the common stock is then listed, or other applicable law, rules or regulations, to be approved by the shareholders. 
The Committee may amend or modify any outstanding awards in any manner to the extent that the Committee would have had the authority under the Plan initially to make such award as so amended or modified, provided that no amendment or modification shall materially adversely alter or impair an

[END TABLE]
 outstanding award without the consent of the participant affected thereby. Re-pricing stock options and stock appreciation rights is prohibited without shareholder approval, including by exchange for cash or a new or different award type. 
Federal Income Tax Considerations 
The following discussion is a summary of certain federal income tax consequences to participants who may receive grants of awards under the Plan and to the Company. This discussion does not purport to be complete, and does not cover, among other things, state and local tax treatment. 
SARs. No taxable income is recognized by a participant upon the grant of a SAR under the Plan. Upon the exercise of a SAR, the participant will realize ordinary income in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of the shares of common stock received and the amount of cash received. Shares of common stock received upon the exercise of a SAR will, upon subsequent sale, be eligible for capital gains treatment, with the capital gains holding period commencing on the date of exercise of the SAR. The Company is generally entitled to a deduction for compensation paid to a participant at the same time and in the same amount as the participant realizes ordinary income upon exercise of the SAR. 
Stock Awards. A recipient of Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or any other awards of shares of common stock generally will be subject to tax at ordinary income rates on the Fair Market Value of the common stock at the time the shares have been delivered and are no longer subject to forfeiture. A recipient who so elects under Section 83(b) of the Code within 30 days of the date of the grant of shares of common stock will have ordinary taxable income on the date of the grant equal to the Fair Market Value of the shares as if the shares were unrestricted or the shares were earned and could be sold immediately. If the shares subject to such election are forfeited, the recipient will not be entitled to any deduction, refund or loss for tax purposes with respect to the forfeited shares. Upon sale of the Restricted Stock or Performance Shares after the forfeiture period has expired, the holding period to determine whether the recipient has long-term or short-term capital gain or loss begins when the restriction period expires. If the recipient timely elects to be taxed as of the date of the grant, the holding period commences on the date of the grant and the tax basis will be equal to the Fair Market Value of the shares on the date of the grant as if the shares were then unrestricted and could be sold immediately. The Company generally is entitled to a deduction for compensation paid to a participant in the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant. 
RSUs and PSUs. A recipient of units generally will be subject to tax at ordinary income rates on the Fair Market Value of any common stock issued or cash paid pursuant to such an award. The Company generally will be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of the ordinary income realized by the recipient. The capital gain or loss holding period for any common stock distributed under an award will begin when the recipient recognizes ordinary income in respect of that distribution. 
Nonqualified Stock Options. For federal income tax purposes, no income is recognized by a participant upon the grant of a nonqualified stock option. Upon exercise, the participant will realize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price multiplied by the number of shares received pursuant to the exercise of such options. A subsequent sale or exchange of such shares will result in gain or loss measured by the difference between (a) the exercise price, increased by any compensation reported upon the participant's exercise of the option, and (b) the amount realized on such sale or exchange. Any gain or loss will be

[END TABLE]
 capital in nature if the shares were held as a capital asset and will be long term if such shares were held for more than one year. The Company generally is entitled to a deduction for compensation paid to a participant at the same time and in the same amount as the participant realizes compensation upon exercise of the option. 
Incentive Stock Options. No taxable income is realized by the participant upon exercise of an incentive stock option granted under the Plan, and if no disposition of those shares is made by such participant within two years after the date of grant or within one year after the transfer of those shares to the participant, then: (a) upon the sale of the shares, any amount realized in excess of the exercise price will be taxed as a long-term capital gain and any loss sustained will be taxed as a long-term capital loss, and (b) no deduction will be allowed to the Company for federal income tax purposes. Upon exercise of an incentive stock option, the participant may be subject to alternative minimum tax on certain items of tax preference. 
If the shares of common stock acquired upon the exercise of an incentive stock option are disposed of prior to the expiration of the two-years-from-grant/one-year-from-transfer holding period, generally: (a) the participant will realize ordinary income in the year of disposition in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Fair Market Value of the shares at exercise (or, if less, the amount realized upon disposition of the shares) over the exercise price, and (b) the Company will be entitled to deduct such amount. Any additional gain or loss realized will be taxed as short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, as the case may be, and may not be deducted by the Company. If an incentive stock option is exercised at a time when it no longer qualifies as an incentive stock option, the stock option will be treated as a nonqualified stock option. 
Annual Incentive Award. A participant will recognize ordinary income upon receipt of cash pursuant to a cash award and the Company generally will be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of the ordinary income realized by the recipient. 
Other Incentive Awards. The federal income tax consequences of other incentive awards will depend on how the awards are structured. Generally, the Company will be entitled to a deduction with respect to other incentive awards only to the extent that the recipient realizes ordinary income in connection with such awards. 
Market Value 
As of February 7, 2019, the per share closing sale price of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $26.78. 
New Plan Benefits 
No determination has been made as to the amount or terms of any stock-based or cash awards under the Plan. Additionally, because the Plan is a new plan, it is not possible to determine the benefits that would have been received by or allocated to eligible participants under the Plan had it been in effect in prior years.

 COMPANY PROPOSAL 5     
[END TABLE]
Company Proposal 5: Proposal to Approve an Amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation to Authorize a New Class of Preferred Stock 
(Item 6 on Proxy Card) 
The Board of Directors recommends adoption of an amendment to Article Fourth, Section (A) of the Amended Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the "Articles"), in the form shown in Annex B hereto to authorize a new class of preferred stock. 
What would this Amendment accomplish? 
Article Fourth, Section (A) of the Company's Articles currently provides that the Company may designate and issue up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value. Of those authorized shares of preferred stock, the Company has to date designated an aggregate of 24,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock; 18,000 shares of Series I Preferred Stock; and 12,000 shares of Series J Preferred Stock. Accordingly, 446,000 authorized shares of undesignated preferred stock are currently eligible for issuance from time to time as determined by the Company's Board of Directors. No shareholder approval is needed in connection with any such issuances, except as otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange rules, if the terms of any series of shares of preferred stock are in accordance with the allowed terms set forth in Article Fourth, Section (A)2)(h). 
The proposed amendment to Article Fourth, Section (A) of the Articles would increase the total amount of authorized shares of preferred stock of the Company by 500,000 shares and add subsection 3), which would create a new class of preferred stock (the "Class B Preferred Stock") and authorize the Company to issue up to 500,000 shares of Class B Preferred Stock. No further shareholder vote would be required for the issuance of any of the Class B Preferred Stock, except as otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange rules. 
Why is this Amendment needed? 
The proposed amendment is being sought to enhance the Company's ability to engage in business activities and transactions typical for its industry. It is not being proposed in connection with any anti-takeover related purpose and neither the Board nor management has any knowledge of any current efforts to effect such a takeover. The Class B Preferred Stock will not be issued or used for any defensive or anti-takeover purpose or for the purpose of implementing any shareholder rights plan. 
The proposed amendment to Article Fourth, Section (A) would provide the Company with additional flexibility to designate and issue one or more future series of Class B Preferred Stock with terms permitted under the Ohio general corporation law that are not available for the Company's existing class of preferred stock currently authorized in the Articles. The provisions of the proposed amendment would apply to all future issuances by the Company of the Class B Preferred Stock such that, as expressly allowed by 1701.06 Ohio Revised Code, the amended Articles would incrementally provide the Board of Directors with the ability to (1) tailor voting rights, (2) exercise discretion over both dividends and distribution rights including preferences, (3) establish liquidation rights and preferences, in addition to liquidation price, (4) determine rights to alter express terms of specific securities and (5) determine any other relative, participating, optional, or other special rights and privileges of, and qualifications or restrictions on, the rights of holders of shares of any series of Class B Preferred Stock.

 COMPANY PROPOSAL 5

 COMPANY PROPOSAL 5     
[END TABLE]
The Company is currently limited in its ability to create, issue and sell shares of preferred stock that contain certain terms that may be preferred by market participants and are allowable under Ohio law. Providing the Board of Directors, the ability to create, issue and sell shares with some or all of these additional terms would alleviate this concern and provide additional flexibility to the Company. For example, due to the restrictions on the voting rights of the existing class of preferred stock set forth in Article Fourth, Section (A)2)(h) of the Articles, the Company was required to hold a special meeting of shareholders in 2008 to amend the Articles to allow for the grant of limited voting rights in order for the Company to participate in the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program ("TARP CPP"). Obtaining shareholder approval was costly and potentially jeopardized the Company's participation in the TARP CPP. 
In addition to the delays in participation in the TARP CPP, the restrictions on voting rights of the existing class of preferred stock contained in the Articles also required the Company to offer alternate terms to those prevailing in the market at the time of its offering of its Series G preferred stock and required the Company to use an alternative merger structure in its acquisition of MB Financial, Inc. 
While the Company was able to use alternate terms and structures to overcome these limitations in the past, there can be no assurances that such alternatives will be available in the future and the Company may be unable to engage in acquisitions, raise capital, or enter into other securities transactions on terms that would otherwise be in the long-term interests of Fifth Third and its shareholders, if the terms of the Company's preferred stock do not permit usual and customary voting provisions, rights, or preferences. Thus, the Company believes it is important to seek approval to amend the Articles to authorize a new class of preferred stock. By seeking this approval now, the Company would be in a position to participate in any such future acquisitions or capital raising transactions that it deems to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders without the risks of added costs, delay or uncertainty. 
Could this Amendment have adverse effects to the holders of the Company's Common Stock, Series H Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock and/or Series J Preferred Stock? 
The Company currently has the authority, upon action by its Board of Directors and without the need for shareholder approval, to issue shares of preferred stock on terms established by the Board of Directors. The effect of this amendment increases the total amount of authorized shares of preferred stock of the Company and increases the types of terms that the Board of Directors may vary with respect to certain preferred stock by creating the Company's Class B Preferred Stock. 
This proposed amendment would allow future issuances of Class B Preferred Stock with voting rights that are not yet known and cannot yet be determined. However, because the Company's common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the Company is subject to the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Under Nasdaq Rule 5640, the Company is prohibited from disparately reducing or restricting existing shareholders' voting rights (e.g. creating a new class of super-voting stock). 
As with all blank check preferred stock, if series of shares of Class B Preferred Stock are issued by the Company, it may potentially make it more difficult to obtain shareholder approval of various actions, such as a merger or removal of management. The terms of the authorized, unissued shares of Class B Preferred Stock have not been proposed in connection with any anti-takeover related purpose. The Company's Class B Preferred Stock will not be used or issued for any defense or anti-takeover purpose or for the

 purpose of implementing any shareholder rights plan. The Board of Directors and management have no knowledge of any current efforts by anyone to obtain control of the Company or to effect large accumulations of the Company's common stock or preferred stock. 
Additionally, the issuance of shares of Class B Preferred Stock may, among other things, have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and on the equity and voting power of existing shareholders. The terms of any Class B Preferred Stock that are fixed by the Company's Board of Directors on issuance, will depend upon the reason for the issuance and on market conditions and other factors existing at the time. 
On May 20, 2018, Fifth Third and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Fifth Third Financial Corporation, entered into the Merger Agreement with MB Financial. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, the combination of MB Financial and Fifth Third would be affected by the merger of MB Financial with a newly-formed subsidiary of the Company, with MB Financial surviving such merger as a subsidiary of the Fifth Third. In the Merger, MB Financial's 6.00% Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (the "MB Preferred Stock"), all of which is held by a depositary, and the outstanding depositary shares that represent the MB Preferred Stock, which are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, would remain outstanding and unchanged. 
Fifth Third believes that, following completion of the Merger, it may be in the best interests of Fifth Third and its shareholders to merge MB Financial into Fifth Third (the "Subsidiary Merger"). Among other things, the Subsidiary Merger would allow Fifth Third to streamline its corporate organization and governance practices and potentially reduce expense. 
If the proposed amendment to the Articles to authorize the Class B Preferred Stock is adopted by the shareholders, the Merger occurs, and Fifth Third determines to proceed with the Subsidiary Merger, the Board of Directors of Fifth Third could create a series of Class B Preferred Stock consisting of 200,000 shares for issuance in the Subsidiary Merger in exchange for the 200,000 shares of MB Preferred Stock currently held by the depositary, which would be cancelled. Under the terms of the MB Preferred Stock, the holders of the MB Preferred Stock would have no right to vote on the Subsidiary Merger if the new series of Class B Preferred Stock issued in exchange for the MB Preferred Stock has powers, preferences and special rights not materially less favorable to the holders than the powers, preferences and special rights of the MB Financial Preferred Stock, taken as a whole. Fifth Third anticipates that, if the Subsidiary Merger occurs, the terms of the new series of Class B Preferred Stock issued in the Subsidiary Merger would not be materially less favorable than the terms of the MB Preferred Stock, which are summarized below. 
Fifth Third has not yet determined whether to enter into the Subsidiary Merger, and it does not anticipate that it will make a final determination until after the Merger is consummated and Fifth Third has completed its plans to otherwise streamline its post-Merger organization. It also anticipates that the Subsidiary Merger would be conditioned on adoption by the shareholders of the proposed amendment to the Articles to authorize the Class B Preferred Stock. Completion of the Merger is not conditioned on, or subject to, approval of this proposal to amend the Articles or on completion of the Subsidiary Merger. 
Even if Fifth Third were to issue 200,000 shares of a series of Class B Preferred Stock in the Subsidiary Merger, 300,000 shares of Class B Preferred Stock would remain authorized for issuance in other circumstances. Other than the possible issuance of Class B Preferred Stock in the Subsidiary Merger, Fifth

 Third does not have any potential plans for the issuance of shares of Class B Preferred Stock at the present time. Regardless of whether Fifth Third ultimately enters into the Subsidiary Merger, however, Fifth Third believes that adoption by the shareholders of the proposed amendment is in the best interests of Fifth Third for the reasons described above. 
Summary of Certain Terms of the MB Preferred Stock 
As described above, if the proposed amendment to the Articles authorizing the Class B Preferred Stock is adopted by the shareholders, the Merger is consummated, and Fifth Third determines to enter into the Subsidiary Merger, Fifth Third anticipates that the terms of the series of Class B Preferred Stock that could be created by the Board of Directors for issuance in the Subsidiary Merger in exchange for the MB Preferred Stock would be not materially less favorable than the terms of the MB Preferred Stock. The following is a summary of certain important terms of the MB Preferred Stock:

What would be the likely effect of a failure to adopt this Amendment? 
The failure to adopt the proposed amendment to the Articles to authorize the Class B Preferred Stock could limit the Company's ability to engage in future capital raising transactions, mergers, or other strategic transactions if such transactions require the Company to issue preferred stock containing terms that the Board of Directors does not have authority to fix under the terms of the existing class of preferred stock. In such cases, the Company may lose opportunities due to the time delay and uncertainty of needing to hold a special meeting of shareholders in order to adopt an amendment to the Articles to allow the Company to proceed with such transactions. In addition, the failure to adopt the proposed amendment would limit the ability of the Company to consummate the Subsidiary Merger. 
If this Amendment is adopted by the Company's shareholders, when would the Company implement this Amendment? 
If this proposed amendment is adopted at the Annual Meeting, the Company will promptly file a certificate of amendment to its Articles in accordance with this Company Proposal 5. The Company's implementation of this amendment is not contingent upon any other event or circumstance.

Our Code of Regulations provides that only such business will be conducted as is properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article II, Section 11 of the Code of Regulations. Except as otherwise provided by law, our Articles, or our Code of Regulations, the determination of whether any business sought to be brought before the Annual Meeting of Shareholders is properly brought before such meeting will be made by the Chair of such meeting. If the Chair determines that any business is not properly brought before the meeting, then any such business will not be conducted or considered. 
Discretion of Proxies. The Board of Directors does not know of any other business to be presented at the Annual Meeting and does not intend to bring other matters before the Annual Meeting. However, if any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, it is intended that the persons named in the Proxy will vote thereon according to their best judgment and interest of Fifth Third Bancorp. No other shareholder has informed us of any intention to propose any other matter to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, the persons named in the accompanying Proxy are allowed to exercise their discretionary authority to vote upon any such proposal without the matter having been discussed in this proxy statement. 
Householding. Shareholders of record who have the same address and last name and have not previously requested electronic delivery of proxy materials will receive a single envelope containing the notices or the proxy statement and proxy card for all shareholders having that address. The notice or proxy card for each shareholder will include that shareholder's unique control number needed to vote his or her shares. This procedure reduces our printing costs and postage fees. If, in the future, you do not wish to participate in householding and prefer to receive your notice or proxy statement in a separate envelope, or if your household currently receives more than one Notice or Proxy Statement and in the future, you would prefer to participate in householding, please call us toll-free at 1-800-488-8035 in the U.S., or inform us in writing at: Fifth Third Bancorp, c/o D.F. King & Co., Inc., 48 Wall Street – 22nd Floor, New York, New York 10005, or by email at FITB@dfking.com. We will respond promptly to such requests. 
For those shareholders who have the same address and last name and who request to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials by mail, we will send only one copy of such materials to each address unless one or more of those shareholders notifies us, in the same manner described above, that they wish to receive a printed copy for each shareholder at that address. 
Beneficial shareholders can request information about householding from their bank, broker or other nominee. 
Copies. A copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year, as filed with the SEC, not including exhibits, will be mailed without charge to shareholders upon written request. Requests should be addressed to Investor Relations, 38 Fountain Square Plaza, MD 1090QC, Cincinnati, Ohio 45263 or by emailing ir@53.com. You can also view information and request documents from the Investor Relations page of Fifth Third's website at www.ir.53.com. The Form 10-K includes certain listed exhibits, which will be provided upon payment of a fee covering our reasonable expenses.

ESTABLISHMENT, PURPOSE, AND DURATION 
1.1.           Establishment of the Plan.

If approved by the shareholders, the Plan would replace the Fifth Third Bancorp 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan and no further awards would be made under such plan. Awards made under the Fifth Third Bancorp 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan will continue to be governed by the terms of that plan. 
1.2.           Purpose of the Plan.

The Plan is designed to provide flexibility to the Company and its Subsidiaries in their ability to motivate, attract and retain the services of Employees, Directors and Consultants upon whose judgment, interest and special efforts the successful conduct of their operations is largely dependent. 
1.3.           Duration of the Plan. The Plan shall become effective on the date it is approved by the Company's shareholders (the "Effective Date"), and shall remain in effect, subject to the right of the Board of Directors to terminate the Plan at any time pursuant to Article 15 herein, until all Shares subject to it shall have been purchased or acquired according to the provisions herein. However, in no event may an Award be granted under the Plan on or after the 10th anniversary of the Effective Date of the Plan.

STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN 
4.1.           Number of Shares. 
(a)          Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, the aggregate number of Shares that may be delivered under the Plan at any time shall not exceed the sum of 40,000,000 plus Shares related to awards under the Predecessor Plans that are cancelled by reason of failure to earn the Shares issuable under, or the cash-settlement, forfeiture, termination, surrender, cancellation or expiration of, each Predecessor Plan Award. The aggregate number of Shares available with respect to Awards under the Plan shall be reduced by one Share for each Share to which an Award relates; provided, however, that each Share issued pursuant to a Full-Value Award, shall reduce the aggregate Plan limit by 2.5 Shares. Shares of Stock delivered under the Plan may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued Shares or Shares that shall have been or may be reacquired by the Company in the open market, in private transactions or otherwise. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  If shares of Stock subject to an outstanding Award under this Plan are not issued, or are cash-settled, or are cancelled  by reason of the failure to earn the Shares issuable under, or the forfeiture, termination, surrender, cancellation or expiration of, such Award, then the shares of Stock subject to such Award shall, to the extent of such forfeiture or cancellation,  again be available for Awards under the Plan and shall be adjusted to take into account any reduction under the Predecessor Plan for the issuance of Full-Value Awards. All awards under the Predecessor Plans outstanding on the Effective Date shall  continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and no provision of this Plan shall be deemed to alter or otherwise modify the rights or obligations of the holders of those Predecessor Plan awards. Notwithstanding anything set  forth herein to the contrary, if a Predecessor Plan award qualifies for grandfathered treatment under Section 162(m) of the Code, as a written and binding contract in existence on or before November 2, 2017 (and not materially modified  thereafter), the Committee may not take any action that would cause the award to lose such grandfathered treatment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (ii)  Shares of Stock shall not again be available if such Shares are surrendered or withheld as payment of either the exercise  price or of withholding taxes in respect of an Award or a Predecessor Plan award.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (iii)  Shares reacquired by the Company in the open market using the proceeds of amounts received upon the exercise of Options  shall not again be available for Awards under the Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (iv)  The exercise or settlement of a SAR Award reduces the Shares available under the Plan by the total number of Shares to  which the exercise or settlement of the SAR Award relates, not just the net amount of Shares actually issued upon exercise or settlement; Shares of Stock not issued upon exercise or settlement of such SAR Award shall not again be available for  Awards under the Plan.

13.10.           Compliance with Code Section 409A. This Plan is intended to comply and shall be administered in a manner that is intended to comply with Code Section 409A and shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. To the extent that an Award or the payment, settlement or deferral thereof is subject to Code Section 409A, the Award shall be granted, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will comply with Section 409A, including regulations or other guidance issued with respect thereto (collectively, "Section 409A"), except as otherwise determined by the Committee. Any provision of this Plan that would cause the grant of an Award or the payment, settlement or deferral thereof to fail to satisfy Section 409A shall be amended to comply with Section 409A in a timely manner, which may be made on a retroactive basis, in accordance with regulations and other guidance issued under Section 409A. In the case of amounts not intended to be deferrals of compensation subject to Section 409A, including, but not limited to, Annual Incentive Awards, payment or settlement of amounts under such Awards shall occur not later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the Participant has a legally binding right to payment or settlement. In the case of amounts intended to be deferrals of compensation subject to Section 409A, the initial deferral election shall be made and become irrevocable not later than December 31 of the year immediately preceding the year in which the Participant first performs services related to such compensation, provided that the timing of such initial deferral election may be later as provided in Section 409A with respect to initial participation in the Plan and for "performance-based compensation" as defined under Section 409A. If an amount payable under an Award as a result of the separation from service (other than due to death) occurring while the Participant is a "specified employee" (for purposes of Section 409A) constitutes a deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A, then payment of such amount shall not occur until six months and one day after the date of Participant's "separation from service," except as permitted under Section 409A. 
ARTICLE 14 
CHANGE IN CONTROL 
14.1.           Effect of Change in Control of the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary and except as provided by the Committee in the applicable Award Agreement, the provisions of this Article 14 shall apply in the event of a Change in Control. 
14.2.          Conditional Vesting. Upon a Change in Control, except to the extent that another Award meeting the requirements of Section 14.3 (a "Replacement Award") is provided to the Participant pursuant to Section 4.2 to replace an outstanding Award (the "Replaced Award"): 
(a)          Each SAR and Option then outstanding shall become fully vested and exercisable; 
(b)          Any remaining Period of Restriction applicable to Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units pursuant to Section 7.2 shall automatically terminate and the Shares of Restricted Stock shall thereby be free of restrictions and be fully transferable, and distribution of Shares with respect to Restricted Stock Units shall occur pursuant to Section 7.4, provided, however, that with respect to any Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit Award which is also a Performance-Based Award, the effect of Change in Control on such Award shall be determined applying the principles of Section 14.2(c) as if such Award was a Performance Share Award; 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ANNEX A: FIFTH THIRD BANCORP 2019 INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN   
 ANNEX A: FIFTH THIRD BANCORP 2019 INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN   
[END TABLE]
(c)          Each Performance Unit or Performance Share Award held by the Participant shall be deemed earned and shall be paid the greater of (i) the extent, as determined by the Committee, to which the Performance Goals applicable to such Performance-Based Award have been met during the applicable Performance Period up through and including the effective date of the Change in Control and (ii) a pro rata portion of such Award equal to the target number of Performance Units or Performance Shares determined at the date of grant multiplied by the percentage of the Performance Period that has elapsed as of the effective date of the Change in Control; and 
(d)          The treatment of any Annual Incentive Award or any Other Incentive Award shall be as determined by the Committee and reflected in the applicable Award Agreement. 
14.3.           Replacement Awards. An Award shall meet the conditions of this Section 14.3 (and therefore be considered a Replacement Award for purposes of this Article 14) if: 
(a)          it has a value at least equal to the value of the Replaced Award; 
(b)          it relates to publicly traded equity securities of the Company or its successor in the Change in Control or another entity that is affiliated with the Company or its successor following the Change in Control; and 
(c)          its other terms and conditions are not less favorable to the Participant than the terms and conditions of the Replaced Award (including the provisions that would apply in the event of a subsequent Change in Control and the provisions of Section 14.4). 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Replacement Award may take the form of a continuation of the Replaced Award if the requirements of the preceding sentence are satisfied. The determination of whether the conditions of this Section 14.3 are satisfied shall be made by the Committee, immediately prior to the Change in Control, in its sole discretion. 
14.4.           Separation from Service. Upon an involuntary separation from service of a Participant, other than for "cause" by the Company (as defined in the Fifth Third Bancorp Executive Change in Control Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan")), including a termination by the Company without "cause" or by the Participant for "good reason" (as defined in the Severance Plan) occurring in connection with or during the period of two years after a Change in Control, all Replacement Awards held by the Participant, to the extent not vested as of such separation, shall become fully vested, and if applicable, exercisable and free of restrictions, and for each Performance Unit or Performance Share Award will be paid according to the provisions of Section 14.2(c). 
ARTICLE 15 
AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, AND TERMINATION 
15.1.           Amendment, Modification and Termination of Plan.

The determination of the Committee as to the foregoing adjustments, if any, shall be conclusive and binding on Participants under the Plan. 
15.3.           Effect on Outstanding Awards. No such amendment, modification or termination of the Plan pursuant to Section 15.1, or amendment or modification of an Award pursuant to Section 15.2, shall materially adversely alter or impair any outstanding Awards without the consent of the Participant affected thereby.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp: 
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the "Bancorp") as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bancorp as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Bancorp's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Bancorp's internal control over financial reporting. 
Change in Accounting Principle 
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, effective October 1, 2018, the Bancorp elected to change its accounting for qualifying Low-Income Housing Tax Credit investments from the equity method to the proportional amortization method, resulting in retrospective adjustments to reflect the accounting change within the 2018 financial statements and to adjust the originally reported amounts for the 2017 and 2016 financial statements. 
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Bancorp's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bancorp's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Bancorp in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
