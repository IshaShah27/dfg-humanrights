PROXY STATEMENT FOR SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
GENERAL INFORMATION 
The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of our board of directors for use at our Special Meeting of Stockholders, or the special meeting, to be held on Friday, December 21, 2018 at 8:00 a.m., Pacific Time, at our corporate headquarters located at 2 Musick, Irvine, California 92618. Endologix, Inc. is sometimes referred to herein as "we", "us", "our" or our "Company." 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Special Meeting of Stockholders to be Held on December 21, 2018 
This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are available at www.proxyvote.com. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROXY MATERIALS AND VOTING 
These questions and answers are intended to briefly address potential questions that our stockholders may have regarding this proxy statement and the special meeting. They are also intended to provide our stockholders with certain information that is required to be provided under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. 
When and where will the special meeting be held? 
You are invited to attend the special meeting to be held on December 21, 2018 at 8:00 a.m., Pacific Time, at our corporate headquarters located at 2 Musick, Irvine, California 92618. 
Why did I receive these proxy materials? 
We are providing this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation by our board of directors of proxies to be voted at the special meeting, and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. Your proxy is being solicited because you owned our common stock at the close of business on November 9, 2018, which is the record date for the special meeting. 
This proxy statement contains important information for you to consider when deciding how to vote on the matter brought before the special meeting. This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card are also available at www.proxyvote.com. 
You are invited to attend the special meeting in person to vote on the proposal described in this proxy statement. However, you do not need to attend the special meeting to vote your shares. 
Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to read this proxy statement and submit your proxy or voting instructions as soon as possible.  Why did I receive a full set of printed proxy materials instead of a notice regarding the Internet availability of the proxy materials? 
For our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, which was held in June 2018, we elected to provide access to the proxy materials through the Internet under the SEC's "notice and access" rules by mailing each of our stockholders a notice regarding the Internet availability of the proxy materials and instructions on how to access the proxy materials on the Internet. However, for purposes of the special meeting, after taking into account a number of considerations, including the timing of the special meeting and the specific purpose of the proposal being considered by our stockholders at the meeting, our board of directors determined it would be more effective to provide a full set of printed proxy materials to each of our stockholders in connection with the special meeting. These proxy materials include the proxy statement, as well as the accompanying proxy card. We do not expect that our decision to provide a full set of printed proxy materials in connection with the special meeting will have any impact on the manner in which we will deliver proxy materials for future meetings of our stockholders. 
Who may vote at the special meeting? 
Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date, November 9, 2018, are entitled to vote at the special meeting. As of the record date, there were 103,453,661 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, held by 238 holders of record. 
What is the quorum requirement for the special meeting? 
At least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy in order to transact business at the special meeting. This is referred to as a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be treated as shares present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether or not a quorum exists. If there is no quorum present at the special meeting, consistent with our bylaws, the chairman of the special meeting, or the holders of a majority of shares present at the special meeting in person or represented by proxy, will adjourn the special meeting to a later date. 
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name"? 
Stockholder of Record 
If, on the record date, your shares were registered directly in your name with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, our transfer agent, then you are a stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the special meeting. Alternatively, you may vote by proxy through the Internet, by telephone or by mail as described in response to the question entitled "How may I vote my shares?" below. 
Beneficial Owner 
If, on the record date, your shares were not registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, but instead were held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, then you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee, which is considered to be the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As a beneficial owner, you are entitled to give instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the special meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee. 
How many votes do I have? 
You have one vote for each share of our common stock that you own as of the close of business on the record date. These shares include shares that you hold directly, as a stockholder of record, and that are held for you in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee.  What proposal will be voted on at the special meeting? 
The single proposal to be voted on at the special meeting is as follows: 
Proposal 1: Approval of an amendment to our Endologix, Inc. Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, or our 2015 Plan, to increase the total number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the plan by 6,000,000 shares, or from 10,300,000 shares to 16,300,000 shares. 
We will also consider such other business as may properly come before the special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
As of the date of this proxy statement, our board of directors is not aware of any matters, other than those described in this proxy statement, which may be presented for consideration at the special meeting. Should any other matters requiring a vote of the stockholders come before the special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the persons named in the accompanying proxy card will have the discretionary authority to vote with respect to such matters in accordance with their best judgment. 
What are my voting options on each proposal? 
You may vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" Proposal 1 or you may abstain from voting on the proposal. 
What is our board of director's voting recommendation on each proposal? 
Our board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote your shares "FOR" approval of Proposal 1 as described in this proxy statement. 
How may I vote my shares? 
The procedures for voting are as follows: 
Stockholder of Record 
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the special meeting. Alternatively, you may vote by proxy through the Internet, by telephone or by mail as described below. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. If you have already voted by proxy, you may still attend the special meeting and vote in person, and your vote at the special meeting will have the effect of revoking your proxy. Please see the response to the question entitled "Can I change my vote after submitting my proxy?" below for additional information. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote in Person. To vote in person, please attend the special meeting and request a ballot when you arrive.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote by Internet. To vote through the Internet, go to www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions  provided on the website. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on December 20, 2018. Our Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders by using individual control  numbers, which are located on the proxy card accompanying these proxy materials. In order to cast your vote, you will be asked to provide the control number from the proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote by Telephone. To vote by telephone, call 1-800-690-6903 from any touch-tone telephone and follow the instructions. Telephonic voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern  Time on December 20, 2018. Our telephonic voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders by using individual control numbers, which are located on the proxy card accompanying these proxy materials. In order to cast your vote, you  will be asked to provide the control number from the proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote by Mail. To vote by mail using the proxy card accompanying these proxy materials, simply complete,  sign and date the proxy card and return it promptly in the postage-paid envelope provided.  
[END TABLE]
 Beneficial Owner 
If you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee, you should have received a proxy card containing voting instructions with these proxy materials from that organization rather than from us. To vote your shares, simply follow the instructions provided to you. To vote in person at the special meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee. 
What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions? 
Stockholder of Record 
If you are a stockholder of record and you indicate when transmitting your voting instructions by Internet or by telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by our board of directors, or if you sign and return a proxy card by mail without giving specific voting instructions, then the proxy holders will vote your shares "FOR" Proposal 1 as recommended by our board of directors. The proxy holders will also have the discretionary authority to vote on any other matters properly presented for a vote at the special meeting in accordance with their best judgment. 
Beneficial Owner 
Generally, if you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name", you are entitled to give instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to vote your shares. Since Proposal 1 constitutes a "non-routine" matter under applicable stock exchange rules, if you do not provide voting instructions, your broker, bank or other nominee may not vote your shares. Accordingly, if the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on this proposal, the organization will inform the inspector of elections that it does not have the authority to vote on the proposal with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote." 
What is the voting requirement to approve the proposal? 
The approval of Proposal 1 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal at the special meeting. 
What is the effect of abstentions and broker non-votes on the approval of the proposal? 
Abstentions will have the same effect as votes against Proposal 1. 
Broker non-votes are not treated as shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the special meeting, so broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the voting on Proposal 1. 
How can I attend the special meeting in person? 
You must present a form of government-issued personal photo identification in order to be admitted to the special meeting. If your shares are held in "street name," you will also need proof of ownership to be admitted to the special meeting. A recent brokerage statement or a letter from your broker, bank or other nominee are examples of acceptable proof of ownership. No cameras, recording equipment, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted at the special meeting. 
Can I change my vote after submitting my proxy? 
Yes. Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke it at any time before it is voted at the special meeting. 
Stockholder of Record 
If you are the stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy in any one of four ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may vote again through the Internet or by telephone at a later time (prior to the deadline for Internet or  telephone voting).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may submit a properly completed proxy card with a later date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may send a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to Endologix, Inc. at 2 Musick, Irvine, California  92618, Attention: Corporate Secretary.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may attend the special meeting and vote in person. However, attending the special meeting will not, by  itself, revoke your proxy or change your vote.  
[END TABLE]
Beneficial Owner 
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," you may revoke your proxy by following the instructions provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee. 
Who is paying for the cost of this proxy solicitation? 
We will bear the entire cost of this proxy solicitation, including costs of preparing, assembling, printing and mailing this proxy statement, the accompanying proxy card and any additional solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders. Copies of these proxy materials will be furnished to brokerage firms, banks or other nominees that hold shares of our common stock in "street name," so that they may forward the proxy materials to the beneficial owners of our shares. We have retained Morrow & Sodali LLC, 470 East Ave, Stamford, Connecticut 06902, or Morrow, a proxy solicitation firm, to deliver solicitation materials to beneficial owners and to assist us in collecting proxies from such individuals. We expect to pay Morrow a fee of $10,000 for their proxy solicitation services. We may reimburse persons representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. Solicitation of proxies may be supplemented by telephone, electronic mail or personal solicitation by our directors, officers or other regular employees. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or other regular employees for such services. 
I share an address with another stockholder, and we received only one copy of these proxy materials. How may I obtain an additional copy of these proxy materials? 
SEC rules permit companies, brokers, banks and other nominees to deliver a single copy of proxy materials to households at which two or more stockholders reside. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce duplicate mailings and save significant printing and postage costs, as well as natural resources. Stockholders sharing an address who have been previously notified by their broker, bank or other nominee and have consented to householding will receive only one copy of our proxy materials. 
If you would like to opt out of this practice for future mailings and receive separate proxy materials for each stockholder sharing the same address, please contact your broker, bank or other nominee. You may also obtain additional copies of our proxy materials without charge by contacting us at Endologix, Inc. 2 Musick, Irvine, California 92618, Attention: Corporate Secretary, or by telephone by calling (949) 595-7200. 
Stockholders sharing an address that are receiving multiple copies of our proxy materials can request delivery of a single copy of our proxy materials by contacting their broker, bank or other nominee, or by contacting us as indicated above. 
Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting? 
We will announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and will publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that we expect to file with the SEC within four business days of the special meeting.  BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS

 PROPOSAL NO. 1 
AMENDMENT TO THE ENDOLOGIX, INC. 2015 AMENDED AND RESTATED STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN TO INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE PLAN 
Overview 
We are seeking stockholder approval to amend our 2015 Plan to increase the total number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the plan by 6,000,000 shares, or from 10,300,000 shares to 16,300,000 shares. The compensation committee of our board of directors, or our compensation committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors, has recommended to our board of directors that we approve the amendment to our 2015 Plan. Based in part on this recommendation, and for a number of reasons discussed in greater detail below, our board of directors believes it is in the best interests of our stockholders to approve the amendment to our 2015 Plan, and has approved the amendment, subject to the stockholder approval of this proposal at the special meeting. Our board of directors unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote "FOR" approval of the amendment to our 2015 Plan to increase the total number of shares reserved for issuance under the plan. 
Purpose of 2015 Plan 
The purpose of our 2015 Plan is to provide us flexibility with respect to our ability to attract and retain the services of qualified employees, officers and non-employee directors upon whose judgment, initiative and efforts the successful conduct and development of our business depends, and to provide additional incentives to such persons to devote their effort and skill to our advancement by providing them an opportunity to participate in the ownership of our Company and thereby have an interest in our success and increased value. 
Principal Reasons for Requested Share Increase 
The approval of this proposal by our stockholders, which would result in the immediate availability of additional shares for issuance under our 2015 Plan, is critical to the furtherance of our compensation programs, and vital to the growth and success of our business. In particular, an increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2015 Plan is necessary for us to retain our key employees, to continue to motivate and incentivize our employees, and to align the interests of our employees with those of our stockholders. 
Consistent with many companies in our industry and stage of growth, equity compensation is a key component of our compensation programs, both with respect to our executives and our other employees. We believe the grant of equity awards, and the potential that the value of the awards will increase over time as the value of our Company increases, is an important element of the compensation package and the overall value proposition we offer our employees, and is a key reason they may choose to become or remain employees of our Company. If we are unable to continue to make grants of equity awards to our employees consistent with their expectations or past practices, or if we are required to issue awards with significantly lower values than competitive market practices mandate due to the lack of available shares under our 2015 Plan, we could be at significant risk of failing to retain key employees who are important to our success, to properly motivate employees to achieve our strategic objectives, or to hire top talent during a time of management transition. 
Unfortunately, the recent and significant decline in the trading price of our stock has resulted both in heightened concerns regarding our ability to retain and motivate employees, as well as the need for a significantly greater number of shares to be granted as equity awards to our employees than anticipated earlier in the year when our stock price was higher. Among other things, we believe the stock price decline may have a material adverse impact on the success of our previously approved stock option exchange program, or Option Exchange Program, both with respect to the participation rate in the program and the number of shares that could be returned to the share reserve under our 2015 Plan upon consummation of the program. A material shortfall in the number of shares returned to our 2015 Plan upon implementation of the Option Exchange Program as compared to our projections would further limit our ability to make equity grants under our 2015 Plan as compared to our expectations at the time the Option Exchange Program was approved by our stockholders. We discuss the interplay between this proposal and the Option Exchange Program in greater detail below.  In the simplest terms, the substantial decline in our stock price has materially impacted our near-term equity compensation requirements and means that equity grants covering substantially more shares need to be issued to employees to provide equity grants with a similar dollar value as prior to the decline. At present, we do not have sufficient shares available under our 2015 Plan to grant currently-contemplated 2018 equity awards to our directors, officers and employees, including certain retention and performance-based grants that we believe are critical to retain key managerial and sales personnel. Without the services of these key employees, we may be unable to effectively maintain or increase sales, lead the organization through our management transition, or execute on our strategic plans. In the absence of a material increase in the share reserve under our 2015 Plan, we will be severely limited in our ability to make, or may even be prevented from making, meaningful equity awards to these key employees, even if we fully deplete the remaining shares currently available for grant under our 2015 Plan. These circumstances have created a dynamic in which it is critical that we seek an immediate and substantial increase in authorized shares under our 2015 Plan to allow us to meet our contractual obligations to employees, meet the compensation expectations of our employees, remain competitive in the market, and achieve our strategic plans and objectives. 
While we have considered other alternatives to the issuance of equity awards as a means to compensate our employees, including the adoption of additional cash incentive programs, our compensation committee believes equity awards are currently a more appropriate and effective compensation vehicle than cash incentive awards because they do not require the near-term use of our limited cash resources, which we believe we need to conserve to preserve the financial condition of our business and comply with the financial covenants under our senior secured borrowing arrangements. Equity awards also have the benefit of more closely aligning the interests of our employees with those of our stockholders, which is an important component of our compensation philosophy. However, if we do not have sufficient shares authorized under our 2015 Plan to grant equity awards in lieu of other incentive programs (whether because this proposal is not approved by our stockholders or otherwise), we may determine it is necessary to provide additional cash incentives or other compensation to our employees in lieu of equity awards in order to retain and motivate them. Any additional cash incentive awards would place significant additional pressure on our cash reserves and liquidity position, and may not be sufficient to adequately support our employee motivation and retention efforts, especially in light of the recent volatility in our stock price. 
In considering our recommendation to increase the total number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2015 Plan by 6,000,000 shares, our board of directors considered a number of factors, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's need to motivate and retain our officers and employees at a critical stage of our  Company's growth, in particular at a time when we are in the process of implementing a management transition, commercial restructuring and strategic market repositioning;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the significant reduction in the trading price of our common stock over the past several months, which has  created uncertainty among our employees and raised concerns about our financial stability;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the number of shares currently reserved for issuance under our 2015 Plan as compared to our current and projected  equity grant requirements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the viability of and risks associated with alternative incentive compensation programs, including cash incentive  programs; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• changes in our expectations regarding the number of shares that are likely to be returned to our 2015 Plan and  made available for future issuance pursuant to the Option Exchange Program, if implemented.  
[END TABLE]
Our board of directors also took into account certain additional criteria relating to the potential impact of the amendment to our 2015 Plan on our stockholders. For example, our board of directors considered the amount of the requested share increase relative to both the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding, as well as our fully-diluted shares outstanding. Our board of directors also took into consideration that virtually all of the stock options granted under our 2015 Plan prior to September 2018 are currently "out-of-the-money" (and in many cases, significantly "out-of-the-money") and therefore do not provide any meaningful incentive or retention benefits. In light of the foregoing, our board of directors believes the additional share request to be appropriate and necessary to meet the objectives of our equity compensation program. 
In connection with seeking an amendment to our 2015 Plan to increase the total number of shares reserved for issuance, we acknowledge we recently solicited and obtained the approval of our stockholders for an increase in the number of reserved shares by 500,000 shares. This approval was obtained at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, which was held in June 2018. At the annual meeting, we also solicited and obtained the approval of our stockholders for the Option Exchange Program. Pursuant to the Option Exchange Program, eligible participants would be entitled to surrender certain out-of-the-money stock options for cancellation in exchange for a grant of a lesser number of restricted stock units that have approximately the same value as the cancelled stock options. In   requesting that only 500,000 shares be added to the share reserve under our 2015 Plan at the annual meeting, our board of directors specifically assumed the Option Exchange Program would be adopted by our stockholders and implemented by our board of directors, and that, based on an assumed participation rate, approximately 2,200,000 shares would be returned to our 2015 Plan and made available for future issuance (after taking into account the grant of restricted stock units in exchange for options under the program). However, due to a number of factors, including the recent volatility in our stock price and our ongoing restructuring efforts, we have not yet implemented the Option Exchange Program. As a result, the additional shares we anticipated would be returned to our 2015 Plan and made available for future grant have not yet been returned to the plan reserve. In addition, based on the recent decline in our stock price, and the resulting impact on the anticipated exchange ratios of stock options for restricted stock units, even if the Option Exchange Program is implemented, we currently anticipate that significantly fewer shares would ultimately be returned to our 2015 Plan than initially projected. In addition, the recent decline in our stock price could make the Option Exchange Program less attractive to our eligible employees, which could limit the participation rate and further reduce the number of shares that are returned to our 2015 Plan. Further, while we anticipate implementing the Option Exchange Program during the first half of 2019, we cannot provide any assurance that we will implement the Option Exchange Program on the currently approved terms or at all. Accordingly, we cannot assume that the Option Exchange Program, even if implemented, will have the impact of providing a sufficient number of reserved shares under our 2015 Plan to meet our projected equity grant requirements or the objectives of our compensation programs. 
In light of both the recent decline in our stock price, and the heightened need to motivate and retain our key employees in the face of our ongoing management transition, commercial restructuring and other strategic changes to our business, we expect the average number of shares underlying equity awards granted by our compensation committee to be significantly greater in 2018 than in previous years. Assuming this proposal is approved by our stockholders, we project that we will issue equity awards covering an aggregate of approximately 8,400,000 shares to our executives, employees and non-employee directors in 2018, most of which are either the result of specific contractual obligations we have with employees or are annual equity grants that represent a critical component of the overall compensation opportunity, and which our compensation committee believes are necessary to maintain competitive compensation practices. We estimate the shares authorized for issuance under our 2015 Plan, assuming that this proposal is adopted, would be sufficient to grant awards for 2018. However, our actual share usage is dependent on a number of important variables, including the future trading price of our common stock, our hiring and promotion activity, and our retention needs. 
Description of our 2015 Plan (as proposed to be amended) 
The material terms of our 2015 Plan, as proposed to be amended by this proposal, are outlined below. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of our 2015 Plan, which is appended to this proxy statement as Appendix A and incorporated herein by reference. You are encouraged the full text of our 2015 Plan, as proposed to be amended, before making a voting decision. 
General. Our 2015 Plan is an "omnibus" stock plan consisting of a variety of equity vehicles to provide flexibility in implementing equity awards, including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, stock payment awards, restricted stock units and dividend equivalents. Participants in our 2015 Plan may be granted any one or more of these equity awards, as determined by our board of directors. 
Shares Reserved for Issuance. As of November 9, 2018, (i) options exercisable for 4,344,924 shares of our common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $8.58 and a weighted average remaining term of 5.24 years were outstanding, (ii) time-based restricted stock units covering 1,039,347 shares of our common stock were outstanding, (iii) performance-based restricted stock units covering 348,216 shares of our common stock were outstanding, and (iv) 2,415,993 shares of our common stock were reserved for future grant under our 2015 Plan. If this proposal is adopted, an aggregate of up to 8,415,993 shares of our common stock will be available for future issuance under our 2015 Plan. For additional information about grants of equity awards that we would be required to make to certain persons upon the approval of this proposal by our stockholders, please see the section titled "New Plan Benefits" below. 
Administration. Our board of directors has delegated administration of our 2015 Plan to our compensation committee. The members of our compensation committee satisfy the requirements for (i) an "independent director" for purposes of the applicable NASDAQ Listing Rules, (ii) a "non-employee director" for purposes of Rule 16b-3 of   the Exchange Act and (iii) an "outside director" under Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Our compensation committee has the powers and authority as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the functions of the administrator. Subject to the express limitations of our 2015 Plan, the administrator has the authority to determine the persons to whom, and the time or times at which, awards may be granted, the number of shares, units or other rights subject to each award, the exercise, base or purchase price of an award (if any), the time or times at which an award will become vested, exercisable or payable, the performance goals and other conditions, duration and all other terms of an award. The administrator may prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to our 2015 Plan. All interpretations, determinations and actions by the administrator in good faith shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties. Additionally, to the extent permitted by law, the administrator may delegate to one or more of our officers or directors the ability to grant and determine terms and conditions of awards under our 2015 Plan to certain employees. 
Eligibility. Our employees, officers, directors, consultants and other service providers are eligible to receive each type of award available under our 2015 Plan, except that only our employees (including members of our board of directors who are also our employees) are eligible to receive incentive stock options under our 2015 Plan. Our directors and officers are eligible to participate in our 2015 Plan, and have a substantial direct interest in the approval of our 2015 Plan. As of November 9, 2018, approximately 540 persons were eligible to participate in our 2015 Plan. 
Types of Awards under our 2015 Plan 
Our 2015 Plan includes the following types of equity compensation awards: incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock award, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents and stock payment awards, all of which are described below. 
Stock Options. Stock options granted under our 2015 Plan may be either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options, subject to the provisions of Section 422 of the Code. The exercise price per share of a stock option shall not be less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date the option is granted, provided that if the person to whom an incentive stock option is granted beneficially owns 10% of our outstanding common stock on the date of the grant, the exercise price shall not be less than 110% of the fair market value on the date the option is granted, subject to certain exceptions. A stock option may be subject to such vesting and exercisability requirements as specified by the administrator in an award agreement. Such vesting and exercisability requirements may be based on the continued service of the participant with us for a specified time period (or periods) or on the attainment of specified performance goals established by the administrator in its discretion, or a combination of both. The administrator shall determine the period during which a vested stock option may be exercised, provided that the maximum term of a stock option shall be ten years from the date the option is granted. 
Stock Appreciation Rights. A stock appreciation right will entitle the holder, upon exercise or other payment of the stock appreciation right, as applicable, to receive an amount determined by multiplying: (i) the excess of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of exercise or payment of the stock appreciation right over the base price of such stock appreciation right by (ii) the number of shares as to which such stock appreciation right is exercised or paid. Subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, payment of the amount determined under the foregoing shall be made either in cash or in shares of our common stock, as determined by the administrator in its discretion. If payment is made in shares of our common stock, such shares shall be valued at their fair market value on the date of exercise or payment, subject to applicable tax withholding requirements and to the conditions set forth in the award agreement. A stock appreciation right may be subject to such vesting and exercisability requirements as specified by the administrator in an award agreement. Such vesting and exercisability requirements may be based on the continued service of the participant with us for a specified time period (or periods) or on the attainment of specified performance goals established by the administrator in its discretion, or a combination of both. Stock appreciation rights may be granted on a basis that allows for the exercise of the right by the participant or that provides for the automatic payment of the right upon a specified date or event. The base price of a stock appreciation right shall not be less than the fair market value of the shares of our common stock on the date the right is granted. 
Restricted Stock Awards. Restricted stock awards are shares issued under our 2015 Plan that are subject to restrictions on transfer and vesting requirements as determined by the administrator. The restrictions imposed on shares granted under a restricted stock award lapse in accordance with the vesting requirements specified in the award agreement. The vesting requirements may be based on the continued service of the participant with us for a specified time period (or periods) or on the attainment of specified performance goals established by the   administrator in its discretion, or a combination of both. If the vesting requirements of a restricted stock award are not satisfied, the award will be forfeited and the unvested shares of our common stock subject to the award will be returned to us (or, to the extent the participant paid for the shares of our common stock, we have the right to repurchase such shares from the participant at the original purchase price). Subject to the provisions of our 2015 Plan and the applicable award agreement, the participant has all rights of a stockholder with respect to the shares granted under a restricted stock award, including the right to vote the shares and receive all dividends and other distributions paid or made with respect thereto. 
Restricted Stock Units. The value of each restricted stock unit is equal to one share of our common stock on the applicable date or time period of determination, as specified by the administrator. A grant of restricted stock units is subject to such restrictions and conditions as may be determined by the administrator. On the date the award is granted, the administrator determines the vesting requirements with respect to a stock unit award, which is set forth in the award agreement. Vesting requirements may be based on the continued service of the participant with us for a specified time period (or periods) or on the attainment of specified performance goals established by the administrator, or a combination of both. A restricted stock unit will become payable to a participant at the time or times set forth in the award agreement, which may be upon or following the vesting of the award. Payment of a restricted stock unit award is made in shares of our common stock, and is subject to applicable tax withholding requirements. The participant does not have any rights as a stockholder with respect to the shares subject to a restricted stock unit award until shares of our common stock are delivered to the participant pursuant to the terms of the award agreement. 
Stock Payment Awards. A stock payment award may be granted for any valid purpose as determined by the administrator. A stock payment award granted to a participant represents shares of our common stock that are issued without restrictions on transfer and other incidents of ownership and free of forfeiture conditions, except as otherwise provided in our 2015 Plan and the award agreement. The administrator may, in connection with any stock payment award, require the payment of a specified purchase price. Subject to the provisions of our 2015 Plan and the applicable award agreement, upon the issuance of our common stock under a stock payment award the participant has all rights of a stockholder with respect to the shares of our common stock, including the right to vote the shares and receive all dividends and other distributions paid or made with respect thereto. 
Dividend Equivalents. A dividend equivalent is a right to receive payments equivalent to the amount of dividends paid by us to holders of shares of our common stock with respect to the number of dividend equivalents held by the participant. The dividend equivalent may provide for payment in our common stock or in cash, or a fixed combination of our common stock or cash, or the administrator may reserve the right to determine the manner of payment at the time the dividend equivalent is payable. Dividend equivalents may be granted only in connection with a grant of restricted stock units and shall be subject to the vesting conditions that govern restricted stock units as set forth in the applicable award agreement. The accrual of dividends or dividend equivalents will only be payable to a participant to the extent that any shares of our common stock underlying a participant's award have vested, and no dividends or dividend equivalents shall be paid on options or stock appreciation rights. See the section entitled "No Dividends on Unvested Awards" below. 
Certain Features of our 2015 Plan 
Payment of Exercise Price or Purchase Price. The payment of the exercise price for stock options, or the purchase price for shares of restricted stock, shares covered by restricted stock units, or stock payment awards may be made, in the discretion of the administrator, through a variety of methods more particularly described in our 2015 Plan, including payment by (i) cash, (ii) check, (iii) delivery of shares of our common stock (provided that any shares acquired pursuant to exercise of options have been held by the participant for the requisite period necessary to avoid a charge to our earnings for financial reporting purposes), such surrendered shares valued at the fair market value of our common stock on the date of exercise or purchase, (iv) waiver of compensation due to the participant for services rendered or (v) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment or any other consideration or method of payment as shall be permitted by applicable law. 
Transferability of Awards. All incentive stock options are nontransferable except upon the participant's death by will or the laws of descent or distribution or pursuant to the terms of certain domestic relations orders. In the case of awards other than incentive stock options, the administrator may provide, in its discretion, for the transfer of all or part of the award to a participant's "family member" (as defined for purposes of the Form S-8 registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act).  Adjustments to Awards Upon Certain Changes in Capitalization. In the event that the outstanding shares of our common stock are increased or decreased or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or our other securities by reason of a recapitalization, stock split, combination of shares, reclassification, stock dividend or other change in our capital structure, then the administrator will make adjustments to the aggregate number and kind of shares subject to our 2015 Plan, the number and kind of shares and the exercise price per share subject to outstanding awards, and the maximum share limitations, as applicable, all in order to preserve, as nearly as practical, but not to increase, the benefits to the participants. 
Occurrence of Corporate Transaction. Our 2015 Plan provides that in order to preserve a participant's rights in the event of certain transactions constituting a change in control of our Company, the administrator shall have the discretion to provide in each award agreement the terms and conditions that relate to the vesting of such award in the event of a change in control of our Company and the assumption of such awards or the issuance of comparable securities under an incentive program in the event of such occurrence. The terms and conditions of each award agreement may vary. If the terms of an outstanding option or stock appreciation right provide for accelerated vesting in the event of a change in control, or to the extent that an award is vested and not yet exercised, the administrator may provide, in connection with the change in control transaction, for the purchase or exchange of each option or stock appreciation right for cash or other property. All outstanding option and stock appreciation rights will terminate and cease to be exercisable upon the consummation of a change in control except to the extent that the options or stock appreciation rights are assumed by a successor entity (or parent) pursuant to the terms of such transaction. 
No Dividends on Unvested Awards. Our 2015 Plan eliminates the ability of the administrator to provide for the payment of dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to any shares of our common stock subject to an outstanding award granted under our 2015 Plan that has not vested. For any such award, the administrator may provide only for the accrual of dividends or Dividend Equivalents that will not be payable to a participant unless and until, and only to the extent that, such award vests. No dividends or dividend equivalents shall be paid on options or stock appreciation rights. 
Minimum Vesting Requirement. Our 2015 Plan imposes a minimum vesting period of at least 12 months on any awards granted under our 2015 Plan after June 14, 2018, provided that up to five percent (5%) of the shares subject to these awards may be issued without being subject to this minimum vesting period. 
Impact of Certain Stock Awards on Share Reserve. Our 2015 Plan provides that, for each share of common stock granted pursuant to the plan as a restricted stock award, stock payment award or restricted stock unit award, the number of shares reserved and available for grant under the plan will be reduced by one-and-six-tenths (1.6) shares. 
Performance Criteria. Our 2015 Plan includes a number of performance criteria that may be used to determine whether and to what extent the shares covered by an award have vested. The administrator has the discretion to specify whether the criteria will be measured either annually or cumulatively over a period of years on an absolute basis or relative to a pre-established target, to the previous years' results or to a designated peer group of companies, in each case as specified in the individual award agreement at the time of grant. The performance criteria may be stated as either target amounts, or as a percentage increase over a base period amount, and may be based upon any one or a combination of the following:

Our officers and directors are eligible to receive grants under our 2015 Plan, and have a substantial direct interest in the approval of this proposal by our stockholders. 
Summary of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of our 2015 Plan 
The following is a brief summary of the material federal income tax consequences of participation in our 2015 Plan. The summary should not be relied upon as being a complete statement of all possible federal income tax consequences. Federal tax laws are complex and subject to change. Participation in our 2015 Plan may also have consequences under state and local tax laws which vary from the federal tax consequences described below. For such reasons, we recommend that each participant consult his or her personal tax advisor to determine the specific tax consequences applicable to him or her. 
Incentive Stock Options. A participant who receives an incentive stock option will not recognize taxable income upon the grant of the option or the exercise of the option. However, the amount by which the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise exceeds the option exercise price will generally be included in the participant's alternative minimum taxable income upon exercise. If stock received on exercise of an incentive stock option is disposed of in the same year the option was exercised, the regular tax treatment and the alternative tax treatment will be the same. If stock received on exercise of an incentive stock option is sold during a year subsequent to that in which the option was exercised, the basis of the stock acquired will equal its fair market value on the date of exercise for purposes of computing alternative minimum taxable income in the year of sale. 
A participant who is subject to the alternative minimum tax in the year of exercise of an incentive stock option may be able to claim, as a credit against the participant's regular tax liability in future years, all or a portion of the amount of alternative minimum tax paid that is attributable to the exercise of the incentive stock option. This credit is generally available in the first year following the year of exercise in which the participant has a regular tax liability. 
Gain realized by a participant upon sale of stock issued on exercise of an incentive stock option is taxable as long-term capital gain if the participant disposes of the shares more than two years after the date of grant of the option and more than one year after the date of exercise. If the participant disposes of the shares (including by gift) less than two years after the date of grant or less than one year after the date of exercise (in each case, a disqualifying disposition), the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the option exercise price and the lower of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise or on the date of disposition of the shares. However, certain transfers may not be treated as dispositions for such purposes, such as transfers to an estate or by inheritance upon death. If the amount realized in a disqualifying disposition exceeds the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise, the gain realized, in excess of the amount taxed as ordinary income as indicated above, will be taxed as capital gain. Any loss realized upon a disqualifying disposition will be treated as a capital loss. Capital gains and losses resulting from disqualifying dispositions will be treated as long-term or short-term depending upon whether the shares were held for more or less than the applicable statutory holding period (which is currently more than one year for long-term capital gains). We will generally be entitled to a tax deduction in an amount equal to the amount the participant must recognize as ordinary income. 
Non-Qualified Stock Options. Generally, no taxable income is recognized by a participant upon the grant of a non-qualified stock option or at the time or times a non-qualified stock option becomes vested where the exercise price of such option is no less than the fair market value of the stock underlying such option at the time such option is granted. Under our 2015 Plan, the exercise price for all options must be at least equal to the fair market value of the stock underlying such options at the time of the grant. Upon exercise, however, the participant will recognize ordinary income in the amount by which the fair market value of the shares purchased, on the date of exercise, exceeds the exercise price paid for such shares. The income recognized by the participant who is our employee will be subject to income tax withholding by us out of the participant's current compensation. If such compensation is insufficient to pay the taxes due, the participant will be required to make a direct payment to us for   the balance of the tax withholding obligation. We will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant, provided that certain reporting requirements are satisfied. If the exercise price of a non-qualified stock option is paid by the participant in cash, the tax basis of the shares acquired will be equal to the cash paid plus the amount of income recognized by the participant as a result of such exercise. If the exercise price is paid by delivering shares of our common stock already owned by the participant or by a combination of cash and already-owned shares, there will be no current taxable gain or loss recognized by the participant on the already-owned shares exchanged (however, the participant will nevertheless recognize ordinary income to the extent that the fair market value of the shares purchased on the date of exercise exceeds the price paid, as described above). The new shares received by the participant, up to the number of the old shares exchanged, will have the same tax basis and holding period as the participant's basis and holding period in the old shares. The balance of the new shares received will have a tax basis equal to any cash paid by the participant plus the amount of income recognized by the participant as a result of such exercise, and will have a holding period commencing with the date of exercise. Upon the sale or disposition of shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, the difference between the proceeds realized and the participant's basis in the shares will be a capital gain or loss and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for the applicable statutory holding period (which is currently more than one year for long-term capital gains). 
Restricted Stock. If no Section 83(b) election is made and we retain repurchase rights, a taxable event will occur on each date the participant's ownership rights vest (e.g., when our repurchase rights expire) as to the number of shares that vest on that date, and the holding period for capital gain purposes will not commence until the date the shares vest. The participant will recognize ordinary income on each date shares vest in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares on that date over the amount paid for such shares. Any income recognized by a participant who is an employee will be subject to income tax withholding by us out of the participant's current compensation. If such compensation is insufficient to cover the amount to be withheld, the participant will be required to make a direct payment to us for the balance of the tax withholding obligation. The participant's basis in the shares will be equal to the purchase price, if any, increased by the amount of ordinary income recognized. If a Section 83(b) election is made within 30 days after the date of transfer, or if we do not retain any repurchase rights, then the participant will recognize ordinary income on the date of purchase in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of such shares on the date of purchase over the purchase price paid for such shares. We are entitled to a tax deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant. 
Stock Appreciation Rights. Generally no taxable income is recognized by a participant receiving a stock appreciation right at the time the stock appreciation right is granted or at the time or times a stock appreciation right becomes vested where the base price of a stock appreciation right is no less than the fair market value of the stock underlying such stock appreciation right at the time such option is granted. Under our 2015 Plan, the base value for all stock appreciation rights must be at least equal to the fair market value of the stock underlying such stock appreciation rights at the time of the grant. If the participant receives the appreciation inherent in the stock appreciation right in cash, the cash will be taxed as ordinary income to the participant at the time it is received. If the participant receives the appreciation inherent in a stock appreciation right in stock, the spread between the then-current market value and the base price will be taxed as ordinary income to the participant at the time such amount is received. We are not entitled to a federal income tax deduction upon the grant or termination of a stock appreciation right. However, upon the settlement of a stock appreciation right, we are entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income the participant is required to recognize as a result of the settlement. 
Restricted Stock Unit, Stock Payment Awards and Dividend Equivalents. Grants of restricted stock units, stock payment awards and dividend equivalents are generally subject to ordinary income tax at the time of settlement or payment, as applicable. 
Tax Withholding. Under our 2015 Plan, we have the power to withhold, or require a participant to remit to us, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state and local withholding tax requirements with respect to any award granted under our 2015 Plan. To the extent permissible under applicable tax, securities, and other laws, the administrator may, in its sole discretion, permit a participant to satisfy an obligation to pay any tax to any governmental entity in whole or in part, by (i) directing us to apply shares of our common stock to which the participant is entitled pursuant to an award or (ii) delivering to us shares of our common stock owned by the participant.  Tax Deduction Limitation. Section 162(m) of the Code disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation paid in excess of $1,000,000 to "covered employees" as defined under Section 162(m). Prior to its amendment by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, which was enacted December 22, 2017, there was an exception to this $1,000,000 deduction limitation for performance-based compensation if certain requirements set forth in Section 162(m) and the applicable regulations were met. The TCJA generally amended Section 162(m) to eliminate this exception for performance-based compensation, effective for taxable years following December 31, 2017. The $1,000,000 compensation limit was also expanded to apply to a public company's chief financial officer and apply to certain individuals who were covered employees in years other than the then-current taxable year. Our compensation committee maintains a practice of considering the anticipated tax treatment to our Company in its review and establishment of compensation programs and awards. Our compensation committee intends to continue to consider the deductibility of compensation as a factor in assessing whether a particular arrangement is appropriate, taking into account the goals of maintaining a competitive executive compensation system generally, motivating executives to achieve corporate performance objectives and increasing stockholder value. 
Deferred Compensation. Any deferrals made under our 2015 Plan, including awards granted under our 2015 Plan that are considered to be deferred compensation, must satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to avoid adverse tax consequences to participants, which include the current inclusion of deferred amounts in income and interest and a surtax on any amount included in income. The Section 409A requirements include limitations on election timing, acceleration of payments, and distributions. Section 409A applies to certain stock appreciation rights, stock unit awards, and other awards that provide the participant with an opportunity to defer recognition of income. We intend to structure any awards under our 2015 Plan to meet the applicable tax law requirements, including under Section 409A, in order to avoid adverse tax consequences to participants or us. 
New Plan Benefits 
If our stockholders approve this proposal, the additional shares of our common stock that would become reserved for issuance under our 2015 Plan would be immediately available to grant equity awards to eligible plan participants. Assuming our stockholders approve this proposal, our compensation committee has determined to make equity grants under our 2015 Plan to certain of our named executive officers, all executive officers as a group, all non-employee directors as a group, and all other employees as a group, as set forth in the table below. The awards set forth in the table reflect only those awards that we are legally obligated to make, but does not reflect all equity awards we intend to make pursuant to our 2015 Plan to meet our compensation plans and objectives. Other than the awards set forth in the table, neither the number nor type of future equity awards to be granted pursuant to our 2015 Plan to particular plan participants is presently determinable.

 DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2019 ANNUAL MEETING 
Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act specifies the requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals in our proxy statement for an annual meeting of stockholders.

However, if we hold our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders on a date that is more than 30 days earlier or later than our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, then a stockholder proposal must be received by us at our principal place of business in a reasonable amount of time prior to when we begin to print and mail our proxy materials. Matters pertaining to such proposals, including the number and length thereof, the eligibility of persons entitled to have such proposals included and other aspects are regulated by Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, rules and regulations of the SEC and other laws and regulations. 
If a stockholder desires to bring business before the meeting which is not the subject of a proposal properly submitted in accordance with Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, the stockholder must follow procedures outlined in our bylaws. Our bylaws provide that a stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting may make nominations for the election of directors or may propose that other business be brought before the meeting only if (i) such nominations or proposals are included in our proxy statement or otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our board of directors, or (ii) the stockholder has delivered or mailed written notice to us (containing certain information specified in the bylaws), and our Corporate Secretary has received such written notice, not less than 90 days prior to the date of the meeting. However, if we have given less than 100 days' advance notice or public disclosure of the date the meeting is to be held, written notice of a nomination or proposal to be submitted by a stockholder at the meeting will be timely if it has been received by us not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made.  OTHER BUSINESS 
As of the date of this proxy statement, our board of directors is not aware of any matters, other than those described in this proxy statement, which may be presented for consideration at the special meeting. Should any other matters requiring a vote of the stockholders come before the special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the persons named in the accompanying proxy card will have the discretionary authority to vote with respect to such matters in accordance with their best judgment.

5.2 Option Agreements. Each Option granted pursuant to this Plan shall be evidenced by an Option Agreement which shall specify the number of shares subject thereto, vesting provisions relating to such Option, the Exercise Price per share, and whether the Option is an Incentive Option or Nonqualified Option. As soon as is practical following the grant of an Option, an Option Agreement shall be duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Company to the Optionee to whom such Option was granted. Each Option Agreement shall be in such form and contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan, as the Administrator shall, from time to time, deem desirable. 
5.3 Exercise Price. The Exercise Price per share of Common Stock covered by each Option shall be determined by the Administrator, subject to the following: (a) the Exercise Price of an Incentive Option shall not be less than 100% of Fair Market Value on the date the Incentive Option is granted, (b) the Exercise Price of a Nonqualified Option shall not be less than 100% of Fair Market Value on the date the Nonqualified Option is granted, and (c) if the person to whom an Incentive Option is granted is a 10% Stockholder on the date of grant, the Exercise Price shall not be less than 110% of Fair Market Value on the date the Incentive Option is granted. 
However, an Option may be granted with an exercise price lower than that set forth in the preceding sentence if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option in a manner satisfying the provisions of Section 424 of the Code. 
5.4 Payment of Exercise Price. Payment of the Exercise Price shall be made upon exercise of an Option and may be made, in the discretion of the Administrator, subject to any legal restrictions, by: (a) cash; (b) check; (c) the surrender of shares of Common Stock owned by the Optionee (provided that shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of options granted by the Company must have been held by the Optionee for the requisite period necessary to avoid a charge to the Company's earnings for financial reporting purposes), which surrendered shares shall be valued at Fair Market Value as of the date of such exercise; (d) the cancellation of indebtedness of the Company to the Optionee; (e) the waiver of compensation due or accrued to the Optionee for 
A-6 
 services rendered; (f) provided that a public market for the Common Stock exists, a "same day sale" commitment from the Optionee and an NASD Dealer whereby the Optionee irrevocably elects to exercise the Option and to sell a portion of the shares so purchased to pay for the Exercise Price and whereby the NASD Dealer irrevocably commits upon receipt of such shares to forward the Exercise Price directly to the Company; (g) provided that a public market for the Common Stock exists, a "margin" commitment from the Optionee and an NASD Dealer whereby the Optionee irrevocably elects to exercise the Option and to pledge the shares so purchased to the NASD Dealer in a margin account as security for a loan from the NASD Dealer in the amount of the Exercise Price, and whereby the NASD Dealer irrevocably commits upon receipt of such shares to forward the Exercise Price directly to the Company; or (h) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment or any other consideration or method of payment as shall be permitted by applicable law.

5.6 Vesting and Exercise of Options. Each Option shall vest and become exercisable in one or more installments, at such time or times and subject to such conditions, including without limitation the achievement of specified performance goals or objectives established with respect to one or more Performance Criteria, as shall be determined by the Administrator. 
5.7 Annual Limit on Incentive Options. To the extent required for "incentive stock option" treatment under Section 422 of the Code, the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time of grant) of the Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Options granted under this Plan and any other plan of the Company or any Affiliated Company become exercisable for the first time by an Optionee during any calendar year shall not exceed $100,000. 
5.8 Nontransferability of Options. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.8, Options shall not be assignable or transferable except by will, the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a DRO entered by a court in settlement of marital property rights, and during the life of the Optionee, Options shall be exercisable only by the Optionee. At the discretion of the Administrator and in accordance with rules it establishes from time to time, Optionees may be permitted to transfer some or all of their Nonqualified Options to one or more "family members," which is not a "prohibited transfer for value," provided that (i) the Optionee (or such Optionee's estate or representative) shall remain obligated to satisfy all income or other tax withholding obligations associated with the exercise of such Nonqualified Option; (ii) the Optionee shall notify the Company in writing that such transfer has occurred and disclose to the Company the name and address of the "family member" or "family members" and their relationship to the Optionee, and (iii) such transfer shall be effected pursuant to transfer documents in a form approved by the Administrator. For purposes of the foregoing, the terms "family members" and "prohibited transfer for value" have the meaning ascribed to them in the General Instructions to Form S-8 (or any successor form) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
5.9 Repricing Prohibited. Subject to Section 4.2 hereof, without the prior approval of the Company's stockholders, evidenced by a majority of votes cast, the Administrator shall not amend the terms of outstanding Options to reduce the Exercise Price of outstanding Options, cancel outstanding Options in exchange for cash, other awards or Options with an Exercise Price that is less than the Exercise Price of the original Options, or otherwise approve any modification to such an Option that would be treated as a "repricing" under the then applicable rules, regulations or listing requirements adopted by the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
5.10 Rights as a Stockholder. An Optionee or permitted transferee of an Option shall have no rights or privileges as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by an Option until such Option has been duly exercised and certificates representing shares purchased upon such exercise have been issued to such person. 
5.11 Unvested Shares. The Administrator shall have the discretion to grant Options which are exercisable for unvested shares of Common Stock. Should the Optionee cease being an employee, officer or director of the Company while owning such unvested shares, the Company shall have the right to repurchase, at the exercise price paid per share, any or all of those unvested shares. The terms upon which such repurchase right shall be exercisable (including the period and procedure for exercise and the appropriate vesting schedule for the purchased shares) shall be established by the Administrator and set forth in the document evidencing such repurchase right.

10.4 No Dividends on Unvested Awards. The Administrator may not provide for the current payment of dividends or Dividend Equivalents with respect to any shares of Common Stock subject to an outstanding award granted under the Plan (or portion thereof) that has not vested.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dividend Equivalents may be granted only in connection with a grant of Restricted Stock Units subject to the vesting conditions that govern Restricted Stock Units as set forth in the applicable Restricted Stock Award Agreement.

(a) The Administrator shall have the discretion to provide in each Award Agreement the terms and conditions that relate to (i) vesting of such Award in the event of a Change in Control, and (ii) assumption of such Awards or issuance of comparable securities under an incentive program in the event of a Change in Control. The aforementioned terms and conditions may vary in each Award Agreement.

(c) If the terms of an outstanding Stock Appreciation Right provide for accelerated vesting in the event of a Change in Control, or to the extent that a Stock Appreciation Right is vested and not yet exercised, the Administrator in its discretion may provide, in connection with the Change in Control transaction, for the purchase or exchange of each Stock Appreciation Right for an amount of cash or other property having a value equal to the value of the cash or other property that the Participant would have received pursuant to the Change in Control transaction in exchange for the shares issuable upon exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right had the Stock Appreciation Right been exercised immediately prior to the Change in Control. 
(d) Outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall terminate and cease to be exercisable upon consummation of a Change in Control except to the extent that the Options or Stock Appreciation Rights are assumed by the successor entity (or parent thereof) pursuant to the terms of the Change in Control transaction.

The Board may alter or amend the Plan to comply with requirements under the Code relating to Incentive Options or other types of options which give Optionees more favorable tax treatment than that applicable to Options granted under this Plan as of the date of its adoption.

14.6 Annual Reports. During the term of this Plan, the Company will furnish to each Participant who does not otherwise receive such materials, copies of all reports, proxy statements and other communications that the Company distributes generally to its stockholders.
