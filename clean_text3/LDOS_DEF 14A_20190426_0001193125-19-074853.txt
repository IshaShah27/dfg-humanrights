LEIDOS 2019
Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and 
Proxy Statement 
Friday, April 26, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., ET 
Leidos Holdings, Inc. 
11951 Freedom Drive 
Reston, Virginia 20190 
A Letter from our Chairman on behalf of the Board of Directors 
Dear Fellow Shareholders, 
On behalf of the entire Board of Leidos, I would like to thank you for your continued support. As a leader in science, information technology, and engineering for 50 years, our experts are amongst the most trusted in the world. Our 32,000 employees focused heavily in 2018 on leveraging our strengths to drive future growth by winning new work that enabled strong bookings and record backlog. We maintained this focus despite the pressures of a hyper-competitive market and the partial government shutdown. 
We are fortunate that our ability to deliver financial sustainability is inextricably linked to our making the world safer, healthier, and more efficient—it is the nature of our business and the potential, we believe, is significant.
We are in businesses that require us to be informed, nimble, creative and efficient. We therefore, from our board and leadership team down throughout our entire employee base, spend a significant amount of time crafting and implementing the right strategy. We further refined this in 2018, enabling our continued differentiation from competitors. 
Over the past year we saw direct, tangible benefits affirming the strategic direction we chose. We further enhanced our efforts by targeting investments in key technical discriminator areas as embodied in our seven Leidos technical core competencies. 
This year we continued our journey of supporting strategic growth by further enhancing our business development and proposal processes to increase our pipeline and improve win rates. We also increased our investment in technology research and development, which is a critical aspect of our long-term strategy.
I want to take a moment to recognize our employees who demonstrate their strong commitment to our purpose as a company each day. Their service to our customers and drive for performance and efficiency led to the more than three quarters of a billion dollars in cash flow generated from operations for fiscal year 2018. We were also able to redeploy a significant amount of that cash back to shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. This is all made possible by our employees, their passion for the work they do, their expertise, their collaboration as a team, and their drive to make a difference in society – and in our world. 
Foundational to our success is integrity and our commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. High ethical standards is the core of Leidos, and I am proud that we were once again recognized this year as one of the 2019 World's Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute. We are continuing to evolve our diversity and inclusion efforts as part of our overall focus on our human capital. We have limited exposure to environmental risks compared to many sectors but we look for opportunities to protect our communities, the planet and future generations where we can find them. I am privileged to work alongside my colleagues who make environmental and social sustainability possible through their contributions. 
I look forward to another year of working hard with the Leidos team to pursue our purpose as we support our customers and communities and deliver value back to you, our shareholders. 
Sincerely, 
Roger A. Krone 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Reston, Virginia 20190 
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
To Be Held April 26, 2019 
PROXY STATEMENT 
This proxy statement is being furnished to the stockholders of Leidos Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board of Directors for use at our annual meeting of stockholders to be held at the company's office at 11951 Freedom Drive, Reston, Virginia, on Friday, April 26, 2019, at 9:00 a.m. ET. and at any and all adjournments, postponements or continuations of the meeting. This proxy statement and the proxy and voting instruction card are first being sent or made available to our stockholders on or about March 14, 2019. 
Information About Voting Rights and Solicitation of Proxies 
Who is entitled to vote at the annual meeting? 
Only stockholders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on our record date of February 25, 2019 are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the annual meeting. As of February 25, 2019, there were 143,627,823 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. 
We have no other class of capital stock outstanding. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting will be available for inspection at 11951 Freedom Drive, Reston, Virginia for at least 10 days prior to the meeting and will also be available for inspection at the meeting. 
Do I need an admission ticket to attend the annual meeting? 
Yes. If you attend the meeting, you will be asked to present an admission ticket or proof of ownership and valid photo identification. Your admission ticket is: 
What constitutes a quorum? 
The presence, either in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the total voting power of the shares of common stock outstanding as of February 25, 2019 is necessary to constitute a quorum and to conduct business at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker "non-votes" will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. 
2019 Proxy Statement    |    1 
Information About Voting Rights and Solicitation of Proxies 
What is a broker "non-vote"? 
A broker "non-vote" occurs when a broker, bank or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that matter and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. In tabulating the voting results for a particular proposal, broker "non-votes" are not considered entitled to vote on that proposal. Broker "non-votes" will not have an effect on the outcome of any matter being voted on at the meeting, assuming a quorum is present. 
Unless you provide voting instructions to any broker holding shares on your behalf, your broker may not use discretionary authority to vote your shares on any of the matters to be considered at the annual meeting other than the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm. Please vote your proxy or provide voting instructions to your broker so your vote can be counted. 
How many votes am I entitled to? 
Each holder of common stock will be entitled to one vote per share, in person or by proxy, for each share of stock held in such stockholder's name as of February 25, 2019, on any matter submitted to a vote of stockholders at the annual meeting unless a stockholder elects to cumulate votes for the election of directors as described below. 
Is cumulative voting permitted for the election of directors? 
In the election of directors, you may cumulate your vote. This means that you may allocate among the director nominees, as you see fit, the total number of votes equal to the director positions to be filled multiplied by the number of shares you hold. You may not cumulate your votes against a nominee and cumulative voting applies only to the election of directors. 
If you are a stockholder of record and choose to cumulate your votes, you will need to notify our 
 Corporate Secretary in writing prior to the Annual Meeting or, if you vote in person at the annual meeting, notify the chair of the meeting prior to the commencement of voting at the annual meeting. You may not submit your proxy or voting instructions over the Internet or by telephone if you wish to distribute your votes unevenly among two or more nominees. If you hold shares beneficially through a broker, trustee or other nominee and wish to cumulate votes, you should contact your broker, trustee or nominee. 
How do I vote my shares? 
Shares of common stock represented by a properly executed and timely proxy will, unless it has previously been revoked, be voted in accordance with its instructions. In the absence of specific instructions, the shares represented by a properly executed and timely proxy will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendations as follows: 
No other business is expected to come before the annual meeting; however, should any other matter properly come before the annual meeting, the proxy holders intend to vote such shares in accordance with their best judgment on such matter. 
There are four different ways to vote your shares: 
By Internet: Go to www.proxyvote.com or scan the QR code on your proxy and voting instruction card with a smart phone. 
By Telephone: Call 1-800-690-6903. 
By Mail: If you received your proxy materials via the U.S. mail, you may complete, sign and return the accompanying proxy and voting instruction card in the postage-paid envelope provided. 
In Person: Attend the meeting at the company's office at 11951 Freedom Drive, Reston, Virginia 20190, and vote in person if you are a stockholder of record or if you have obtained a valid proxy from the stockholder of record. 
2    |    2019 Proxy Statement 
Information About Voting Rights and Solicitation of Proxies 
Submitting a proxy will not prevent you from attending the annual meeting and voting in person. Any proxy may be revoked at any time prior to exercise by delivering a written revocation or a new proxy bearing a later date to our mailing agent, Broadridge, as described below or by attending the annual meeting and voting in person. The mailing address of our mailing agent is Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Simply attending the annual meeting will not revoke a proxy. 
What are the voting deadlines? 
For shares not held in the Leidos, Inc. Retirement Plan (the "Leidos Retirement Plan"), the deadline for submitting a proxy using the Internet or the telephone is 11:59 p.m. ET on April 25, 2019. For shares held in the 
 Leidos Retirement Plan, the deadline for submitting voting instructions using any of the allowed methods is 11:59 p.m. ET on April 23, 2019. 
How are the shares held by the Leidos Retirement Plan voted? 
Each participant in the Leidos Retirement Plan has the right to instruct Vanguard Fiduciary Trust Company, as trustee of the Leidos Retirement Plan (the "Trustee"), on a confidential basis, how to vote his or her proportionate interests in all shares of common stock held in the Leidos Retirement Plan. The Trustee will vote all shares held in the Leidos Retirement Plan for which no voting instructions are received in the same proportion as the shares for which voting instructions have been received. 
The Trustee's duties with respect to voting the common stock in the Leidos Retirement Plan are governed by the fiduciary provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). The fiduciary provisions of ERISA may require, in certain limited circumstances, that the Trustee override the votes of participants with respect to the common stock held by the Trustee and to determine, in the Trustee's best judgment, how to vote the shares. 
How are the shares held by the Stock Plans voted? 
Under the terms of our Management Stock Compensation Plan and Key Executive Stock Deferral Plan, Matrix Trust Company, as trustee of these stock plans, has the power to vote the shares of common stock held in these stock plans. Matrix will vote all such shares in the same proportion that our other stockholders collectively vote their shares of common stock. If you are a participant in these stock plans, you do not have the right to instruct Matrix on how to vote your proportionate interests in the shares of common stock held in these stock plans. 
What is the difference between a "stockholder of record" and a "beneficial" holder? 
These terms describe how your shares are held. If your shares are registered directly with Computershare, our transfer agent, then you are a "stockholder of record" of these shares. If your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank, trust or other similar organization, then you are a "beneficial" holder of these shares. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the annual meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization on how to vote the shares held in your account. If you wish to vote in person at the annual meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from the organization holding the shares. 
2019 Proxy Statement    |    3 
Information About Voting Rights and Solicitation of Proxies 
Who is soliciting these proxies? 
We are soliciting these proxies and the cost of the solicitation will be borne by us, including the charges and expenses of persons holding shares in their name as nominee incurred in connection with forwarding proxy materials to the beneficial owners of such shares. In addition to the use of the mail, proxies may be solicited by our officers, directors and employees in person, by telephone or by email. 
Such individuals will not be additionally compensated for such solicitation but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such solicitation. 
What is "householding" and how does it affect me? 
We have adopted a procedure approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, called "householding." Under this procedure, we send only one proxy statement and one annual report to eligible stockholders who share a single address, unless we have received instructions to the contrary from any stockholder at that address. This practice is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy and voting instruction cards. We do not use householding for any other stockholder mailings. 
If you are a registered stockholder residing at an address with other registered stockholders and wish to receive a separate copy of the proxy statement or annual report, or if you do not wish to participate in householding and prefer to receive separate copies of these documents in the future, please contact our mailing agent, Broadridge, either by calling toll-free at 1-800-542-1061, or by writing to Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. If you own shares through a bank, broker, or other nominee, you should contact the nominee concerning householding procedures. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of the proxy statement or annual report to you upon request. 
If you are eligible for householding, but you and other stockholders of record with whom you share an address currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement or annual report and you wish to receive a single copy of each of these documents for your household, please contact our mailing agent, Broadridge, at the telephone number or address indicated above. 
Where can I find the voting results of the annual meeting? 
We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the annual meeting and publish final results in a Current 
 Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four business days of the annual meeting. 
Internet Availability of Proxy Materials 
As permitted by the rules of the SEC, we are using the Internet as a means of furnishing proxy materials to our stockholders. We believe this method will make the proxy distribution process more efficient, lower costs and help in conserving natural resources. 
On or about March 14, 2019, we mailed to our stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials, including our proxy statement and annual report. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also instructs you on how to access your proxy and voting instruction card to be able to vote through the Internet or by telephone. Other stockholders, in accordance with their prior requests, and employees with regular access to email have received email notification of how to access our proxy materials and vote via the Internet or by telephone or have been mailed paper copies of our proxy materials and a proxy and voting instruction card. 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Shareholder Meeting To Be Held on April 26, 2019. 
The proxy statement and annual report are available at www.proxyvote.com. 
4    |    2019 Proxy Statement 
Proposal 1 — Election of Directors 
At the annual meeting, thirteen directors are to be elected to serve for one-year terms to hold such position until their successors are elected and qualified unless any such director resigns or is removed prior to the end of such term. All nominees have been nominated by the Board of Directors (the "Board") based on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. To the best knowledge of the Board, all of the nominees are able and willing to serve. Each nominee has consented to be named in this proxy statement and to serve if elected. 
Majority Voting Standard in Uncontested Director Elections 
We have adopted majority voting procedures for the election of directors in uncontested elections. In an uncontested election, nominees must receive more "for" than "against" votes to be elected. Abstentions are not counted as votes cast. As provided in our bylaws, a "contested election" is one in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected. The election of directors at the 2019 annual meeting is an uncontested election. 
If an incumbent director receives more "against" than "for" votes, he or she is expected to tender his or her resignation in accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the offer of resignation and recommend to the Board the action to be taken. The Board will promptly disclose its decision as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation in a press release, Current Report on Form 8-K or some other public announcement. 
Shares of common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted as instructed in the proxy. In the absence of specific instructions, the shares represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted "for" each nominee. If any of the nominees listed below becomes unable to stand for election at the annual meeting, the proxy holders intend to vote for any person designated by the Board to replace the nominee unable to serve. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR each nominee. 
Nominees for Election to the Board of Directors 
Set forth below is a brief biography of each nominee for election as a director and a brief discussion of the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills that led to the Board's conclusion that the nominee should serve as a director of our company. The Board evaluates each individual in the context of the Board as a whole, with the objective of recommending to stockholders a group of nominees with complementary skills and a diverse mix of backgrounds, perspectives and expertise beneficial to the broad business diversity of our company. Our board membership criteria and director nomination process are described in the "Corporate Governance" section of this proxy statement.

Corporate Governance 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
Our Board recognizes the importance of strong corporate governance as a means of addressing the various needs of our stockholders, employees, customers and other stakeholders. As a result, our Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines which, together with our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, committee charters and other key governance practices and policies, provide the framework for our corporate governance. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines cover a wide range of subjects, including criteria for determining the independence and qualification of our directors. These guidelines are available on our website at www.leidos.com by clicking on the links entitled "Investors" followed by "Corporate Governance." The Board recognizes that observing good corporate governance practices is an ongoing responsibility. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly reviews corporate governance developments and recommends revisions to these Corporate Governance Guidelines and other corporate governance documents as necessary to promote our stockholders' best interests and to help ensure that we comply with all applicable laws, regulations and stock exchange requirements. 
Codes of Conduct 
All of our employees, including our executive officers, are required to comply with our Code of Conduct, which describes our standards for protecting company and customer assets, fostering a safe and healthy work environment, dealing fairly with customers and others, conducting international business properly, reporting misconduct and protecting employees from retaliation. This code forms the foundation of our corporate policies and procedures designed to promote ethical behavior in all aspects of our business. 
Our directors also are required to comply with our Code of Business Conduct of the Board of Directors intended to describe areas of ethical risk, provide guidance to directors and help foster a culture of honesty and accountability. This code addresses areas of professional conduct relating to service on our Board, including conflicts of interest, protection of confidential information, fair dealing and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 
These documents are available on our website at www.leidos.com by clicking on the links entitled "Investors" followed by "Corporate Governance." 
Director Independence 
The Board annually determines the independence of each of our directors and nominees in accordance with the Corporate Governance Guidelines. These guidelines provide that "independent" directors are those who are independent of management and free from any relationship that, in the judgment of the Board, would interfere with their exercise of independent judgment. No director qualifies as independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with us (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization with which we have a relationship). The Board has established independence standards set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines that include all elements of independence required by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE. 
All members of the Audit and Finance, Human Resources and Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees must be independent directors as defined by the Corporate Governance Guidelines. Members of the Audit and Finance Committee and the Human Resources and Compensation Committee must also satisfy separate independence requirements which require that they may not accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from us or any of our subsidiaries other than their directors' compensation or be an affiliated person of ours or any of our subsidiaries. 
Each year, our directors are obligated to complete a questionnaire which requires them to disclose any transactions with us in which the director or any member of his or her immediate family might have a direct or potential conflict of interest. Based on its review of an analysis of the responses, the Board determined that all directors are independent under its guidelines and free from any relationship that would interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment, except for Roger A. Krone because of his role as our Chief Executive Officer.

Corporate Governance 
Criteria for Board Membership 
To fulfill its responsibility to identify and recommend to the full Board nominees for election as directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the composition of the Board to determine the qualifications and areas of expertise needed to further enhance the composition of the Board. In evaluating potential nominees, the Committee and the Board consider each individual in the context of the Board as a whole, with the objective of recommending to stockholders a slate of individual director nominees that can best continue the success of our business and advance stockholders' interests. In evaluating the suitability of individual nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board consider many factors, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     expertise and involvement in areas relevant to our business such as defense, intelligence, science, finance, government or  commercial and international business;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     interpersonal skills, substantial personal accomplishments and diversity as to gender, age, race/ethnicity and experience;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     commitment to business ethics, professional reputation, independence and understanding of the responsibilities of a  director and the governance processes of a public company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     demonstrated leadership, with the ability to exercise sound judgment informed by diversity of experience and perspectives;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     benefits from the continuing service of qualified incumbent directors in promoting stability and continuity, contributing  to the Board's ability to work together as a collective body and giving the company the benefit of experience and insight that its directors have accumulated during their tenure.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the director selection process annually and the Committee and the Board assess its effectiveness through an annual written evaluation process. The Board expects a high level of commitment from its members and will review a candidate's other commitments and service on other boards to ensure that the candidate has sufficient time to devote to us. In addition, non-employee directors may not serve on the boards of directors of more than four other publicly-traded companies. Moreover, directors are expected to act ethically at all times and adhere to our Code of Business Conduct of the Board of Directors. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board is currently led by Roger A. Krone as Chair and Robert S. Shapard as independent Lead Director. Our Board believes that it is in the best interests of stockholders for the Board to have the flexibility to determine the most qualified and appropriate individual to serve as Chair of the Board, whether that person is an independent director or the Chief Executive Officer. The Board selects the Chair annually and may decide to separate or combine the roles of Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, if appropriate, any time in the future. In cases where the Board determines it is in the best interests of our stockholders to combine the positions of Chair and Chief Executive Officer, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee nominates an independent director to serve as "Lead Director," who then must be approved by at least a majority of the independent directors. 
The Lead Director has specifically delineated duties, which include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     reviewing and approving meeting agendas and the annual schedule of meetings;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     providing input to the Chair on the quantity, quality and timeliness of information provided to the Board;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     calling and chairing all meetings of the independent directors and apprising the Chair of the issues considered, as  appropriate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     presiding, in the Chair's absence, at Board meetings and the annual meeting of stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     helping the Chair facilitate full and candid Board discussions, ensuring all directors express their views on key Board  matters and assisting the Board in achieving a consensus;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     being authorized to attend all committee meetings, as appropriate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     serving as the liaison between the independent directors and the Chair and Chief Executive Officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     being available for consultation and direct communication with significant stockholders and other interested parties, if  requested;  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Our Board is committed to strong corporate governance and believes that Board independence and oversight of management are effectively maintained through the Board's current composition, committee structure and the position of Lead Director. Currently, 12 of our 13 directors are "independent" as defined by the NYSE rules and our Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Board's Audit and Finance, Human Resources and Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees are each comprised entirely of independent directors. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
As part of its oversight function, the Board and its committees monitor risk as part of their regular deliberations throughout the year. When granting authority to management, approving strategies, making decisions and receiving management reports, the Board considers, among other things, the risks facing the company. The Board also oversees risk in particular areas through its committee structure. The Audit and Finance Committee evaluates the company's guidelines and policies regarding risk assessment and risk management, including risks related to internal control over financial reporting, the company's major financial risk exposures, including financial, capital investment and insurance risks, and information security and related risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee evaluates risks potentially arising from the company's human resources and compensation policies and practices. The Ethics and Corporate Responsibility Committee oversees risks associated with unethical conduct and political, social, environmental and reputational risks. The Classified Activities Oversight Committee oversees risks associated with the company's classified business activities and receives reports from management on particular classified projects involving significant performance, financial or reputational risks. Company management also maintains an Enterprise Risk Management Committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer and senior executives that, among other things, establishes the overall corporate risk strategy and ensures that policies, systems, processes and training are established to identify and address appropriate risk matters within the company. This management committee reports regularly to the Audit and Finance Committee, and annually to the full Board, on its activities and findings, highlighting the key risks we face and management's actions for managing those risks. 
Our full Board and our Board's Audit and Finance Committee are each involved in oversight of our management of cybersecurity risk. Information security is critical to maintaining the trust of our customers and business partners, and we are committed to protecting the security of our data and systems from potential breach. As a government contractor and a provider of information technology services, we are entrusted with highly sensitive information, and we are continuously exposed to unauthorized attempts to compromise this information through cyberattacks, insider threats and other information security threats. Management provides our Board and the Audit and Finance Committee with regular updates about our cybersecurity and related risk exposures, our policies and procedures to mitigate such exposures and the status of projects to strengthen our information security infrastructure and defend against and respond to threats. 
Board of Directors Meetings 
During fiscal 2018, the Board held eight meetings of the entire Board. The independent directors met seven times during the year, either in executive session of regular board meetings or in separate meetings. Mr. Shapard, the independent Lead Director, presides at all executive sessions of our independent directors as provided by our Corporate Governance Guidelines. During fiscal 2018, no director attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of the meetings of the Board and committees of the Board on which they served. In addition, all directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. It is our policy to encourage all directors to attend our annual meeting.

Director Nominations Process 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee utilizes a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for director. The Committee regularly assesses the Board's current and projected strengths and needs by, among other things, reviewing the Board's current profile, the criteria for board membership described in this proxy statement beginning on page 14 and our current and future needs. 
18    |    2019 Proxy Statement 
Corporate Governance 
When vacancies on the Board are anticipated or otherwise arise, the Committee prepares a target candidate profile and develops an initial list of director candidates identified by the current members of the Board, business contacts, community leaders and members of management. The Committee may also retain a professional search firm to assist in developing a list of qualified candidates. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would also consider any stockholder recommendations for director nominees that are properly received. The Committee then screens and evaluates the resulting slate of director candidates to identify those individuals who best fit the target candidate profile and Board membership criteria and provides the Board with its recommendations. The Board then considers the recommendations and votes on whether to nominate the director candidate for election by the stockholders at the annual meeting or to appoint the director candidate to fill a vacancy on the Board. 
Stockholder Recommendations and Nominations of Director Candidates 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers stockholder recommendations for candidates for the Board of Directors using the same criteria described above under "Corporate Governance—Criteria for Board Membership." The name of any recommended candidate for director, together with a brief biographical sketch, a document indicating the candidate's willingness to serve if elected, and evidence of the nominating stockholder's ownership of company stock must be sent to: Leidos Holdings, Inc., Office of the Corporate Secretary, 11951 Freedom Drive, Reston, Virginia 20190. 
Any stockholder may nominate a person for election as a director by complying with the procedures set forth in our bylaws. 
Mandatory Retirement Policy 
The Board has adopted a mandatory retirement age of 75 for non-employee directors. Employee directors are expected to retire from the Board upon their retirement or resignation as an employee of the company. It is the general policy of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee not to nominate candidates for re-election at any annual stockholder meeting to be held after he or she has attained the applicable retirement age. 
Director Compensation 
We use a combination of cash and stock-based incentives to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve as directors. In determining director compensation, we consider the significant amount of time required of our directors in fulfilling their duties, as well as the skill and expertise of our directors. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee periodically reviews director compensation with the assistance of independent compensation consultants and recommends to the Board the form and amount of compensation to be provided. The director compensation described below represents the total compensation received by our directors for their service as directors for both Leidos Holdings, Inc. and Leidos, Inc. 
The following is a summary of our annual compensation program for our non-employee directors, as paid for service in 2018: 
Cash Compensation 
Our directors receive an annual cash retainer of $115,000. The Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee receive an additional annual retainer of $25,000, and the chair of each other committee receive an additional annual retainer of $15,000. The independent Lead Director also receives an additional annual retainer of $30,000. These annual retainer amounts are prorated based on time served on the Board or in a committee Chair role during the year. We also reimburse our directors for expenses incurred while attending meetings or otherwise performing services as a director. We do not pay separate meeting fees. 
Equity Compensation 
Directors receive annual equity awards under our equity incentive plan. Each of our directors receives an annual equity award valued at approximately $150,000, two-thirds in the form of restricted stock units and one-third in the form of stock options. These equity awards vest on the earlier of one year from the date of grant or on the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders following the date of grant. If a director retires due to our mandatory retirement policy, the director's equity awards continue to vest as scheduled and options remain exercisable for the remainder of the option term.

Corporate Governance 
Deferral Plans 
The directors are eligible to defer all or any portion of their cash retainers or certain equity compensation into our Keystaff Deferral Plan or Key Executive Stock Deferral Plan, or both. These plans are described in further detail under the caption "Executive Compensation—Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" below. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines and Policies 
The Board believes that its members should acquire and hold shares of our stock in an amount that is meaningful and appropriate. To encourage directors to have a material investment in our stock, the Board has adopted stock ownership guidelines that call for directors to hold shares of our stock earned from their service on our Board until attaining stock ownership with a value of at least five times the amount of their annual cash retainer. All of our directors continue to observe this holding requirement. In addition to these ownership guidelines, our directors are also subject to policies that prohibit certain short-term or speculative transactions in our securities that we believe carry a greater risk of liability for insider trading violations or may create an appearance of impropriety. Our policy requires directors to obtain preclearance from our General Counsel for all transactions in our securities. 
The following table sets forth information regarding the compensation paid to our directors for service in fiscal 2018.

Related Party Transactions 
There were no transactions during fiscal 2018 in which any related party had a direct or indirect material interest. The Board has adopted written policies and procedures for the review and approval of transactions between us and certain "related parties," which are generally considered to be our directors and executive officers, nominees for director, holders of five percent or more of our outstanding capital stock and members of their immediate families. The Board has delegated to 
2019 Proxy Statement    |    21 
Corporate Governance the Ethics and Corporate Responsibility Committee the authority to review and approve the material terms of any proposed related party transaction. If a proposed related party transaction involves a non-employee director or nominee for election as a director and may be material to a consideration of that person's independence, the matter is also considered by the Chair of the Board and the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
In determining whether to approve or ratify a related party transaction, the Ethics and Corporate Responsibility Committee considers, among other factors it deems appropriate, the potential benefits to us, the impact on a director's or nominee's independence or an executive officer's relationship with or service to us, whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. In deciding to approve a transaction, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, impose such conditions as it deems appropriate on us or the related party. Any transactions involving the compensation of executive officers, however, are to be reviewed and approved by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee. If a related party transaction will be ongoing, the Ethics and Corporate Responsibility Committee may establish guidelines to be followed in our ongoing dealings with the related party. Thereafter, the Ethics and Corporate Responsibility Committee will review and assess ongoing relationships with the related party on at least an annual basis to determine whether they are in compliance with the Committee's guidelines and that the related party transaction remains appropriate. 
We engage in transactions and have relationships with many entities, including educational and professional organizations, in the ordinary course of our business. Some of our directors, executive officers or their immediate family members may be directors, officers, partners, employees or stockholders of these entities. We carry out transactions with these firms on customary terms. 
Communications with the Board of Directors 
Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with any of the independent directors, including Committee Chairs and the Lead Director, by using the following address: 
Leidos Holdings, Inc. 
Office of the Corporate Secretary 
11951 Freedom Drive 
Reston, Virginia 20190 
Each communication should specify the intended recipient(s). The Office of the Corporate Secretary will initially process the communications, summarize lengthy or repetitive communications and forward them to the applicable member(s) of the Board as appropriate. Communications may also be referred to other departments within the Company for action and resolution. The Company will refrain from forwarding to the Board any communication that it determines to be primarily commercial in nature, mass mailings, resumes or job inquiries, any communication that relates to an improper or irrelevant topic, or that requests general information about the Company.

Proposal 2 — Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
We are providing our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. 
We urge stockholders to read our Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A"), which describes in detail how we seek to closely align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our stockholders. As described in the CD&A, our compensation programs are designed to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     pay for performance by tying a substantial majority of an executive's compensation to the achievement of financial and  other performance measures that the Board believes promote the creation of long-term stockholder value and position the company for long-term success;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     provide the same types of benefits for executives as other employees, with no special or supplemental pension, health or  death benefits for executives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     target total direct compensation at approximately the median among companies with which we compete for executive talent;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     enable us to recover, or "clawback," incentive compensation if there is any material restatement of our financial  results or if an executive is involved in misconduct;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     require our executives to own a significant amount of our stock;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     avoid incentives that encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     compete effectively for talented executives who will contribute to our long-term success.  
[END TABLE]
The Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board believes that these programs and policies are effective in implementing our pay for performance philosophy and achieving its goals. This advisory stockholder vote, commonly known as "Say-on-Pay," gives you, as a stockholder, the opportunity to advise whether or not you approve of our executive compensation program and policies by voting on the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the CD&A, compensation tables and narrative discussion contained in the "Executive Compensation" section. 
The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the vote relates to the compensation of our named executive officers, as described in the CD&A and Executive Compensation sections of this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. The vote is advisory, which means that the vote is not binding on the company, our Board or the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board. Our Board values the opinions of our stockholders. To the extent there is any significant vote against our named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address the concerns of stockholders. 
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present or represented either in person or by proxy and entitled to vote is required to approve this proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted in evaluating the results of the vote. This advisory vote on executive compensation is non-binding on the Board. 
Shares of common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted as instructed. In the absence of specific instructions, properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted "FOR" the proposal. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement.

Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis, or CD&A, and the tables and narrative that follow provide important information about our executive compensation programs for the prior fiscal year. In this proxy statement, the term "named executive officers" refers to the following executive officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     Roger A. Krone—Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     James C. Reagan—Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

[END TABLE]
In this CD&A, the "Committee" refers to the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which is responsible for overseeing the compensation programs for all of our executives. 
Our executive compensation programs are designed to align the interests of senior management with stockholders by tying a significant portion of their potential compensation to the achievement of challenging financial performance goals, which include adjusted operating income, total backlog, days working capital, revenue and relative total shareholder return. A small portion is also contingent on personal and leadership goals. We believe these factors contribute to a top-tier workplace environment, improve our efficiency and effectiveness, help us to win key business opportunities and ultimately drive long-term value for stockholders.

Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
The chart below depicts each principal element of target compensation as a percentage of total direct compensation for each of our named executive officers for 2018. 
Business Performance Highlights for 2018 Relating to Pay 
Our business performance in 2018 was strong, meeting or exceeding our expectations in several respects and resulting in above-target payouts for our named executive officers under our annual cash incentive program. We ended the year with record total backlog, resulting in achievement of 116% of our backlog target. Successful management of our working capital resulted in achievement of 117% of our days working capital target, and we achieved 100% of our adjusted operating income goal. 
Compensation Decisions for Fiscal 2018 
Base Salary 
The Committee reviews executive officers' base salaries annually or at the time of promotion or a substantial change in responsibilities based on the criteria described above. For fiscal 2018, the Committee considered its independent consultant's analysis of salary levels for comparable positions in the compensation peer group based on proxy and survey data. Individual base salary amounts also reflect the Committee's judgment with respect to each executive officer's level of responsibility, individual performance, experience and other factors, including internal equity considerations, the individual's historical compensation and any retention concerns. 
At the beginning of 2018, the Committee approved increases in the base salaries for four of our five named executive officers in order to bring them closer to the market median of our compensation peer group.

Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
Annual Cash Incentive Awards for Fiscal 2018 
We provided annual cash incentive awards to executives for performance during fiscal 2018 based on the achievement of pre-established financial and personal performance goals and other relevant factors. 
Performance Measures and Weightings. Our annual cash incentive plan for fiscal 2018 was designed to incentivize and reward both company financial performance and individual contributions to enterprise goals. The intended purpose and relative weightings of the performance goals are shown below: 
Financial Performance Targets.Because our financial results are considered the most important factors in setting pay and are objectively measurable, we weight these metrics most heavily; financial goals represent 80% of the target opportunity under our annual cash incentive program. To the extent that performance for a financial metric is less than 80% of target (threshold performance) no bonus amount would be paid with respect to that metric. Maximum payout (150% of target) for each component is provided for performance at or above 125% of target. The Committee generally seeks to set financial performance goals for the annual cash incentive program at levels that reflect improvement over the prior year's results. For 2018, the Committee approved adjusted operating income and total backlog goals that targeted improvement over 2017 results. The 2018 average days working capital goal incorporated the expected impact of an internal financial systems integration project, which was expected to be disruptive to billing and collection processes for a period of time, and therefore impacted the 2018 goal. Additionally, 2017 actual days working capital results benefited from a material advance payment on one of our larger programs, which was considered non-recurring. Excluding these discrete items, the 2018 goal was also established to reflect improvement over 2017 results. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
($ in millions)      2018 Target         2017 Results% Change   
($ in millions)      2018 Target         2017 Results% Change   
 Total Backlog     $17,976        $17,476        3.0% 
 Average Days Working Capital (2)     35 days        32 days        (9.0)% 
[END TABLE]
Personal Goals. We believe that individual contributions towards other enterprise goals are responsible for the achievement of our financial goals over time. Accordingly, non-formulaic personal goals represent 20% of the target opportunity under our annual cash incentive program, in order to encourage individual efforts in an array of areas that we believe will ultimately lead to improved financial performance for the company. 
2019 Proxy Statement    |    27 
Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
Award Payout Ranges. Payout opportunities for our named executive officers for fiscal 2018 ranged from 80% to 150% of base salary rates. Potential for each financial goal ranged from 60% at threshold performance (paid only when at least 80% of the objective is achieved) to 150% at maximum performance (paid when 125% or more of the objective is achieved), with the payout for performance between these levels interpolated on a straight-line basis. In addition, failure to achieve threshold performance of at least 70% of our annual adjusted operating income goal for the fiscal year would result in no payout for the financial goals portion of the annual cash incentive. 
Annual Incentive Payout Determination for Fiscal 2018 
Financial Achievement Levels. The Committee established the performance targets for our annual cash incentive program at the beginning of the fiscal year. For our named executive officers the targeted enterprise financial performance and actual performance for fiscal 2018 were:

(1)  Adjusted Operating Income is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles  ("GAAP") in the United States. We believe that Adjusted Operating Income provides useful information to management and stockholders as it provides another measure of the company's profitability after adjusting for the impact of  discrete events. A reconciliation of Adjusted Operation Income to the most comparable GAAP measure is set forth below:

(2)  Average Days Working Capital measures the efficiency of our use of capital. A score below target is a positive result.

Personal Performance Results. In analyzing personal performance results, the Committee reviewed each individual's level of achievement and also considered input from the Chief Executive Officer—or the independent directors with respect to the Chief Executive Officer's performance. Any circumstance considered relevant by Committee members—or by the independent directors, or in the case of named executive officers other than the CEO, by the CEO—can be a factor in the determination, including the degree of success, the difficulty of achieving personal performance goals and his or her leadership behavior.

Total Executive Payouts. The chart below provides the target annual cash incentive amounts established for each named executive officer by the Committee, at the beginning of the year, as well as their actual payout amounts determined by the Committee at the end of the year. Because we surpassed the adjusted operating income goal threshold of 70% of target by achieving 100%, the Committee approved the payout of awards under the annual incentive plan. Actual payout amounts for fiscal year 2018 ranged between 115% and 121% of target. Information on all of the annual cash incentive payouts for fiscal 2018 is provided below:

[END TABLE]
Long-Term Incentive Award Grants in 2018 
Long-term incentive awards are granted to motivate future performance, create long-term alignment with stockholders, and for retention purposes. For fiscal 2018, each named executive officer received a mix of long-term incentive awards comprised of performance shares (50%), performance restricted stock units (30%) and stock options (20%). The grant date fair value of each award was determined based on market data and consideration of each executive officer's level of experience, position and responsibilities. We do not generally consider an executive officer's current stock holdings or outstanding awards in making annual grants. 
Performance Share Awards. For all of our named executive officers, 50% of the targeted total value of long-term incentive awards granted was in the form of three-year performance share awards. Shares are issued under those awards at the end of the three-year performance period (from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020 for awards granted in fiscal 2018) only to the extent that the company achieves three specific three-year financial performance goals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     50% of the award is tied to the achievement of relative total stockholder return goals, a measurement of growth in  stockholder value;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     25% of the award is tied to achievement of adjusted operating income goals that align with our growth strategy and  correlate to potential stockholder value; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     25% of the award is tied to achievement of revenue goals.  
[END TABLE]
Performance for each of these goals is measured on a cumulative basis over the total performance period rather than annually for each year of the performance period. 
PRSUs. Performance restricted stock units (PRSUs) comprise 30% of the targeted total value of long-term incentive awards granted to our named executive officers. PRSUs vest 25% each year on the anniversary of the grant date, but are forfeited if we fail to achieve a pre-established performance goal for the first year. The performance goal for fiscal 2018 was adjusted earnings per share of least $2.16. The Committee determined that this goal was met and therefore the PRSUs granted in fiscal 2018 will be eligible to vest over four years. 
Stock Options. The final 20% of targeted total long-term incentive award value granted to our named executive officers is in stock options. Stock options are an effective means of linking rewards to the creation of stockholder value over a longer term. We believe that stock options motivate our executives to build stockholder value because they may realize value only if our stock appreciates during the option term. The options vest 25% each year on the anniversary of the grant date and expire on the seventh anniversary of the grant date.

Performance Equity Vesting in 2018 
Determination of Performance Shares Earned for the 2016—2018 Performance Period. In December 2015, the Committee established the long-term performance goals for the performance share program measuring the three-year performance period covering fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The vesting and payout for these performance shares was contingent on the achievement of a relative total shareholder return metric (weighted 50%) and an adjusted operating income goal (weighted 50%), with both metrics measuring cumulative results over the three-year performance period. 
At its February 2019 meeting, the Committee approved a payout score of 106% for the 2016 through 2018 performance period. The tables below show the modified adjusted operating income goal at target and the actual results for the three-year performance period, as well as the relative total shareholder return goals and results:

Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
Other Benefits 
In addition to the elements of direct compensation described above, we also provide our executive officers with the following benefits: 
Health and Welfare Benefits 
Our executive officers are entitled to participate in all health and welfare plans that we generally offer to all of our eligible employees, which provide medical, dental, health, group term life insurance and disability benefits. We believe that these health and welfare benefits are reasonable in scope and amount and are of the kind typically offered by other companies against which we compete for executive talent. 
Retirement Benefits 
Our executive officers are entitled to participate in the same tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan that is generally available to all of our eligible employees, subject to certain limits on the amounts that each participant may contribute each year. We make matching contributions to eligible participants' retirement plan accounts based on a percentage of their "eligible compensation" under applicable rules. We believe that this retirement program assists our executives in saving for their retirement in a tax-effective manner. 
Deferred Compensation Plans 
To provide other tax-deferred means to save for retirement, we maintain certain deferred compensation plans that allow our named executive officers and other eligible participants to elect to defer all or a portion of any cash or certain equity incentive awards granted to them under our cash incentive or stock plans. In addition, we maintain a deferred compensation plan that allows our named executive officers and other eligible participants to elect to defer a portion of their eligible salary. The majority of current vested deferred balances under the plans will be paid upon retirement or termination or are held in specified date accounts, which pay out in the year specified by the participant, including years prior to termination. These plans are described in more detail under "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
Perquisites and Personal Benefits 
We generally do not provide perquisites and personal benefits to our executive officers that are not otherwise available to other employees. 
How We Determine Direct Compensation 
In determining the amounts of direct compensation (base salary, annual and long-term incentives) to be awarded to our executive officers, we considered the company's overall performance, the performance of operating units under the executive officer's management, individual performance as measured against performance goals and criteria, and competitive market data for our compensation peer group as well as third-party survey data for general industry and the technology industry. The Committee reviews and approves the amounts of direct compensation to be provided to our executive officers for each fiscal year. Executive officers do not propose their own compensation. 
At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Committee reviews and approves: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     the amount of base salary and target incentive opportunities to be provided for the upcoming year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     the payout range for the annual cash incentive awards that may be earned for the year and the performance goals and  criteria upon which the amounts of the awards will be determined;

  u     the mix and amount of long-term incentive awards (including performance share awards, PRSUs and stock options) to be  granted to our executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement    |    31 
Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
In approving payout ranges for our incentive programs, we determine the levels of performance that must be achieved in order to receive a threshold, target and maximum payout amount for each goal. Upon completion of each fiscal year, the Committee approves the payment, if any, of cash incentive awards and the number of performance shares, if any, that are earned based upon the achievement of the predetermined performance goals and criteria for the performance cycle just completed. 
Company and Operational Sector Performance 
Our overall enterprise performance (or a combination of company enterprise and business group performance for executive officers with operational responsibilities) determines the payout for 80% of the target amount of any annual cash incentive awards and for 100% of any performance share program awards and PRSUs . Payout amounts are principally determined based upon the company's or group's achievement of financial and operating objectives set at the beginning of the fiscal year, but the Committee retains the discretion to reduce the payouts when appropriate. The maximum score for performance on any of the financial metrics for the cash incentive awards and the performance share program awards is 150%. The earnings per share metric for the PRSUs is a hurdle that, when met, results only in continued vesting of the PRSUs; results for this metric do not result in an adjustment to the amount of the PRSUs. 
Individual Performance 
Individual performance is a factor in setting base salaries, and individual leadership behaviors and the achievement of personal goals determine 20% of the target amount of any annual cash incentive award to be paid upon completion of the fiscal year for all of our named executive officers. In determining base salaries, the Committee reviews a performance assessment for each of our executive officers, as well as compensation recommendations provided by the Chief Executive Officer for the other named executive officers. 
The Committee also considers market data and information provided by its independent compensation consultant. In addition, in determining annual incentive amounts, the Committee considers whether the executive officer has achieved predetermined personal goals applicable to his or her organization, and the way in which those personal goals were achieved, as demonstrated through leadership behaviors. 
Personal performance goals and leadership behaviors relate to ethics and integrity, maintaining a top-tier workplace environment, collaboration, customer satisfaction and retention, business development in strategic areas and other financial and operating goals as appropriate. For purposes of the 2018 annual cash incentive, personal performance is scored on a range from 0% to 200% with a threshold of 50%. Performance below threshold with respect to personal goals would result in no payout (0%) related to the portion of the cash incentive based on personal performance. Performance of between 50% and 200% with respect to these goals for 2018 would result in a payout that is interpolated linearly between the 50% and 200% payout opportunity. Performance above the 200% level would not result in any additional payout. For the 2019 annual cash incentive program, the Committee reduced the maximum adjustment factor from 200% to 150%. 
Assessing Chief Executive Officer Performance 
In determining compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, the Committee meets in executive session and evaluates his performance based on his achievement of performance objectives that were established and agreed upon at the beginning of the fiscal year. Formal input is received from the independent directors and senior management. The Committee also considers the Chief Executive Officer's general leadership contributions towards the company's performance, including financial and operating results, development and achievement of strategic objectives, progress in building capability among the senior management team and corporate governance leadership, as well as market data and information provided by the Committee's independent compensation consultant. The Committee determines the Chief Executive Officer's compensation and then reviews his evaluation and compensation with the Board's independent directors. The Lead Director and the Chair of the Committee then present the Committee's evaluation and compensation determination to the Chief Executive Officer.

Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
Comparable Market Compensation 
The Committee compares the amount of direct compensation that we provide to our executive officers to that provided by companies with whom we compete for executive talent in similar roles and with similar responsibilities. To assist with this effort, the Committee's independent compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook"), conducts an annual review and benchmarking analysis of each element of target total direct compensation (including salary, cash and equity incentives) provided to our executive officers. In December 2017, FW Cook compared the target compensation provided to members of senior management against that provided by other publicly traded engineering, information technology, consulting and defense companies, which we refer to as our "compensation peer group," as well as third-party survey data for general industry and the technology industry. 
Peer group companies are chosen for having a similar industry focus as ours and for competing with us for talent as well as business and stockholder investment. Furthermore, the compensation peer group is initially structured so that no company within the group has annual revenues smaller than 40% or greater than 250% of ours and a market capitalization within a reasonable range. 
Our compensation peer group is periodically reviewed and updated to ensure the companies in our peer group are strong business and talent competitors and are comparable in size. In September 2017, the Committee consulted with FW Cook and reviewed the compensation peer group to be used for setting fiscal 2018 target compensation. The Committee removed Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and added DXC Technologies and Huntington Ingalls lndustries. At the time the peer group for fiscal 2018 was approved, the company was at the 63rd percentile for revenue and the 41st percentile for market capitalization as compared to the new peer group.

[END TABLE]
The Committee considers market data and analysis when evaluating appropriate levels of target total direct compensation. To be competitive in the market for our executive-level talent, we generally: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     target overall compensation for our executive officers at the market median, although the actual cash paid and equity  incentive awards earned will vary based on actual financial and individual performance and may therefore generate compensation that is higher or lower than the market median; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     award higher levels of compensation, when appropriate, in recognition of the importance or uniqueness of the role of an  executive officer or to address retention concerns.  
[END TABLE]
Other Policies and Considerations 
Stockholder Advisory Vote 
At our last annual stockholders' meeting in May 2018, we held a non-binding stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, commonly referred to as a say-on-pay vote. Our stockholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 96% of stockholder votes cast in favor of our say-on-pay resolution. As we evaluated our compensation practices during fiscal 2018, we considered the support our stockholders expressed for our pay for performance compensation philosophy and that influenced our decision not to make any significant changes to our executive compensation programs this year. We continued to 
2019 Proxy Statement    |    33 
Compensation Discussion & Analysis emphasize short- and long-term incentive compensation, targeted at competitive market median levels, with a substantial majority of total compensation based on the achievement of financial performance goals designed to deliver value for our stockholders. 
At our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders expressed a preference for an annual non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation, in accordance with our Board's recommendation. Consistent with our stockholders' preference in this regard, we expect to continue holding an advisory stockholder vote on the compensation of our named executive officers each year. 
Assessment of Risks in Our Compensation Programs 
During fiscal 2018, management undertook a risk assessment of our compensation programs, which FW Cook, the Committee's independent compensation consultant, reviewed. In conducting the assessment, we reviewed our pay practices and incentive programs to identify any potential risks inherent in our compensation programs. We also reviewed the risks facing the company and evaluated whether our compensation practices and programs could be expected to increase or help mitigate these risks. The finding of the assessment, with which the Committee concurred, was that our compensation programs are effectively designed to help mitigate excessive risk-taking that could harm our value or reward poor judgment by our executives or other employees. The factors considered in reaching this conclusion include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     short-term incentive measures that are balanced among different financial measures, with targets that are intended to be  achievable upon realistic levels of performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     significant weighting towards long-term incentive compensation that promotes long-term decision-making and discourages  short-term risk-taking;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     maximum payouts that are capped at levels that do not reward excessive risk-taking;

  u     leadership behaviors, such as ethics and integrity, that are specifically addressed in our short-term incentive programs;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     our compensation recoupment policy that allows us to recover compensation based on financial results that are subsequently  restated or if fraud or intentional misconduct is involved; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     our stock ownership guidelines that encourage a long-term perspective.  
[END TABLE]
Equity Award Grant Practices 
The Committee is responsible for the administration of our equity incentive programs for the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan and 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan in which our named executive officers participate. The Committee set the equity award fiscal 2018 grant dates for new and existing employees, including executive officers, in December 2017. These grant dates were selected to occur after the dates when we anticipate releasing our annual and quarterly financial results. We generally grant equity incentive awards to our executive officers and all other eligible employees on an annual basis shortly after we announce our financial results for the recently completed fiscal year. In addition to these annual grants, the Committee set four quarterly dates on which any additional equity incentive awards could be made to eligible executive officers or other employees in connection with a new hire, a promotion, for retention or otherwise. 
The Committee approves all equity awards made to our directors and executive officers. The exercise price of any option grant is determined by reference to the fair market value of the shares on the grant date, which the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan and 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan defines as the closing sales price of our common stock on the NYSE on the previous trading day. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
We encourage our employees to own our stock so that they are motivated to maximize our long-term performance and stock value. Under our established stock ownership guidelines, our named executive officers are required to accumulate 
34    |    2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation Discussion & Analysis and maintain stock holdings in an amount of our stock with a value at least equal to five times their base salary. Because they must hold all after-tax shares acquired under our equity incentive programs until they meet this ownership requirement, which we expect will take several years, we do not have specific time-based holding periods following the exercise of stock options or vesting of other equity awards. 
Policy on Hedging and Short-Term or Speculative Transactions 
We have established policies applicable to all designated insiders under our Insider Trading Policy, including all of our executive officers, that prohibit certain short-term or speculative transactions in our securities. We believe that these prohibited transactions carry a greater risk of liability for insider trading violations and may create an appearance of impropriety. With respect to our securities, our executive officers and other designated insiders are prohibited from engaging in any short sales or any trading in puts, calls or other derivatives on an exchange or other organized market. They are also prohibited from engaging in hedging or other monetization transactions (such as cashless collars, forward contracts, equity swaps or similar transactions involving our securities, and from holding company securities in a margin account or pledging securities as collateral for a loan. In addition, our executive officers are required to obtain preclearance for all transactions in our securities. 
Compensation Recoupment Policy 
Under our compensation recoupment policy, the Committee may require members of senior management to return incentive compensation if there is a material restatement of the financial results upon which the incentive compensation was originally based. Our recoupment policy includes both cash and equity forms of incentive compensation. If the Committee determines that recovery is appropriate, the company will seek repayment of the difference between the incentive compensation paid and the incentive compensation that would have been paid, if any, based on the restated financial results. 
The policy also provides for recovery of incentive compensation from any employee involved in fraud or intentional misconduct, whether or not it results in a restatement of our financial results. In such a situation, the Committee would exercise its business judgment to determine what action it believes is appropriate under the circumstances. 
We may seek to recover the applicable amount of compensation from incentive compensation paid or awarded after the adoption of the policy, from future payments of incentive compensation, cancellation of outstanding equity awards and reduction in or cancellation of future equity awards. In cases of fraud or misconduct, we may also seek recovery from incentive compensation paid or awarded prior to the adoption of the policy. 
Post-Employment Benefits 
We do not maintain a defined benefit or other supplemental retirement plan that would entitle our executive officers to receive company-funded payments if they leave the company. 
Upon certain terminations of employment, including death, disability, retirement or a change in control, our named executive officers may be eligible for continued vesting of equity awards on the normal schedule or accelerated vesting in full or on a pro-rata basis, depending on the nature of event and the type of award. The purpose of these provisions is to protect previously earned or granted awards by making them available following the specified event. Because these termination provisions are contained in our standard award agreements for all recipients and relate to previously granted or earned awards, we do not consider these potential termination benefits as a separate item in compensation decisions for our named executive officers. Our long-term incentive plans do not provide for additional benefits or tax gross-ups. For more information about potential post-employment benefits, see "Executive Compensation—Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control." 
Potential Change in Control and Severance Benefits 
We have adopted a severance plan that would provide our executive officers with payments and benefits if their employment is involuntarily terminated by the company or is terminated following an acquisition of our company. These severance benefits are further described in this Proxy Statement under "Executive Compensation—Potential Payments 
2019 Proxy Statement    |    35 
Compensation Discussion & Analysis 
 Upon Termination or a Change in Control." We believe that our severance plan provides an important benefit to us by helping alleviate any concern the executive officers might have when contemplating a potential change in control of our company and permitting them to focus their attention on our business. In addition, we believe that this plan is an important recruiting and retention tool, as many of the companies with which we compete for talent have similar arrangements in place for their senior management. 
Our executive officers, other than Mr. Krone, are employees-at-will and as such do not have any employment agreements with us. Mr. Krone's employment agreement provides that if his employment is terminated by us for reasons other than cause or by Mr. Krone for good reason, he would receive an amount equal to one times the sum of his base salary and target bonus. Such payment will be subject to Mr. Krone's agreement to release us from any claims. However, if such termination is within three months prior to a change in control or within 24 months after a change in control, Mr. Krone would receive an amount equal to a maximum of two and one half times the sum of his base salary and target bonus and payment for certain benefits, depending on whether the termination occurs during a change in control period. The Committee approved these severance benefits after considering the potential costs, as an inducement for Mr. Krone to join the company. 
We have described the change in control and other termination benefits offered to Mr. Krone and our other named executive officers in the section entitled "Executive Compensation—Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control" in the tables following this CD&A. 
Tax Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, generally limits the deductibility of certain compensation in excess of $1 million paid in any one year to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the three other most highly compensated named executive officers. Prior to the amendment, qualified performance-based compensation was not subject to this deduction limit if certain requirements were met. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the performance-based exception has been repealed. The new rules generally apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, but do not apply to compensation provided pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 that is not modified in any material respect after that date. 
We do not expect the disallowance of a deduction for compensation paid to our named executive officers in excess of $1 million as a result of these changes to Section 162(m) to significantly alter our compensation programs. The Committee considers it important to design compensation programs that are in the best long-term interests of our company and our stockholders.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
We provided benefits to our named executive officers during fiscal 2018 under the following nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which are summarized below: 
The Leidos Keystaff Deferral Plan allows eligible participants to elect to defer all or a portion of salary and any cash bonus granted to them under our cash incentive plan. We make no contributions to participants' accounts under the Keystaff Deferral Plan. Participants can direct their deferrals into investment options similar to those available in the Leidos Retirement Plan other than the Leidos Stock Funds. Distributions under the Keystaff Deferral Plan are then made to participants in cash. Deferred balances under this plan will be paid upon the elected specified date, retirement or separation from service. 
The Leidos Key Executive Stock Deferral Plan allows eligible participants to elect to defer all or a portion of their cash or certain equity incentive awards granted to them under our cash incentive or stock incentive plans. Participant deferrals in other forms are converted to stock units of our common stock. Participant accounts are credited with additional units corresponding to their outstanding account balance for each company dividend payable. We make no contributions to participants' accounts under the Key Executive Stock Deferral Plan. Distributions under the Key Executive Stock Deferral Plan are then made to participants in shares of common stock corresponding to the number of vested stock units held for the participant. Vested deferred balances under this plan will be paid upon the elected specified date, or upon retirement or separation from service.

Executive Compensation 
The Leidos 401(k) Excess Deferral Plan (Excess Plan) is a pre-tax savings plan that, through December 31, 2016, allowed eligible participants to defer up to 20% of their eligible compensation after meeting the annual IRS contribution limit for the Leidos Retirement Plan. Bonuses were not eligible for deferral to the Excess Plan. The investment options in the Excess Plan are similar to those in the Leidos Retirement Plan but do not include the Leidos Stock Funds. Vested deferred balances under this plan will generally be paid following separation from service. 
The Leidos Deferred Compensation Plan for Former IS&GS Employees is a pre-tax savings plan that allowed eligible participants to defer salary and receive certain company contributions. Salary deferrals in this plan did not start until after an eligible participant met the annual IRS contribution limit for the Leidos Retirement Plan for Former IS&GS Employees. Bonuses were not eligible for deferral to this plan. The investment options in the Deferred Compensation Plan are similar to those in the Leidos Retirement Plan but do not include the Leidos Stock Funds. Deferred balances under this plan will generally be paid following separation from service.

Executive Compensation 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change in Control 
Roger A. Krone, Chief Executive Officer 
Mr. Krone's employment agreement would provide severance benefits to him if his employment is terminated by us for reasons other than for cause, or by Mr. Krone for good reason. However, if such termination is within three months prior to or within 24 months after a change in control of the company (the "change in control period"), Mr. Krone would receive a higher level of benefits. In addition, Mr. Krone would be entitled to receive certain benefits and outplacement services in the event of a qualifying termination under his employment agreement. Severance benefits under this agreement in connection with a Change in Control, or CIC, are "double trigger" and any payments under this agreement are subject to the recipient's execution of a general release in favor of the Company and its affiliates. Finally, pursuant to the terms of the equity awards Mr. Krone received under the Leidos 2006 Equity Incentive Plan and 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan ("Equity Plans") if Mr. Krone is terminated by us for reasons other than for cause, by him for good reason, or by reason of his death or disability, he would be entitled to accelerated vesting, or pro-rated vesting, of his long-term incentive awards, depending on whether the termination is during a change in control period. The chart below provides the amounts that Mr. Krone would be entitled to under these various termination scenarios.

Mr. Reagan, Mr. Scholl, Ms. Heise and Mr. Howe 
All of our executive officers, other than Mr. Krone, are covered by the Leidos Holdings, Inc. Executive Severance Plan, effective January 1, 2017 (the "Severance Plan"). 
The Severance Plan provides for the following in the event of a qualifying termination without Cause in the absence of a Change in Control or CIC: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
u     A cash lump sum severance benefit of 1.0 times base salary plus target bonus; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
u     Medical benefits equal to the cash value of premiums for 12 months.

Executive Compensation 
The Severance Plan is designed to provide severance benefits to executive officers in certain cases where they terminate involuntarily from employment not for cause, with a separate set of benefits for an involuntary termination not for cause or resignation for good reason that occurs within three months prior to or within 24 months following a CIC. Benefits under this plan in connection with a CIC are "double trigger" and any payments under this plan are subject to the recipient's execution of a general release in favor of the company and its affiliates. 
Following a CIC, our executive officers would also vest in their outstanding equity awards, if the CIC meets the definition in our Equity and Deferred Compensation Plans. Finally, pursuant to the terms of the equity awards they received under the Equity Plan, if they terminated employment involuntarily not for cause, or by reason of their death or disability, they would be entitled to accelerated vesting, or pro-rated vesting, of certain long-term incentive awards. The charts below provide the amounts that these executive officers would be entitled to under various termination scenarios.

Treatment of Equity Awards upon Termination 
With respect to outstanding equity awards, our executive officers are generally treated in the same way as all other employee award recipients if their employment is terminated due to death, disability, retirement, involuntary without cause departure, or voluntary departure. 
In the case of death or disability, restricted stock units and options will vest immediately and options will remain exercisable for the remaining term of the option. For our 2017 and earlier performance share award program, target shares will be paid out promptly on a pro-rata basis upon death and for 2018, target shares will be paid out promptly upon death. In the case of disability for all performance share awards, individuals will receive a pro-rata number of shares after the end of the applicable three-year performance period, based on actual company performance over the full period. 
Under our continued vesting program, employees who retire, including our executive officers, may continue holding and vesting in their stock options if they have held such options for at least 12 months prior to retirement and they retire (i) after age 59 1/2 with at least ten years of service or (ii) after age 59 1/2 when age at termination plus years of service equals at least 70. When an individual becomes eligible for continued vesting, restricted stock units will continue to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedule. Individuals meeting these qualifications who hold performance share awards will receive a pro-rata number of shares after the end of the applicable three-year performance period, based on actual company performance over the full period. We have the right to terminate continued vesting if an individual violates confidentiality, non-solicitation, non-compete, or similar obligations to us. 
In the case of involuntary termination without cause departure, all restricted stock units and stock options granted 2017 or later will vest on a pro-rata basis provided the award has been held for a minimum of six months. In the case of a performance share award granted prior to 2017, individuals will receive a pro-rata number of shares after the end of the applicable three-year performance period, based on actual company performance over the full period. For performance share awards granted in 2018, individuals will receive a pro-rata number of shares after the end of the applicable three-year performance period, based on actual company performance over the full period, provided the award has been held for a minimum of 6 months. 
In any other case, if the employment of an equity award recipient, including an executive officer, is terminated for any reason, all unvested restricted stock units, options and performance share awards are forfeited. Vested options remain exercisable for 90 days or until the option expiration date, if earlier.

Executive Compensation 
Pay Ratio Disclosure 
In accordance with the requirements of Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K (which we collectively refer to as the "Pay Ratio Rule"), we are providing the following estimated information for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
u     the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees (except our Chief Executive Officer) was $95,000;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
u     the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive officer was $9,834,974; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
u     the ratio of these two amounts was 104 to 1. We believe that this ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner  consistent with the requirements of the Pay Ratio Rule.  
[END TABLE]
SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and apply various assumptions and, as a result, the pay ratio reported by us may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies. 
Methodology for Identifying Our "Median Employee" 
Employee Population 
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than our Chief Executive Officer), we first identified our total employee population from which we determined our "median employee." We selected December 28, 2018, which is within the last three months of 2018, as the date upon which we would identify the "median employee." We determined that, as of December 28, 2018, our employee population consisted of 32,147 individuals (of which approximately 93% were located in the United States and 7% were located in jurisdictions outside the United States). Our employee population consisted of our global workforce of full-time, part-time, and temporary employees, as described in more detail below. 
Adjustments to Our Employee Population 
As permitted by the Pay Ratio Rule, we adjusted our total employee population (as described above) for purposes of identifying our "median employee" by excluding approximately 1,135 of our employees located in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States given the relatively small number of employees in those jurisdictions and the estimated costs of obtaining their compensation information, as follows: 1,070 employees from the United Kingdom; 14 employees from Israel; 2 employees from Singapore, 1 employee from South Korea, 21 employees from Canada and 27 employees from Saudi Arabia. 
After taking into account the above described adjustments to our employee population as permitted by the Pay Ratio Rule, our total adjusted employee population for purposes of determining our "median employee" consisted of approximately 31,012 individuals. 
Determining Our Median Employee 
To identify our "median employee" from our total adjusted employee population, we compared the annualized salary of our employees as reflected in our human resources system of record. We identified our "median employee" using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all our employees included in the calculation. After identifying the median employee, that employee's compensation was restated based on the Summary Compensation Table elements. Using the methodologies described above, we determined that our "median employee" was a full-time, salaried employee located in the United States with base wages for the 12-month period ending December 28, 2018 in the amount of $95,000. 
Determination of Annual Total Compensation of Our "Median Employee" and Our CEO 
Once we identified our "median employee", we then calculated such employee's annual total compensation for 2018 using the same methodology we used for purposes of determining the annual total compensation of our named executive officers for 2018 (as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in this Proxy Statement). 
Our CEO's annual total compensation for 2018 for purposes of the Pay Ratio Rule is equal to the amount reported in the "Total" column in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, adjusted, to the extent applicable, in a similar manner as the annual total compensation of our "median employee".

Proposal 3 — Stockholder Proposal: Simple Majority Vote 
Mr. John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Ave., No. 205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278, has notified Leidos that he intends to present the following proposal for consideration at the 2019 stockholders' meeting. In accordance with SEC rules, the proposal, along with the supporting statement of the stockholder proponent, is set forth below. Leidos is not responsible for the content of the proposal or supporting statement. Our Board of Directors opposes and unanimously recommends that you vote "AGAINST" the proposal for the reasons stated after the proposal. 
Stockholder Proposal 
RESOLVED, Shareholders request that our board take each step necessary so that each voting requirement in our charter and bylaws (that is explicit or implicit due to default to state law) that calls for a greater than simple majority vote be eliminated, and replaced by a requirement for a majority of the votes cast for and against applicable proposals, or a simple majority in compliance with applicable laws. If necessary this means the closest standard to a majority of the votes cast for and against such proposals consistent with applicable laws. 
Shareholders are willing to pay a premium for shares of companies that have excellent corporate governance. Supermajority voting requirements have been found to be one of 6 entrenching mechanisms that are negatively related to company performance according to "What Matters in Corporate Governance" by Lucien Bebchuk, Alma Cohen and Allen Ferrell of the Harvard Law School. Supermajority requirements are used to block initiatives supported by most shareowners but opposed by a status quo management. 
This proposal topic won from 74% to 88% support at Weyerhaeuser, Alcoa, Waste Management, Goldman Sachs, FirstEnergy, McGraw-Hill and Macy's. The proponents of these proposals included Ray T. Chevedden and William Steiner. The votes would have been higher than 74% to 88% if all shareholders had ready access to independent voting advice. 
Currently a 1%-minority can frustrate the will of our 66%-shareholder majority. In other words a 1%-minority could have the power to prevent shareholders from making an overdue change. This can be particularly important during periods of management underperformance and/or an economic downturn. 
Simple Majority Vote — Proposal 3 
Board Response 
Statement in Opposition to Stockholder Proposal to Change Certain Voting Requirements 
The Board has carefully considered the above proposal and believes it is not in the best interests of our stockholders. Consequently, the Board will oppose this proposal if it is properly presented at the 2019 annual meeting and recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal. 
Under our existing governance documents, a simple majority vote requirement already applies to most matters submitted for stockholder approval. However, our certificate of incorporation provides for more stringent voting requirements in certain limited circumstances, such as in the event of a change of control or with respect to amending certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, including the procedures for calling stockholder meetings, altering the size of the Board and removing directors. 
Our Board believes that the requirement of a supermajority vote for a limited number of fundamental matters serves important corporate governance objectives. These include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
u     Ensuring Broad Stockholder Consensus for Key Actions. The Board believes that  extraordinary transactions and fundamental changes to corporate governance should have the support of a broad consensus of our stockholders rather than just a simple majority. The Board also believes that the supermajority vote requirements protect  stockholders, particularly minority stockholders, from the potentially self-interested actions of short-term investors. Without these provisions, it would be possible for a group of short-term stockholders to approve an extraordinary transaction  that is not in the best interests of our company and opposed by nearly half of our stockholders. Targeted supermajority vote requirements, limited to a small number of critical matters, preserve and maximize long-term value for all stockholders.   
[END TABLE]
48    |    2019 Proxy Statement 
Proposal 3 — Stockholder Proposal: Simple Majority Vote 
[BEGIN TABLE]
u     Providing Protection Against Certain Takeovers. Our supermajority voting provisions  further protect our stockholders by encouraging persons or firms making unsolicited takeover proposals to negotiate directly with the Board, which provides the Board with increased leverage to maximize value for all stockholders. We believe that our  independent Board is in the best position to evaluate proposed offers, consider alternatives and protect stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
u     We are committed to a corporate governance structure that promotes stockholder rights and accountability. Consistent with  our current practice, our Board will continue to evaluate the future implementation of appropriate corporate governance changes. However, for the reasons discussed above, our Board does not believe it is in the best interests of our stockholders or  our company to implement the stockholder proposal's request for the lowest possible voting thresholds on all matters on which stockholders vote.  
[END TABLE]
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of common stock, present or represented and entitled to vote at the annual meeting is required to approve the proposal. Abstentions have the effect of a vote against the proposal, and broker "non-votes" have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. Shares of common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. In the absence of specific instructions, properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted "AGAINST" the proposal. The proposal is not binding on the Board or the Company. 
Recommendation of the Board 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal. 
2019 Proxy Statement    |    49 
Proposal 4 — Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending January 3, 2020. During the fiscal year ended December 28, 2018, Deloitte & Touche LLP served as our independent registered public accounting firm and also provided certain tax and other audit-related services as set forth under the caption "Audit Matters" below. Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP will be at the annual meeting to respond to appropriate questions and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. 
Stockholders are not required to ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. However, we are submitting the appointment for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit and Finance Committee will consider whether or not to retain Deloitte & Touche LLP. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit and Finance Committee may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in our stockholders' best interests. 
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of common stock, present or represented and entitled to vote at the annual meeting is required to approve the proposal. Abstentions have the effect of a vote against the proposal, and broker "non-votes" have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. Shares of common stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. In the absence of specific instructions, properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted "FOR" the proposal. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors recommends stockholders vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending January 3, 2020.

Audit Matters 
Audit and Finance Committee Report 
The Audit and Finance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of: (i) the integrity of the company's financial statements, including the financial reporting process, system of internal control over financial reporting and audit process; (ii) the company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (iii) the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence; (iv) the performance of the company's internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm; and (v) financial reporting risk assessment and mitigation. The Audit and Finance Committee's job is one of oversight and it recognizes that management is responsible for the preparation and certification of the company's financial statements and that the independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing those financial statements. 
The Audit and Finance Committee recognizes that financial management, including the internal audit staff, and the independent registered public accounting firm, have more time, knowledge, and detailed information on the company than do Audit and Finance Committee members. Consequently, in carrying out its oversight responsibilities, the Audit and Finance Committee is not providing any expert or special assurance as to the company's financial statements or any professional certification as to the independent registered public accounting firm's work. 
The duties and responsibilities of the Audit and Finance Committee have been set forth in a written charter since 1975. A copy of the current Audit and Finance Committee charter is available on the company's website at www.leidos.com by clicking on the links entitled "Corporate Governance" and then "Board Committees." Each member of the Audit and Finance Committee meets the independence and financial literacy requirements of the SEC and the NYSE. In addition, all of the Committee members qualify as audit committee financial experts under SEC rules. 
In the course of fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit and Finance Committee has: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     met with the internal auditor and the independent registered public accounting firm to discuss any matters that the  internal auditor, the independent registered public accounting firm or the Committee believed should be discussed privately without members of management present;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     met with management of the company to discuss any matters management or the Committee believed should be discussed  privately without the internal auditor or the independent registered public accounting firm present;  
[END TABLE]

  u     reviewed and discussed with management and Deloitte & Touche LLP, the company's independent registered public  accounting firm, the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2018;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board (PCAOB) Standards and Rule 2-07 of Regulation S-X (Communications with Audit Committees); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  u     received the written disclosures and the letter required by the applicable PCAOB Standard (Communication with Audit and  Finance Committees Concerning Independence).  
[END TABLE]
Based on the reviews and discussions summarized in this Report and subject to the limitations on our role and responsibilities referred to above and contained in the Audit and Finance Committee charter, the Audit and Finance Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the company's audited consolidated financial statements referred to above be included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

All of the fees set forth above were pre-approved by one of these means.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules of the SEC require our directors and executive officers to file reports of their ownership and changes in ownership of common stock with the SEC. Our personnel generally prepare and file these reports on the basis of information obtained from each director and officer and pursuant to a power of attorney. All of our directors and executive officers and, to our knowledge, beneficial owners of more than 10% of our common stock complied during fiscal 2018 with the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
Stockholder Proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting 
Any stockholder proposals intended to be presented at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders must be received by us no later than November 15, 2019 in order to be considered for inclusion in our Proxy Statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting. 
Our proxy access bylaws permit a stockholder or group of stockholders (up to 20) who have owned at least three percent of common stock for at least three years to submit director nominees for inclusion in our Proxy Statement if the nominating stockholder(s) satisfies the requirements specified in the bylaws. To be timely, the notice must be delivered to the Corporate Secretary not later than the close of business on the 120th day, nor earlier than the close of business on the 150th day, prior to the first anniversary of the date that the proxy statement for the annual meeting was sent to stockholders. In the event, however, that the annual meeting is not scheduled to be held within a period that begins 30 days before the first anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders and ends 30 days after the first anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders, then the notice of nomination must be provided by the later of the close of business on the date that is 180 days prior to the annual meeting or the tenth day following the date such annual meeting is first publicly announced or disclosed. Therefore, in connection with the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, notice must be delivered to the Corporate Secretary between October 16 and November 15, 2019. 
In addition, Sections 2.07 and 3.03 of our bylaws provides that, in order for a stockholder to propose any matter (including nominations for directors) for consideration at the annual meeting (other than by inclusion in the Proxy Statement), such stockholder must give timely notice to our Corporate Secretary of his or her intention to bring such business before the meeting. To be timely, notice must be delivered to the Corporate Secretary not later than the close of business on the 90th day, nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. In the event, however, that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by us, whichever occurs later. Therefore, in connection with the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, notice must be delivered to the Corporate Secretary between December 28, 2019 and January 27, 2020. 
Such stockholder's notice must include certain information about the stockholder and the underlying beneficial owner, if any, including his or her name, age, address, occupation, shares, rights to acquire shares, information about derivatives, hedges, short positions, understandings or agreements regarding the economic and voting interests of the stockholder and related persons with respect to our stock, if any, and such other information as would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of the proposed nominee. A stockholder's notice must be updated, if necessary, so that the information submitted is true and correct as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting.
