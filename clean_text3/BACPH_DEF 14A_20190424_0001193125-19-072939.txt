As we conclude two consecutive  years of record-breaking and devastating disasters that left communities shattered, the American Red Cross was there to provide food, shelter, relief supplies, emotional support, and long-term recovery planning to help communities devastated by six  major back-to-back hurricanes in the U.S. and certain U.S. territories, the most destructive wildfires in California history, six tragic shootings across the U.S., and more than 73,000 households affected by a home fire. As part of the world's  largest humanitarian network, the American Red Cross also provided humanitarian aid to more than 18 countries, including financial support, lifesaving supplies, and trained disaster responders.

OUR STOCKHOLDERS INFORM AND GUIDE ACHIEVEMENT OF GOVERNANCE OBJECTIVES 
Our investor relations and management regularly meet with investors, prospective investors, and investment analysts to discuss our business and strategy. Our Board and management also routinely engage with and listen to our stockholders. In addition to the investor relations meetings, throughout 2018 and into 2019, we provided direct updates about our Board and our company to stockholders and key stakeholders representing approximately 54% of our shares outstanding. Our Board and management met with stockholders and stakeholders representing approximately 35% of our shares outstanding to solicit their input on important governance, executive compensation, human capital management, regulatory, environmental, social, and other matters. This continued dialogue has informed our Board's meeting agendas, and contributes to governance enhancements that help us address the issues that matter most to stockholders and key stakeholders. This engagement process complements our Responsible Growth, and will assist us in achieving our strategic objectives, creating long-term value, maintaining our culture of compliance, and contributing to our environmental, social, and governance activities.

COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS 
Pay-for-Performance Compensation Philosophy 
Our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance over the long-term, as well as on an annual basis. Our performance considerations include both financial and non-financial measures—including the manner in which results are achieved. These considerations reinforce and promote Responsible Growth and maintain alignment with our risk framework. 
Our executive compensation program provides a mix of salary, incentives, and benefits paid over time to align executive officer and stockholder interests. A majority of total variable compensation granted to named executive officers is deferred equity-based awards, further encouraging long-term focus on generating sustainable growth.

These business practices enable us to address some of the key challenges facing the world today while  also creating business opportunities, allowing us to create shared success with our employees, clients, and communities around the world. 
      Responsible Growth means we must grow, no  excuses. We have to do it by focusing on delivering for clients within our risk parameters. And it must be sustainable.

Driving ESG Leadership 
Our ESG approach is integrated into each of our eight lines of business and helps define how we pursue growing business opportunities and manage risk. Our management-level ESG Committee is comprised of senior executives across every line of business and support function who help guide the company's efforts and enable ESG progress. The committee identifies and discusses ESG issues material to our business—including our human capital management practices, products and service offerings, client selection, and investments in creating a sustainable global economy. It helps set and monitor our progress against these ESG goals, reports regularly to our Board through the Corporate Governance Committee, and oversees disclosure to investors, stakeholders, and clients through annual ESG reporting in our Annual Report and on our company's website. 
In addition, the chair of our ESG Committee, Vice Chairman Anne Finucane, and her team engage with consumer advocates, community advisors, and other stakeholders for their advice and guidance in shaping our ESG policies and practices. In 2005, we founded our National Community Advisory Council, a forum for senior leaders from social justice, consumer advocacy, community development, environmental, research, and advocacy organizations, and senior executives meet with the council at least twice annually for external perspectives on our business policies, practices, and products. 
Being a Great Place to Work 
Another way we facilitate sustainable Responsible Growth is by being a great place to work. We do this by listening to our employees so that our programs and resources enhance their experience and further their careers with us. We deliver on our commitment to be a great place to work by being an inclusive workplace for our employees around the world, creating opportunities for employees to grow and develop, recognizing and rewarding performance, and supporting employees' physical, emotional and financial wellness. Through this lens, we provide compensation, benefits, and resources to employees that reflect our commitment to be a great place to work. This is not only the right thing to do, it is core to achieving Responsible Growth in a sustainable manner. 
Our focus on being a great place to work has been recognized across the world, including:

Our Board seeks directors whose complementary knowledge, experience, and skills provide a broad range of perspectives and leadership expertise in financial services and other global, highly complex and regulated industries, strategic planning and business development, business operations, marketing and distribution, technology/cybersecurity, risk management and financial controls, human capital management, corporate governance, and public policy, and other areas important to our company's strategy and oversight. Our Board also assesses directors' age and tenure, and Board continuity; it strives to achieve a balance between the perspectives of new directors and those of longer-serving directors with industry and institutional insights. 
Our Board views diversity as a priority and seeks representation across a range of attributes, including race, gender, ethnicity, and professional experience, and regularly assesses our Board's diversity when identifying and evaluating director candidates. In addition, our Corporate Governance Committee follows applicable regulations in confirming that our Board includes members who are independent, possess financial literacy and expertise, and an understanding of risk management principles, policies, and practices, and have experience in identifying, assessing, and managing risk exposures. 
Our current Board, comprised of the 16 director nominees, reflects the Board's commitment to identify, evaluate, and nominate candidates who possess personal qualities, qualifications, skills, and diversity of backgrounds, and provide a mix of tenures that, when taken together, best serve our company and our stockholders. See "Our Director Nominees" on page 5. 
Succession Planning and the Director Recruitment Process 
Our Board regularly reviews and renews its composition. Our Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and recommending director candidates to our Board for nomination using a director selection process that has been reviewed and acknowledged by our primary bank regulators. The Board, in coordination with the Corporate Governance Committee, also regularly considers Board leadership succession planning and committee membership. 
PROPOSAL 1: ELECTING DIRECTORS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Assess. The Committee regularly reviews our mix of individual directors on the Board to assess the overall Board composition. Among other  factors, the Committee considers our company's strategy and needs; our directors' experiences, gender, race, ethnicity, tenure, and age; and the attributes and qualifications our Board identifies in its self-evaluations to develop criteria  for potential candidates and whether these attributes and qualifications are additive to our overall Board composition.   To maintain a vibrant mixture of viewpoints and benefit from the fresh perspectives brought by new directors and the institutional knowledge and industry insights of  directors having longer experience on our Board, the Committee reviews measures that enhance the Board's refreshment process, including the appropriate retirement age and related tenure limitations, and ability to commit the time necessary to  our company. For additional information on the average tenure of directors serving on our Board and each director's tenure, see "Our Director Nominees" on page 5.     Identify. To drive effective Board renewal, refreshment, and Board leadership succession planning, the  Committee has a regularly recurring agenda item to develop and review a diverse group of potential director candidates. Based on the factors and criteria developed in the assessment phase, the Committee engages third-party search firms to identify  potential candidates for review. It considers and provides feedback on the then-current pool of director talent identified by search firms; and the search firms periodically update the lists of potential director candidates based on Committee and  Board input.   In 2018, the Committee continued to develop the pool of potential director  candidates using two external search firms. In its work with the external search firms, the Committee emphasizes the importance of diversity in its consideration of director candidates. Potential director candidates possess professional experiences  and the gender, racial, and ethnic diversity aligned with Committee-specified criteria and with the qualities identified by our Board in recent self-evaluations. See "Board Evaluation" on page 19 for additional information on our  Board's self-evaluation process. The Committee also considers candidates proposed by management and our stockholders.   Dr. Rose, a director on our Board from 2013 to 2015, was identified by the Chairman of the Board, reviewed by an external search firm for inclusion in the pool of  potential director candidates, and appointed to the Board following Committee evaluation and nomination. He did not stand for reelection at the 2015 annual meeting in order to focus his time on his then-new  position as President of Bowdoin College.      Evaluate. The Committee has an established process for evaluating director candidates that it follows regardless of who recommends the candidate  for consideration. During this process, the Committee reviews available information regarding each candidate, including qualifications, experience, skills, and integrity, as well as race, gender, and ethnicity. The Committee also reviews the  candidate's independence, absence of conflicts, and any reputational risks.   Our  Board understands the significant time commitment involved in serving on the Board and its committees. The Committee evaluates whether candidates and serving directors are able to devote the time necessary to discharge their duties as directors,  taking into account primary occupations, memberships on other boards, and other responsibilities. Prior to the annual renomination of currently serving directors, the Committee also assesses these factors. Once elected, directors are expected to  seek Committee approval prior to joining the board of another public company. Directors who change principal occupations must offer to resign from the Board, subject to further evaluation by the Committee and the Lead Independent Director.              Director Commitment   Our Corporate Governance Committee and Board nominate only candidates who they believe are capable of devoting the necessary time to discharge their  duties, taking into account principal occupations, memberships on other boards, attendance at Board and committee meetings, and other responsibilities. Our Corporate Governance Committee assesses directors' time commitment to the Board  throughout the year, including through the annual formal self-evaluation process.   Through our Corporate Governance Committee, the Board regularly reviews and closely monitors stockholders' views on the appropriate number of  public company boards on which directors may serve. The Committee considers: the proxy voting guidelines of our major stockholders; input from our stockholders during our engagement discussions; voting policies of the major proxy advisory firms;  corporate governance guidelines adopted by other public companies; board trends at peer and other significant public companies; and advice from outside advisors. In 2016, at the Committee's recommendation, our Board amended the Corporate  Governance Guidelines to reduce the maximum number of public company boards on which a director on our Board may serve from six to four public companies (including our Board), and to specify that any public company chief executive officer who serves  as a director on our Board may not serve on the boards of more than three public companies (including our Board). All of our directors and director nominees comply with this policy.     
     Assess. The Committee regularly reviews our mix of individual directors on the Board to assess the overall Board composition. Among other  factors, the Committee considers our company's strategy and needs; our directors' experiences, gender, race, ethnicity, tenure, and age; and the attributes and qualifications our Board identifies in its self-evaluations to develop criteria  for potential candidates and whether these attributes and qualifications are additive to our overall Board composition.

In 2018, the Committee continued to develop the pool of potential director  candidates using two external search firms. In its work with the external search firms, the Committee emphasizes the importance of diversity in its consideration of director candidates. Potential director candidates possess professional experiences  and the gender, racial, and ethnic diversity aligned with Committee-specified criteria and with the qualities identified by our Board in recent self-evaluations. See "Board Evaluation" on page 19 for additional information on our  Board's self-evaluation process. The Committee also considers candidates proposed by management and our stockholders.   Dr. Rose, a director on our Board from 2013 to 2015, was identified by the Chairman of the Board, reviewed by an external search firm for inclusion in the pool of  potential director candidates, and appointed to the Board following Committee evaluation and nomination. He did not stand for reelection at the 2015 annual meeting in order to focus his time on his then-new  position as President of Bowdoin College.      Evaluate. The Committee has an established process for evaluating director candidates that it follows regardless of who recommends the candidate  for consideration. During this process, the Committee reviews available information regarding each candidate, including qualifications, experience, skills, and integrity, as well as race, gender, and ethnicity. The Committee also reviews the  candidate's independence, absence of conflicts, and any reputational risks.   Our  Board understands the significant time commitment involved in serving on the Board and its committees. The Committee evaluates whether candidates and serving directors are able to devote the time necessary to discharge their duties as directors,  taking into account primary occupations, memberships on other boards, and other responsibilities. Prior to the annual renomination of currently serving directors, the Committee also assesses these factors. Once elected, directors are expected to  seek Committee approval prior to joining the board of another public company. Directors who change principal occupations must offer to resign from the Board, subject to further evaluation by the Committee and the Lead Independent Director.              Director Commitment   Our Corporate Governance Committee and Board nominate only candidates who they believe are capable of devoting the necessary time to discharge their  duties, taking into account principal occupations, memberships on other boards, attendance at Board and committee meetings, and other responsibilities. Our Corporate Governance Committee assesses directors' time commitment to the Board  throughout the year, including through the annual formal self-evaluation process.   Through our Corporate Governance Committee, the Board regularly reviews and closely monitors stockholders' views on the appropriate number of  public company boards on which directors may serve. The Committee considers: the proxy voting guidelines of our major stockholders; input from our stockholders during our engagement discussions; voting policies of the major proxy advisory firms;  corporate governance guidelines adopted by other public companies; board trends at peer and other significant public companies; and advice from outside advisors. In 2016, at the Committee's recommendation, our Board amended the Corporate  Governance Guidelines to reduce the maximum number of public company boards on which a director on our Board may serve from six to four public companies (including our Board), and to specify that any public company chief executive officer who serves  as a director on our Board may not serve on the boards of more than three public companies (including our Board). All of our directors and director nominees comply with this policy.     
     Assess. The Committee regularly reviews our mix of individual directors on the Board to assess the overall Board composition. Among other  factors, the Committee considers our company's strategy and needs; our directors' experiences, gender, race, ethnicity, tenure, and age; and the attributes and qualifications our Board identifies in its self-evaluations to develop criteria  for potential candidates and whether these attributes and qualifications are additive to our overall Board composition.   To maintain a vibrant mixture of viewpoints and benefit from the fresh perspectives brought by new directors and the institutional knowledge and industry insights of  directors having longer experience on our Board, the Committee reviews measures that enhance the Board's refreshment process, including the appropriate retirement age and related tenure limitations, and ability to commit the time necessary to  our company. For additional information on the average tenure of directors serving on our Board and each director's tenure, see "Our Director Nominees" on page 5.     Identify.

The Committee considers: the proxy voting guidelines of our major stockholders; input from our stockholders during our engagement discussions; voting policies of the major proxy advisory firms;  corporate governance guidelines adopted by other public companies; board trends at peer and other significant public companies; and advice from outside advisors. In 2016, at the Committee's recommendation, our Board amended the Corporate  Governance Guidelines to reduce the maximum number of public company boards on which a director on our Board may serve from six to four public companies (including our Board), and to specify that any public company chief executive officer who serves  as a director on our Board may not serve on the boards of more than three public companies (including our Board). All of our directors and director nominees comply with this policy.     
     Assess. The Committee regularly reviews our mix of individual directors on the Board to assess the overall Board composition. Among other  factors, the Committee considers our company's strategy and needs; our directors' experiences, gender, race, ethnicity, tenure, and age; and the attributes and qualifications our Board identifies in its self-evaluations to develop criteria  for potential candidates and whether these attributes and qualifications are additive to our overall Board composition.   To maintain a vibrant mixture of viewpoints and benefit from the fresh perspectives brought by new directors and the institutional knowledge and industry insights of  directors having longer experience on our Board, the Committee reviews measures that enhance the Board's refreshment process, including the appropriate retirement age and related tenure limitations, and ability to commit the time necessary to  our company. For additional information on the average tenure of directors serving on our Board and each director's tenure, see "Our Director Nominees" on page 5.     Identify. To drive effective Board renewal, refreshment, and Board leadership succession planning, the  Committee has a regularly recurring agenda item to develop and review a diverse group of potential director candidates. Based on the factors and criteria developed in the assessment phase, the Committee engages third-party search firms to identify  potential candidates for review. It considers and provides feedback on the then-current pool of director talent identified by search firms; and the search firms periodically update the lists of potential director candidates based on Committee and  Board input.   In 2018, the Committee continued to develop the pool of potential director  candidates using two external search firms. In its work with the external search firms, the Committee emphasizes the importance of diversity in its consideration of director candidates. Potential director candidates possess professional experiences  and the gender, racial, and ethnic diversity aligned with Committee-specified criteria and with the qualities identified by our Board in recent self-evaluations. See "Board Evaluation" on page 19 for additional information on our  Board's self-evaluation process. The Committee also considers candidates proposed by management and our stockholders.   Dr. Rose, a director on our Board from 2013 to 2015, was identified by the Chairman of the Board, reviewed by an external search firm for inclusion in the pool of  potential director candidates, and appointed to the Board following Committee evaluation and nomination. He did not stand for reelection at the 2015 annual meeting in order to focus his time on his then-new  position as President of Bowdoin College.      Evaluate. The Committee has an established process for evaluating director candidates that it follows regardless of who recommends the candidate  for consideration. During this process, the Committee reviews available information regarding each candidate, including qualifications, experience, skills, and integrity, as well as race, gender, and ethnicity. The Committee also reviews the  candidate's independence, absence of conflicts, and any reputational risks.   Our  Board understands the significant time commitment involved in serving on the Board and its committees. The Committee evaluates whether candidates and serving directors are able to devote the time necessary to discharge their duties as directors,  taking into account primary occupations, memberships on other boards, and other responsibilities. Prior to the annual renomination of currently serving directors, the Committee also assesses these factors. Once elected, directors are expected to  seek Committee approval prior to joining the board of another public company. Directors who change principal occupations must offer to resign from the Board, subject to further evaluation by the Committee and the Lead Independent Director.              Director Commitment   Our Corporate Governance Committee and Board nominate only candidates who they believe are capable of devoting the necessary time to discharge their  duties, taking into account principal occupations, memberships on other boards, attendance at Board and committee meetings, and other responsibilities. Our Corporate Governance Committee assesses directors' time commitment to the Board  throughout the year, including through the annual formal self-evaluation process.

Our Board of Directors 
Our Board and its committees oversee: 
Our Board and its committees are also responsible for: 
Director Independence 
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards require a majority of our directors and each member of our Audit, Compensation and Benefits, and Corporate Governance Committees to be independent. The Federal Reserve Board's Enhanced Prudential Standards require the chair of our Enterprise Risk Committee to be independent. In addition, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require a substantial majority of our directors to be independent. Our Board has adopted Director Independence Categorical Standards (Categorical Standards), published on our website at http://investor.bankofamerica.com, to assist it in determining each director's independence. Our Board considers a director or director nominee "independent" if he or she meets the criteria for independence in both the NYSE listing standards and our Categorical Standards. 
In early 2019, our Board, in coordination with our Corporate Governance Committee, evaluated the relevant relationships between each director/director nominee (and his or her immediate family members and affiliates) and Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries and affirmatively determined that all of our directors/director nominees are independent, except for Mr. Moynihan due to his employment by our company. Specifically, the following 15 of our 16 directors/director nominees are independent under the NYSE listing standards and our Categorical Standards: Ms. Allen, Ms. Bies, Mr. Bovender, Mr. Bramble, Mr. de Weck, Mr. Donald, Ms. Hudson, Ms. Lozano, Mr. May, Mr. Nowell, Dr. Rose, Mr. White, Mr. Woods, Mr. Yost, and Dr. Zuber. 
In making its independence determinations, our Board considered the following ordinary course, non-preferential relationships that existed during the preceding three years and those transactions reported under "Related Person and Certain Other Transactions" on page 36, and determined that none of the relationships constituted a material relationship between the director/director nominee and our company: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Our company or its subsidiaries provided ordinary course financial products and services to all of our directors/director  nominees. Our company or its subsidiaries also provided ordinary course financial products and services to some of these directors/director nominees immediate family members and entities affiliated with some of our directors/director  nominees or their immediate family members (Mr. de Weck, Mr. Donald, Mr. May, and Dr. Rose). In each case, the fees we received for these products and services were below the thresholds of the NYSE listing standards and our  Categorical Standards, and, where applicable, were less than 2% of the consolidated gross annual revenues of our company and of the other entity.

[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Our company or its subsidiaries purchased products or services in the ordinary course from entities where some of our  directors/director nominees are executive officers or employees or their immediate family members serve or served in the past three years as executive officers (Mr. Donald, Mr. May, Dr. Rose, and Mr. Woods). In each case, the  fees paid to each of these entities were below the thresholds of the NYSE listing standards and our Categorical Standards.

Independent Board Leadership 
Our Board is committed to objective, independent leadership for our Board and each of its committees. Our Board views the active, objective, independent oversight of management as central to effective Board governance, to serving the best interests of our company and our stockholders, and to executing our strategic objectives and creating long-term value. This commitment is reflected in our company's governing documents, including our Bylaws, our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and the governing documents of each of the Board's committees. 
Our Board believes that its optimal leadership structure may change over time to reflect our company's evolving needs, strategy, and operating environment; changes in our Board's composition and leadership needs; and other factors, including the perspectives of stockholders and other stakeholders. In accordance with a 2014 amendment to our Bylaws, which our stockholders ratified at a special meeting in 2015, our Board has the flexibility to determine the Board leadership structure best suited to the needs and circumstances of our company and our Board. At each of our 2017 and 2018 annual meetings of stockholders, our stockholders reaffirmed their support for allowing this flexibility by voting over two-thirds of votes cast against stockholder proposals seeking Bylaw amendments requiring an independent Chairman.      
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Under  our Board's current leadership structure, we have a Chairman and a Lead Independent Director. Our Lead Independent Director is empowered with, and exercises, robust, well-defined duties. Our Board is composed of experienced and committed  independent directors (with all non-management nominees being independent), and our Board committees have objective, experienced chairs and members. Our Board is committed to engaging with stockholders and  other stakeholders. All directors are required to stand for election annually.   Our Board  believes that these factors, taken together, provide for objective, independent Board leadership, effective engagement with and oversight of management, and a voice independent from management and accountable to stockholders and other  stakeholders.

Periodic Review of Board Leadership Structure 
At least annually, our Board, in coordination with our Corporate Governance Committee, deliberates on and discusses the appropriate Board leadership structure, including the considerations described above. Based on that assessment and on input from stockholders, our Board believes that the existing structure, with Mr. Moynihan as Chairman and Mr. Bovender as Lead Independent Director, continues to be the optimal leadership framework at this time. As a highly regulated global financial services company, we and our stockholders benefit from an executive Chairman with deep experience and leadership in and knowledge of the financial services industry, our company, its businesses, and our focus on Responsible Growth, and a strong, active Lead Independent Director who exercises robust, well-defined duties. Our Lead Independent Director, together with the other independent directors, exemplifies objective independent Board leadership, and effectively engages and oversees management. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   The  Board believes in having a Lead Independent Director who is empowered with robust, well-defined duties. The Lead Independent Director is joined by experienced, independent Board members and a Chairman who, as CEO, serves as the primary voice to  articulate our long-term strategy and our Responsible Growth. The independent directors provide objective oversight of management, review the CEO's performance and approve CEO compensation, help to establish the long-term strategy and regularly  assess its effectiveness, and serve the best interests of our company and our stockholders by overseeing management's work to create long-term value.

In 2017, our Board updated our Corporate Governance Guidelines to include an emergency succession plan for our Lead Independent Director and Board Chairman that provides for an orderly, interim succession process in the event of extraordinary circumstances. In addition, our Corporate Governance Committee has a process for implementing an orderly independent Director leadership transition for our Lead Independent Director.

Board Evaluation 
Our Board and our Board's Audit, Compensation and Benefits, Corporate Governance, and Enterprise Risk Committees continuously evaluate their own effectiveness throughout the year. The evaluation is a multi-faceted process that includes quarterly one-on-one discussions with our Lead Independent Director, individual director input on Board and Committee meeting topical agenda subjects, executive sessions without management present, periodic input to our CEO and senior management on topical agendas and enhancements to Board and committee effectiveness, and an annual formal self-evaluation developed and administered under the direction of the Corporate Governance Committee. 
One-on-One Discussions with the Lead Independent Director 
In addition to the formal annual Board and committee evaluation process, our Lead Independent Director speaks with each Board member at least quarterly, and receives input regarding Board and committee practices and management oversight. Throughout the year, committee members also have the opportunity to provide input directly to committee chairs or to management.

Composition. Through the self-evaluation process, our Board identifies qualities, relevant skills, and experience of potential director candidates that are consistent with the company's current strategy, and that would add to the Board's diversity. 
Board Culture. Our Board considers its role in setting the standard for the company's culture and values by forging a collegial and collaborative dynamic that values independent judgment and emphasizes accountability. As part of this review, our Board evaluates its working relationship with management, including the importance of challenging and holding management accountable, and its processes of seeking stockholder and stakeholder input. 
Focus. Our Board and committees consider their critical oversight responsibilities, including risk, strategy, and succession planning. Risk focused meetings cover a range of topics—both ongoing considerations relating to the seven key risk types identified in our Risk Framework, and emerging risks in areas including cyber and information security, macroeconomic trends, and geopolitics. Our Board continues to engage in dialogue and solicit feedback from management, stockholders, and stakeholders, and receive third-party perspectives on the competitive environment and opportunities for growth. 
Process. As part of the self-evaluation process, directors review overall Board and committee structure, meeting materials, agenda topics, and other meeting processes. Each of our directors meets with management and with our Lead Independent Director through a combination of executive sessions, smaller group sessions, and one-on-one meetings. Board and committee meetings are structured to allow ample time for discussion, debate, and in-depth review of key topics and trends. 
Information and Resources. Through the self-evaluation process, our Board continues to highlight the need for clear, comprehensive, and concise information to effectively support its oversight responsibilities. In particular, directors have highlighted the importance of well-organized, streamlined, and accessible materials that identify key issues in a timely manner. 
Enhancements Made in Response to Formal Board Self-Evaluations

Director Education 
Our Board believes that director education is vital to the ability of directors to fulfill their roles, and supports Board members in their continuous learning. The Board encourages directors to participate annually in external continuing director education programs, and our company reimburses directors for their expenses associated with this participation. Our directors also attend forums and conferences convened by our primary banking regulators. Continuing director education is also provided during Board meetings and other Board discussions as part of the formal meetings, and as stand-alone information sessions outside of meetings. Among other topics, during 2018, our Board heard from our primary banking regulators; third-party advisors on topics including the impact of geopolitics and macroeconomic trends, governance matters, ESG capital deployment projects, and regulatory developments; and from management on numerous subjects, including learnings from our stockholder engagement activities, stockholder activism, economic updates, regulatory developments, lending technologies, payment systems, and cybersecurity. 
All new directors also participate in our director orientation program during their first six months on our Board. New directors have a series of meetings over time with management representatives from all of our business and staff areas to review and discuss, with increasing detail, information about our company, industry, and regulatory framework. Based on input from our directors, we believe this gradual on-boarding approach over the first six months of Board service, coupled with participation in regular Board and committee meetings, provides new directors with a strong foundation in our company's businesses, connects directors with members of management with whom they will interact and oversee, and accelerates their effectiveness to engage fully in Board deliberations. Directors have access to additional orientation and educational opportunities upon acceptance of new or additional responsibilities on the Board and in committees. 
Board Meetings, Committee Membership, and Attendance 
Directors are expected to attend our annual meetings of stockholders and our Board and committee meetings. Each of our incumbent directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate meetings of our Board and the committees on which they served during 2018. In addition, with the exception of Mr. de Weck, all of the directors serving on our Board at the time of our 2018 annual meeting attended the meeting. 
Our independent directors meet privately in executive session without our Chairman and CEO or other members of management present at each regularly scheduled Board meeting and held 13 such executive sessions in 2018. Our Lead Independent Director leads these Board executive sessions. 
Our Board has five committees. Charters describing the responsibilities of each of the Audit, Compensation and Benefits, Corporate Governance, and Enterprise Risk Committees can be found at http://investor.bankofamerica.com, and their membership is set forth on page 2. Our Board's fifth committee, the Corporate Development Committee, was formed by our Board in 2013 as the result of a litigation settlement to oversee certain transactions. (1)

CEO and Senior Management Succession Planning 
Our Board oversees CEO and senior management succession planning, which is formally reviewed at least annually; two such planning sessions were held in 2018. Our CEO and our Chief Human Resources Officer provide our Board with recommendations and evaluations of potential CEO successors, and review their development plans. Our Board reviews potential internal senior management candidates with our CEO and our Chief Human Resources Officer, including the qualifications, experience, and development priorities for these individuals. Directors engage with potential CEO and senior management successors at Board and committee meetings and in less formal settings to allow directors to personally assess candidates. Further, our Board periodically reviews the overall composition of our senior management's qualifications, tenure, and experience. 
Our Board also establishes steps to address emergency CEO and senior management succession planning in extraordinary circumstances. Our emergency CEO succession planning is intended to enable our company to respond to unexpected position vacancies, including those resulting from a major catastrophe, by continuing our company's safe and sound operation and minimizing potential disruption or loss of continuity to our company's business and operations. 
Board Oversight of Risk 
At Bank of America, we are guided by a common purpose to make financial lives better by connecting those we serve with the resources they need to be successful. Our purpose and values form the foundation of our culture—a culture that is rooted in accountability, disciplined risk management, and delivering together as a team to better serve our clients, strengthen our communities, and deliver value to our stockholders. This all comes together as an engine for sustainable Responsible Growth. Our culture comes from how we run the company every day, by acting responsibly and managing risk well, which includes our commitments to ethical behavior, acting with integrity, and complying with laws, rules, regulations, and policies that reinforce such behavior. Managing risk is central to everything we do. Our success relies on the intellectual curiosity and sound judgment of every employee across the company. 
Conduct and Culture 
Our Board and its committees play a key role in oversight of our culture, setting the "tone at the top" and holding management accountable for its maintenance of high ethical standards and effective policies and practices to protect our reputation, assets, and business. Our Board and its committees do this in a number of ways, including by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    focusing on the character, integrity, and qualifications of their respective members, and their respective leadership  structures and composition;    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    overseeing managements identification, measurement, monitoring, and control of our material risks, including  compliance risk and conduct risk;    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    regularly requesting and receiving briefings from senior management on matters relating to compliance and business conduct  risk;    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    holding management accountable for the timely escalation of issues for review with the Board and its committees; and

Our Risk Governance Documents 
Risk is inherent in all of our business activities. One of the tenets of Responsible Growth is "we must grow within our risk framework." We execute on that strategy through our commitment to responsible and rigorous risk management and through a comprehensive approach with a defined Risk Framework and a well-articulated Risk Appetite Statement. The Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement are regularly reviewed with an eye towards enhancements and improvements. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities, and accountability for the management of risk and describes how our Board oversees the establishment of our risk appetite and of both quantitative limits and qualitative statements and objectives for our activities. This framework of objective, independent Board oversight and management's robust risk management better enables us to serve our customers, deliver long-term value for our stockholders, and achieve our strategic objectives. 
Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for consistent and effective risk management. It outlines the seven types of risk that our company faces: strategic risk; credit risk; market risk; liquidity risk; operational risk (including model, conduct, and cyber risk); compliance risk; and reputational risk. It describes components of our risk management approach, including our culture of managing risk well, risk appetite, and risk management processes, with a focus on the role of all employees in managing risk. It also outlines our risk management governance structure, including the roles of our Board, management, lines of business, independent risk management, and corporate audit within the governance structure. 
Our Risk Appetite Statement defines the aggregate levels and types of risk our Board and management believe appropriate to achieve our company's strategic objectives and business plans.

Our Risk Governance Structure 
Our directors bring relevant risk management oversight experience; see "Our Director Nominees" on page 5. Our Chief Risk Officer, the company's senior-most risk manager, reports jointly to the CEO and Enterprise Risk Committee, and participates in Board and Enterprise Risk Committee meetings. This governance structure is designed to complement our Board's commitment to maintaining an objective, independent Board and committee leadership structure, and to fostering integrity over risk management throughout our company and further demonstrates our commitment to a strong culture of compliance, governance, and ethical conduct. 
We believe our holistic, ongoing Board and committee risk oversight process provides the foundation for consistent and effective management of risks facing our company and demonstrates our commitment to a culture of rigorous risk management and compliance. Details of our company's risk management policies and practices are described in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2018 Annual Report.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Compensation Governance 
Our Compensation and Benefits Committee follows procedures intended to promote strong governance of our pay-for-performance philosophy. The Committee regularly reviews: (i) company performance; (ii) our executive compensation strategy, approach, trends, and regulatory developments; and (iii) other related topics, as appropriate. Each year, the Committee reviews, and makes available to our Board, an executive compensation statement, or "tally sheet," for each executive officer. The tally sheets reflect each executive officer's total compensation, including base salary, cash and equity-based incentive awards, the value of prior restricted stock unit awards (including the status of achieving any performance goals), qualified and nonqualified retirement and deferred compensation benefit accruals, and the incremental cost to our company of the executive's perquisites. The Committee uses this information to evaluate all elements of compensation and benefits provided to an executive officer. Annually, the Committee reviews with our Board its compensation decisions (including cash and equity-based incentive awards, if applicable) for executives who report directly to our CEO. With respect to the CEO's compensation, the Committee makes a recommendation that is further reviewed and approved by the independent members of the Board. The CEO does not participate in Committee or Board deliberations about his compensation. Additionally, for our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Audit Executive, the Committee's pay recommendations are further reviewed and approved by our Board's Enterprise Risk Committee and Audit Committee, respectively. 
Executive officers do not engage with the Committee in setting the amount or form of their own individual compensation. During annual performance reviews for executive officers other than our CEO, the Committee considers our CEO's perspective and incentive award recommendations before approving compensation for each of these executive officers. In addition, the Committee considers the performance of our various lines of business, business segments and functions, as well as performance feedback from our Chief Human Resources Officer and our independent control functions (corporate audit, compliance, finance, human resources, legal, and risk). 
The Committee has the sole authority and responsibility under its charter to approve engaging any compensation consultant it uses and the fees for those services. The Committee retained Farient Advisors LLC (Farient Advisors) as its 2018 independent compensation consultant. Farient Advisors' business with us is limited to providing independent executive and director compensation consulting services. Farient Advisors does not provide any other services to our company. For 2018, Farient Advisors provided the Committee external market and performance comparisons, advised the Committee on senior executive, CEO, and director compensation, assisted in evaluating program design, and assisted with other executive and director compensation-related matters. In performing these services, Farient Advisors met regularly with the Committee without management and privately with the Chair of the Committee. 
The Committee may delegate to management certain duties and responsibilities regarding our benefit plans. Significant Committee delegations to management include authority to: (i) the Management Compensation Committee to direct the compensation for all of our employees except for our CEO and his direct reports, and (ii) the Corporate Benefits Committee to oversee substantially all of our employee benefit plans. See "Compensation Governance Structure" on the next page. 
Compensation Risk Management Policies and Practices 
We believe that our company applies prudent risk management practices to its incentive compensation programs across the enterprise. Our Compensation and Benefits Committee is committed to a compensation governance structure that effectively contributes to our company's overall risk management policies. 
Compensation Governance Policy. The Committee has adopted and annually reviews our Compensation Governance Policy, which governs our incentive compensation decisions and defines the framework for oversight of enterprise-wide incentive compensation program design. Consistent with global regulatory initiatives, our Compensation Governance Policy requires that our incentive compensation plans do not encourage excessive risk-taking, and addresses our:

[END TABLE]
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Compensation Governance Structure. Our compensation governance structure allocates responsibility so that our Board, Compensation and Benefits Committee, or the appropriate management-level governing body makes compensation decisions with documented input from the independent control functions. This approach promotes effective oversight and review, and facilitates the appropriate governance to balance risk and reward. Below is an illustration of our compensation governance structure, which is influenced by internal considerations and external factors: 
Incentive Plan Certification Process. Pursuant to our Compensation Governance Policy, our annual incentive plan certification and review process provides for a comprehensive review, analysis, and discussion of incentive design and operation. As part of the governance for incentive plans, each of the CEO's direct reports, along with their management teams and independent control functions (including their respective risk officers), meet periodically to discuss how business strategy, performance, and risk align to compensation. The relevant participants certify that the incentive programs they review: (i) are aligned with the applicable lines of business and our company's business strategy and performance objectives, (ii) do not encourage excessive or imprudent risk-taking beyond our company's ability to effectively identify and manage risk, (iii) are compatible with effective controls and risk management, and (iv) do not incentivize impermissible proprietary trading. Our Chief Risk Officer also certifies all incentive plans across our company as part of the Management Compensation Committee's governance process. Farient Advisors and the Compensation and Benefits Committee review these management certifications. 
Incentive Plan Audit Reviews. Corporate audit reviews all incentive plans at least every three years, using a risk-based approach that includes reviewing governance, payment, and processing against each incentive plan's design, and validating incentive plan design and operation against regulatory requirements. 
Conduct Reviews. As part of our compensation governance practices, management reviews conduct incidents so they are consistently and appropriately considered in performance assessments and pay decisions across the company. These performance and pay outcomes are reviewed at least annually by the Committee. 
Independent Control Function Feedback. In addition to reviewing the individual incentive compensation awards for executive officers and other senior executives who report directly to the CEO, the Committee also reviews the outcomes of our control function feedback process and individual incentive compensation awards for certain highly compensated employees. As part of its governance process, the Committee meets with the heads of our independent control functions and business lines during a half-day meeting to discuss their feedback on the pay-for-performance process, including how risk management and conduct matters were factored into compensation decisions. 
As a result of these processes and reviews, and in combination with the risk management and clawback features of our compensation programs, we believe that our compensation policies and practices appropriately hold employees accountable, while balancing risks and rewards in a way that does not encourage excessive or imprudent risk-taking or create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company.

STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
We interact with our investors in a variety of ways. Our investor relations team regularly meets with investors, prospective investors, and investment analysts. Often these meetings include our Chairman and CEO, CFO, or line of business leaders. These meetings are generally focused on company performance, strategy, and Responsible Growth. Our Board and management also regularly engage with our stockholders to solicit their views and input on important performance; corporate governance; ESG matters, including human capital management and executive compensation matters; and other topics of interest to our stockholders. The combination of information received in investor relations meetings and stockholder engagement meetings provides the Board and management with insights into a comprehensive scope of topics important to our stockholders.

These views were shared with our Board and its committees, where applicable, for their consideration. 
In addition to engaging with our institutional stockholders, in 2018 we made available video interviews with our directors, which have been updated in March 2019, to provide all stakeholders, including our retail stockholders, with the opportunity to hear directly from our Board.

RESPONSIBLE GROWTH 
RESPONSIBLE GROWTH(1) 
We deliver on our purpose—to help make financial lives better through the power of every connection—through Responsible Growth. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles help define how Bank of America delivers Responsible Growth and contributes to the work we do to help drive the global economy. Our ESG leadership enables us to pursue growing business opportunities and manage risk associated with addressing the world's biggest environmental and social challenges. It defines how we deploy our capital and resources, informs our business practices, and helps determine how and when we use our voice in support of our values. Integrated across our eight lines of business, our ESG focus reflects how we hold ourselves accountable and allows us to create shared success with our clients and communities. 
Our management-level Global ESG Committee, which is led by our Vice Chairman Anne Finucane, is comprised of senior executives from across the company who are actively engaged in managing our ESG approach and strengthening our ESG governance. The committee engages in dialogue and debate on social and environmental issues that are material to the business, including our human capital management practices, product and service offerings, and investments with the goal of creating a sustainable economy. The committee, which is accountable to the CEO, convenes six times a year and reports regularly to the Corporate Governance Committee. 
In addition, Vice Chairman Anne Finucane and her team engage with stockholders, consumer advocates, community advisors, and other stakeholders for their advice and guidance in shaping our ESG policies and practices. In 2005, we founded our National Community Advisory Council, a forum for senior leaders from social justice, consumer advocacy, community development, environmental, research, and advocacy organizations, and senior executives meet with the council at least twice annually for external perspectives on our business policies, practices and products. 
ESG underscores how we seek growth within our Risk Framework, including how we engage external stakeholders and provide strong oversight of environmental and social risks that present themselves through our business activities. This includes the responsible products and services delivered to clients; how we evaluate business opportunities; and how we help enable social progress and economic mobility in local communities around the world. Ultimately, through our commitment to ESG principles we build trust and credibility as a company people want to work for, invest in, and do business with. 
Deploying Capital for Sustainable Growth 
One important aspect of our ESG focus is how we can help mobilize participants across the financial system to increase the flow of capital to address the major global challenges broadly articulated by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We refer to our efforts as Capital Deployment—how we contribute to the global need for sustainable finance through our own business activities and by developing innovative partnerships and financial structures. This enterprise-wide initiative is designed to unlock and provide the necessary financing to address major global and local challenges such as affordable housing, sustainable energy, clean water and sanitation, education, and healthcare. In 2018 alone we deployed more than $50 billion in capital to address these issues. 
Highlights of our Capital Deployment work in 2018 include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Environmental Business Commitment: Deployed $21.5  billion in capital to support low-carbon, sustainable business activities through lending, investing, capital raising, advisory services, and developing financial solutions for clients around the world, as part of our Environmental Business  Commitment to deploy $125 billion by 2025. Since 2013, we have delivered nearly $105 billion towards this goal.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Blended Finance Catalyst Pool: In November 2018,  launched a new financing initiative to provide $60 million in capital to support deals that would ordinarily fall outside the scope of our Risk Framework, but by which, through our participation, we can drive significant leverage and impact.

   🌑  Our Global Diversity & Inclusion Council, chaired by our CEO, is comprised of leaders  representing every line of business and region, and is responsible for setting and upholding diversity and inclusion goals and practices   🌑  We are a diverse and inclusive company. Currently, our global workforce is more than 50% female; and more than 45% of the U.S.-based workforce are people of color. Our senior leadership is also diverse; seven of our 16 Board  members and seven of our CEOs 13 direct reports are women and/or people of color    🌑  Our most recent global campus recruiting class was more than 40% female; and more than 45% of the U.S. recruiting class was  people of color   🌑  We host courageous conversations, group and one-on-one discussions that encourage employees to have open dialogue on topics that are important to them. These dialogues foster inclusion,  understanding, empathy, and positive action by creating awareness of employees experiences and perspectives related to differences in thought, style, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, ethnicity, disability, culture, and experience   🌑  We have a range of programs to connect employees, executives, and thought leaders across our company, including  11 Employee Networks with more than 250 chapters made up of over 120,000 members worldwide   🌑  Our company was recognized for the second year in a row by Fortune Magazine on its 100 Best Workplaces for Diversity List, by  Euromoney as the Best Bank for Diversity, and by Catalyst with the 2019 Catalyst Award for our efforts focused on investing in women            🌑  All of our compensation plans are reviewed and  certified annually by our risk management function   🌑  We have an enhanced performance review process for senior leaders and employees who have the ability to expose our company to material risk   🌑  We have been an industry leader in establishing an internal minimum rate of pay for our U.S. hourly employees and have made regular increases over many years. Two years ago, we raised our minimum wage to $15 per hour and our minimum wage is higher today. Our average rate  for all U.S. hourly employees is significantly above this level   🌑  We pay our employees competitively based on market rates for their roles and how they perform, and we regularly benchmark against other companies  both within and outside our industry to ensure our pay is competitive in the market for comparable roles   🌑  Our company is committed to compensating all of our employees fairly and equitably based on performance, with equal pay for equal work, regardless  of race or gender. See page 34   🌑  In addition to merit-based salary increases and applicable incentive  compensation, to share our success in 2018, we again provided special compensation awards to recognize the contributions of our employees to our progress and record performance, and reflect the continuing benefits  of last years U.S. tax reform. Approximately 95% of our teammates received special awards as a result of 2018 performance. Over the last 2 years, we awarded more than $1 billion  in shared success awards to our teammates   🌑  We use a standard U.S. practice restricting how we solicit compensation information when hiring, so we determine compensation levels for new hires based on  individual qualifications and roles, rather than how they may have been compensated in the past

RESPONSIBLE GROWTH 
More information on our commitment to ESG, including our human capital management practices, is available on our website at http://bankofamerica.com/responsiblegrowth. 
RELATED PERSON AND CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS 
RELATED PERSON AND CERTAIN OTHER TRANSACTIONS
Our related person transactions policy in our Corporate Governance Guidelines sets forth our policies and procedures for reviewing and approving or ratifying any transaction with related persons (directors, director nominees, executive officers, stockholders holding 5% or more of our voting securities, or any of their immediate family members or affiliated entities). Our policy covers any transactions where the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, our company is a participant, and a related person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 
Under our related person transactions policy, our Corporate Governance Committee must approve or ratify any related person transactions, and when doing so, consider: the related person's interest in the transaction; whether the transaction involves arm's-length bids or market prices and terms; the transaction's materiality to each party; the availability of the product or services through other sources; the implications of our Code of Conduct or reputational risk; whether the transaction would impair a director's or executive officer's judgment to act in our company's best interest; the transaction's acceptability to our regulators; and in the case of an independent director, whether the transaction would impair his or her independence or status as an "outside" or "non-employee" director. 
Our Board has determined that certain types of transactions do not create or involve a direct or indirect material interest on the part of the related person and therefore do not require review or approval under the policy. These include transactions involving financial services, including loans and brokerage, banking, insurance, investment advisory or asset management services, and other financial services we provide to any related person, if the services are provided in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable services provided to non-affiliates and comply with applicable law, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Federal Reserve Board Regulation O. 
A number of our directors, director nominees, and executive officers, their family members, and certain business organizations associated with them are or have been customers of our banking subsidiaries. All extensions of credit to these persons have been made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time in comparable transactions with persons not related to our company and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability. 
Occasionally, we may have employees who are related to our executive officers, directors, or director nominees. We compensate these individuals in a manner consistent with our practices that apply to all employees. The sister of Mr. Thong M. Nguyen, an executive officer, and the brother of Dr. Zuber, a director and nominee, are each employed by the company in non-executive, non-strategic positions, and each received compensation in 2018 of approximately $180,000 and $320,000, respectively. Dr. Zuber's brother's compensation is primarily commissions based. The methodology through which his compensation is calculated is consistent with that used for other financial advisors in similar roles. The compensation and other terms of employment of both Mr. Nguyen's sister and Dr. Zuber's brother are determined on a basis consistent with the company's human resources policies. 
Our company and Mr. Moynihan are parties to an aircraft time-sharing agreement, as disclosed in prior proxy statements and approved by our Corporate Governance Committee in December 2010. 
Based on information contained in separate Schedule 13G filings with the SEC, each of Warren E. Buffett/Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire Hathaway), BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock), and The Vanguard Group (Vanguard) reported that it beneficially owned more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2018 (see "Stock Ownership of Directors, Executive Officers, and Certain Beneficial Owners" on the next page). 
In the ordinary course of our business during 2018, our subsidiaries provided and are expected to continue to provide financial advisory, sales and trading, treasury, and other financial or administrative services to Berkshire Hathaway and its affiliates, BlackRock and its affiliates and clients, and Vanguard and its affiliates. These transactions were entered into on an arm's-length basis and contain customary terms and conditions. Our company and its subsidiaries may also, in the ordinary course, invest in BlackRock or Vanguard funds or other products or buy or sell assets to or from BlackRock or Vanguard funds and separate accounts. 
STOCK OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AND CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS 
STOCK OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AND CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS 
Our voting securities are our common stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series 1, 2, 4, and 5 Preferred Stock. The following table shows the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned as of March 4, 2019 by: (i) each director, (ii) each named executive officer, (iii) all directors and executive officers as a group, and (iv) beneficial owners of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities (as determined under SEC rules). As of that date, none of our directors and executive officers owned any shares of any class of our voting securities, other than as reported in the table below, or had any outstanding options or warrants for such shares. Each director, each named executive officer, and all directors and executive officers as a group beneficially owned less than 1% of our outstanding common stock. Unless otherwise noted, all shares of our common stock are subject to the sole voting and investment power of the directors and executive officers. The table below also contains information about other stock units that are not deemed beneficially owned under SEC rules.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) requires our directors, executive officers, and anyone holding 10% or more of a registered class of our equity securities (reporting persons) to file reports with the SEC showing their holdings of, and transactions in, these securities. Based solely on a review of copies of such reports, and written representations from each reporting person that no other reports are required, we believe that for 2018 all reporting persons filed the required reports on a timely basis under Section 16(a). 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Our director compensation philosophy is to appropriately compensate our non-management directors for the time, expertise, and effort required to serve as a director of a large, complex, and highly regulated global company, and to align the interests of directors and long-term stockholders. 
Annual payments are made after the non-management directors are elected by stockholders. Non-management directors who begin their Board or committee chair service other than at the annual meeting of stockholders receive a prorated amount of annual compensation. Mr. Moynihan receives no compensation for his services as our sole management director. 
2018 Director Pay Components 
The primary elements of annual compensation and incremental awards for our non-management directors for 2018 are provided in the table below. Incremental awards recognize additional responsibilities and the time commitment of these critical Board leadership roles.

2018 Director Compensation Review 
Our Compensation and Benefits Committee annually reviews and periodically recommends updates to the director compensation program to our Board for approval. The Committee's recommendation takes into account our director compensation philosophy, changes in market practices, and consultation with the Committee's independent compensation consultant, Farient Advisors. 
No changes were made to the form or amount of director compensation as part of the 2018 review. However, the Board determined that, beginning in 2019, awards of restricted stock to directors will be made from the Bank of America Key Employee Equity Plan (KEEP), instead of the Directors' Stock Plan, to simplify plan administration. The terms of the 2019 annual awards from the KEEP will be consistent with those of prior awards under the Directors' Stock Plan. See also Proposal 4 for additional information about the KEEP. 
Director Deferral Plan 
Non-management directors may elect to defer all or a portion of their annual restricted stock or cash awards through the Bank of America Corporation Director Deferral Plan (Director Deferral Plan). When directors elect to defer their restricted stock award, their "stock account" is credited with "stock units" equal in value to the restricted stock award and subject to the same vesting requirement applicable to restricted stock awards to directors. Each stock unit is equal in value to a share of our common stock but because it is not an actual share of our common stock it does not have any voting rights. When directors elect to defer their cash award, they may choose to defer into either a stock account or a "cash account." Deferrals into a stock account are credited with dividend equivalents in the form of additional stock units and deferrals into the cash account are credited with interest at a long-term bond rate. Following retirement from our Board and depending on the director's selection, a non-management director may receive the stock account balance (to the extent vested) and cash account balance in a single lump sum cash payment or in a series of cash installment payments. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Stock Retention Requirements and Hedging Prohibition for Non-management Directors 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Under our stock retention requirements, non-management directors are required to hold and cannot sell the restricted stock  they receive as compensation (except as necessary to pay taxes on taxable events such as vesting) until termination of their service. All non-management directors are in compliance with these requirements

PROPOSAL 2: APPROVING OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (AN ADVISORY, NON-BINDING "SAY ON PAY" RESOLUTION) 
PROPOSAL 2: APPROVING OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (AN ADVISORY, NON-BINDING "SAY ON PAY" RESOLUTION) 
We are seeking an advisory vote to approve our executive compensation for 2018. At our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, a majority of stockholders voted to have a Say on Pay vote each year. As a result, we will conduct an advisory vote on executive compensation annually at least until the next stockholder advisory vote on the frequency of such votes. 
Although the Say on Pay vote is advisory and is not binding on our Board, our Compensation and Benefits Committee will take into consideration the outcome of the vote when making future executive compensation decisions. At the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, nearly 95% of the votes cast favored our Say on Pay proposal. The Committee considered this result and input from investors during our stockholder engagement process, and in light of the strong support, maintained a consistent overall approach for 2018. 
Our Board believes that our current executive compensation program appropriately links compensation realized by our executive officers to our performance and properly aligns the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders. The details of this compensation for 2018, and the reasons we awarded it, are described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," starting below. 
Our Board recommends a vote "FOR" approving our executive compensation (an advisory, non-binding "Say on Pay" resolution) (Proposal 2). 
Our Board recommends that our stockholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that our stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the accompanying narrative discussion disclosed in this proxy statement." 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
1. Executive Summary a. Executive Compensation Philosophy 
Our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance over the long-term, as well as on an annual basis. Our performance considerations include both financial and non-financial measures—including the manner in which results are achieved—for the company, line of business, and the individual. These considerations reinforce and promote Responsible Growth and maintain alignment with our risk framework. Our executive compensation program provides a mix of salary, incentives, and benefits paid over time to align executive officer and stockholder interests. Our Compensation and Benefits Committee has the primary responsibility for approving our compensation strategy and philosophy, and the compensation programs applicable to our named executive officers listed below. With respect to Mr. Moynihan's compensation, our Compensation and Benefits Committee makes a recommendation that is further reviewed and approved by the independent members of the Board.

c. Stockholder Engagement & Say on Pay Results 
[BEGIN TABLE]
We conduct stockholder engagement throughout the year and provide stockholders with an annual opportunity to cast an advisory Say on Pay vote. At our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, nearly 95% of the votes cast favored our Say  on Pay proposal. Additionally in 2018 and early 2019, management and directors met with investors owning approximately 35% of our outstanding common shares and discussed our executive compensation program, human capital management, and other  compensation-related matters. These discussions, together with the 2018 Say on Pay results, indicated strong support for our 2017 compensation program and influenced our decision to maintain a consistent overall approach for 2018.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
2. 2018 Company & Segment Performance 
From our continued dedication to Responsible Growth, we achieved record results in 2018. We continue focusing on what we control and drive: creating operating leverage by managing expenses, growing loans and deposits, and doing more business with our clients. We are doing this responsibly and within our Risk Framework while listening to our clients, communities, and employees when they answer the question: "What would you like the power to do?". We believe we are well positioned to continue delivering Responsible Growth in 2019. 
Following are financial highlights and key measures of company and line of business performance that our Compensation and Benefits Committee considered in evaluating the 2018 performance of our named executive officers.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
3. Executive Compensation Program Features a. Executive Pay Components & Variable Pay Mix 
Our Compensation and Benefits Committee determines the pay for our named executive officers for each performance year. For the CEO, a portion of the compensation is delivered as base salary and the remainder as restricted stock units. For named executive officers other than the CEO, a portion of the compensation is delivered as base salary and the remainder as annual cash incentive and restricted stock units. Restricted stock units are divided into two components: time-based and performance-based. Our time-based awards vest ratably over three years except for the CEO's cash-settled restricted stock units that vest over one year. Our performance-based awards are re-earned following initial grant only by the sustained three-year average achievement of performance metrics. Consequently, for our named executive officers to realize the full value of their performance-based awards, the future performance of our company must be at or above the standards set for this award. This pay-for-performance structure, which emphasizes variable pay, helps motivate our executives to deliver sustained stockholder value and Responsible Growth. 
The following chart provides an overview of the 2018 pay components for our active named executive officers:

b. Compensation Risk Management Features 
Our Compensation and Benefits Committee believes that the design and governance of our executive compensation program encourage executive performance consistent with the highest standards of risk management. 
i. Pay Practices 
Highlighted below are the key features of our compensation program for executive officers, including the pay practices we have implemented to drive Responsible Growth, encourage executive retention, and align executive and stockholder interests. We also identify certain pay practices we have not implemented because we believe they do not serve our risk management standards or stockholders' long-term interests.

Additionally, it is not our policy to provide for the accelerated vesting of equity awards upon an employee's voluntary resignation to enter government service. We do not anticipate changing our approach. 
The "Compensation Governance and Risk Management" discussion beginning on page 25 contains more information about our Compensation Governance Policy and our compensation risk management practices. That section describes our Chief Risk Officer's review and certification of our incentive compensation programs and our Chief Audit Executive's risk-based review of our incentive plans. We also describe the extent to which our CEO participates in determining executive officer compensation, and the role of Farient Advisors, the Committee's independent compensation consultant. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
ii. Multiple Cancellation & Clawback Features 
Our equity-based awards are subject to three separate and distinct features that can result in the awards being cancelled or prior payments being clawed back in the event of certain detrimental conduct or financial losses. We believe these features encourage appropriate behavior and manage risk in our compensation program. Our named executive officers are subject to all three cancellation and clawback features.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
4. Compensation Decisions and Rationale a. Pay Evaluation & Decision Process 
Each year, our Compensation and Benefits Committee reviews our named executive officers' performance using a balanced and disciplined approach to determine their base salaries and variable compensation awards. The approach for 2018 included a range of performance and governance considerations as inputs into compensation decisions. 
Performance Considerations The Committee considers various factors that collectively indicate successful management of our business, including: Company, line of business, and individual performance, including financial and non-financial measures The manner in which results are achieved, adherence to risk and compliance policies, and the quality of earnings Accountability in driving a strong risk management culture and other core values of our company Our year-over-year performance relative to our established risk metrics Our performance relative to our primary competitor group The Committees evaluation includes a robust review of performance scorecards, which are aligned to the four tenets of Responsible Growth: Grow and win in the market Grow with our customer- focused strategy Grow within our Risk Framework Grow in a sustainable manner For each tenet of Responsible Growth, the scorecard includes metrics tailored for each named executive officer based on company, line of business, risk financial, and strategic priorities. Pages [.] through [.] provide material factors aligned to each of the four tenets the Committee considered. Market Practices and Governance Considerations The Committee reviews market pay practices and governance practices to inform compensation decisions: Market pay practices, including market compensation benchmarks from our primary peers are reviewed annually Additionally, practices at leading international financial institutions and global companies headquartered in the U.S. spanning all industries of similar size and scope are considered The Committee reviews feedback from our independent control functions (i.e., audit, compliance, finance, human resources, legal, and risk) as part of their assessment of performance The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer join the Committee to discuss full-year financial and risk performance The Committee considers our CEOs perspective on executive performance and pay for our Named Executive Officers and other key executives The Committees independent consultant, Farient, Advisors provides perspectives on company performance and market pay practices for our NEOs as an input into our compensation decisions Compensation Decisions and Approvals: After taking all of these various inputs into consideration, the Committee applies its business judgment and discretion to determine the appropriate compensation for the named executive officers As part of the compensation decisions, the Committee evaluates the relevant facts and circumstances so it may judiciously assess pay for performance alignment, potentially resulting in an increase or decrease to compensation Compensation decisions are generally determined on a year-over-year basis without preset target levels of total compensation, without assigning weightings, and without formulaic benchmarking The Committee believes this use of business judgment is in the stockholders' best interests as it enables the Committee to appropriately respond to qualitative factors in our Responsible Growth and the dynamic nature of our businesses and industry For the CEO and the Chief Risk Officer, the Committee's pay recommendations are further reviewed and approved by the independent members of our Board and the Enterprise Risk Committee, respectivelyPerformance Considerations The Committee considers various factors that collectively indicate successful management of our business, including: Company, line of business, and individual performance, including financial and non-financial measures The manner in which results are achieved, adherence to risk and compliance policies, and the quality of earnings Accountability in driving a strong risk management culture and other core values of our company Our year-over-year performance relative to our established risk metrics Our performance relative to our primary competitor group The Committees evaluation includes a robust review of performance scorecards, which are aligned to the four tenets of Responsible Growth: Grow and win in the market Grow with our customer- focused strategy Grow within our Risk Framework Grow in a sustainable manner For each tenet of Responsible Growth, the scorecard includes metrics tailored for each named executive officer based on company, line of business, risk financial, and strategic priorities.

Note: Some of the 2018 compensation above differs from the Summary Compensation Table on page 57. SEC rules require that the Summary Compensation Table include equity compensation in the year granted, while the Committee awards equity compensation after the performance year. Therefore, equity-based incentives granted in 2018 for the 2017 performance year are shown in the Summary Compensation Table as 2018 compensation. The equity-based incentives above were granted in 2019 for the 2018 performance year. The Summary Compensation Table also includes elements of compensation not shown above. 
For a description of the pay components above, see "Executive Pay Components & Variable Pay Mix" on page 46. 
In addition to the compensation decisions listed above, the Committee determined variable compensation for Mr. Laughlin in December 2018, following his passing on October 25, 2018. The Committee approved a cash payment of $11,250,000 based on his 2018 performance as Vice Chairman and Head of Global Wealth & Investment Management.

Re-earning the Performance Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs) granted in February 2019 (based on 2018 performance) requires the company to meet average return on assets (ROA) and average adjusted tangible book value (TBV) growth standards over a three-year performance period from 2019-2021. For these awards the Committee increased the three-year average ROA standard by 10 bps at the 100% payout level and 5 bps at the 662⁄3% payout level. These increases align 662⁄3% and 100% payout on ROA with three-year average performance of 80 bps and 100 bps, respectively. Set in consideration of another year of strong company performance, this is the second year in a row we have increased the ROA performance standards for PRSUs. 
Under a hypothetical scenario, if our 2018 average assets of $2.3 trillion remained constant during the performance period, our company would need to earn $69.8 billion in aggregate net income from 2019-2021 to achieve the PRSU 1.00% ROA standard. This is an increase of $8.5 billion, or 14%, over the aggregate net income needed to achieve the 0.90% ROA standard for the prior year's performance RSUs based on average 2017 assets. Additionally, by adjusting TBV growth for approved capital actions, this performance standard is not impacted when the company returns capital to stockholders through share repurchases or dividends. 
These performance metrics and standards encourage the achievement of sustained stockholder value and Responsible Growth. PRSUs are forfeited if results are below both minimum standards. PRSUs granted since 2017 provide no upside payout opportunity (100% is the maximum that can be re-earned for these awards). PRSUs granted since 2016 are settled in stock. For any portion of the PRSU standards achieved, payment will be made after the end of the performance period. The performance year 2018 PRSU standards are outlined below:

(1)  Three-year Average ROA means the average "return on assets" for the three  calendar years in the performance period. For this purpose, "return on assets" will be based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) at the conclusion of each year.  
(2)  Three-year Average Growth in Adjusted TBV means the average year-over-year percentage  change in "adjusted tangible book value" for the three calendar years in the performance period. For this purpose, "adjusted tangible book value" for each year will equal our total common shareholders' equity, less  (a) the impact of any capital actions approved (or not objected to) by the Federal Reserve Board and/or approved by our company's Board, and less (b) the sum of the carrying value of: (i) goodwill and (ii) intangible assets  excluding mortgage servicing rights; adjusted for (iii) deferred tax liabilities directly related to: (i) and (ii). Each year-over-year percentage change is measured after the conclusion of each calendar year using the beginning balance as  of January 1 and the ending balance as of December 31 of that year.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
5. Other Compensation Topics a. Results for Performance Restricted Stock Units 
PRSUs have been a component of our executive compensation program since 2011. 
PRSUs require our executive officers to re-earn awards over the performance period based on achievement of established performance standards and help align management with stockholder interests. Our practice is not to adjust PRSU results for the impact of legacy litigation, fines, and penalties or the Tax Act, which has contributed to outcomes for PRSU payouts since their introduction. Since 2011, we have had two types of PRSU programs: 
5-Year Program (completed) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    2011 and 2012 PRSUs were based on rolling four quarter return on assets (ROA) standards over a five-year performance period.   
[END TABLE]
3-Year Program (current) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Since 2013, PRSUs have been based 50% on three-year average ROA and 50% on three-year average growth in adjusted TBV  standards  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    The 2016 PRSUs completed in 2018 at 116% of the target opportunity based on ROA results of 94 bps and TBV results of 10.26%.  For the portion of the 2016 PRSUs achieved above 100%, payment will be deferred an additional two years  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    For the awards granted in 2017, 2018 and 2019, the maximum payout opportunity is 100%  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  For PRSUs awarded in 2015 and 2016, the maximum payout was up to 125% of the target opportunity  
[END TABLE]
The award terms for these PRSUs provide for the calculation of performance results at the conclusion of each calendar year in the performance period. As a result, the performance results above may differ from the results reported under GAAP in our company's audited financial statements. 
b. Competitor Groups 
Our Compensation and Benefits Committee periodically reviews compensation practices of two competitor groups: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Our primary competitor group includes five leading U.S. financial institutionswe compete directly with them for  customers, employees, and investors, and they follow similar economic cycles to our own  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Leading international financial institutions for perspectives on the global financial services industry   
[END TABLE]
The Committee used the following 2018 competitor groups periodically to evaluate market trends, pay levels, and relative performance in executive compensation, but without any formulaic benchmarking. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 🌑  Citigroup    🌑  Morgan Stanley       🌑  Barclays    🌑  HSBC 
 🌑  Goldman Sachs    🌑  Wells Fargo       🌑  BNP Paribas    🌑  Royal Bank of Canada 
 🌑  JPMorgan Chase       🌑  Credit Suisse    🌑  UBS 
            🌑  Deutsche Bank   
            🌑  Deutsche Bank   
[END TABLE]
From time to time, the Committee also reviews executive compensation for a leading group of global companies headquartered in the U.S. spanning all industries to get a general perspective on compensation practices for companies of similar size and global scope. For 2018, these companies were: Abbott Laboratories, AT&T, Chevron, Cisco, Coca-Cola, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, General Electric, IBM, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo, Pfizer, Philip Morris International, Procter & Gamble, Verizon, and Wal-Mart. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
c. Retirement Benefits 
We provide our named executive officers the opportunity to save for their retirement via employee and employer contributions to qualified and nonqualified defined contribution plans on the same terms as other U.S.-based salaried employees. These plans help us attract and retain key people by providing a means to save for retirement. 
Certain named executive officers also participate in various frozen qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans. For more information about these plans, see "Pension Benefits Table" and "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table" on pages 64 and  65, respectively. 
d. Health and Welfare Benefits & Perquisites 
Our named executive officers received health and welfare benefits, such as medical, life, and long-term disability coverage, under plans generally available to all other U.S.-based salaried employees. Because we have internal expertise on financial advisory matters, we do not charge fees to our named executive officers for their use of our financial advisory services for personal needs. We also may provide certain named executive officers with secured parking. In limited circumstances, we allow spouses to accompany executives traveling for a business-related purpose and pay for other incidental expenses. Our policy provides for the use of corporate aircraft by senior management for approved emergency travel. For reasons of security, personal safety, and efficiency, we require our CEO to use corporate aircraft for all air travel (business, commuting, and personal). Pursuant to his aircraft time-sharing agreement, our CEO reimburses our company for costs related to his use of our aircraft for commuting. 
e. Tax Deductibility of Compensation 
Changes in U.S. tax law effective January 1, 2018 limit a public company's deductions to $1 million per year for compensation paid to its CEO, chief financial officer, and each of its three other most highly compensated executive officers, as well as to any individual who was subject to the $1 million deduction limitation in 2017 or any later year. Under the revised law, there is no exception for qualifying performance-based compensation unless it is pursuant to a written binding contract in effect as of November 2, 2017 (the Transition Date). 
Certain annual cash incentive awards and equity-based incentive awards made on or before the Transition Date may satisfy the requirements for deductible compensation. Any compensation in excess of $1 million paid to a covered person after 2017 will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief. The Committee continues to retain the discretion to make awards and pay amounts that do not qualify as deductible.

    For this purpose, in accordance with SEC rules, the present value was determined using the same assumptions applicable for  valuing pension benefits for purposes of our financial statements. See "Pension Benefits Table" on page 64.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Effective June 30, 2012, Bank of America froze pension plan accruals under all of its U.S. pension plans for all  employees. As a result, the named executive officers are not accruing any additional pension benefits with respect to any compensation or service after June 30, 2012.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    For Mr. Moynihan, the amount reported above under "Change in Pension Value" results primarily because of  annuity benefits under a legacy SERP frozen since 2005. The monthly annuity benefit amount has not changed since the SERP was frozen. However, the present value of the benefit increases each year because he is a year closer to the plan's  retirement age.  
[END TABLE]

    The above-market earnings on nonqualified deferred compensation result from Mr. Moynihan's participation in a  legacy FleetBoston deferred compensation plan. See "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table" on page 65.

[END TABLE]

PRSUs 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    The PRSUs granted in February 2018 are re-earned based on return on assets (ROA) and growth in adjusted tangible book value  (TBV) standards over a three-year performance period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. The following highlights the performance metrics and standards of these PRSU awards:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  O     "Three-year Average ROA" means the average "return on assets" for the three calendar years in the  performance period. For this purpose, "return on assets" will be based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) at the conclusion of each year  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  O     "Three-year Average Growth in Adjusted TBV" means the average year-over-year percentage change in "adjusted  tangible book value" for the three calendar years in the performance period. For this purpose, "adjusted tangible book value" for each year will equal our total common shareholders' equity, less (a) the impact of any capital  actions approved (or not objected to) by the Federal Reserve Board and/or approved by our company's Board, and less (b) the sum of the carrying value of: (i) goodwill and (ii) intangible assets excluding mortgage servicing rights; adjusted for  (iii) deferred tax liabilities directly related to: (i) and (ii). Each year-over-year percentage change is measured after the conclusion of each calendar year using the beginning balance as of January 1 and the ending balance as of December 31 of  that year  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  O     The awards are equally weighted with 50% based on ROA standards and 50% based on adjusted TBV growth standards. The portion  of the PRSUs earned for the performance period depends on the level of our average ROA and adjusted TBV growth. No PRSUs will be earned if results are below the minimum standards. Results above the 331⁄3% minimum standard will be interpolated on a straight-line basis between the two nearest standards

🌑    To encourage sustainable, long-term performance, PRSUs are subject to performance-based cancellation, and payment on a  settlement date is specifically conditioned on our company or the applicable segments remaining profitable over the performance period. If a loss is determined to have occurred, our Compensation and Benefits Committee, together with key control  functions, will review losses and the executive officers accountability. The Committee will then make a final determination to either take no action or to cancel all or a portion of the part of the executive officers award otherwise  payable as of the applicable settlement date. All such determinations will be final and binding

  (2)  For purposes of these awards, "cause" is generally defined as a termination of an employee's employment if  it occurs in conjunction with a determination that the employee has: (i) committed an act of fraud or dishonesty in the course of his employment; (ii) been convicted of (or pleaded no contest with respect to) a crime constituting a felony;  (iii) committed an act or omission which causes the employee or Bank of America or its subsidiaries to be in violation of federal or state securities laws, rules or regulations, and/or the rules of any exchange or association of which Bank of  America is a member, including statutory disqualification; (iv) failed to perform job function(s), which Bank of America views as being material to his or her position and the overall business of Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries  under circumstances where such failure is detrimental to Bank of America Corporation or any subsidiary; (v) materially breached any written policy applicable to employees of Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, including, but not  limited to, the Bank of America Corporation Code of Conduct and General Policy on Insider Trading; or (vi) made an unauthorized disclosure of any confidential or proprietary information of Bank of America Corporation or its subsidiaries or has  committed any other material violation of Bank of America's written policy regarding Confidential and Proprietary Information.

  (3)  A Qualifying Termination means any voluntary or involuntary termination (other than for death, disability, or  "cause") after the executive has met certain specified age and/or service requirements. For most of the named executive officers, the executive must have at least 10 years of service and his or her age and years of service must add up to  at least 60.

The following describes the material features of our pension plans in which the named executive officers participate. 
Qualified Pension Plan. During 2018, all of our named executive officers (other than Mr. Montag) participated in one of the legacy components of The Bank of America Pension Plan (Pension Plan). The component plans are cash balance pension plans where notional cash balance accounts grow based on notional credits. As of June 30, 2012, participants no longer receive compensation credits or years of credited service under the Pension Plan. 
Participants in the Legacy Fleet component plan (Fleet Legacy Pension Plan) continue to receive notional interest credits based on the one-year U.S. Treasury Note yield, subject to a minimum annual rate of 3.25%. Participants in the Legacy Bank of America component plan (Bank of America Legacy Pension Plan) continue to receive notional interest credits based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note yield for their post-2007 accounts and notional investment credits based on selected investment choices for their pre-2008 accounts. 
All participating named executive officers are vested under the Pension Plan and can receive their cash balance account in a lump sum, or an actuarial equivalent form of benefit. 
Nonqualified Pension Plans and SERPs. During 2018, certain named executive officers participated in one or more of the following:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    FleetBoston Financial Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (Fleet SERP)  
[END TABLE]
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Pension Restoration Plan and Fleet RIAP provide benefits for qualified pension plan participants whose retirement benefits were reduced due to IRS limits on qualified plans. These plans were frozen, along with the corresponding qualified pension plans, effective June 30, 2012. Each participating named executive officer's nonqualified pension plan benefits are fully vested and payable as either a lump sum or annual installments over a period of up to 10 years beginning in a year after termination (other payment options may be available for legacy benefits). 
Mr. Moynihan's Fleet SERP benefit is equal to a percentage of final average compensation (based on previously frozen compensation), reduced benefits from the Fleet Legacy Pension Plan, and the Fleet RIAP. Mr. Moynihan's participation in the Fleet SERP was frozen at his request effective December 31, 2005, and he elected this benefit to be payable as a lump sum payment determined using the actuarial assumptions in effect under the Fleet Legacy Pension Plan in 2005.

[END TABLE]
The following describes the material features of our nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which the named executive officers participate. 
Bank of America Deferred Compensation Plan. Each of our named executive officers is eligible to participate in the Bank of America Deferred Compensation Plan, which is a nonqualified retirement savings plan that allows for deferrals above the IRS limits on qualified plans. Participants may elect to defer up to 50% of base salary and up to 75% of certain eligible incentive awards. Employer contributions made under the plan, if any, when combined with the employer contributions under the 401(k) plan, will not exceed the maximum employer contributions allowable under the 401(k) Plan—$12,500 for matching contributions and $7,500 for annual company contributions. Participants may generally elect to receive their distribution in a lump sum payment or installments payable up to 15 years. Participants are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on amounts that they deferred or any notional investment earnings (based on elections of the same investment options as under the 401(k) Plan) until those amounts are distributed to them, and we do not take a tax deduction on these amounts until they are distributed. 
Fleet ESA Plan. Mr. Athanasia has a nonqualified deferred compensation account that was established prior to FleetBoston's merger with Bank of America Corporation and funded by employer contributions. This plan was closed to contributions in 2004. Upon his termination of employment, Mr. Athanasia will be paid in equal installments over a one-year restrictive covenant period, unless he terminates due to death or disability. 
FleetBoston Financial Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan No. 2. Messrs. Moynihan and Athanasia each have an account under the FleetBoston Financial Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan No. 2 (Fleet Deferred Compensation Plan), which is a nonqualified retirement savings plan. Prior to being closed to deferrals in 2002, participants could defer base salary and certain bonuses under the plan. Participants can elect payments in a lump sum or up to 15 annual installments either on or after termination of employment, but not beyond the year in which the participant turns 65. Mr. Laughlin also had an account under the Fleet Deferred Compensation Plan. Following his passing in October 2018, a portion of Mr. Laughlin's Fleet Deferred Compensation Plan account balance was distributed to his beneficiary, in accordance with the plan's terms; the remainder of the account balance will be distributed in annual installments over four years. 
FleetBoston Financial Corporation Executive Supplemental Plan. Messrs. Moynihan and Athanasia each have an account under the FleetBoston Financial Corporation Executive Supplemental Plan (Fleet Executive Supplemental Plan), which is a nonqualified retirement savings plan that allowed deferrals above the IRS limits on qualified plans. This plan was closed to contributions in 2004. Payments are made in a lump sum or up to 15 annual installments beginning in the year of termination of employment or any later year elected by the participant, but not beyond the year in which the participant turns 65. 
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
We do not have any agreements with our named executive officers that provide for cash severance payments upon termination of employment or a change in control. In addition, under our policy regarding executive severance agreements, we will not enter into employment or severance agreements with our executive officers that provide severance benefits exceeding two times base salary and bonus (as defined under our policy), unless the agreement has been approved by our stockholders. 
Potential Payments from Equity-based Awards 
Our equity-based awards to our named executive officers include standard provisions that cause awards to vest or be forfeited upon termination of employment, depending on the reason for termination. These provisions for awards granted in 2018 are described in more detail on page 59, and those details can be found for awards granted in prior years in our prior proxy statements. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
In general, our awards provide for continued payments on the original schedule after certain types of termination of employment, subject to the following conditions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    In case of a Qualifying Termination (sometimes referred to in prior years as Rule of 60), the award  continues to be paid according to the awards payment schedule if the executive complies with certain covenants, including not working for a competitive business. A Qualifying Termination means any voluntary or involuntary termination (other  than for death, disability, or cause) after the executive has met certain specified age and/or service requirements. For most of the named executives officers, the executive must have at least 10 years of service and his or her age and years of  service must add up to at least 60. Mr. Montag has a special eligibility standard set forth in his applicable offer letter but has otherwise satisfied the general age and service standard. Currently, each of the named executive officers meets  the applicable requirements for a Qualifying Termination  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Awards remain subject to performance-based cancellation prior to payment, and may be cancelled in whole or in part if losses  occur. Awards also can be cancelled or recouped if the executive engages in detrimental conduct. Further, under our Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy, the Board can require reimbursement of any incentive compensation paid to an executive  officer whose fraud or intentional misconduct causes our company to restate its financial statements. Awards also will be subject to any policies we may adopt to implement final, released, and effective rules implementing Section 954 of the  Dodd-Frank Act  
[END TABLE]
Awards to our named executive officers under our Bank of America Corporation Key Employee Equity Plan (KEEP) are generally designed to be paid per schedule if an executive's employment is terminated without "cause" or for "good reason" within two years after a change in control. This change in control treatment is often referred to as "double trigger" vesting, because it requires both: (i) a change in control and (ii) a subsequent involuntary termination (either by our company without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason"). Our KEEP does not provide our executive officers "single trigger" vesting upon a change in control. 
If a named executive officer is terminated for "cause," our equity-based awards provide that the awards will be forfeited. 
The following table shows the value of equity awards that would have been payable, subject to the non-compete or compliance with covenants, as applicable, for a termination of employment as of December 31, 2018. For this purpose, restricted stock units were valued at our closing price as of December 31, 2018, which was $24.64 per share. Due to a number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon termination of employment, any actual amounts paid or distributed may vary from the amounts listed below. Factors that could affect these amounts include the time during the year of any such event and the price of our common stock.

(3)  Under Mr. Montag's 2008 offer letter with Merrill Lynch, his equity awards must continue to vest per the vesting  schedule, subject to any conditions in the applicable award agreements (other than a non-compete) for any involuntary termination without "cause" or resignation for "good reason." Mr. Montag's offer letter defines  "cause" as: (i) his engagement in (A) willful misconduct resulting in material harm to our company or (B) gross negligence in connection with the performance of his duties; or (ii) his conviction of, or plea of nolo  contendere to, a felony or any other crime involving fraud, financial misconduct, or misappropriation of company assets, or that would disqualify him from employment in the securities industry (other than a temporary disqualification). For  Mr. Montag, "All Other Terminations Except for Cause" includes a resignation by him for "good reason" under his 2008 employment agreement, defined as a resignation following: (i) a meaningful and detrimental alteration  in the nature of the executive's responsibilities or authority; or (ii) a material reduction in the executive's total annual compensation that is not experienced generally by similarly situated employees.  
[END TABLE]
As previously noted, Mr. Laughlin passed away on October 25, 2018. In accordance with the terms of Mr. Laughlin's restricted stock units, the awards became immediately vested and were paid to his beneficiary after his death with an aggregate gross value of $19,362,014 based on our closing price of $26.59 on October 25, 2018. 
Other Potential Payments 
Following termination of employment, our named executive officers receive payment of retirement benefits and nonqualified deferred compensation benefits under our various plans in which they participate. The value of those benefits as of December 31, 2018 is set forth in the sections above entitled "Pension Benefits Table" and "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table." There are no special or enhanced benefits under those plans for our named executive officers, and all of our named executive officers are fully vested in the benefits discussed in those sections. 
We make tax and financial planning advisory services available to our named executive officers during their employment with us. The standard form of this benefit continues through the end of the year in which the executive ceases employment, including preparation of that year's tax returns. This benefit may continue for an extended term of up to five years if the executive meets the age and service standard for a Qualifying Termination and does not engage in any full-time employment. However, in the case of a termination for cause or if the executive engages in detrimental conduct, the benefit ends immediately. 
Bank of America employees who retire and meet the applicable requirements for a Qualifying Termination have access to continued coverage under our group health plan, but the employee generally must pay for the full cost of that coverage on an after-tax basis without any employer subsidy. Under an agreement entered into with Merrill Lynch, Mr. Montag will be able to access non-subsidized retiree medical coverage if he retires, so long as he does not work for or accept another position with a competitor. 
An employee who is a former NationsBank employee and who was hired before January 1, 2000 is eligible for an annual supplement to help cover the cost of retiree medical benefits if he or she meets the "Rule of 75" at termination. The amount of this supplement equals $30 per year of service. An employee meets the Rule of 75 if he or she retires after age 50, with at least 15 years of vesting service under our pension plan, and with a combined age and years of service of 75 or more. As of the end of the last fiscal year, the only named executive officer eligible for these benefits is Mr. Donofrio. The amount of the annual retiree medical benefit supplement for Mr. Donofrio based on his years of service through December 31, 2018 is $540. If Mr. Donofrio predeceases his spouse, this supplement will continue at a rate of 50% for the life of his surviving spouse. 
Also, all eligible employees hired before January 1, 2006 who meet the Rule of 75 when they terminate receive $5,000 of retiree life insurance coverage. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Donofrio was the only named executive officer who would have qualified for this benefit. 
CEO PAY RATIO 
CEO PAY RATIO 
Below is: (i) the 2018 annual total compensation of our CEO; (ii) the 2018 annual total compensation of our median employee; (iii) the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to that of our median employee; and (iv) the methodology we used to calculate our CEO pay ratio:

Our CEO pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules. Our methodology and process is explained below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Determined Employee Population. We began with our global employee population as of  October 1, 2018, including full-time, part-time, and seasonal or temporary workers, employed by our company or consolidated subsidiaries, but excluding our CEO.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Identified the Median Employee. We calculated compensation for each employee using base  salary as of October 1, 2018 and estimated overtime, plus performance year 2017 cash incentives paid and equity awards granted in 2018. We identified employees within $500 of the median compensation and removed those employees who had anomalous  compensation characteristics. For each remaining employee, we estimated total compensation using a method similar to the Summary Compensation Table rules, but including employer health insurance contributions and the value of other benefits, and  then identified the median employee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Calculated CEO Pay Ratio. We calculated our median employees annual total  compensation for 2018 according to the SECs instructions for preparing the Summary Compensation Table, including employer health insurance contributions and the value of other benefits. We then calculated our CEOs annual total  compensation using the same approach to determine the pay ratio shown above.  
[END TABLE]
We invest in our employees at all levels in the company by rewarding performance that balances risk and reward, empowering professional growth and development, and by offering affordable benefits and programs that meet the diverse needs of our employees and their families. See "Being a Great Place to Work" on page 32 for additional details. 
PROPOSAL 3: RATIFYING THE APPOINTMENT OF OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019 
PROPOSAL 3: RATIFYING THE APPOINTMENT OF OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019 
Our Board recommends a vote "FOR" ratifying the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 (Proposal 3). 
Our Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm, and is involved in the selection of the firm's lead engagement partner who is subject to a mandatory, regular rotation and who may provide services to our company for a maximum of five consecutive years. In selecting and approving a lead engagement partner, the Committee relies on relevant succession criteria established by management and the Committee, interactions with prospective candidates, assessments of their professional experience, and input from our company's independent public accounting firm. The Committee also engages in an annual evaluation of the independent public accounting firm. It considers, in particular, whether the retention of the firm is in the best interests of our company and its stockholders, taking into account the firm's quality of service, the firm's institutional knowledge and experience, our company's global operations and businesses, the firm's sufficiency of resources, the quality of the communication and interaction with the firm, and the firm's independence, objectivity, and professional skepticism. The Committee also considers the advisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent public accounting firm. 
After assessing the qualifications, performance, and independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), which has served as our company's independent registered public accounting firm since 1958, the Committee believes that retaining PwC is in the best interests of our company. The Committee has appointed PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the 2019 consolidated financial statements of Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries. Although it is not required to do so, our Board is asking stockholders to ratify PwC's appointment. If our stockholders do not ratify PwC's appointment, the Committee will consider changing our independent registered public accounting firm for 2020. Whether or not stockholders ratify PwC's appointment, the Committee may appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that such a change is appropriate. 
PwC has advised the Committee that it is an independent accounting firm with respect to our company and its affiliates in accordance with the requirements of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
Representatives of PwC are expected to be present at our annual meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they choose, and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate stockholder questions. 
PwC's 2018 and 2017 Fees. PwC's aggregate fees for professional services rendered in or provided for 2018 and 2017, as applicable, were:

Tax Fees. Tax fees cover tax compliance, advisory, and planning services and are those billed or expected to be billed for services rendered during each fiscal year. 
All Other Fees. During 2017 and 2018, All Other Fees consisted primarily of amounts billed or expected to be billed for the company's engagement of PwC to provide guidance in connection with regulatory commitments. 
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
Our Audit Committee annually pre-approves a list of services that PwC may provide without obtaining the Committee's engagement-specific pre-approval and sets pre-approved fee levels for such services. The pre-approved list of services consists of audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and all other services. All requests or applications for PwC services must be submitted to members of our corporate audit function or tax function to determine if they are included within the Committee's pre-approved list of services. The Committee or the Committee chair must specifically approve any type of service that has not been pre-approved. The Committee or the Committee chair must also approve any proposed service that has been pre-approved but has fees that will exceed the pre-approved level. All pre-approvals by the Committee chair must be presented to the full Committee at its next meeting. The Committee or the Committee chair pre-approved all of PwC's 2018 fees and services. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
Our Audit Committee is composed of seven Board members. Our Board has determined that all Committee members are independent under the NYSE listing standards, our Categorical Standards, and applicable SEC rules and regulations. Our Board has also determined that all Committee members are financially literate in accordance with NYSE listing standards and qualify as "audit committee financial experts" as defined by SEC rules. The Committee's responsibilities are stated in a written charter adopted by our Board. 
Management is responsible for preparing and the overall reporting process with respect to our company's consolidated financial statements, and, with the assistance of our company's internal corporate auditors, for establishing, maintaining, and assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), our company's independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for planning and conducting an independent audit of our company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and for expressing an opinion as to the conformity of these financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. The Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. 
The Committee annually evaluates PwC's qualifications, performance, and independence. The Committee also oversees the performance of the corporate audit function managed by our Chief Audit Executive. The Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and with PwC our company's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, management's assessment of the effectiveness of our company's internal control over financial reporting, and PwC's evaluation of our company's internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the Committee has discussed with PwC the matters that independent registered public accounting firms must communicate to audit committees under applicable PCAOB standards. 
The Committee has also discussed and confirmed with PwC its independence from our company, and received all required written disclosures and correspondence required by the PCAOB Ethics and Independence requirements. The Committee has evaluated and concluded the non-audit services provided by PwC to our company do not impair PwC's independence. 
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, and discussions with the Committee's independent disclosure counsel, the Committee recommended to our Board that the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the related footnotes be included in our company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

🌑    The terms of the KEEP are aligned with stockholders interests, including a minimum vesting requirement, no automatic  single-trigger vesting for key employees upon change in control, no liberal share counting, no use of discounted stock options or stock appreciation rights (SARs), and no use of reload options.

[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    We have robust compensation governance and employee equity award practices, including dividend payout only after vesting and  performance conditions are met, and cancellation and clawback features in all awards.  
[END TABLE]
Background 
We currently maintain the KEEP, which was last approved by stockholders in 2015 with more than 94% of stockholder votes cast in favor of the plan. Under this plan, we have reserved a number of shares of our common stock for issuance to key employees (including executive officers) as equity-based awards in the form of restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, stock options, and SARs. The KEEP was amended in December 2018, in connection with discontinuing the Bank of America Corporation Directors' Stock Plan (Directors' Stock Plan), to permit restricted stock awards to non-employee directors on the same basis as was applicable under the Directors' Stock Plan. The KEEP is currently scheduled to expire on May 5, 2025. In March 2019, our Board approved the amendment to the KEEP, subject to the approval of our stockholders at the annual meeting, principally to increase the number of shares available for grant and extend the plan term, as described below. 
Material Changes to the KEEP 
The amendment to the KEEP makes two material changes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    The number of shares of our common stock available for awards under the KEEP will be increased by 150 million shares.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    The amendment extends the KEEP term through April 23, 2029 (i.e., 10 years after the date of the annual meeting).   
[END TABLE]
The amendment also updates provisions regarding minimum vesting requirements and tax withholding. 
Impact of the Amendment Based on Information as of March 4, 2019 
As of March 4, 2019, under the current authorization, there are 149 million shares of common stock available for grant as equity-based awards. Based on our current run rate, these shares would last less than two years, while the current plan term has six years remaining. We believe it is appropriate to increase the number of shares of our common stock available for awards under the KEEP so that our company can continue the practice of granting deferred equity-based awards in lieu of cash. 
We estimate the total dilutive effect of our stock plans on our stockholders (sometimes called "overhang") resulting from the amendment to the KEEP would be approximately 4.7%, with the incremental overhang resulting from the requested share increase equal to approximately 1.4%. The overhang is calculated as follows, in each case as of the record date of March 4, 2019: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (a) Incremental share request subject to stockholder approval          150,000,000

Also includes 818,853 vested restricted stock units and stock option gain deferrals that were assumed by the company in connection with prior  acquisitions under whose plans the awards were originally granted.

(2)  The total number of noncompensatory warrants and convertible instruments as of March 4, 2019 was 61,603,640, and is not  reflected in the table above.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Includes 149,292,353 shares of common stock available for future issuance under the KEEP and 59,454 shares of common stock  which are available for future issuance under the Directors' Stock Plan. As of January 1, 2019, grants of stock awards to the company's non-employee directors will be made under the KEEP.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  To determine the sum of (e) plus (f) for this calculation, 62,889 restricted stock shares included in both (e) and (f) are  counted only once to prevent duplicative aggregation.  
[END TABLE]
Based on data available as of December 31, 2018, our level of overhang was lower than the average for our primary competitor group. Additionally, our rate at which we grant equity awards relative to shares of our common stock outstanding (sometimes referred to as "run rate") was below the average run rate for our primary competitor group on a one-year and three-year average basis. For the past three calendar years (2016-2018), the weighted average annual share usage is 1.0% of our common shares outstanding. If the KEEP is approved, we expect the pool of requested shares to last approximately three years assuming we maintain similar grant practices as over the past two years and assuming hypothetically our current stock price remains constant. 
The number of shares remaining available for grant under our equity compensation plans as noted in the previous table differs from those reported as of December 31, 2018 because that information does not take into account year-to-date grants during 2019 for the 2018 performance year. Information regarding the number of shares remaining available for grant as required by SEC disclosure rules are discussed in detail under "Additional Information" on page 79. 
The list of companies included in our primary competitor group are detailed under "Competitor Groups" on page 55. 
Purpose 
The KEEP is intended to serve a critical role in our pay-for-performance compensation program. In addition, our Board believes that equity-based awards aid in our ability to attract, retain and motivate our employees and is the most direct way to align employee interests with those of stockholders. As part of our pay-for-performance practices, more than 90,000 employees receive variable incentives. More highly compensated employees receive a portion of their variable incentive as deferred restricted stock units (RSUs). The portion of the variable incentive deferred as equity-based awards generally increases with compensation levels according to a predetermined deferral grid, aligning employees' interests with those of stockholders. The RSU awards are a key part of our pay-for-performance philosophy, and in many cases are required by law, rule, and regulation. In addition, our executive officers receive PRSUs that must be re-earned by meeting specific performance criteria, as described on page 54 for awards granted in February 2019. Equity awards granted to employees are subject to cancellation and clawback features which encourage appropriate behavior and manage risk in our compensation program; these features are described on page 48. 
The value of RSUs tracks the price of our common shares. Compensation expense is in the personnel expense line of the income statement. 
The KEEP is the company's vehicle for delivering deferred equity-based awards. Since the KEEP was last approved by stockholders in 2015, the amount of common stock awarded has averaged approximately 100 million shares each year; we now have 149 million shares remaining for awards under the KEEP. The Board has determined to increase the shares of our common stock available for awards under the plan by 150 million shares to enable the granting of plan awards in the future. The alternative would be to increase the use of deferred cash awards, which we believe would be less aligned with stockholder interests. Therefore, the Board recommends amending the KEEP to increase the number of shares of common stock available for awards under the plan. 
In addition, for the last three years, the company has repurchased shares of common stock, in an amount equal to the value of stock-settled equity awards as they are recognized into capital. These share repurchases offset the net new shares of common stock delivered under the KEEP. The company currently intends to continue this repurchase practice. The company's common stock repurchases are subject to required regulatory and Board approvals. 
The additional 150 million shares authorized under the KEEP would allow our company to continue current grant practices for approximately three years.

PROPOSAL 4: AMENDING THE BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION KEY EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLAN 
Overview of the KEEP 
The following is a summary of the material terms of the KEEP, as amended. It is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the KEEP, as amended. A copy of the KEEP, marked to show the amendment approved by the Board in March 2019, is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix B. The proposed amendment to the KEEP will become effective only if the KEEP, as amended, is approved by our stockholders. 
Number of Shares 
The KEEP, as approved by stockholders in 2015, provides that the aggregate number of shares of our common stock available for grants of awards under the plan from and after January 1, 2015 will not exceed the sum of (i) 450 million shares plus (ii) any shares that were subject to an award as of December 31, 2014 under the KEEP, if such award is cancelled, terminates, expires, lapses or is settled in cash for any reason from and after January 1, 2015. As of March 4, 2019, there were approximately 149 million common shares available for future awards under the KEEP. The amendment to the KEEP, if approved by stockholders, would increase the number of shares available for awards by 150 million shares, to approximately 299 million shares estimated based on information available on March 4, 2019. 
Under the KEEP, each award, whether granted as a stock option, SAR, restricted stock share or restricted stock unit, counts against the available share pool as one share for each share awarded. 
The share re-use provisions under the KEEP do not include any "liberal share counting" features. Shares covered by awards will continue to be available for awards if and only to the extent (a) the award is cancelled or forfeited or (b) the award is settled in cash. Shares used to cover the exercise price of stock options or to cover any tax withholding obligations in connection with awards will continue to be unavailable for awards under the KEEP. In addition, the total number of shares covering stock-settled SARs or net-settled options will be counted against the pool of available shares, not just the net shares issued upon exercise. 
Administration     
The KEEP is primarily administered by the Compensation and Benefits Committee. To the extent permitted by law, the Compensation and Benefits Committee may designate an individual or committee (which need not consist of directors) to act as the appropriate committee under the KEEP for granting awards to key employees who are not "officers" under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act or "covered employees" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Under the KEEP, the Compensation and Benefits Committee has authority with respect to the following:

The Board administers grants of restricted stock under the KEEP to non-employee directors. 
Eligibility 
Except for certain non-employee director restricted stock awards as described below, "key employees" of Bank of America and its subsidiaries may participate in the KEEP, as selected by the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Key employees are those employees of Bank of America and its subsidiaries who occupy managerial or other important positions and who have made, or are expected to make, important contributions to our business, as determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee, including persons employed outside the United States. Approximately 95,000 employees are expected to be eligible to participate. However, as mentioned above, the Compensation and Benefits Committee in its discretion selects which key employees will receive any awards. Following discontinuance of the Directors' Stock Plan, the KEEP also provides for 
PROPOSAL 4: AMENDING THE BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION KEY EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLAN 
awards of restricted stock to non-employee directors as part of our director compensation program. All 15 of the non-employee directors nominated for election at the annual meeting are eligible to receive these restricted stock awards. As noted elsewhere in this proxy statement, as part of our director compensation program, our Board grants restricted stock to directors on the day of their election or appointment as a director. Any director nominee that receives at least a majority of votes cast at the annual meeting will be elected at the annual meeting, and will be eligible to receive the restricted stock award as part of their 2019-2020 director compensation. In the event this proposal to amend the KEEP does not receive at least a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting, and the amended KEEP does not become effective, there are enough common shares remaining for issuance in the KEEP to grant directors elected at the annual meeting the 2019-2020 restricted stock award. 
Types of Awards 
The KEEP permits awards of stock options, SARs, restricted stock shares and restricted stock units to key employees and restricted stock shares to non-employee directors, all of which are described in more detail below. 
Awards of Stock Options and SARs. The KEEP provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of our common stock at option prices which are not less than the fair market value of a share of our common stock at the close of business on the date of grant. (The fair market value of a share of our common stock as of March 4, 2019, was $29.03.) The KEEP also provides for the grant of SARs to key employees. SARs entitle the holder upon exercise to receive either cash or shares of our common stock or a combination of the two, as the Compensation and Benefits Committee in its discretion may determine, with a value equal to the difference between: (i) the fair market value on the exercise date of the shares with respect to which a SAR is exercised; and (ii) the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. 
Awards of options under the KEEP, which may be either incentive stock options (which qualify for special tax treatment) or nonqualified stock options, are determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee. No more than an aggregate of 450 million shares may be awarded as incentive stock options under the KEEP. The terms and conditions of each option and SAR are to be determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee (or its designees) at the time of grant. 
Options and SARs granted under the KEEP will expire not more than 10 years from the date of grant, and the award agreements entered into with each participant will specify the extent to which options and SARs may be exercised during their respective terms, including in the event of the participant's death, disability or termination of employment. 
The KEEP includes two additional limitations on stock option and SAR grants. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    The KEEP expressly prohibits dividend equivalents with respect to stock options and SARs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    The KEEP permits nonqualified stock options and SARs to be transferable if and to the extent permitted under the applicable  award agreement, but prohibits transfers to be made for consideration.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board has not granted stock options or SARs since 2008. 
Awards of Restricted Stock Shares and Restricted Stock Units. Under the KEEP, the Compensation and Benefits Committee may award key employees restricted shares of our common stock or restricted stock units which represent the right to receive shares of our common stock (or cash equal to the fair market value of those shares). Each award agreement will contain the terms of the award, including any applicable conditions, which may include continued service of the participant, the attainment of specified performance goals or any other conditions deemed appropriate by the Compensation and Benefits Committee. 
Restricted stock shares will be held in our custody until the applicable restrictions have been satisfied. The participant cannot sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise alienate or hypothecate restricted stock shares until the applicable restrictions are satisfied. Once the restrictions are satisfied, the shares will be delivered to the participant's account, free of restrictions. During the period of restriction, the participant may exercise full voting rights with respect to the restricted stock shares. The participant will also be credited with dividends with respect to restricted stock shares. Dividends may be payable currently or subject to additional restrictions as determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee and reflected in the award agreement. Our grant practice has been not to pay dividends on restricted stock shares during the vesting period, but to accrue those dividends with interest from the grant date to be paid only if and when the underlying award becomes vested. 
The award agreement for any restricted stock units will specify whether units that become earned and payable will be settled in shares of our common stock (with one share of common stock to be delivered for each earned and payable restricted stock unit), in cash (equal to the aggregate fair market value of the restricted stock units that are earned and payable), or in a combination of shares and cash. Shares of our common stock used to pay earned restricted stock units may have additional restrictions, as determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee. Unpaid restricted stock units may have dividend equivalent rights, as determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee and evidenced in the award agreement. As with restricted stock shares, our grant practice has been to include dividend equivalent rights for awards of restricted stock units that accrue with interest from the grant date and are paid only if and when the underlying award becomes vested. Unpaid restricted stock units have no voting rights. 
PROPOSAL 4: AMENDING THE BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION KEY EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLAN 
The KEEP also provides for awards of restricted stock to our non-employee directors as part of our director compensation program. As under the prior Directors' Stock Plan, these awards vest one year after the date of grant or, if earlier, at the date of the next annual meeting. However, awards that are scheduled to vest in less than 50 weeks after the date of grant will count against the 5% exception pool for the minimum vesting requirements described below. The awards vest earlier in case of death, disability or a change in control. If a director retires before the one-year vesting date, a prorated amount of the award vests based on the number of days the director served during the vesting period before retirement. Awards may be deferred under the Bank of America Corporation Director Deferral Plan. See "Director Compensation" on page 39 for additional details about our director compensation program. 
Minimum Vesting Conditions 
The KEEP as approved in 2015 provides that for stock-settled awards intended to vest based solely on the passage of time, the awards will not vest more quickly than ratably over a three-year period, subject to exceptions such as for awards to newly hired employees. The KEEP, as amended, updates these minimum vesting requirements so that generally all stock-settled awards will vest no more quickly than ratably annually as of each anniversary over a three-year period beginning on the grant date of the award. This requirement does not apply to (1) certain substitute awards arising from acquisitions, (2) shares delivered in lieu of fully vested cash incentive awards, (3) awards to non-employee directors that vest on the earlier of the one year anniversary of the date of grant or the next annual meeting of stockholders (but not sooner than 50 weeks after the grant date) or (4) awards that vest based on the achievement of performance goals over a period of at least one year. Also, the Compensation and Benefits Committee may grant equity-based awards without regard to the minimum vesting requirement with respect to a maximum of 5% of the available share reserve authorized for issuance under the KEEP. In addition, the minimum vesting requirement does not apply to the Compensation and Benefits Committee's discretion to provide for accelerated exercisability or vesting of any award, including in cases of retirement, workforce reduction, death, disability, or a change in control, in the terms of the award or otherwise. 
Section 162(m) Award Limits 
Prior to 2018, awards under the KEEP could be designed to qualify as "performance-based compensation" that is exempt from the deduction limits under Section 162(m) of the Code. Changes in the U.S. tax laws eliminated this exception for grants made from and after January 1, 2018. The KEEP, however, continues to include award limits related to this prior tax law, under which a participant may not be granted in any calendar year: (i) stock options or SARs for more than 4,000,000 shares, or (ii) performance-based restricted stock shares/units intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) (as in effect before 2018) for more than 4,000,000 shares (assuming maximum performance). 
Withholding for Payment of Taxes 
The KEEP provides for the withholding and payment by a participant of any payroll or withholding taxes required by applicable law. The KEEP permits a participant to satisfy this requirement, with the approval of the Compensation and Benefits Committee and subject to the terms of the KEEP, by withholding from the participant a number of shares of our common stock otherwise issuable under the award having a fair market value equal to the amount of applicable payroll and withholding taxes. The amendment to the KEEP, if approved by stockholders, would permit the Company and the participant to withhold at rates up to the maximum statutory tax rates. 
Adjustments for Changes in Capitalization 
In the event of any change in the number of our outstanding shares of common stock by reason of any stock dividend, split, spin-off, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares or otherwise, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock with respect to which awards may be made under the KEEP, the annual limit on individual awards, the limits on incentive stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units and the terms, types of shares and number of shares of any outstanding awards under the KEEP will be equitably adjusted by the Compensation and Benefits Committee in its discretion to preserve the benefit of the award for us and the participant. 
No Single Trigger Vesting Upon a Change in Control for Key Employees 
The KEEP permits the Compensation and Benefits Committee to provide for vesting of awards to key employees in connection with a change in control of Bank of America if there is also a termination of employment in connection with the change in control. This is often referred to as "double trigger" vesting. For these purposes, a termination is considered to be in 
PROPOSAL 4: AMENDING THE BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION KEY EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLAN 
connection with a change of control if it occurs upon or within two years after the change in control and is for one of the following two reasons: (i) an involuntary termination by the company without "cause" or (ii) a termination by the participant for "good reason." "Cause" and "good reason" will be as defined in the applicable award agreements. In addition, the Committee may provide for the assumption or substitution of awards by a surviving corporation. Awards to non-employee directors fully vest upon a change in control. 
Amendment and Termination of the Plan 
Our Board has the power to amend, modify or terminate the KEEP on a prospective basis. Stockholder approval will be obtained for any change to the material terms of the KEEP to the extent required by New York Stock Exchange listing requirements or other applicable law. The KEEP, as amended, automatically terminates at the close of business on April 23, 2029, following which no awards may be made under the KEEP. 
Option and SARs Repricing Prohibited 
The KEEP specifically prohibits the repricing of stock options or SARs without stockholder approval. For this purpose, a "repricing" means any of the following (or any other action that has the same effect as any of the following): (A) changing the terms of a stock option or SAR to lower its exercise price; (B) any other action that is treated as a "repricing" under generally accepted accounting principles; and (C) repurchasing for cash or canceling a stock option or SAR at a time when its exercise price is greater than the fair market value of the underlying stock in exchange for another award, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with change in capitalization or similar change. Such cancellation and exchange would be considered a "repricing" regardless of whether it is treated as a "repricing" under generally accepted accounting principles and regardless of whether it is voluntary on the part of the key employee. 
Federal Income Tax Treatment 
The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of awards under the KEEP based on the law as in effect on the date of this document. The following discussion does not purport to cover federal employment taxes or other federal tax consequences that may be employed with awards, nor does it cover state, local or non-U.S. taxes. 
Nonqualified Stock Options. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant or vesting of a nonqualified stock option with an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and no additional deferral feature. Upon the exercise of a nonqualified stock option, a participant generally will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares underlying the stock option on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the stock option. When a participant sells the shares, the participant will have short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, as the case may be, equal to the difference between the amount the participant received from the sale and the tax basis of the shares sold. The tax basis of the shares generally will be equal to the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date. 
Incentive Stock Options. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant of an incentive stock option. If a participant exercises an incentive stock option during employment or within three months after employment ends (12 months in the case of permanent and total disability), the participant will not recognize taxable income at the time of exercise for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes (although the participant generally will have taxable income for alternative minimum tax purposes at that time as if the stock option were a nonqualified stock option). If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of the shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option after the later of (a) one year from the date the participant exercised the option and (b) two years from the grant date of the stock option, the participant generally will recognize long-term capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount the participant received in the disposition and the exercise price of the stock option. If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option before these holding period requirements are satisfied, the disposition will constitute a "disqualifying disposition," and the participant generally will recognize taxable ordinary income in the year of disposition equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price of the stock option (or, if less, the excess of the amount realized on the disposition of the shares over the exercise price of the stock option). The balance of the participant's gain on a disqualifying disposition, if any, will be taxed as short-term or long-term capital gain, as the case may be. 
With respect to both nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options, special rules apply if a participant uses shares of common stock already held by the participant to pay the exercise price or if the shares received upon exercise of the stock option are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture by the participant. 
PROPOSAL 4: AMENDING THE BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION KEY EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLAN 
Stock Appreciation Rights. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant or vesting of a SAR with a grant price at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and no additional deferral feature. Upon the exercise of a SAR, a participant generally will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares underlying the SAR on the date of exercise and the grant price of the SAR. 
Restricted Stock Shares and Restricted Stock Units. A participant generally will not have taxable income upon the grant of restricted stock or restricted stock units. Instead, the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of vesting or payout equal to the fair market value (on the vesting or payout date) of the shares or cash received minus any amount paid. For restricted stock only, a participant may instead elect to be taxed at the time of grant. 
Tax Consequences to Bank of America. In the foregoing cases, we generally will be entitled to a deduction at the same time, and in the same amount, as a participant recognizes ordinary income, subject to certain limitations imposed under the Code, including those imposed by Section 162(m) as applicable. 
New Stock Plan Benefits 
Because awards under the KEEP are discretionary, awards are generally not determinable at this time. As stated previously, in the event the amended KEEP is not approved by stockholders at the annual meeting, there are enough shares remaining under the KEEP for the Board to grant restricted stock awards to directors elected at the annual meeting as part of 2019-2020 director compensation.

PROPOSALS 5-7: STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
PROPOSALS 5-7: STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
As noted elsewhere in this proxy statement, we actively seek engagement with stockholders to solicit their views on different matters of importance to them. We encourage this dialogue and believe this engagement is beneficial to our company and Board. Of the three stockholder proposals set forth below, none of the proponents attempted to engage with our company prior to submitting their proposal, and two of the three proponents, Mr. Chevedden and Mr. Steiner, did not respond to our attempts to engage with them after we received their proposal. We acknowledge the rights of stockholders to submit proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement in accordance with SEC rules. We also encourage stockholders that have questions or would like additional information about our practices or policies, or that are contemplating submitting a proposal for inclusion in our proxy statement, to contact us beforehand to allow for a constructive discussion of their concerns. See "Stockholder Proposals for our 2020 Annual Meeting" on page 87. 
As part of our year-round stockholder engagement process, we met with holders of approximately 35% of our outstanding common stock in 2018-19. None of the investors we met with raised concerns about our policies or practices that are the subjects of the stockholder proposals below. 
Our Board recommends a vote "AGAINST" these stockholder proposals (Proposals 5-[]). 
Proposal 5: Report Concerning Gender Pay Equity 
Ellen Cassilly and Frank Konhaus, c/o Arjuna Capital, 1 Elm Street, Manchester, MA 01944, has advised us that they intend to introduce the following resolution: 
Whereas: The World Economic Forum estimates the gender pay gap costs the economy 1.2 trillion dollars annually. The median income for women working full time in the United States is 80 percent of that of their male counterparts. This disparity can equal nearly half a million dollars over a career. The gap for African American and Latina women is 60 percent and 55 percent. At the current rate, women will not reach pay parity until 2059. 
United States companies have begun reporting statistically adjusted equal pay for equal work numbers, assessing the pay of men and women performing similar jobs, but mostly ignore median pay gaps. The United Kingdom now mandates disclosure of median gender pay gaps. And while Bank of America reported a 30.5 percent median pay gap for its United Kingdom operations, it has not published median information for its global operations. The median pay gap for United Kingdom financial services companies is 22 percent. 
Bank of America reports women earn 99 percent of the compensation received by men on a statistically adjusted equal pay basis. Yet, that statistically adjusted number alone fails to consider how discrimination affects differences in opportunity. In contrast, median pay gap disclosures address the structural bias that affects the jobs women hold, particularly when men hold most higher paying jobs. 
Women account for 54 percent of our company's United States workforce, but only 32 percent of senior leadership. Mercer finds female executives are 20 to 30 percent more likely to leave financial services careers than other careers. Actively managing pay equity "is associated with higher current female representation at the professional through executive levels and a faster trajectory to improved representation." 
Research from Morgan Stanley, McKinsey, and Robeco Sam suggests gender diverse leadership leads to superior stock price performance and return on equity. McKinsey states, "the business case for the advancement and promotion of women is compelling." Best practices include "tracking and eliminating gender pay gaps." 
Public policy risk is of concern, not only in the United Kingdom, but in the United States as well. The Paycheck Fairness Act pends before Congress. California, Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland have strengthened equal pay legislation. The Congressional Joint Economic Committee reports 40 percent of the wage gap may be attributed to discrimination. 
PROPOSALS 5-7: STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
Resolved: Shareholders request Bank of America report on the company's global median gender pay gap, including associated policy, reputational, competitive, and operational risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining female talent. The report should be prepared at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary information, litigation strategy and legal compliance information. 
The gender pay gap is defined as the difference between male and female median earnings expressed as a percentage of male earnings (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development). 
Supporting Statement: A report adequate for investors to assess company strategy and performance would include the percentage global median pay gap between male and female employees across race and ethnicity, including base, bonus and equity compensation. 
Our Board recommends a vote "AGAINST" Proposal 5 because: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    The requested ratio conflates the distinct issues of gender representation and gender pay equity, which we believe are  more effectively addressed and assessed separately.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Our company has practices in place to compensate all of our employees fairly and equitably based on performance, with  equal pay for equal work, regardless of race or gender.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  O     We maintain robust policies and practices reinforcing our commitment, including analyses and reviews with oversight from our  Board and senior leaders.  
  O     Outside experts also examine employee pay before year-end compensation decisions are finalized, and we adjust compensation  where appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    We publicly disclose our progress in compensating all of our employees fairly and equitably.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  O     In our 2018 proxy statement, we reported that among U.S. and U.K. employees, total compensation received by women was equal  to on average 99% of that received by men.  
  O     We expanded the geographic scope of our 2019 review and disclose that the pay ratio is on average greater than 99% of that  received by men on page 34 in this proxy statement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    We focus on recruiting and retaining female talent. Accordingly, we have robust policies and programs to provide women  with opportunities for professional development and advancement, and report on our progress in our ESG reports and our proxy statements.

  O     More than 50% of our global workforce is female, and more than 45% of our U.S.-based workforce are people of color. The  company's senior leadership is similarly diverse—seven of the CEO's 13 direct reports are women and/or people of color, as are seven of our 16 Board members.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    The ratio requested in the proposal would not accurately portray our record of promoting gender equality; recruiting,  retaining, and promoting female employees; and supporting female employee satisfaction.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  O     The ratio requested would provide a misleading and counterproductive perception of the opportunities available to all  employees at all levels within our company, regardless of gender.  
  O     We already report on what outside experts believe are the best metrics by which to measure gender pay equity and gender  representation, including detailed statistics on employee representation at different levels of our company.  
[END TABLE]
The requested ratio conflates the distinct issues of gender representation and gender pay equity, which we believe are more effectively addressed and assessed separately. The proposal requests that we prepare reports on (1) our company's global median gender pay gap, including certain associated risks, and (2) risks related to our company's recruiting and retaining of female talent. As described below, our Board believes such reports are unnecessary in light of our demonstrated and recognized commitment to recruiting and developing female talent at all levels of our organization, and the disclosures we already provide on our company's record of recruiting, retaining, and promoting female talent, including those on page 34 of this proxy statement. We have active and on-going programs that independent experts review, and our executive leadership and Board oversee, to foster gender pay equity through equal pay for equal work. As emphasized elsewhere in this proxy statement, our company believes in and practices pay for performance, not pay based on racial or gender factors. Moreover, our pay policies and practices are just one aspect of our broader program dedicated to the critical issues of providing opportunity, advancement and support for our female employees. Importantly, the median gender pay ratio requested in the proposal conflates two important but distinct issues – gender pay equity (equal pay for equal work) and gender representation (female participation across the spectrum of workforce levels) – and providing the information requested would result in a misleading 
PROPOSALS 5-7: STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
and counterproductive perception of the opportunities available to all employees at all levels within our company, regardless of gender. We believe that these issues are more effectively addressed and assessed separately, and as we discuss below, we provide transparency through the extensive disclosures that we already provide on each of them. 
Our company has practices in place to compensate all of our employees fairly and equitably based on performance, with equal pay for equal work, regardless of race or gender. We maintain robust policies and practices reinforcing our commitment, including analyses and reviews with oversight from our Board and senior leaders. Outside experts also examine employee pay before year-end compensation decisions are finalized, and we adjust compensation where appropriate. Our work to ensure that men and women in similar positions having similar experience and performance receive comparable pay is fundamental to being a great place to work, which is core to how we drive Responsible Growth. We have established robust policies and practices to help guide pay decisions, and our human resources team, company leadership, and Board are involved on an ongoing basis to monitor pay equity. Each year, we engage in a thorough and rigorous inspection process, which, together with our detailed governance framework and independent analyses by an external consulting firm, allows us to identify potential areas for adjustment and take appropriate action prior to pay decisions being made. If pay misalignment is identified, we take action where appropriate to bring an individual employee in line with their comparable peers, making compensation adjustments as part of our annual year-end process in real time. This process, which has been in place for over a decade, reinforces our culture and commitment to pay our employees equitably. 
We publicly disclose our progress in compensating all of our employees fairly and equitably. In our 2018 proxy statement, we reported that among U.S. and U.K. employees, total compensation received by women was equal to on average 99% of that received by men. We expanded the geographic scope of our 2019 review and disclose that the pay ratio is on average greater than 99% of that received by men on page 34 in this proxy statement. As we disclosed in our 2018 proxy statement, our 2018 pay equity review (measuring equal pay for equal work) of total compensation for U.S. and U.K. employees (approximately 80% of our global workforce), showed that compensation received by women was equal to on average 99% of that received by men, and that compensation received by minority teammates was equal to on average 99% of non-minority teammates. These results continue to inform our pay-for-performance culture, including how we continue to bridge any gaps that exist or may exist in the future. We are committed to expanding these compensation analyses by our outside compensation expert to include review of additional international locations on an annual basis. Accordingly, we expanded the geographic scope of our 2019 pay equity review to include international locations where we have significant employee presence– France, Ireland, Hong Kong, Singapore– to encompass approximately 82% of our global workforce. The results show that compensation received by women is on average greater than 99% of that received by men and that compensation received by teammates who are people of color is on average greater than 99% of teammates who are not people of color. Additional detail regarding this review and results are disclosed on page 34 of this proxy statement. 
We focus on recruiting and retaining female talent. Accordingly, we have a robust set of policies and programs to provide women with opportunities for professional development and advancement, and report our progress in our ESG reports and our proxy statements. To drive sustainable Responsible Growth, we are focused on our numerous policies and practices that support and advance our comprehensive goal of providing opportunity, advancement and job satisfaction for all employees, including women. We devote substantial resources to attract talented women to join our company. We continue to attract diverse talent and provide female employees with the tools and programs to support their success. For example, we partner with more than 200 colleges, universities and other organizations around the world to attract diverse talent. In 2018, our recruiting initiatives increased the representation of women across our intern and full-time classes to 45% and 41%, respectively. Once these women join our company, we focus on cultivating, developing and empowering their talents through a variety of internal networks and conferences. For example: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Our  Learning & Leadership Development team actively supports women at the company with guidance through career and life changes, one-on-one executive support, and  tailored development and career path plans to help advance their careers;  
[END TABLE]

🌑    Our  Investing in Women Leadership Council for senior executives and employee networks for women at all levels play key roles in building the culture of our company, focusing on recruitment, development, networking, culture and community engagement; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Through our  Global Ambassadors Program, we empower our female employees to share their insights with women outside the company, helping more women use their skills to impact the world. The program connects women leaders of social enterprises and small  businesses to women executives for mentoring to help them realize their economic potential.  
[END TABLE]
We also offer industry leading benefits, including 16 weeks of paid parental leave and an adult care services program to help employees care for a parent or other adult loved one, and offer flexible work arrangements like job sharing, compressed work weeks, and reduced hours—all designed to help employees better manage life and work schedules. 
PROPOSALS 5-7: STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
Notwithstanding our significant progress in recruiting, retaining, and promoting female employees, it is an important part of Responsible Growth that we continue efforts to close certain narrow gender representation gaps in technology and certain revenue-producing areas. We are committed to using our available resources to address these issues. 
We are recognized as a global leader in developing and supporting our female employees, including by numerous third-party advocates specializing in the promotion and advancement of women. Our executive leadership and Board have strongly supported and guided our programs dedicated to recruiting, developing, and empowering women. This commitment has resulted in strong representation of women across our company, significantly outpacing industry benchmarks. More than 50% of our global workforce is female, and more than 45% of our U.S.-based workforce are people of color. The company's senior leadership is similarly diverse—seven of the CEO's 13 direct reports are women and/or people of color, as are seven of our 16 Board members. More than 40% of our global managers are female, and approximately 45% of our senior level employees are female, and our management team is over 45% women, which is more than double the 16% industry benchmark reported in the most recent Oliver Wyman Women in Financial Services report. More than 30% of our Board is female, which is significantly higher than the industry benchmark of 20% reported in the Oliver Wyman study and the S&P 500 benchmark of 24% reported in the 2018 Spencer Stuart Board Index. 
Our long-standing commitment to and support of gender equality, and diversity and inclusion has not gone unnoticed. We have been repeatedly recognized by independent third-parties for our leadership. For example, we were recently named the 2019 Catalyst Award winner by Catalyst, a global nonprofit working with CEOs and leading companies to build workplaces that work for women. We earned the honor based on our ongoing efforts to be a great place to work and to support the continued development, empowerment and advancement of women at our company and around the world. In addition, we were named World's Best Bank by Euromoney in 2018, including World's Best Bank for Diversity & Inclusion in 2018 and 2016. We have also been recognized as one of the leading financial institutions on the Bloomberg Financial Services Gender-Equality Index every year since its inception. Similarly, JUST Capital named us as one of America's Most JUST Companies, including as the industry leader (No. 1 out of 42) in the "Banks" category, specifically mentioning our commitment to gender pay equity and gender diversity in management. More broadly, we have been repeatedly recognized for the resources we provide our employees. For example, Fortune Magazine recently named us as one of the 50 Best Workplaces for Parents and one of the 100 Best Workplaces for Diversity. Our company has been designated one of Working Mother Magazine's 100 Best Companies for 30 consecutive years and we were named a Top Company for Women Technologists by the Anita Borg Institute. 
The ratio requested in the proposal would not accurately portray our record of promoting gender equality; recruiting, retaining, and promoting female employees, and supporting female employee satisfaction. It would provide a misleading and counterproductive perception of the opportunities available to women at all levels within our company, regardless of gender. We already report on what outside experts believe are the best metrics by which to measure gender pay equity and gender representation, including detailed statistics on employee representation at different levels of our company. We believe comparing compensation of male and female employees at the median without adjusting for their different roles, experiences, performance, locations, and other factors is misleading, and is not a common metric for pay equity comparisons in the United States. Our compensation policies and practices are based on an employee's role, individual experience and performance, and location, not by median gender or ethnicity data. For example, comparing the median male employee's total compensation with the median female employee's total compensation as the proposal requests, would almost certainly result in comparing two individuals whose jobs are professionally distinct and whose primary commonality is the fact that they both work at our company. The ratio sought in the proposal would mislead our stockholders, stakeholders, and current and prospective employees because it does not reflect pay-for-performance for equal roles, disregards our substantial efforts to improve gender representation at all levels, and ignores the voices of how our company's female employees feel about working at Bank of America. 
As we have illustrated above, recruiting, retaining, supporting, and promoting our female employees is a complex and multi-faceted process. Given the important roles women play in our workforce, with our customer base, in the communities we serve, and society generally, our Responsible Growth can succeed only if we provide the best place for women to work and thrive professionally. Our 2018 annual employee satisfaction survey results reflected the highest employee engagement scores in the company's history, with female engagement results two percentage points higher than those for men. This indicia of personal job fulfillment cannot be captured or expressed in the reports requested by the proposal. We believe the global median gender pay gap ratio suggested in the proposal is an inaccurate and simplistic metric for portraying a complex societal issue that extends beyond our sphere of specific influence. It also does not take into consideration the breadth and depth of our non-remunerative efforts to support and retain our female teammates. 
In light of our strong, broad, transparent and well-recognized commitment to fair and equitable compensation of our employees, the rigor of our compensation review process which includes review and analyses internally and by outside experts, and our programs for and commitment to increasing gender diversity at our company through recruiting and empowering women, we 
PROPOSALS 5-7: STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
believe that the reports requested under the proposal are misconceived and unnecessary. Moreover, the median gender pay ratio requested in the proposal confuses two important issues – gender pay equity and gender representation – resulting in a misleading and counterproductive perception of the opportunities available to men and women at all levels of our company. 
Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote "AGAINST" this proposal (Proposal 5). 
Proposal 6: Right to Act by Written Consent 
Kenneth Steiner, 14 Stoner Avenue, 2M, Great Neck, NY 11021, has advised us that he intends to present the following resolution: 
Resolved, Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any valid topic for written consent. 
Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. Taking action by written consent in place of a meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle. 
This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 major companies in a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. This proposal topic would have received a vote still higher than 67% at Allstate and Sprint if most shareholders at Allstate and Sprint had access to independent proxy voting advice. 
Shareholder proposals such as this have taken a leadership role to improve the corporate governance rules of many companies. The ability to elect a director by written consent would give our current directors a greater incentive to manage the following problem more effectively: 
Announcement of new share repurchase authorization of $20 Billion common shares from July 2018 to June 2019. 
There is a concern about share repurchases. Stock buybacks can be a sign of short-termism for executives – sometimes boosting share price without boosting the underlying value, profitability, or ingenuity of the company. A dollar spent repurchasing a share is a dollar that cannot be spent on new equipment, an acquisition, entry into a new market or anything else. 
Our directors also need a greater incentive to improve the Board of Directors. We did not have an independent chairman. Plus our Lead Director, Jack Bovender, is retired and was not getting any fresh director experience at any other major company to keep his skills up-to-date. And director Arnold Donald received 10-times the negative votes as certain other Bank of America directors. 
The expectation is that, once this proposal is adopted, shareholders would not need to make use of this right of written consent because its mere existence will act as a guardrail to help ensue [sic] that our company is well supervised by the Board of Directors and management. Our Directors and management will want to avoid shareholder action by written consent and will thus be more alert in avoiding poor performance.

PROPOSALS 5-7: STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
The proposal requests that the company take the steps necessary to permit stockholders to act by written consent. We are committed to effective corporate governance policies and practices that promote the long-term interests of all stockholders. As described below, our Board believes that the change requested by the proposal could be unfair and disenfranchising to stockholders, is unnecessary in light of our current governance practices and policies, and is more onerous to use than rights already available to our stockholders. 
We believe that matters requiring stockholder approval should be presented to, and voted on, by all stockholders. Unlike matters presented for vote at a stockholder meeting, stockholder action by written consent may not require communication to all stockholders and may deny stockholders the ability to participate in major decisions affecting the company and their interests. A stockholder seeking action by written consent may attempt to solicit the fewest possible stockholders to take action, rather than seeking input from all stockholders, and may rely on consents obtained from some stockholders before other stockholders have had the ability to evaluate a proposal, express their views, and vote. Action by written consent thereby can disenfranchise stockholders who are not given the opportunity to vote. In contrast, when stockholders can act at a special or annual meeting of stockholders, all stockholders receive advance notice of the meeting and have clearly established times during which they can evaluate the issues, engage with the company and other stockholders, communicate their views, and vote. Moreover, permitting stockholder action by written consent could create confusion and disruption, as multiple stockholders could solicit written consents at any time on a wide range of issues, which may duplicate or conflict with other proposals. 
Stockholders owning 10% of our common shares already have the ability to call a special meeting of stockholders outside of the annual meeting cycle, and stockholders owning 20% of our common shares already have the ability to nominate a candidate for election to our Board through our proxy access Bylaw provision. In addition to stockholders being able to propose and vote on important matters at our annual meeting, one or more stockholders owning 10% or more of our outstanding common stock are entitled to call a special meeting of stockholders. A special meeting permits stockholders, the Board, and company management to discuss applicable stockholder concerns. Unlike action by written consent, a special meeting of stockholders allows all stockholders to participate collectively in a single meeting and make an informed vote. The ability for 10% of our stockholders to call a special meeting represents a significant and unique right for our stockholders. Of the 303 S&P 500 companies that permit stockholders to call a special meeting, more than 82% of those companies have a stock ownership threshold greater than 10%, with the most common stock ownership threshold set at 25%. 
In 2015, we were among the first companies to adopt a proxy access Bylaw provision. This provision allows stockholders owning 20% or more of our outstanding common stock the right to nominate director candidates constituting up to 20% of our Board, using our proxy materials. This proxy access right and the ability for 10% of our stockholders to call a special meeting each allow our stockholders to voice their views in a way that is less onerous than the proposal's written consent, which would require proposed actions to be approved by holders of at least a majority (or higher if required by Delaware law or our certificate of incorporation) of our outstanding shares. 
The chart below illustrates how our stockholders already have better means of implementing actions than the Proposal:

governance, ESG and executive compensation activities. For example, on page 29 we report on actions we have taken as a result of our extensive stockholder engagement activities. 
Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote "AGAINST" this proposal (Proposal 6). 
Proposal 7: Enhance Shareholder Proxy Access 
John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Ave., No 205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278, has advised us that he intends to present the following resolution: 
RESOLVED: Stockholders ask the board of directors to amend its proxy access bylaw provisions and any associated documents, to include the following change: 
A shareholder proxy access director candidate shall not need to obtain a specific percentage vote in order to qualify as a shareholder proxy access director candidate at any future shareholder meeting. 
Our company now requires that a proxy access candidate receive at least a 20%-vote in order to be a proxy access candidate in the following 2-years. In other words there is a 2-year penalty if a proxy access candidate does not obtain a 20%-vote. This proposal is important because a shareholder proxy access candidate might not get a 20%-vote even if he or she is the most qualified candidate to join our Board of Directors. 
Shareholders may simply believe that at the time of the annual meeting that the company is not ripe for a proxy access candidate and hence may vote against the candidate simply because the timing is not right. A year later a majority of shareholders might determine that the timing is right and hence they should be able to vote for such a highly qualified candidate. 
Please vote yes: 
Enhance Shareholder Proxy Access – Proposal 7 
Our Board recommends a vote "AGAINST" Proposal 7 because: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Our existing proxy access Bylaw provisions strike the appropriate balance between promoting stockholder rights and  protecting the interests of all our stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    The requirement for proxy access nominees to receive a meaningful vote to qualify for  re-nomination is in line with market practice; of those companies having adopted proxy access, a significant majority have a re-nomination threshold for proxy access  nominees; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    We have strong corporate governance policies and procedures that empower our stockholders and encourage stockholders to  provide on-going feedback to our Board.  
[END TABLE]
The proposal requests that the Board amend our proxy access Bylaw to eliminate the condition requiring that director candidates receive a threshold of stockholders' support to be eligible for re-nomination in a subsequent year. Because our proxy access Bylaw provision already provides our stockholders with a meaningful role in the nomination and election of directors and aligns with current market practice, and in light of our long-standing commitment to strong corporate governance and stockholder engagement, we believe the changes requested by the proposal are unnecessary and contrary to our stockholders' interests. 
Our existing proxy access Bylaw provisions strike the appropriate balance between promoting stockholder rights and protecting the interests of all our stockholders. In March 2015, our company was the first major financial institution, and one of the first large U.S. public companies, to amend our Bylaws to adopt a proxy access provision. This Bylaw provision allows one or more stockholders to nominate director candidates for election to our Board, and for those director candidates to be included in our proxy materials. Under our proxy access Bylaw, a group of up to 20 stockholders, which collectively has owned at least 3% of our common stock for at least three years, may nominate director nominees constituting up to 20% of our Board, subject to certain informational and procedural requirements. Our Board evaluated a number of different factors and potential formulations in adopting our proxy access Bylaw, and considered the right of stockholders to have meaningful participation in the director election process, as well as the importance of instituting reasonable thresholds on re-nomination so repetitive proxy access director candidates who receive low stockholder support do not impose additional administrative costs and confusion on the company's stockholders. 
PROPOSALS 5-7: STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
Based on its assessment of these factors and the particular characteristics of the company and our stockholders, our Board concluded that our current form of proxy access Bylaw appropriately balances stockholder rights to use proxy access with the best interests of all our stockholders. For example, the Bylaw provision addressed in this proposal provides stockholders the ability to nominate a director candidate in our proxy statement while limiting the ability of stockholders to use proxy access to re-nominate a recently considered director candidate who did not receive meaningful stockholder support for two years following the vote. This Bylaw provision does not prohibit stockholders from nominating a different proxy access director candidate in a subsequent year, or nominating the same candidate in a separate proxy statement that our stockholders do not have to fund. In light of the feedback we have received from our stockholders since 2015, and our on-going review of the proxy access rights adopted by other companies, we continue to believe that our existing proxy access Bylaw is most appropriate for the company and our stockholders. 
The requirement for proxy access nominees to receive a meaningful vote to qualify for re-nomination is in line with market practice; of those companies having adopted proxy access bylaws, a significant majority have a re-nomination threshold for proxy access nominees. The re-nomination limitation in our current proxy access Bylaw as described above is designed to prevent abuse of the proxy access process, and to avoid the repetitive nomination of candidates who are unable to obtain at least modest support from our stockholders. However, it does allow those nominees who receive important minority voting percentages of 20% or higher to again be nominated through our proxy access Bylaw. We note that our 20% threshold requirement is lower than the minimum vote requirement at most companies that have adopted proxy access bylaws. Of the 87 companies in the S&P 100 that have adopted proxy access bylaws, almost 70% include a re-nomination threshold for proxy access nominees, and 55% require nominees to receive at least 25% support to be re-nominated. We do not believe it is in stockholders' interests to immediately re-consider a proxy access director nominee that a significant majority of our stockholders did not meaningfully support at the prior year's annual meeting. The proposal would eliminate this important requirement altogether, which is not only contrary to current market practice, but contrary to the long-term interests of all of our stockholders. 
We have strong corporate governance policies and procedures that empower our stockholders and encourage them to provide on-going feedback to our Board. Our proxy access Bylaw is only one of many provisions that help advance and protect the interests of our stockholders and provide them a meaningful ability to make their views known to the Board. 
In addition to the proxy access Bylaw, one or more stockholders who own 10% or more of our outstanding stock are entitled to call a special meeting of stockholders. Our 10% stock ownership threshold for calling a special meeting represents a significant stockholder right for our company's stockholders and is lower than the vast majority of S&P 500 companies that permit stockholders to call special meetings. Of the 303 S&P 500 companies that permit stockholders to call special meetings, more than 50% of the companies have a 25% or greater stock ownership threshold, with the most common stock ownership threshold set at 25% and no companies having a threshold lower than 10%. 
Our Board and management engage and listen to our stockholders based on a systematic process of outreach. At least twice annually, management invites our 250 largest institutional investors, representing approximately 65% of our outstanding shares, to engage with us. As described in "Stockholder Engagement" on page 28, in 2018-9 management and our Board's Lead Independent Director held approximately 80 meetings with stockholders representing approximately 35% of our outstanding common shares. At these meetings, we solicit their input on important performance, governance, executive compensation, human capital management, regulatory, environmental, social, and other matters. We maintain this dialogue to clarify and deepen our Board's understanding of stockholder concerns, and provide stockholders with insight into our Board's processes. Moreover, input received from our stockholders and other stakeholders as part of our year-round engagement program has resulted in a number of enhancements in our corporate governance, ESG, and executive compensation policies. See page 29 for actions we have taken as a result of our extensive stockholder engagement activities. 
We also have adopted robust corporate governance policies that empower our stockholders, including the annual election of all directors; majority voting for director elections; and independent Board leadership by a strong Lead Independent Director. Moreover, our Board is committed to regular renewal and refreshment in alignment with our long-term strategy. 
Accordingly, our Board recommends a vote "AGAINST" this proposal (Proposal 7).

Each share of our common stock and Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to one vote. Although each share of the Series 1, 2, 4, and 5 Preferred Stock (Series 1–5 Preferred Stock) is entitled to 150 votes, we do not have "dual-class" voting as all stockholders vote together without regard to class, except as otherwise required by law. Holders of the Series 1–5 Preferred Stock hold their shares through depositary receipts that each represent 1/1200th of a share of Series 1–5 Preferred Stock (or a vote representing 0.125 shares of our common stock). Therefore the aggregate vote represented by the Series 1–5 Preferred Stock is de minimis. As of the record date, the Series 1–5 Preferred Stock represent 5,146,200 votes, or approximately 0.05% of the total eligible votes at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders. We issued the Series 1–5 Preferred Stock as part of our merger with Merrill Lynch, that became effective January 1, 2009, as required under Delaware law to holders of respective outstanding shares of Merrill Lynch series 1–5 preferred stock. Since the issuance of the Series 1–5 Preferred Stock in 2009, our company has not issued any additional shares of Series 1–5 Preferred Stock, does not have any current plans to issue any additional shares of Series 1–5 Preferred Stock, and redeemed the Series 3 Preferred Stock in 2018. 
VOTING AND OTHER INFORMATION 
In accordance with Delaware law, for the 10 days prior to our annual meeting, a list of registered holders entitled to vote at our annual meeting will be available for inspection in the Office of the Corporate Secretary, Bank of America Corporation, Hearst Tower, 214 North Tryon Street, NC1-027-18-05, Charlotte, North Carolina 28255. The list will also be available at our annual meeting. 
Employee Voting.

Your shares cannot be voted unless you provide voting instructions to the Trustee. Your voting instructions to the Trustee will be held in strict confidence. The deadline to provide voting instructions for shares held in the Plan is April 23, 2019, at 8:00 a.m., Eastern time. If you are an employee and you hold shares in multiple accounts, you may receive one proxy card covering all the shares in your accounts. If you receive one proxy card covering all the shares in your accounts, you must provide voting instructions by April 23, 2019, at 8:00 a.m. to vote all your shares. After the applicable deadline, you will not be able to submit voting instructions or change prior voting instructions for any shares. In 2018, the Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. 401(k) Savings & Investment Plan was merged into The Bank of America 401(k) Plan and the Merrill Lynch Employee Stock Purchase Plan was terminated.

Our company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, we believe that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide additional clarity in assessing the results of our company as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Total revenue of the corporation on a fully-taxable equivalent basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Certain results excluding debit valuation adjustment (DVA) losses provide additional information to assess the underlying  operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
🌑    Certain ratios that utilize tangible equity present measures of those assets that can generate income. Return on average  tangible common shareholders equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average shareholders equity. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted year-end common  shareholders equity divided by ending common shares outstanding  
[END TABLE]
Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
For additional information about non-GAAP financial measures, see Supplemental Financial Data in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 24 of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 26, 2019. 
Below is a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures found on pages 44, 45, and 52.

APPENDIX B: BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION KEY EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLAN 
Bank of America Corporation 
Key Employee Equity Plan 
Article 1. Establishment, Duration and Purpose 
1.1 Establishment and Duration of the Plan. The Company established this Plan, originally known as the "Bank of America Corporation Key Associate Stock Plan," effective as of January 1, 2003, and the Plan as originally established was approved by the Company's stockholders. The Plan was subsequently amended on several occasions and was then further amended and restated effective April 28, 2010, upon approval by the Company's stockholders. The Plan is hereby being further amended and restated, subject to and effective upon the approval of the Company's stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders on May 6, 2015. The purposes of amending and restating the Plan are to (a) change the Plan's name to the "Bank of America Corporation Key Employee Equity Plan," (b) authorize additional Shares for award under the Plan, (c) update the provisions of the Plan regarding performance-based Awards, including the addition of shareholder-approved performance metrics for purposes of designing Awards intended to meet the Performance-Based Exception under Section 162(m) of the Code, and (d) otherwise meet current needs. The Plan shall remain in effect until the earliest of (i) the date that no additional Shares are available for issuance under the Plan, (ii) the date that the Plan has been terminated in accordance with Article 14 or (iii) the close of business on May 5April 23, 20252029. 
1.2 Purpose of the Plan. The Company believes that the compensation of its Key Employees should be linked to the Company's business performance in order to enhance the long-term success and value of the Company. The Plan serves this compensation philosophy by providing a source of equity-based Awards for Key Employees that are intended to further motivate Key Employees to increase the value of the Company's common stock, thereby aligning the interests of the Key Employees with those of the Company's stockholders while maintaining an appropriate balance between risk and reward. The Plan also provides the Company with a means to attract, recruit and retain Key Employees who will create sustainable results consistent with the Company's risk management policies and strategic plan for the long-term benefit of the Company's stockholders. The Plan also enables the Company to attract and retain persons of exceptional ability to serve as Non-Employee Directors and to further align the interests of Non-Employee Directors and stockholders in enhancing the value of the Company's Shares.

meaning of Code Section 162(m) shall, if so designated by the Committee, qualify for the Performance-Based Exception. Accordingly, the terms of Section 9.2, including the definitions of 162(m) Covered Employee and other terms used therein, shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Code Section 162(m). The foregoing notwithstanding, because the Committee cannot determine with certainty whether a given Participant will be a 162(m) Covered Employee with respect to a fiscal year that has not yet been completed, the term 162(m) Covered Employee as used herein shall mean only a person who is (a) designated by the Committee, at the time of grant of Performance Awards, as having the potential to be a 162(m) Covered Employee with respect to that fiscal year or any future fiscal year and (b) qualifies as a "covered employee" for the relevant fiscal year within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. If any provision of the Plan or any agreement relating to such Performance Awards does not comply or is inconsistent with the requirements of Code Section  162(m), such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements. 
Article 10. Beneficiary Designation 
Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, each Participant under the Plan may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of his or her death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form and pursuant to such procedures as may be prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant's death shall be paid to the Participant's estate. 
Article 11. Deferrals 
The Committee may permit a Participant to defer such Participant's receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant by virtue of the exercise of an Option or SAR or the lapse or waiver of restrictions with respect to Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code (if applicable). If any such deferral election is required or permitted, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, establish rules and procedures for such payment deferrals. 
Article 12. Rights of Key Employees 
12.1 Employment. Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company to terminate any Participant's employment at any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company. 
For purposes of this Plan, a transfer of a Participant's employment between the Company and a Subsidiary, or between Subsidiaries, shall not be deemed to be a termination of employment. Upon such a transfer, the Committee may make such adjustments to outstanding Awards as it deems appropriate to reflect the changed reporting relationships. 
12.2 Participation. No Key Employee shall have the right to be selected to receive an Award under this Plan, or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive a future Award. 
Article 13. Change in Control 
13.1 Treatment of Outstanding Awards. Unless otherwise specifically prohibited under applicable laws, or by the rules and regulations of any governing governmental agencies or national securities exchanges, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, at the time an Award is made hereunder or at any time prior to, coincident with or after the time of a Change in Control take any one or more of the following actions which shall apply only upon the occurrence of a Change in Control or, if later, upon the action being taken: 
(a) provide for the acceleration of any time periods, or the waiver of any other conditions, relating to the vesting, exercise, payment or distribution of an Award so that any Award to a Participant whose employment has been terminated as a result of a Change in Control may be vested, exercised, paid or distributed in full on or before a date fixed by the Committee, and in connection therewith the Committee may (i) provide for an extended period to exercise Options (not to exceed the original Option term) and (ii) determine the level of attainment of any applicable performance goals; 
(b) provide for the purchase of any Awards from a Participant whose employment has been terminated as a result of a Change in Control, upon the Participant's request, for an amount of cash equal to the amount that could have been obtained upon the exercise, payment or distribution of such rights had such Award been currently exercisable or payable; or 
APPENDIX B: BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION KEY EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLAN 
(c) cause the Awards then outstanding to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefore, by the surviving corporation in such Change in Control. 
For purposes of sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) above, any Participant whose employment is either (i) terminated by the Company other than for "cause," or (ii) terminated by the Participant for "good reason" (each as defined in the applicable Award Agreement), in either case upon, or on or prior to the second anniversary of, a Change in Control, shall be deemed to have been terminated as a result of the Change in Control. 
13.2 Limitation on Change-in-Control Benefits. It is the intention of the Company and the Participants to reduce the amounts payable or distributable to a Participant hereunder if the aggregate Net After Tax Receipts (as defined below) to the Participant would thereby be increased, as a result of the application of the excise tax provisions of Section 4999 of the Code. Accordingly, anything in this Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that the certified public accountants regularly employed by the Company immediately prior to any "change" described below (the "Accounting Firm") shall determine that receipt of all Payments (as defined below) would subject the Participant to tax under Section 4999 of the Code, it shall determine whether some amount of Payments would meet the definition of a "Reduced Amount" (as defined below). If the Accounting Firm determines that there is a Reduced Amount, the aggregate Payments shall be reduced to such Reduced Amount in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.2(b) below. 
(a) For purposes of this Section 13.2(a): 
(i) A "Payment" shall mean any payment or distribution in the nature of compensation to or for the benefit of a Participant who is a "disqualified individual" within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code and which is contingent on a "change" described in Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code with respect to the Company, whether paid or payable pursuant to this Plan or otherwise; 
(ii) "Plan Payment" shall mean a Payment paid or payable pursuant to this Plan (disregarding this Section 13.2); 
(iii) "Net After Tax Receipt" shall mean the Present Value of a Payment, net of all taxes imposed on the Participant with respect thereto under Sections 1 and 4999 of the Code, determined by applying the highest marginal rate under Section 1 of the Code which applied to the Participant's Federal taxable income for the immediately preceding taxable year; 
(iv) "Present Value" shall mean such value determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code; and 
(v) "Reduced Amount" shall mean the smallest aggregate amount of Payments which (A) is less than the sum of all Payments and (B) results in aggregate Net After Tax Receipts which are equal to or greater than the Net After Tax Receipts which would result if all Payments were paid to or for the benefit of the Participant. 
(b) If the Accounting Firm determines that aggregate Payments should be reduced to the Reduced Amount, the Committee shall promptly give the Participant notice to that effect and a copy of the detailed calculation thereof. The Company shall reduce or eliminate the Payments, by first reducing or eliminating the portion of the Payments which are not payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating cash payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits which are to be paid the farthest in time from the determination, all as determined by the Accounting Firm. All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 13.2 shall be binding upon the Company and the Participant and shall be made within sixty (60) days immediately following the event constituting the "change" referred to above. As promptly as practicable following such determination, the Company shall pay to or distribute for the benefit of the Participant such Payments as are then due to the Participant under this Plan. 
(c) At the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that amounts will have been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Participant pursuant to this Plan which should not have been so paid or distributed ("Overpayment") or that additional amounts which will have not been paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Participant pursuant to this Plan could have been so paid or distributed ("Underpayment"), in each case, consistent with the calculation of the Reduced Amount hereunder. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based either upon the assertion of a deficiency by the Internal Revenue Service against the Company or the Participant which the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success or controlling precedent or other substantial authority, determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit of the Participant shall be treated for all purposes as a loan ab initio to the Participant which the Participant shall repay to the Company together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code; provided, however, that no such loan shall be deemed to have been made and no amount shall be payable by the Participant to the Company if and to the extent (i) such deemed loan and payment would not either reduce the amount on which the Participant is subject to tax under Section 1 and Section 4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes or (ii) the Participant is subject to the prohibition on personal loans under Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In the event that the Accounting Firm, based upon controlling precedent or other substantial 
APPENDIX B: BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION KEY EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLAN 
authority, determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Participant together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. 
13.3 Termination, Amendment, and Modifications of Change-in-Control Provisions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any Award Agreement provision, the provisions of this Article 13 may not be terminated, amended, or modified on or after the date of a Change in Control to affect adversely any Award theretofore granted under the Plan without the prior written consent of the Participant with respect to said Participant's outstanding Awards; provided, however, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Committee, may terminate, amend, or modify this Article 13 at any time and from time to time prior to the date of a Change in Control. 
Article 14. Amendment, Modification, and Termination 
14.1 Amendment, Modification, and Termination. The Board may at any time and from time to time, alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan in whole or in part; provided, however, that an amendment to the Plan may be conditioned on the approval of the stockholders of the Company if and to the extent the Board determines that stockholder approval is necessary or appropriate. 
14.2 Awards Previously Granted. No termination, amendment, or modification of the Plan shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted under the Plan, without the written consent of the Participant holding such Award. 
14.3 No Repricing. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the repricing of Options or SARs is prohibited without prior approval of the Company's stockholders. For this purpose, a "repricing" means any of the following (or any other action that has the same effect as any of the following): (A) changing the terms of an Option or SAR to lower its Option Price or grant price; (B) any other action that is treated as a "repricing" under generally accepted accounting principles; and (C) repurchasing for cash or canceling an Option or SAR at a time when its Option Price or grant price is greater than the Fair Market Value of the underlying Shares in exchange for another Award, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with a change in capitalization or similar change under Section 4.6 above. Such cancellation and exchange would be considered a "repricing" regardless of whether it is treated as a "repricing" under generally accepted accounting principles and regardless of whether it is voluntary on the part of the Participant. 
Article 15. Withholding 
15.1 Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy Federal, state, local, foreign or other taxes (including the Participant's FICA or other applicable social tax obligation) required by law to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of this Plan. 
15.2 Share Withholding. The Company may cause any tax withholding obligation described in Section 15.1 to be satisfied by the Company withholding Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to the minimum statutory totalrequired tax which could bewithholding imposed on the transaction (not to exceed maximum statutory rates). In the alternative, the Company may permit Participants to elect to satisfy the tax withholding obligation, in whole or in part, by either (a) having the Company withhold Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to the minimum statutory totalrequired tax withholding which could be imposed on the transaction (not to exceed maximum statutory rates) or (b) tendering previously acquired Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the minimum statutory totalrequired tax withholding which could be imposed on the transaction (not to exceed maximum statutory rates). All such elections shall be irrevocable, made in writing, signed by the Participant, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. 
Article 16. Indemnification 
Provisions for the indemnification of officers and directors of the Company in connection with the administration of the Plan shall be as set forth in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect from time to time. 
Article 17. Successors 
All obligations of the Company under the Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company. 
APPENDIX B: BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION KEY EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLAN 
Article 18. Legal Construction 
18.1 Gender and Number. Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine; the plural shall include the singular and the singular shall include the plural. 
18.2 Severability. In the event any provision of the Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. 
18.3 Requirements of Law. The granting of Awards and the issuance of Shares under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. 
18.4 Securities Law Compliance. With respect to Insiders, transactions under this Plan are intended to comply with all applicable conditions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors under the Exchange Act. To the extent any provision of the plan or action by the Committee fails to so comply, it shall be deemed null and void, to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Committee. 
18.5 No Conflict. Unless otherwise provided for by an Award Agreement, in the event of any conflict between the terms of the Plan and the terms of an Award Agreement, the terms of the Plan shall control. 
18.6 Governing Law. To the extent not preempted by Federal law, the Plan, and all agreements hereunder, shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware. 
18.7 Compliance With Code Section 409A. The Plan is intended to comply with Code Section 409A, to the extent applicable. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Plan shall be interpreted, operated and administered consistent with this intent. In that regard, and notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Company reserves the right to amend the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan, by action of the Committee, without the consent of any affected Participant, to the extent deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of maintaining compliance with Code Section 409A. 
Article 19. Non-Employee Directors 
19.1 Restricted Stock Awards. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Board, at any time and from time to time, may grant Shares of Restricted Stock to Non-Employee Directors in such amounts as the Board shall determine. Notwithstanding the definition of "Participant" provided in Article 2 above, upon receipt of a grant of Shares of Restricted Stock, a Non-Employee Director shall be considered a Participant in the Plan. Each grant of Shares of Restricted Stock to a Non-Employee Director shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the Period or Periods of Restriction, the number of Shares of Restricted Stock granted, and such other provisions as the Board shall determine. 
19.2 Administration. The Board shall be responsible for administering any grants of Restricted Stock to Non-Employee Directors and shall have all of the powers necessary to enable it to properly carry out its duties hereunder. Not in limitation of the foregoing, the Board shall have the power to construe and interpret the Plan and to determine all questions that shall arise thereunder with respect to grants of Restricted Stock to Non-Employee Directors. The Board shall have such other and further specified duties, powers, authority and discretion as are elsewhere in the Plan either expressly or by necessary implication conferred upon it. The Board may appoint such agents as it may deem necessary for the effective performance of its duties, and may delegate to such agents such powers and duties as the Board may deem expedient or appropriate that are not inconsistent with the intent of the Plan and this Article 19. The decision of the Board upon all matters within the scope of authority shall be final and conclusive on all persons, except to the extent otherwise provided by law. 
19.3 Vesting. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, including, and without limitation, Section 3.4 of the Plan, Shares of Restricted Stock granted to Non-Employee Directors shall not become vested until the first anniversary of the applicable date of grant (or, if earlier, the date of the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company) (the "Non-Employee Director Vesting Date"), provided that if the Non-Employee Director Vesting Date occurs less than 50 weeks after the applicable date of grant, it shall count against the 5% exception pool to the minimum vesting requirements set forth in Section 3.4. If the Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a Non-Employee Director before the Non-Employee Director Vesting Date due to the Non-Employee Director's death, or if there is a Change in Control prior to the Vesting Date, then the Shares shall become fully vested as of the date of such death or Change in Control, as applicable. If the Non-Employee Director 
APPENDIX B: BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION KEY EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLAN 
ceases to serve as a Non-Employee Director at any time for any reason other than death before the earlier of the Vesting Date or a Change in Control, then the Shares shall become vested pro rata (based on the number of days between the grant date of the Shares of Restricted Stock, or in the case of Shares of Restricted Stock granted to a newly appointed Non-Employee Director, the date of commencement of services, and the date of cessation of services divided by (a) 365 days for grants made at an annual stockholders meeting or (b) the number of days from the date of commencement of services until the next annual stockholders meeting for grants made to a newly appointed Non-Employee Director), and to the extent the Shares are not thereby vested they shall be forfeited as of the date of such cessation of services. A Non-Employee Director may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any Shares of Restricted Stock until they become vested; however, the Non-Employee Director shall have the right to receive dividends with respect to the Shares and to vote the Shares prior to vesting. If a Non-Employee Director has elected to defer any Shares of Restricted Stock pursuant to the Bank of America Corporation Director Deferral Plan (or any other similar plan in which the Non-Employee Director participates, including any successor or replacement plan) (a "Deferral Plan"), then (i) such Shares shall not be issued under this Plan, (ii) the Non-Employee Director shall be credited with "Stock Units" to be paid in cash when and as provided for under the Deferral Plan, and (iii) the vesting provisions set forth above shall apply to any such Shares that are deferred as Stock Units under the Deferral Plan. 
19.4 No Other Awards. For purposes of clarity, Non-Employee Directors may not receive any other form of Award described in this Plan, other than grants of Shares of Restricted Stock.
