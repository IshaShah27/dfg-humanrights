This proxy statement is first being mailed to shareholders on or about October 10, 2018.

What is the purpose of the annual meeting?
At our annual meeting, shareholders will act upon the matters outlined in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, including the election of directors and ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm.  In addition, management may report on the performance of Home Federal Bancorp and will respond to questions from shareholders.
What are the Board of Directors' recommendations?
The recommendations of the Board of Directors are set forth under the description of each proposal in this proxy statement.  In summary, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the nominees for director described herein and FOR ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019.
The proxy solicited hereby, if properly signed and returned to us or voted over the Internet or by telephone and not revoked prior to its use, will be voted in accordance with your instructions.  If no contrary instructions are given, each proxy signed and received will be voted in the manner recommended by the Board of Directors and, upon the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, in accordance with the best judgment of the persons appointed as proxies.  Proxies solicited hereby may be exercised only at the annual meeting and any adjournment of the annual meeting and will not be used for any other meeting.
Who is entitled to vote?
Only our shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date for the meeting, September 25, 2018, are entitled to vote at the meeting. On the record date, we had 1,897,924 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and no other class of equity securities outstanding.  For each issued and outstanding share of common stock you own on the record date, you will be entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted on at the meeting, in person or by proxy.
How do I vote my shares?
After you have carefully read this proxy statement, indicate on your proxy card how you want your shares to be voted, then sign, date and mail your proxy card in the enclosed prepaid return envelope as soon as possible.  You may also vote by telephone or the Internet if indicated on your proxy card or voting instruction form. This will enable your shares to be represented and voted at the annual meeting.                 Voting instructions from participants in the Home Federal Bank Employees' Savings and Profit Sharing Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on November 7, 2018, to be used by the plan Trustees to determine the votes for plan shares.
Can I attend the meeting and vote my shares in person?
Yes. All shareholders are invited to attend the annual meeting.  Shareholders of record can vote in person at the annual meeting.  If your shares are held in "street name," then you are not the shareholder of record and you must ask your broker or other nominee how you can vote at the annual meeting.
Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy after I return my proxy card or vote by telephone or the Internet?
Yes.  If you are a shareholder of record, there are three ways you can change your vote or revoke your proxy after you have sent in your proxy card or voted by telephone or the Internet.
[BEGIN TABLE]
● First, you may complete and submit a new proxy card or vote by telephone or the Internet again before the deadline printed on the card.  Any earlier proxies will be revoked automatically.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Second, you may send a written notice to our Corporate Secretary, Ms. DeNell W. Mitchell, Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana, 624 Market Street, Shreveport, Louisiana 71101, in advance of the meeting stating that you would like to revoke your proxy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Third, you may attend the annual meeting and vote in person.  Any earlier proxy will be revoked.  However, attending the annual meeting without voting in person will not revoke your proxy.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in "street name" and you have instructed a broker or other nominee to vote your shares, you must follow directions from your broker or other nominee to change your vote.
If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, could my broker automatically vote my shares?
Your broker may not vote on the election of directors if you do not furnish instructions for such proposal to your broker. You should use the voting instruction form or broker card provided by the institution that holds your shares to instruct your broker to vote your shares or else your shares may not be voted or may be considered "broker non-votes."
Your broker may vote in his or her discretion on the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm if you do not furnish instructions. If your broker votes in his or her discretion on proposal two and you do not provide instructions for proposal one, then your shares will be considered "broker non-votes" on proposal one.
What constitutes a quorum?
The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting will constitute a quorum.  Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shareholders considered to be present at the meeting.
What vote is required to approve each item?
The election of directors will be determined by a plurality of the votes cast at the annual meeting.  The two nominees for director receiving the most "for" votes will be elected. The affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast is required for approval of the proposal to ratify the appointment of LaPorte, A Professional Accounting Corporation as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending June 30, 2019. Abstentions are considered in determining the presence of a quorum, but will not affect the vote on the proposals.

Election of Directors (Proposal One)
Our Articles of Incorporation provide that the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible.  The directors are elected by our shareholders for staggered three year terms and until their successors are elected and qualified.
At this annual meeting, you will be asked to elect one class of directors, consisting of two directors, for a three-year term expiring in 2021 and until their successors are elected and qualified.  Shareholders of Home Federal Bancorp are not permitted to use cumulative voting for the election of directors.  Our Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, nominated Messrs. James R. Barlow and Thomas Steen Trawick, Jr. to a three-year term expiring in 2021.  Mr. Clyde Patterson, who has served as a director of Home Federal Bank since 1990 and served in various other positions with Home Federal Bank since 1964, will be retiring when his term ends as of the date of the annual meeting. As a result of Mr. Patterson's retirement, the Board has reduced the size of the Board to eight members effective as of the date of the annual meeting. Our Articles of Incorporation provide that the Board of Directors will be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible. No director or nominee for director is related to any other director or executive officer by blood, marriage or adoption.
Unless otherwise directed, each proxy signed and returned by a shareholder will be voted for the election of the nominees for director listed below.  If any person named as a nominee should be unable or unwilling to stand for election at the time of the annual meeting, the proxies will nominate and vote for any replacement nominee or nominees recommended by our Board of Directors.  At this time, the Board of Directors knows of no reason why any of the nominees listed below may not be able to serve as a director if elected.
The following tables present information concerning the nominees for director and our continuing directors.  The indicated period of service as a director is presented on a calendar year basis and includes service for directors of Home Federal Bank prior to our reorganization into the holding company structure in 2005.  Ages are reflected as of September 25, 2018.

Director Nominations
Nominations for director of Home Federal Bancorp are made by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates for director suggested by other directors, as well as our management and shareholders.  A shareholder who desires to recommend a prospective nominee for the Board should notify our Secretary in writing with whatever supporting material the shareholder considers appropriate.  In addition, any shareholder wishing to make a nomination must follow our procedures for shareholder nominations, which are described under "Shareholder Proposals, Nominations and Communications with the Board of Directors."
The charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee sets forth certain criteria the committee may consider when recommending individuals for nomination as director including: (a) ensuring that the Board of Directors, as a whole, is diverse and consists of individuals with various and relevant career experience, relevant technical skills, industry knowledge and experience, financial expertise (including expertise that could qualify a director as a "financial expert," as that term is defined by the rules of the SEC), local or community ties and (b) minimum individual qualifications, including strength of character, mature judgment, familiarity with our business and industry, independence of thought and an ability to work collegially.  The committee also may consider the extent to which the candidate would fill a present need on the Board of Directors.
Director Independence
A majority of Home Federal Bancorp's directors are independent directors as defined in the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market.  The Board of Directors has determined that Drs. Colquitt and Trawick and Messrs. Harrison, Humphrey, Lawrence and Wilhite are independent directors.
Board Leadership Structure
Our Board of Directors is led by a Chairman of the Board, presently Mr. Daniel Herndon, who also serves as Special Projects Manager.  Mr. Barlow serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer and is also a member of the Board. The Board of Directors believes that the separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board and President enhances board independence and oversight.  Further, the separation of the Chairman of the Board permits the President and Chief Executive Officer to better focus on his responsibilities of managing the daily operations of Home Federal Bancorp, enhancing shareholder value and expanding and strengthening our franchise while allowing the Chairman of the Board to lead the Board of Directors in its fundamental role of providing independent oversight and advice to management. As President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Barlow is familiar with our business and operations and is well situated to lead discussions with the Board on important matters affecting the business of Home Federal Bancorp.                 The Board of Directors is aware of the potential conflicts that may arise when an insider chairs the Board, but believes these are limited by existing safeguards which include the fact that as a financial institution holding company, much of our operations are highly regulated.
Compensation of Directors
Director Compensation Table. The table below summarizes the total compensation paid to each of our non-employee directors and Messrs. Herndon and Patterson for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The primary elements of Home Federal Bank's non-employee director compensation program consist of cash and equity compensation.  Mr. Herndon is also compensated in his capacity as our Chairman of the Board and Mr. Patterson as our Executive Vice President and Treasurer.  Compensation for Mr. Barlow is included in the Summary Compensation Table.

Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee reviews with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the systems of internal control, reviews the annual financial statements, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K and monitors Home Federal Bancorp's adherence in accounting and financial reporting to generally accepted accounting principles.  The Audit Committee is comprised of three directors who are independent directors as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board of Directors has determined that no members of the Audit Committee meet the qualifications established for an Audit Committee financial expert in the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission; however, the members have the requisite financial and accounting background to meet the Nasdaq listing standards.  The Audit Committee met three times in fiscal 2018 and informally reviews our financial results on a quarterly basis.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  It is the responsibility of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with its charter to, among other functions, review the qualifications of director nominees.  The Committee approves nominees for consideration by the full Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the Board or for election at the annual meeting.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met once during fiscal 2018. Compensation Committee.  It is the responsibility of the Compensation Committee of Home Federal Bancorp to set the compensation of Home Federal Bancorp's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as well as the other members of senior management and administer our stock and incentive compensation plans.  The Compensation Committee of Home Federal Bancorp did not meet in fiscal 2018.
Board's Role in Risk Oversight
Risk is inherent with every business, particularly financial institutions. We face a number of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, strategic risk and reputational risk.  Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks Home Federal Bancorp faces, while the Board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, the Board of Directors ensures that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed.
Members of senior management regularly attend meetings of the Board of Directors and address any questions or concerns raised by the Board on risk management or other matters. The Board's risk oversight function is carried out through, among other factors, its review and approval of various policies and procedures, such as Home Federal Bank's lending and investment policies, ratification or approval of investments and loans exceeding certain thresholds, and regular review of risk elements such as interest rate risk exposure, liquidity and problem assets.
Directors' Attendance at Annual Meetings
Directors are expected to attend the annual meeting absent a valid reason for not doing so.  All of our directors attended, in person or by telephone, the annual meeting of shareholders held on November 8, 2017.

Employment and Change in Control Agreements
Home Federal Bank has entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Mr. James R. Barlow effective as of January 1, 2013.  The employment agreement amended and restated the prior employment agreement between Home Federal Bank and the executive.  Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Barlow serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of Home Federal Bank for an initial term of three years commencing on the effective date, provided that the term of Mr. Barlow's agreement will be extended for an additional year on each January 1 during the term of the agreement, unless Home Federal Bank or Mr. Barlow gives notice to the other party of its or his intent not to extend the term of the agreement.  The agreement provided for an initial base salary of $193,950 per year for Mr. Barlow.  Mr. Barlow's base salary may be increased at the discretion of the Board of Directors of Home Federal Bank but may not be decreased during the term of the agreement without the prior written consent of the executive.  Home Federal Bank also agreed to provide Mr. Barlow with an automobile during the term of the agreement.
The employment agreement with Mr. Barlow is terminable with or without cause by Home Federal Bank. The employment agreement provides that in the event of (y) termination of employment by  Home Federal Bank other than for cause, disability, retirement or death, or (z) termination by the executive for "good reason," as defined, in each case before or after a change in control, the executive would be entitled to (1) an amount of cash severance which is equal to three times his average annual compensation and (2) continued participation in certain employee benefit plans of Home Federal Bank until the earlier of 36 months or the date the executive receives substantially similar benefits from full-time employment with another employer.  The employment agreement with Home Federal Bank provides that in the event any of the payments to be made thereunder or otherwise upon termination of employment are deemed to constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments and benefits received thereunder shall be reduced by the minimum amount necessary to result in no portion of the payments and benefits being non-deductible by Home Federal Bank for federal income tax purposes.                Home Federal Bancorp entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Barlow to serve as President and Chief Operating Officer of Home Federal Bancorp, effective as of January 1, 2013, which is on terms substantially similar to the amended and restated employment agreement with Home Federal, except as follows.  The agreement with Home Federal Bancorp provides that severance payments payable to Mr. Barlow by Home Federal Bancorp shall include the amount by which the severance benefits payable by Home Federal are reduced as a result of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, if the parachute payments exceed 105% of three times the executive's "base amount" as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.  If the parachute payments are not more than 105% of the amount equal to three times the base amount, the severance benefits payable by Home Federal Bancorp will be reduced so they do not constitute "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.  In addition, the agreement with Home Federal Bancorp provides that Home Federal Bancorp shall reimburse Mr. Barlow for any resulting excise taxes payable by him, plus such additional amount as may be necessary to compensate him for the payment of state and federal income, excise and other employment-related taxes on the excise tax reimbursement. Under the agreements with Home Federal Bancorp and Home Federal Bank, Mr. Barlow's compensation, benefits and expenses will be paid by Home Federal Bancorp and Home Federal Bank in the same proportion as the time and services actually expended by Mr. Barlow on behalf of each of Home Federal Bancorp and Home Federal Bank.
Home Federal Bancorp and Home Federal Bank have entered into a change in control agreement with Mr. Herndon, effective January 1, 2018. The change in control agreement provides that in the event of (y) termination of Mr. Herndon's employment other than for cause, disability, retirement or death, or (z) termination by the executive for "good reason," as defined, in each case within twenty-four (24) months after a "change in control," as defined, the executive would be entitled to receive (1) a cash amount equal to three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) paid in a lump sum within ten (10) business days following the date of termination; and (2) continued participation in certain employee benefit plans until the earlier of twenty-four (24) months after the date of termination or the date the executive receives substantially similar benefits from full-time employment with another employer.  The change in control agreement provides that in the event any of the payments to be made thereunder or otherwise upon termination of employment are deemed to constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments and benefits received thereunder shall be reduced by the minimum amount necessary to result in no portion of the payments and benefits being non-deductible by the employer for federal income tax purposes.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreements
Home Federal Bank adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreement on December 13, 2017 for the benefit of Mr. Barlow as President and Chief Executive Officer of Home Federal Bancorp and Home Federal Bank effective as of January 1, 2018.  Under the terms of the agreement, after the target retirement date of December 31, 2033, Mr. Barlow will receive annual retirement benefits of $120,000, payable in equal annual installments over ten years.  In the event of a separation from service prior to December 31, 2033, other than as a result of death and without cause, Mr. Barlow would receive his accrued benefits through such date payable in a lump sum.  If Mr. Barlow has a separation from service either concurrently with or within two years following a change in control, he will be credited with five additional years of service following the date of his separation from service for purposes of calculating his accrued amount.  In the event of death while in active service, his designated beneficiaries would receive a lump sum payment of the full retirement benefit.  In the event of death after retirement, but before all payments have been made, any remaining benefits will be paid to the designated beneficiaries until all the annual installments have been paid.  The retirement benefits are vesting ratably at 6.25% per year for sixteen years beginning with the calendar year ending December 31, 2018.
Home Federal Bank also entered into Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreements for the benefit of Messrs. Herndon and Patterson effective as of January 1, 2013. Under the terms of the agreements, following the executive's retirement after December 31, 2017, Messrs. Herndon and Patterson are entitled to receive annual retirement benefits of $75,000 and $25,000, respectively, payable in equal annual installments of eight and ten years, respectively. In the event of death while in active service, the designated beneficiaries would receive a lump sum payment of the full retirement benefit. In the event of death after retirement, but before all payments have been made, any remaining benefits will be paid to the designated beneficiaries until all the annual installments have been paid. The retirement benefits were fully vested as of December 31, 2017. Loan Officer Incentive Plan
On February 10, 2016, the Compensation Committee approved the Home Federal Bank 2016 Loan Officer Incentive Plan for the benefit of the Bank's eligible commercial loan officers. The terms of the Loan Officer Incentive Plan are reviewed annually and were amended on February 10, 2016 to change the administration period to a fiscal year basis, to provide for three participation levels, two based on the size of the commercial loan officer's book of business and one for the Commercial Sales Manager and to specify the five performance measures used to calculate the book of business performance. Mr. Sawrie is our only named executive officer who participates in the plan as Commercial Sales Manager.
The Loan Officer Incentive Plan is an annual incentive compensation plan intended to reward participating commercial loan officers with variable cash awards that are contingent upon the net interest income produced from the loan officer's identified loan portfolio, and in the case of the Commercial Sales Manager, all loans originated by commercial loan officers, and net income from new loans originated during the performance period plus commercial deposit fee income, multiplied by a portfolio rating based on the performance measures.  Participants in the Loan Officer Incentive Plan are selected by the President and Chief Executive Officer and recommended for approval by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors which administers the plan.
During fiscal 2018, Level I and Level II participants in the Loan Officer Incentive Plan received a cash incentive award equal to 2.0% and 3.0%, respectively, of the net interest income from loans originated by the particular loan officer prior to the beginning of the fiscal year and a cash incentive award equal to 15.0% and 10.0%, respectively, of the net income from the loan officer's loan originations during the performance period plus year to date commercial deposit fee income, in each case multiplied by a portfolio rating based on the five performance measures.  The Commercial Sales Manager received a cash incentive award equal to 1.0% of the net interest income from loans originated by all the commercial loan officers prior to the beginning of the fiscal year and a cash incentive award equal to 5.0% of the net income from all of the loans originated by the commercial loan officers during the performance period plus year to date commercial deposit fee income, in each case multiplied by a portfolio rating based on the five performance measures. The cash incentive awards are paid to the Commercial Sales Manager on a quarterly basis.
Retirement Benefits
Retirement benefits are an important element of a competitive compensation program for attracting senior executives, especially in the financial services industry. Our executive compensation program currently includes (i) a 401(k) profit sharing plan which enables our employees to supplement their retirement savings with elective deferral contributions and with matching and discretionary contributions by us, and (ii) an employee stock ownership plan that allows participants to accumulate retirement benefits in the form of employer stock at no current cost to the participant.
401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan.  We adopted the Home Federal Bank Employees' Savings and Profit Sharing Plan and Trust ("401(k) Plan") effective November 15, 2004.  To participate in the 401(k) Plan, eligible employees must have completed three months of full time service and attained age 21.  Participating employees may make elective salary reduction contributions of up to $18,500 of their eligible compensation for 2018.  Home Federal Bank will contribute a basic "safe harbor" contribution of 100% of the first 6% of plan salary elective deferrals.  We are also permitted to make discretionary contributions to be allocated to participant accounts.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan.  We established an employee stock ownership plan for our employees in connection with our mutual to stock conversion in 2005. We acquired additional shares in connection with our second-step conversion in 2010.  The shares were purchased by the employee stock ownership plan with funds borrowed from Home Federal Bancorp and are held in a suspense account and released for allocation as debt service payments are made.  Additional discretionary contributions may be made to the plan in either cash or shares of common stock, although we have no plans to do so at this time.  Shares released from the suspense account are allocated to each eligible participant's plan account pro rata based on compensation.  Forfeitures may be used for the payment of expenses or be reallocated among the remaining participants. Employees who have been credited with at least 1,000 hours of service during a 12-month period and who have attained age 21 are eligible to participate in the employee stock ownership plan.  Participants become 100% vested after three years of service. Participants also become fully vested in their account balances upon a change in control (as defined), death, disability or retirement.  Benefits may be payable upon retirement or separation from service. Stock Option Plans and Recognition and Retention Plans
In August 2005, shareholders approved our 2005 Stock Option Plan.  Pursuant to the terms of the 2005 Stock Option Plan, options to acquire up to 158,868 shares of common stock were available to be granted to employees and directors.  In December 2011, shareholders approved our 2011 Stock Option Plan and our 2011 Recognition and Retention Plan. On July 31, 2014, the Compensation Committee awarded the remaining available 31,311 stock options and 8,557 stock awards under our 2005 and 2011 plans such that no further awards are available for future grant under the 2005 and 2011 plans. In November 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan which provides for a total of 150,000 shares reserved for future issuance as stock awards or stock options. No more than 37,500 shares, or 25%, may be granted as stock awards. On October 26, 2015, we granted a total of 34,500 plan share awards and 103,500 stock options to directors, officers, and other key employees vesting ratably over five years. Under all of our stock benefit plans, awards may vest no faster than 20% per year, beginning one year from the date of grant.  However, under the plans, vesting of any award is accelerated upon the death or disability of a recipient or upon a change-in-control of Home Federal Bancorp. Outstanding stock awards and stock options for our named executive officers are reflected in the table "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End."
Survivor Benefit Plan
In June 2011, Home Federal Bank purchased bank owned life insurance on the lives of its employees. In consideration for entering into consent to insurance agreements, on July 13, 2011, Home Federal Bank entered into Survivor Benefit Plan Participation Agreements with employees including our named executive officers. The agreements provide that the officer's beneficiary will receive three times the officer's base salary if serving as an officer of Home Federal Bank at the date of death. The agreements may be amended or terminated at any time by Home Federal Bank as long as it does not reduce or delay any benefit payable to a participant whose death has already occurred.
Related Party Transactions
Home Federal Bank offers extensions of credit to its directors, officers and employees as well as members of their immediate families for the financing of their primary residences and other proposes.  These loans are made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to Home Federal Bank and none of such loans involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.
Under Home Federal Bancorp's Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee is required to review and approve all related party transactions, as described in Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of Home Federal Bancorp's common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by regulation to furnish Home Federal Bancorp with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.  We know of no person who owns 10% or more of our common stock.
Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms furnished to us, or written representations from our officers and directors, we believe that during, and with respect to, the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, all of our officers and directors complied in all respects with the reporting requirements promulgated under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Proposal Two)
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Home Federal Bancorp has appointed LaPorte, A Professional Accounting Corporation to perform the audit of our financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2019, and further directed that the selection of auditors be submitted for ratification by the shareholders at the annual meeting.
We have been advised by LaPorte that neither that firm nor any of its associates has any relationship with Home Federal Bancorp or its subsidiaries other than the usual relationship that exists between an independent registered public accounting firm and its clients.  LaPorte will have one or more representatives at the annual meeting who will have an opportunity to make a statement, if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
In determining whether to appoint LaPorte as our independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee considered whether the provision of services, other than auditing services, by LaPorte is compatible with maintaining their independence.  In fiscal 2018 and 2017, LaPorte performed auditing services as well as reviewed our public filings.  The Audit Committee believes that LaPorte's performance of these services is compatible with maintaining the independent registered public accounting firm's independence.
Audit Fees
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees paid by us to LaPorte for professional services rendered by LaPorte in connection with the audit of Home Federal Bancorp's consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2018 and 2017, as well as the fees paid by us to LaPorte for audit-related services, tax services and all other services rendered by LaPorte to us during fiscal 2018 and 2017.

In its review of these services and related fees and terms, the Audit Committee considers, among other things, the possible effect of the performance of such services on the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm.  The Audit Committee pre-approves certain audit-related services and certain non-audit related tax services which are specifically described by the Audit Committee on an annual basis and separately approves other individual engagements as necessary. Each new engagement of LaPorte, A Professional Accounting Corporation was approved in advance by the Audit Committee or its Chair, and none of those engagements made use of the de minimis exception to pre-approval contained in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules.

We hope you will take advantage of the opportunity to direct the manner in which shares of common stock of Home Federal Bancorp allocated to your account in the Home Federal Bank 401(k) Plan will be voted.
Enclosed with this letter is the Proxy Statement, which describes the matters to be voted upon, Annual Report for the year ended June 30, 2018 and Voting Instruction Ballot.  After you have reviewed the Proxy Statement, we urge you to vote your allocated shares held in the 401(k) Plan by marking, dating, signing and returning the enclosed Voting Instruction Ballot in the envelope provided or voting by phone or the Internet.  In order to be effective, your voting instructions must be received no later than 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time on November 7, 2018.
We urge each of you to vote, as a means of participating in the governance of the affairs of Home Federal Bancorp.  If your voting instructions are not received, the shares allocated to your 401(k) Plan account will generally not be voted.  While I hope that you will vote in the manner recommended by the Board of Directors, the most important thing is that you vote in whatever manner you deem appropriate.  Please take a moment to do so.
Please note that the enclosed material relates only to those shares which have been allocated to you in your account under the 401(k) Plan.  If you also own shares of Home Federal Bancorp common stock outside of the 401(k) Plan, you should receive other voting material for those shares owned by you individually.  Please return all your voting material so that all your shares may be voted.
