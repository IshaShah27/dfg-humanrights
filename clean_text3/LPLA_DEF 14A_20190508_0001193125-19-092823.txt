 Proposal Three—Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Compensation    
   Because the proposal to approve, on an  advisory basis, the compensation awarded to named executive officers for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 is a non-binding, advisory vote, there is no required vote that would constitute approval.  Although the vote is advisory and non-binding in nature, the compensation and human resources committee (the "Compensation Committee") will consider the outcome of the vote when considering future  named executive officer compensation arrangements. A vote to abstain or a broker non-vote will have no direct effect on the outcome of the proposal.

[END TABLE]
General Information About Corporate Governance and the Board of Directors 
We believe that good corporate governance is important to ensure that we are managed for the long-term benefit of our stockholders. In support of that philosophy, we have adopted many leading corporate governance practices, including those summarized below and elsewhere in this proxy statement. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Independence     A majority of our directors must be independent. Currently, all of our directors other than our chief executive officer are  independent, and all of our committees are composed exclusively of independent directors.    
   Non-executive Chair     We currently separate the offices of chair of the Board and chief executive officer of the Company. The current chair of our  Board, James S. Putnam, is an independent director.    
   Director Diversity     Our goal is a balanced and diverse Board, with members who bring a diversity of skills, expertise, experiences, perspectives,  tenures and personal characteristics, including with respect to age, race, gender and ethnicity.    
   Board Refreshment     Our Board's composition represents a balanced approach to director tenure, allowing the Board to benefit from the experience  of longer-serving directors as well as fresh perspectives from newer directors. The nominating and governance committee of the Board (the "Nominating and Governance Committee") has developed a skills matrix to inform director searches and  succession planning.    
   Director Overboarding     Any director who is not serving as chief executive officer of a public company is expected to serve on no more than four public  company boards (including our Board), and any director serving as chief executive officer of a public company is expected to serve on no more than three public company boards (including the board of his or her own company).    
   Committee Membership     The Board appoints members of its committees on an annual basis, with the Nominating and Governance Committee reviewing and  recommending committee membership based in part on the need to ensure a succession plan for each committee chair.    
   Board Self-evaluations     The Board conducts an annual evaluation of its performance, operations, size and composition, with the Nominating and Governance  Committee overseeing the evaluation process, which also encompasses the Board's committees.    
   Strategy Oversight     The Board holds an annual two-day session focused on the Company's long-term  strategy, which informs the Board's oversight and work plan for the following year.    
   Executive Succession Planning     The Compensation Committee conducts regular reviews of executive talent, development and succession planning, and our Board  reviews the succession plans for the chief executive officer position annually.    
   Annual Election of Directors     All directors are elected annually, which reinforces our Board's accountability to our stockholders.    
   Majority Voting Standard for Director Elections     Our bylaws mandate that directors be elected under a "majority voting" standard in uncontested elections. Any director  who does not receive more votes "for" his or her election than votes "against" must tender his or her resignation and, if our Board accepts the resignation, step down from our Board.    
   Single Voting Class     LPL Financial Holdings Inc.'s common stock is the only class of voting shares outstanding.

                            Proposal 1: Election of Directors         
[END TABLE]
Proposal 1: Election of Directors 
As of March 29, 2019, our Board of Directors consisted of eight directors: seven independent directors and our chief executive officer. Each current director is standing for election at the Annual Meeting. 
Based on the recommendation of our Nominating and Governance Committee, our Board has selected Corey E. Thomas as a new nominee to stand for election at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, nine director nominees are standing for election, each of whom has been nominated by our Board based on the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee. Each director nominee would hold office until our annual meeting of stockholders in 2020 and until his or her respective successor has been elected. 
As described below, our nominees have considerable professional and business expertise. The recommendation of our Board of Directors is based on its carefully considered judgment that the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills of our nominees qualify them to serve on our Board of Directors. 
Board Membership Criteria 
The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics required of directors in the context of the current make-up of the Board. As reflected in the corporate governance guidelines applicable to the Company (the "Corporate Governance Guidelines"), it is the policy of the Board that all directors should: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• possess unimpeachable integrity and a personal reputation for transparency, honesty and ethical behavior;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• have considerable personal accomplishment and professional expertise;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• demonstrate strong business acumen, financial literacy and strategic agility;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• contribute to boardroom dialogue through critical thinking and independent judgment, and candid and constructive  communication;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• be passionate about the vision of the Company and enthusiastic about the commitments entailed in serving as a director;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• understand their role as stewards in representing the long-term interests of our stakeholders.   
[END TABLE]
Director Diversity 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines reflect our commitment to director diversity. Our goal is a balanced and diverse Board, with members who bring a diversity of skills, expertise, experiences, perspectives, tenures and personal characteristics, including with regard to age, race, gender and ethnicity. When conducting director searches, the Board is committed to actively seeking highly qualified women and individuals from minority groups to include in the pool from which Board nominees are selected. 
In recent years, our Nominating and Governance Committee has focused on the refreshment and continued diversity of the Board. Since 2014, we will have added six new independent directors, four of whom are among our director nominees: H. Paulett Eberhart, William F. Glavin, Jr., Allison H. Mnookin and Corey E. Thomas. Through the addition of these directors, the Board of Directors has gained seasoned leaders, as well as particularly relevant experience related to our industry, strategic planning, oversight and execution, business innovation, technology, accounting and risk management. The addition of these directors also reflects our balanced approach to director tenure, allowing the Board to benefit from the experience of longer-serving directors as well as fresh perspectives from newer directors. 
The charts below reflect the characteristics of our director nominees. The average age of our director nominees is 60, and the average tenure of our director nominees is six years. One-third of our director nominees are women, which places our Board among the top in our industry in gender diversity.

[END TABLE]
Recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee 
In connection with its efforts to ensure that our Board has the appropriate mix of skills, expertise, experiences, perspectives and personal characteristics, the Nominating and Governance Committee engaged Heidrick & Struggles, a director search firm, in 2018 to provide ongoing assistance in Board succession planning and identifying, evaluating and recruiting potential additional director candidates. The Nominating and Governance Committee evaluated candidates according to the principles set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and sought an individual who could contribute meaningfully to the Board, particularly in the context of the Company's evolving business strategy and operating environment. Among other things, the Nominating and Governance Committee sought a candidate with chief executive leadership experience, an entrepreneurial mindset and success as a business leader in a disrupting industry. 
As part of the process of considering Mr. Thomas as a potential nominee to the Board, members of the Board met with Mr. Thomas both in person and telephonically. After the course of this evaluation process, the Nominating and Governance Committee determined that Mr. Thomas' background, skills and experience would make him a valuable addition to the Board and recommended that the Board nominate him to stand for election at the Annual Meeting. 
In recommending that the Board nominate each of our current directors to stand for election at the Annual Meeting, the Nominating and Governance Committee evaluated our current directors according to the principles set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and considered the pertinent qualifications and experience of each nominee, as further set forth below. 
If any of our nominees is unable or unwilling to serve on our Board of Directors, the shares represented by your proxy will be voted for the election of such other person as may be nominated by our Board of Directors. In addition, in full compliance with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations, we will file an amended proxy statement and proxy card that, as applicable: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• identifies the alternate nominee(s);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• discloses that any such nominee has consented to being named in the revised proxy statement and to serve if elected; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• includes the disclosure required by Item 7 of Schedule 14A with respect to any such nominee.  
[END TABLE]
We know of no reason why any nominee would be unable or unwilling to serve. All nominees have consented to be named in this proxy statement and to serve if elected.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

Eight of the nine directors who served on the Board at the time of the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders attended such meeting. Viet Dinh, a former director, did not attend. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines, Committee Charters, and Code of Conduct 
We believe that good corporate governance is important to ensure that we are managed for the long-term benefit of our stockholders. 
Our Board of Directors has adopted our Corporate Governance Guidelines to set clear parameters for the operation of our Board. Our Board of Directors has also adopted charters for its audit committee (the "Audit Committee"), Nominating and Governance Committee, and Compensation Committee. We have adopted a Code of Conduct that applies to, among others, our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions.

    We have implemented several important measures that are designed to promote long-term stockholder value:    
    ◾ Our Board consists of a  single class of directors elected on an annual basis who may be removed with or without cause. Accordingly, our stockholders are able to register their views on the performance of all directors on an annual basis, enhancing the accountability of our  Board to our stockholders.    
    ◾ We currently separate the  offices of the chair of the Board and chief executive officer of the Company, although the Board maintains the flexibility to select the chair of the Board and its leadership structure, from time to time, based on the criteria that it deems to be in  the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.    
    ◾ Our bylaws provide for a  majority voting standard in uncontested director elections. We also have adopted a director resignation policy in our Corporate Governance Guidelines pursuant to which a director who does not receive support from holders of a majority of shares  voted in an uncontested election must tender his or her resignation and, if our Board accepts the resignation, step down from our Board. This makes director elections more meaningful for our stockholders and promotes accountability.    
    ◾ We seek an advisory vote on  the compensation of our named executive officers annually, which underscores the careful consideration we give to our stockholders views on our compensation practices.    
    ◾ We have established a  compensation claw-back policy that enables the Company to recoup cash and equity incentive compensation from executive officers in the event of certain financial restatements.    
    ◾ Our executive officers are  subject to equity ownership guidelines that set minimum ownership requirements based on a multiple of annual base salary, which aligns the interests of senior management with the interests of our stockholders.    
    ◾ We have also adopted equity  ownership guidelines for directors, which set minimum ownership requirements based on a multiple of the cash portion of the annual base retainer then in effect.    
    ◾ Our Insider Trading Policy  prohibits our executives and directors from pledging and hedging our Common Stock, in order to further the alignment between stockholders and our executives that our equity awards are designed to create.        
    ◾ Our Insider Trading Policy  prohibits our executives and directors from pledging and hedging our Common Stock, in order to further the alignment between stockholders and our executives that our equity awards are designed to create.

Director Independence 
The listing standards of The Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq") require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company's audit, nominating and governance, and compensation committees be independent. Rule 5605(a)(2) of the listing rules of Nasdaq further provides that a director will only qualify as an "independent director" if, in the opinion of that company's board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Audit Committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and compensation committee members are also subject to heightened independence criteria under Nasdaq rules. 
After its evaluation of director independence, the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that Messrs. Glavin, Putnam, Riepe and Schifter, and Mses. Eberhart, Mnookin and Mulcahy are independent directors under applicable Nasdaq rules, and Mr. Thomas will qualify as an independent director if elected. 
Board Composition and Leadership Structure of the Board of Directors 
Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board of Directors. As of March 29, 2019, our Board of Directors was composed of eight directors. Under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the number of directors shall not be fewer than three or more than 15. The authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board of Directors. 
The Board does not have a fixed policy regarding the separation of the offices of chair of the Board and chief executive officer and believes that it should maintain the flexibility to select the chair of the Board and its Board leadership structure, from time to time, based on the criteria that it deems to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. At this time, the offices of the chair of the Board and the chief executive officer are separated. Prior to having appointed an independent chair, the Board of

 Directors had established the position of lead director, with responsibilities for performing many of the functions that an independent chair would perform for the Company. Mr. Putnam served as lead director from June 2016 until his appointment as non-executive chair in March 2017. 
At this time, the Company believes that having a separate chief executive officer and chair allows Mr. Arnold to focus on his role as president and chief executive officer and increases the Board's independence from management, leading to effective monitoring and oversight. As non-executive chair, Mr. Putnam serves as a key source of communication between the independent directors and our chief executive officer, establishes the agenda for each meeting of the Board and coordinates the agenda for and leads meetings of the independent directors. 
Board Oversight 
Strategic Planning 
Oversight of the Company's business strategy and strategic planning is a key responsibility of our Board. At the beginning of the year, the chair of the Board and our chief executive officer prepare an annual Board work plan that is tied to our strategic framework. As a result, elements of our strategy and operating plans are embedded in the agenda for every quarterly meeting of the Board. All members of our management committee, as well as other senior leaders, regularly attend Board and committee meetings and discuss the Company's strategy, plans and operating results with the Board and its committees. In addition, the Board dedicates a multi-day session each year to focus on the Company's long-term strategy and related planning. This session, which is led by our Corporate Strategy team and includes senior management, enables a deep discussion between directors and management regarding the Company's operating environment, desired strategic positioning and financial outcomes associated with execution of the strategic plan. 
The Board also dedicates significant attention to reviewing our capital allocation strategy, which is focused on disciplined capital management to drive long-term stockholder value. Key elements of our current strategy are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• prioritizing investments that drive organic business growth;   
• positioning the Company to take advantage of attractive merger and acquisition opportunities; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• returning capital to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends.  
[END TABLE]
Workplace Conduct and Culture 
We are committed to fostering a respectful, rewarding, diverse and inclusive workplace in which all of our employees and advisors are positioned for success. The Compensation Committee, as well as our Board, engages with our leadership team on a regular basis on human capital management topics, including culture, executive succession planning, talent acquisition and development, and diversity and inclusion initiatives. We believe that human capital management and talent development are important to the Company's continued success. 
Oversight of workplace conduct and culture was an area of focus for the Board and the Compensation Committee in 2018. At the Compensation Committee's request, management conducted an evaluation of the Company's workplace conduct practices, including its training, policies and procedures for preventing and responding to workplace conduct matters. In addition, during a closed session, the Board received a presentation from an external consultant on best practices for board oversight of workplace conduct and civility, as well as an assessment of the Company's reporting channels, policies, procedures and employee training. 
Finally, the Board engaged with management on a planned cultural transformation as part of the Company's Ease of Doing Business initiative and the development of a new corporate mission statement, which served to clarify the purpose of the Company and guide corporate culture: "We take care of our advisors, so they can take care of their clients." For additional information on the Ease of Doing Business initiative, please see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
Cybersecurity 
The Audit Committee and the Board are each involved in overseeing the Company's management of cybersecurity risk. We believe that cybersecurity protection is critical to maintaining our proprietary information and the trust of our advisors and their clients. In 2018, management provided regular updates to the Audit Committee and the Board on cybersecurity matters, including projects to strengthen controls and defenses, the threat landscape and the Company's incident response

 plans. The Board also received a presentation from an external consultant on sources of cybersecurity risk for financial services firms, best practices and the role of the Board in addressing cybersecurity risk. 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
Corporate social responsibility is an integral value for the Company. We enable the independent financial advisors that we support to provide objective financial guidance to millions of American families, and we are committed to supporting this vital work with excellence, integrity and ethical standards. Our work makes a difference, and we believe that the Company's sustainability depends not only on the business we conduct but also on how we conduct it. 
Our Board supports the Company's efforts to serve its stakeholders' interests, including stockholders, employees and advisors. The Nominating and Governance Committee provides oversight of our corporate social responsibility program, which began in 2008 with a focus on community involvement. The program subsequently expanded to encompass additional social and environmental matters that are aligned with the Company's strategy and culture, including its efforts to attract and retain highly talented employees who are passionate about the Company's mission. We intend to continue the evolution of the program in 2019 and have engaged a third party consultant to assist with the benchmarking and further development of the program, as well as related reporting. Our goal is a sustainability strategy that drives long-term value and related disclosures that are transparent and credible. The Board plans to review our corporate social responsibility program at least annually. 
In addition to sound corporate governance, we are committed to community involvement, diversity and inclusion, and environmental principles, as well as the security of our data and the privacy of our advisors' clients. The following is a summary of some of our practices and initiatives in these areas. To learn more, please see the "Social Responsibility" section of our website at www.lpl.com.

Annual Board Evaluation 
Our Board recognizes that a robust and constructive evaluation process is an important aspect of good corporate governance and board effectiveness. The Nominating and Governance Committee conducts an annual evaluation of our Board, each of its standing committees and individual directors following the end of each year. The goal is to provide a meaningful assessment of whether the Board's performance, operations, size and composition are effective for the Company, both in the short- and longer-term. 
Following discussion by the Nominating and Governance Committee, the 2019 annual evaluation included the following elements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a written questionnaire completed by each director;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

In addition, the Compensation Committee reviews our executive and non-executive officer talent to ensure that we attract and develop employees with the skill sets needed to execute our business strategy. The Compensation Committee focuses on ongoing development and coaching for future leadership positions, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annual succession planning for all managing director roles to ensure we are identifying and investing in key talent for  critical positions;

The Compensation Committee has authority under its charter to access such internal and external resources, including retaining legal, financial or other advisors, as the Compensation Committee deems necessary or appropriate to fulfill its responsibilities. In 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged an independent compensation consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (the "Compensation Consultant"), to advise on compensation matters and provide experiential guidance on what is considered fair and competitive practice in our industry, primarily with respect to the compensation of our executive officers. 
The Compensation Committee has the authority to delegate to subcommittees of the Compensation Committee any responsibilities of the full committee. The Compensation Committee may also delegate to a committee of one or more directors, or one or more of our executive officers, subject to certain restrictions, the power to grant stock options, restricted stock units, or other equity awards, and amend the terms of such awards, pursuant to our equity plans. References to the Compensation Committee in this proxy statement also refer to its subcommittees and its delegates, where applicable. 
The Compensation Committee met seven times during 2018. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No member of the Compensation Committee is or has been an officer or employee of ours or any of our subsidiaries. None of our executive officers serves or has served as a member of the board of directors, compensation committee, or other board committee performing equivalent functions of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as one of our directors or on our Compensation Committee. 
Risk Management and Compensation Policies and Practices 
We employ an enterprise risk management ("ERM") framework that is intended to address key risks and responsibilities, enable us to execute our business strategy, and protect our firm and its franchise. Our framework is designed to promote clear lines of risk management accountability and a structured escalation process for key risk information and events. In addition to the ERM framework, we have written policies and procedures that govern the conduct of business by our employees and independent financial advisors, and the terms and conditions of our relationships with financial product manufacturers. 
Our risk management governance approach is discussed in our Annual Report under "Item 7A.

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Risk Management." This approach includes the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee, and the Compensation Committee, as well as the Company's Risk Oversight Committee (the "ROC") and its subcommittees, the Company's Internal Audit department, the Company's Compliance, Legal and Risk department, and business line management. 
Role of the Audit Committee 
In addition to its other responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviews our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, as well as our major regulatory, litigation and financial risk exposures and the steps management has undertaken to monitor and control them. The Audit Committee generally provides reports to the Board at each of the Board's regularly scheduled quarterly meetings. 
The Audit Committee has mandated that the ROC oversee our risk management activities, including those of our subsidiaries. The Audit Committee generally receives reports on the ROC at each of the Audit Committee's regularly scheduled quarterly meetings. The reports cover topics addressed by the ROC at its meetings since the immediately preceding report. If warranted, matters of material risk are escalated to the Audit Committee or Board more frequently. In addition, our Internal Audit department provides independent verification of the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls by conducting risk assessments and audits designed to identify and cover important risk categories. Our Internal Audit department provides regular reports to the ROC and reports to the Audit Committee at least as often as quarterly. 
Role of the Compensation Committee 
In addition to its other responsibilities, the Compensation Committee assesses whether our compensation arrangements encourage inappropriate risk-taking, and whether risks arising from our compensation arrangements are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and evaluated the philosophy and standards on which our compensation practices have been developed and implemented across our Company. It is our belief that our compensation practices do not encourage inappropriate actions by our executive officers or other employees and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Specifically, we believe that our compensation practices avoid: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    a compensation mix overly weighted toward annual bonus awards;   
◾    an excessive focus on short-term equity incentive awards that could cause behavior to drive short- term stock price  gains in lieu of long-term value creation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    unreasonable financial goals or thresholds that could encourage efforts to generate near-term revenue with an adverse  impact on long-term success.  
[END TABLE]
We believe that our current business process and planning cycle fosters the following behaviors and controls that serve to mitigate the potential for adverse risk caused by the action of our executive officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    defined processes for developing strategic and annual operating plans, approval of capital investments, internal  controls over financial reporting and other financial, operational and compliance policies and practices;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    approval by our Board of the Companys annual corporate goals aligns these goals with our annual operating plan,  strategic plan and compensation programs, which achieves an appropriate risk-reward balance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    annual review of peer group practices and compensation surveys to develop compensation strategies and practices;

Director Compensation Policy 
Our director compensation policy provides that each of our non-employee directors receives an annual service retainer of $235,000. Of this amount, $80,000 is paid in a lump sum in cash (or, at the director's election, in the form of shares of our Common Stock as described below) and $155,000 is paid in the form of restricted shares of our Common Stock granted under our Amended and Restated 2010 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the "2010 Plan"). 
The following table sets forth the additional annual service retainers under our director compensation policy that a committee member received for his or her additional duties during 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       Chair         Each Other  Member      
       Chair         Each Other  Member      
  Audit Committee      $      30,000        $          15,000    
  Compensation Committee      $      25,000        $          12,500    
  Nominating and Governance Committee      $      20,000        $          10,000    
[END TABLE]
Our director compensation policy also provides that the chair of the Board receives an additional annual service retainer of $120,000 in connection with his additional duties. The retainers for committee and chair service are paid in cash in installments following the end of each quarter of service. Mr. Arnold does not receive additional compensation for his service as a director. 
The Compensation Committee reviews the director compensation practices of our compensation peer group annually, with the assistance of the Compensation Consultant. The 2018 benchmarking analysis indicated that our total compensation per director was below the median of our peer group, primarily as a result of below-median equity compensation. After reviewing this analysis, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved, in May 2018, an increase in the equity portion of the directors' annual service retainer from a grant date value of $130,000 to a grant date value of $155,000. 
As noted above, in 2018, each of our non-employee directors was granted an annual award of restricted stock having a grant date value of $155,000 (based on the average of the closing price of our Common Stock for the trailing thirty consecutive trading days including the grant date). These awards vest in full on May 7, 2019, which is the day prior to the Annual Meeting, generally subject to the director's continued service through that date. We believe these equity grants serve to further align our directors' interests with the interests of our stockholders. 
Our director compensation policy permits non-employee directors to make an election to be issued, in lieu of the cash portion of their annual service retainer, fully vested shares of our Common Stock. For 2018, the number of fully vested shares was determined by dividing $80,000 by the average of the closing price of our Common Stock for the trailing thirty consecutive trading days, ending on and including the date such shares were granted. 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
Under the LPL Financial Holdings Inc. Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Plan"), non-employee directors may make an annual election to defer receipt of the equity portion, or both the equity and cash portion, of their annual service retainer for Board service. For directors who make such a deferral election, a book-entry account is established and credited with a number of deferred stock units granted under our 2010 Plan equal in value to the shares and, if so elected by the director, the cash, that would otherwise be granted or paid absent such deferral election, with each deferred stock unit representing the right to receive a share of our Common Stock. Dividend equivalent rights are credited to a director's book-entry account, in the form of additional stock units, on both vested and unvested deferred stock units. All such shares will be paid only upon a director's separation from service or a change in control, as defined in the Deferred Plan. 
Equity Ownership Guidelines 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines include equity ownership guidelines for non-employee directors. Within five years of the date of his or her election to the Board, each non-employee director must maintain ownership of shares of Common Stock equal to five times the cash portion of the annual service retainer for Board service then in effect, not including any retainers for committee or chair service. All shares owned outright and beneficially owned by a non-employee director, including all shares of unvested restricted stock, are counted in determining compliance with such minimum ownership requirement. Neither vested nor unvested stock options are counted, however. As of March 8, 2019, each of our non-employee directors except for Ms. Mnookin, who was elected to the Board in June 2018, satisfied this minimum ownership requirement.

Summary of 2018 Corporate Performance 
The following summary of the Company's corporate performance is intended to provide additional context for the Compensation Committee's evaluation of the Company's performance in 2018 for compensation-related purposes. As discussed below, the Compensation Committee established a bonus pool funding framework at the beginning of 2018 that assigned equal weighting to the Company's financial performance and achievement of its pre-established 2018 corporate goals. 
Adjusted EBITDA was the primary metric used in the bonus pool funding framework to evaluate the Company's financial performance in 2018. The Compensation Committee also considered the Company's gross profit and expense management results, and their effect on the Company's Adjusted EBITDA results. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit and core G&A are non-GAAP financial measures that are described below under "Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
Under the bonus pool funding framework, the Compensation Committee assessed the achievement of the following five corporate goals for 2018, which were approved by the Board of Directors at the beginning of the year along with underlying key performance metrics and program deliverables: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Drive profitable growth and complete the onboarding and assimilation of advisors from National Planning Holdings, Inc.  ("NPH"), the broker-dealer network that the Company acquired in 2017 (the "Growth Goal");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Enhance the service experience for advisors and their clients by making it easier for them to do business with the  Company, which we refer to as our Ease of Doing Business initiative (the "Ease of Doing Business Goal");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Foster a culture where engaged employees are empowered to execute with excellence;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Improve operating leverage, effectively deploy capital and maximize stockholder returns (the "Operating Leverage  Goal"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Effectively manage firm risk.  
[END TABLE]
The Company generated strong financial results in 2018, including net income and earnings per share that grew year-over-year by 84% and 87%, respectively. The Company's gross profit of $1.9 billion in 2018 increased 25% from $1.6 billion in 2017, as a result of growth across all primary revenue lines. The Company maintained a focus on expense management while increasing investments in organic growth, which resulted in core general and administrative expense ("Core G&A") of $817 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year prior to costs related to corporate acquisitions. As a result, the Company's EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA each grew year-over-year by 40%. The Company's Adjusted EBITDA of $889 million in 2018 exceeded the Company's 2018 performance target of $777 million by $112 million, or 14%.

[END TABLE]
As further discussed below, the Compensation Committee determined that the Company generally performed well against its 2018 corporate goals. The Company drove growth in its total brokerage and advisory assets through a combination of organic growth and the acquisition of assets from NPH. Organic growth was driven by recruited assets of $27.3 billion, compared to $25.0 billion in 2017, and production retention that increased to 96% from 95% year-over-year. In addition, the Company's advisors continued to shift their business mix from brokerage to advisory solutions, and increase their use of both the Company's corporate advisory and centrally managed platforms, which benefit the Company's gross profit return on assets over time. Although the Ease of Doing Business initiative is ongoing, the Company made progress in 2018 in positioning itself to better serve and support its advisors, including improvements to its ClientWorks platform, service model and corporate culture. In addition, the Company's expense discipline enabled it to make significant investments in organic growth and technology capabilities in 2018, including through the acquisition of AdvisoryWorld, while also returning capital to stockholders. 
After taking into account the Company's overall performance against financial and non-financial goals for 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that the 2018 bonus pool would be funded at an above-target level, and the annual cash bonus awards to our NEOs (as well to our other executives and employees) would generally be paid at target, or above target level for high performing employees, including our NEOs. This approach is consistent with our compensation philosophy and past practice. 
Gross profit increased to $1.9 billion in 2018, up 25% from the prior year. 
Gross Profit 
($ in millions) 
The increase in the Company's gross profit combined with disciplined expense management generated operating leverage, as Adjusted EBITDA increased 40% year-over-year to $889 million. This result exceeded our 2018 performance target of $777 million by 14%.

Components of Compensation 
The core components of our executive compensation program are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Annual cash bonus awards;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Long-term equity incentive awards; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Severance and change-in-control  benefits.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee retains flexibility to determine the appropriate level and mix of the various compensation components consistent with our business needs. The mix of compensation elements is intended to provide our NEOs with a competitive total pay package that both rewards short-term results and drives long-term corporate performance. 
The annual cash bonus awards incentivize our NEOs to achieve pre-determined annual Company and individual performance goals. The long-term equity incentive awards incentivize our NEOs to increase stockholder value over a sustained period of time and to achieve pre-determined long-term Company performance goals, which align the interests of our NEOs with the interests of our stockholders. 
The charts below show that variable compensation comprised 85% of Mr. Arnold's 2018 total target compensation mix and 75% of our other NEO's 2018 average total target compensation mix. 
Base Salary 
We pay our NEOs base salaries in order to provide a level of competitive and stable income. The base salaries of our NEOs are set based on the responsibilities of the individual, taking into account the individual's skills, experience, and prior compensation levels, as well as market compensation levels of our peer group and other survey data, as described below. The Compensation Committee reviews base salaries for our NEOs on an annual basis, although salary changes may occur on a less frequent basis. 
Generally, the Compensation Committee will increase an NEO's base salary when individual performance, job scope, or market compensation data indicate that an increase is warranted. As the responsibilities of our NEOs increase in the future, the Compensation Committee generally plans to adjust compensation through increases in the size of long-term equity awards and, to a lesser extent, annual cash bonus opportunity, rather than through adjustments to base salary. 
With regard to our NEOs' base salaries for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    The base salaries of Messrs. Arnold, Audette, Seese and White were unchanged from 2017; and

[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Mr. Steinmeiers base salary was set at the time he joined us in August 2018.

[END TABLE]
In determining that the salaries remained appropriate for Messrs. Arnold, Audette, Seese and White, the Compensation Committee considered, among other things, competitiveness and mix of the total compensation opportunities based on benchmarking data prepared by the Compensation Consultant. This benchmarking data included compensation data for comparable roles at relevant peer companies and other survey data, as described further in the "Benchmarking" section ("Benchmarking Data"). 
In determining that Mr. Steinmeier's base salary was appropriate, the Compensation Committee considered his expertise, the nature and scope of his responsibilities at the Company and his experience prior to joining the Company, as well as internal equity considerations. 
The 2018 salaries for all of our named executive officers appear in the Summary Compensation table that follows this CD&A. 
Annual Cash Bonus Awards 
We provide annual cash bonus awards in order to tie a significant portion of the overall cash compensation of each of our NEOs to the achievement of annually-established, key short-term corporate objectives and financial goals of the Company. See "—Goals, Objectives and Performance Evaluation" below for a description of these objectives and goals and our 2018 performance against them. The Compensation Committee believes that our NEOs, as key members of the Company's leadership team, share responsibility for supporting the goals and performance of the Company. 
At the beginning of 2018, the Compensation Committee established: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Target award amounts for each NEO (other than Mr. Steinmeier, whose target award amount was set at the time he  joined us in August 2018 based on the same factors described under Base Salary);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Financial and non-financial Company performance goals, which were approved by  the Board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    A bonus funding framework that provided a potential range of bonus pool funding based on the level of achievement of the  Companys financial and non-financial performance goals.  
[END TABLE]
Target Award Amounts 
The Compensation Committee sets each NEO's individual target award amount by taking into account Benchmark Data, the nature of the NEO's role and the NEO's potential contribution to the execution of the Company's overall performance goals, rather than focusing only on their individual business unit or function. We believe that our annual cash bonus plan provides a significant incentive to our NEOs to work collaboratively as a team toward achieving our overall financial and non-financial corporate performance goals. 
Bonus Funding Framework 
In establishing the 2018 bonus pool funding framework, the Compensation Committee assessed its historical approach to annual incentive compensation. In connection with such assessment, the Compensation Committee determined that, relative to our peers' practices, our historical approach provided a greater level of discretion to the Compensation Committee to determine annual bonus pool funding within prescribed guidelines. 
As a result, the Compensation Committee established a more quantitative approach in 2018, although it continued to believe that maintaining a level of discretion was appropriate given the variety of factors that affect the Company's Adjusted EBITDA results, including prevailing interest rates and equity market performance. By undertaking a more quantitative approach, the Compensation Committee sought to provide management with increased transparency, and also sought to incentivize the achievement of key business priorities and to better align with industry best practice. 
To determine the bonus pool funding for 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the following criteria, with the indicated weightings: 
Criteria Weightings 
Target performance as it related to the financial and corporate goals would yield a 2018 bonus funding pool of $47.8 million ("Target Funding"). Bonuses to our NEOs, other executives and other employees would be paid from this pool.

[END TABLE]
Financial Performance Goals. For the Company's 2018 financial performance goals, the Compensation Committee established a range of bonus funding based on the Company's actual Adjusted EBITDA results relative to a performance target of $777 million. The range of bonus funding was scaled such that performance above target would yield a proportionately greater payout and performance below target would yield a proportionately lesser payout. This approach was intended to ensure that the financial results were a motivating element in the funding framework: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Percentage of Target       Percent payout   
 Percentage of Target       Percent payout   
 120%    150% 
 100%    100% 
 80%    50% 
[END TABLE]
The Company generated Adjusted EBITDA of $889 million in 2018, which was 14% greater than the performance target. This level of achievement resulted in a funding level above target for this component of the funding framework. 
Corporate Goals. The Compensation Committee established the following weights for each of the Company's 2018 corporate goals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Goal       Weight   
 Goal       Weight   
  Profitable Growth    15% 
  Ease of Doing Business    15% 
  Other goals, collectively    10% 
  Total    40% 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee assigned greater weighting to the Profitable Growth Goal and the Ease of Doing Business Goal because they were priority elements of the Company's longer-term strategy. 
The Committee also established a range of bonus funding per goal using the performance rating scale below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Rating       Payout   
 Performance Rating       Payout   
  Exceeds    150% 
  Meets    100% 
  Partially meets    75% 
[END TABLE]
As further described under "—Goals, Objectives and Performance Evaluation." the Compensation Committee rated: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Profitable Growth Goal and the Ease of Doing Business Goal as "partially meets;"   
• the Operating Leverage Goal as "exceeds;" and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each of the other goals as "meets."  
[END TABLE]
The collective achievement of these corporate goals resulted in a funding level slightly below target for this component of the funding framework. 
Committee Discretion. After determining the applicable funding level, the Compensation Committee had discretion to adjust bonus pool funding up or down based on its subjective assessments of key drivers of performance (including business and market factors affecting the Company's financial results) and the degree of difficulty of the individual 2018 corporate goals. 
For 2018, the collective level of achievement of the Company's financial and corporate goals yielded total bonus pool funding of $53.6 million, which exceeded Target Funding. 
The Compensation Committee exercised its discretion to increase the level of 2018 bonus pool funding to $55.4 million. In exercising its discretion, the Compensation Committee considered the degree of difficulty of the Profitable Growth Goal and the Ease of Doing Business Goal and, in particular: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's recruited assets of $27.3 billion, while below target, represented record results; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the multi-year nature of the Ease of Doing Business initiative, which affects Company-wide operations and corporate  culture, and progress on longer-term program deliverables in 2018 that exceeded expectations.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee also considered the Company's strategic execution, including its progress in providing new capabilities that help its financial advisors differentiate themselves in the marketplace. For example, the Company's acquisition of AdvisoryWorld accelerated delivery of technology solutions to the Company's financial advisors for proposal generation, investment analytics and portfolio modeling. 
The 2018 bonus pool was 6.2% of 2018 Adjusted EBITDA, compared to 7.5% as a percentage of 2017 Adjusted EBITDA for the 2017 bonus pool. 
Individual Award Determinations 
The Compensation Committee evaluates each NEO's performance against additional, previously established individual goals. In determining whether and to what extent bonuses are paid, the Compensation Committee takes into account

[END TABLE]
 discussions with management and the Compensation Consultant. See "—Goals, Objectives and Performance Evaluation." 
The Compensation Committee generally has the discretion to pay bonuses above or below the established targets based upon their assessment of each NEO's performance and potential, and other considerations such as internal pay equity. 
Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer met with the Compensation Committee in December 2018 and January 2019 to discuss our actual performance compared to our financial and corporate goals for 2018. Based primarily on this assessment of the Company's performance, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion to award annual cash bonuses to our NEOs above each executive's target award amount for 2018. 
The table and chart below show the target annual cash bonus award opportunity established for each of our NEOs at the beginning of 2018 (other than Mr. Steinmeier), as well as the actual cash bonus awarded to each of our NEOs for 2018, as determined by the Compensation Committee:

(1) Mr. Steinmeier's annual target award is $549,000, or 122% of his base salary. Mr. Steinmeier's target award for 2018 was prorated for the portion of the year following the commencement of his employment with the Company. Mr. Steinmeier also received a $500,000 sign-on bonus in connection with his commencement of employment. 
Annual Cash Bonus Awards 
($ in thousands) 
Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards 
The purposes of our long-term equity incentive program are to promote the achievement of corporate goals that drive long-term stockholder value, to align the interests of our executive officers and other key employees with our stockholders and to retain key executives. Our long-term equity incentive program is critical to our efforts to hire and retain the best talent in the financial services industry. 
At the beginning of each year, the Compensation Committee establishes annual long-term incentive ("LTI") award targets for executive officers after reviewing the recommendations of our chief executive officer and additional information, including Benchmarking Data. Annual target award amounts are based on an executive's position, including job scope and base salary, after consideration of Benchmarking Data and prior years' awards to the executive. For 2018, the Compensation Committee established annual LTI award targets for our NEOs that ranged from 125% to 350% of base salary. 
After the conclusion of the year, the Compensation Committee determines the actual amounts of the LTI award to be granted to each of our NEOs based on the target award previously set by the Compensation Committee as well as the NEO's individual performance both during the year and over time,

[END TABLE]
 leadership responsibilities and potential, and retention considerations. Based upon such considerations, an NEO's actual LTI award may vary from the target amount previously established. Unlike our annual cash bonus awards, the actual amount of executives' LTI awards are generally not based on annual Company performance, although the value of those LTI awards depends on the Company's longer-term performance. 
LTI Vehicles 
Prior to 2017, our long-term equity incentive awards consisted of time-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") and stock options. In 2017, the Compensation Committee approved performance share units ("PSUs") as an additional form of performance-based LTI award to be incorporated into the Company's awards for all executive officers, including our NEOs. We continue to believe the incorporation of PSUs into our long-term equity incentive program aligns with our pay-for-performance principles and puts appropriate focus on long-term alignment and pay relative both to market peers and stockholder returns. 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee approved equity grants to our chief executive officer that consisted of 50% PSUs and 50% stock options (by grant date value), and equity grants to our other NEOs (other than Mr. Steinmeier) that consisted of 40% PSUs, 30% stock options and 30% RSUs. We believe that this blended approach provides appropriate incentives for long-term stockholder value creation while also serving as a retention tool for the Company. 
Pursuant to the terms of his offer letter, the Compensation Committee granted Mr. Steinmeier a sign-on award of 30,143 RSUs on September 7, 2018, which vests in equal annual installments over four years. This grant reflects the results of negotiations in recruiting Mr. Steinmeier to accept employment with the Company. 
2018 Performance Share Unit Awards. The PSUs granted in 2018 are eligible to become earned PSUs based on the Company's total stockholder return ("TSR") relative to the TSR of a predetermined comparator group over a three-year performance period (the "Performance Period"). The comparator group consists of the Standard & Poor's 1500 Capital Markets Companies (the "Comparator Group"), and the number of earned PSUs is based on a relative ranking between the 25th and 80th percentile of the 
 Comparator Group's TSR results. Based on our relative performance, the number of earned PSUs can range between 50% (threshold) and 200% (maximum) of the target award as shown below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Performance Level    Relative TSR Percentile Rank (based on Comparator Group)    Common Shares Earned (as a% of Target) 
Performance Level    Relative TSR Percentile Rank (based on Comparator Group)    Common Shares Earned (as a% of Target) 
 Maximum   80th   200% 
 Target   50th   100% 
 Threshold   25th   50% 
 Below Threshold   Below 25th   0% 
[END TABLE]
The beginning and ending share price for TSR calculations will be based on the average closing price of our Common Stock for the trailing thirty consecutive trading days including each of the beginning and end dates of the Performance Period. Earned PSUs become vested on the later of the third anniversary of the grant date and the date on which the Compensation Committee certifies achievement of the performance criteria associated with the award. The number of earned PSUs is capped at 100% of the target award if the Company's TSR is negative over the Performance Period. 
In granting PSUs in 2018, the Compensation Committee calculated the number of shares underlying each award using a price per share equal to the average closing price of our Common Stock for the trailing thirty consecutive trading days including the grant date. This approach was intended to mitigate the effect of stock price volatility. 
2018 Stock Option Awards. The stock options granted in 2018 enable a grantee to purchase a specified number of shares of our Common Stock at a fixed purchase price over a fixed period of time. The exercise price is equal to the closing price per share of our Common Stock on the date of grant. These stock options will only have value if our share price exceeds the options' exercise price, and the stock options vest in three equal annual installments. 
In determining the size of stock option awards in 2018, the Compensation Committee used the value per option as of the grant date, calculated using the Black-Scholes model and related assumptions (the "Black-Scholes Value"). 
2018 Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Upon vesting, each RSU granted in 2018 entitles the grantee to receive one share of our Common Stock. RSUs vest

 over time, generally in three equal annual installments. In granting RSUs in 2018, the Compensation Committee calculated the number of shares underlying each award using a price per share equal to the average closing price of our Common Stock for the trailing thirty consecutive trading days including the grant date, consistent with the approach to PSUs. 
Effect of Termination of Employment and Retirement on 2018 Equity Awards. Unvested stock options, RSUs and PSUs generally are forfeited if an NEO voluntarily leaves the Company other than upon retirement. In the event of retirement, stock options and RSUs will become fully vested, stock options will generally remain exercisable for a period of two years following termination and PSUs will generally remain outstanding and eligible to become earned PSUs in accordance with the terms of the award. "Retirement" means the termination of employment other than for cause following either:

Additional Compensation Elements 
Severance and Change-in-Control Benefits 
Our Executive Severance Plan enables us to offer a form of protection to our NEOs in the event their employment with us is involuntarily terminated by the Company or is terminated for good reason by the executive (each, a "qualifying termination"). We believe that providing these benefits helps us compete for executive talent and may help us retain current key employees. All of our NEOs are eligible for severance benefits under the Executive Severance Plan. 
Executive Perquisites 
Executive perquisites are not a core component of our executive compensation program, however, we offer an executive financial services policy, pursuant to which NEOs are eligible to receive annual reimbursement of up to $15,000 for qualifying personal financial planning services. We also provide for reimbursement of relocation expenses in connection with an executive's work-related relocation. 
Other Compensation Components 
401(k) Plan.    We maintain a retirement savings plan (the "401(k) Plan"), for the benefit of all eligible employees, including our NEOs. Under the terms of the 401(k) Plan, employees may elect to make pre-tax 401(k) and Roth 401(k) contributions up to the statutorily prescribed limit. Effective May 1, 2018, we provide a match in an amount equal to 75% of an employee's elective deferral up to 8% of his or her eligible compensation on a pay period basis after six months of service. We provide this benefit to all of our eligible employees, and it is provided to our NEOs on the same basis as all other eligible employees. From January 1, 2018 to April 30, 2018, we provided a match in an amount of 65% of an employee's elective deferral up to 8% of his or her eligible compensation after one year of service. 
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.    Mr. Arnold, previously an executive of our wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, UVEST Financial Services Group, Inc. ("UVEST"), participates in the UVEST Executive Nonqualified "Excess" Plan (the "UVEST Plan"). The UVEST Plan allows certain highly compensated or management employees to defer up to 100% of their current compensation, which includes for this purpose base salary, service bonus, performance-based compensation, and commissions. Distributions of deferred amounts may be made only upon a qualifying distribution event, which, depending on the individual's election, may be a separation from service, disability (as defined in the UVEST Plan), death, a change-in-control event (as defined in the UVEST Plan), an unforeseeable emergency, or a specified date, or may be the earliest of one or more of these events. At the time an election is made to defer compensation under the UVEST Plan, participants may choose, with respect to each potential qualifying distribution event, to receive amounts in either a lump sum or in equal annual installments over a number of years (but not to exceed five years). Deferred amounts are credited with an investment return determined as if the amounts were invested in one or more investment funds made available by the UVEST Plan and selected by a participant. The amounts of compensation Mr. Arnold elected to defer under the UVEST Plan in 2018 are described in the table below titled "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for the Year Ended December 31, 2018."

Goals, Objectives and Performance Evaluation 
Our NEOs are primarily responsible for ensuring that the Company achieves its annual and long-term goals. At the beginning of 2018, our Board determined, with the input of the chief executive officer and the management team, the corporate goals for the year, including with regard to the Company's financial performance. In evaluating incentive compensation at the end of the year, the Compensation Committee considered the level of achievement of the Company's financial and non-financial performance goals. 
The Compensation Committee determined that the Company generally performed well against its 2018 goals based on its strong financial results and the achievement of the non-financial performance goals listed below. See "Executive Summary—Summary of 2018 Corporate Performance" and "Annual Cash Bonus Awards-- Bonus Funding Framework" for additional information about our 2018 performance and the 2018 bonus funding framework.

 Drive profitable growth and complete the onboarding and assimilation of NPH advisors     The Company successfully completed the onboarding of NPH advisors and assets. Recruited assets of $27.3 billion represented a  record recruiting year, and production retention increased to 96% from 95%. Profitability metrics outperformed annual targets, as advisors increased their use of the Company's corporate advisory and centrally managed platforms. 
 Make it easier for advisors and their clients to do business with the Company     The Company made progress on its multi-year Ease of Doing Business initiative. The Company delivered improvements to the  functionality, performance and resiliency of its ClientWorks platform, and began introducing new capabilities for advisors. It also streamlined processes and modernized policies, which contributed to reduced service center escalation volume. The  Company initiated a structured approach to a cultural transformation, including introduction of its new client-centric mission statement. Progress on program deliverables exceeded expectations in 2018 and resulted in improved advisor satisfaction  scores year-over-year. 
 Foster a culture where engaged employees are empowered to execute with excellence     The Company achieved an annualized retention rate of high performing employees of 93% in 2018. A 73.5% overall favorable score in  the annual employee engagement survey indicated an upward trend in employee engagement across all business units and validated our employee-focused initiatives. 
 Improve operating leverage, effectively deploy capital and maximize stockholder returns     The Company drove improved operating margin in 2018 through strong gross profit growth and disciplined expense management. The  Company deployed capital to drive organic growth, including $122 million in technology-related investments, and completed the AdvisoryWorld acquisition. The Company also returned $506 million to stockholders, and its total stockholder  return was in the top decile of the Comparator Group. 
 Effectively manage firm risk     The Company reduced its technology operational risk through control improvements related to "end of life" software,  technology infrastructure and cybersecurity. Compliance testing programs and execution of key controls and related initiatives were completed on time. The Company effectively managed its litigation and arbitration portfolio, as well as regulatory  matters.

As we look forward to 2019, the Board has recommitted our management team to goal categories that are generally consistent with those adopted in 2018. 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
We believe that presenting certain non-GAAP measures by excluding or including certain items can be helpful to investors and analysts who may wish to use some or all of this information to analyze the Company's current performance, prospects, and valuation. We use this non-GAAP information internally to evaluate operating performance and to formulate the budget for future periods. We believe that the non-GAAP measures and metrics discussed below are appropriate for evaluating the performance of the Company for compensation-related purposes. 
Gross Profit 
Gross profit is calculated as net revenues less commission and advisory expenses and brokerage, clearing, and exchange fees. All other expense categories, including depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets, are considered general and administrative in nature. Because the Company's gross profit amounts do not include any depreciation and amortization expense, the Company considers its gross profit amounts to be non-GAAP measures that may not be comparable to those of others in its industry. We believe that Gross Profit can provide investors with useful insight into the

 Company's core operating performance before indirect costs that are general and administrative in nature. 
Core G&A 
Core G&A consists of total operating expenses, which were $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, excluding the following expenses: commission and advisory, regulatory charges, promotional, employee share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, amortization of intangible assets, and brokerage, clearing, and exchange. We believe Core G&A reflects the corporate operating expense categories over which management can generally exercise a measure of control, compared with expense items over which management either cannot exercise control, such as commission and advisory expenses, or which management views as a promotional expense necessary to support advisor growth and retention, including conferences and transition assistance. Core G&A is not a measure of the Company's total operating expenses as calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company reviews Core G&A in addition to total operating expenses because total operating expenses contains expense components, such as commission and advisory expenses, that are market-driven and over which the Company cannot exercise control. Set forth below is a reconciliation of the Company's total operating expenses to Core G&A for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
EBITDA 
EBITDA is defined as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, amortization and loss on extinguishment of debt. We believe that EBITDA can be a useful financial metric in understanding the Company's earnings from operations. EBITDA is not a measure of the Company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Set forth below is a reconciliation of the Company's net income to EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Adjusted EBITDA 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA, further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA can be a useful financial metric in assessing our historical operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. Set forth below is a reconciliation of the Company's net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Gross profit, Core G&A, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of the Company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of profitability or liquidity. In addition, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA can differ significantly from company to company depending on, among other things, long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate, and capital investments.

How Compensation Decisions Were Made 
Role of Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee is composed entirely of directors who meet the Nasdaq standards for independence, including the heightened standards applicable to compensation committee members. The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing our human resources policies, including our compensation philosophy and principles, and overseeing our executive compensation policies and program. The Compensation Committee reviews and gives final approval of the total compensation payable to each of our NEOs, as well as the structure and implementation of the Company's overall compensation programs. In establishing total target compensation levels for our NEOs, the Compensation Committee, with input from the Compensation Consultant, determines the ranges of market compensation that it believes will enable us to effectively compete for and retain high-performing, qualified executives. The Compensation Committee's charter sets forth the Compensation Committee's responsibilities. 
CEO Assessment Process 
At the beginning of each year, the chief executive officer sets and reviews with the Board his priorities based on the corporate goals approved by our Board and additional feedback from our non-employee directors. Previous priorities have included achievement of financial results, providing strategic vision and plans to deliver new capabilities to advisors, operational execution to improve efficiency, effectiveness and manage risk, leading organizational talent development and effective management of external relationships. 
At the end of each year, the Compensation Committee requests that our chief executive officer prepare a written self-evaluation of performance against the year's corporate goals and CEO priorities. The chair of the Compensation Committee distributes the completed self-evaluation to each non-employee director, who completes an assessment of the chief executive officer's performance relative to these priorities. 
Our chief human capital officer provides a summary of the results of the non-employee directors' assessments to the Compensation Committee, which then considers the chief executive officer's self-evaluation and the results of the non-employee directors' assessments in evaluating the chief executive officer's performance for the year. The assessment materials are also discussed with the Board in an executive session led by the chair of the Compensation Committee, and after such discussion, feedback and compensation decisions are provided to the chief executive officer by the chair of the Compensation Committee and the Chair of the Board.

[END TABLE]
Role of Executive Officers 
At the beginning of each year, our executive officers develop the corporate goals and objectives that they believe should be achieved for the Company to be successful, which are approved by the Board and used by the Compensation Committee for the purpose of establishing how executive performance will be assessed for compensation-setting purposes. These objectives are derived largely from the Company's annual financial and strategic planning sessions, and are prioritized and aligned with the Company's long-term strategic plan. The objectives include both quantitative financial measurements and qualitative strategic and operational deliverables and goals. The chief executive officer and the chief financial officer provide quarterly reports to the Compensation Committee assessing the Company's performance against the corporate goals and objectives. 
Our chief executive officer annually reviews the individual performance of each of his direct reports, including the NEOs (but excluding himself), and provides the Compensation Committee with evaluations of each such direct report as well as recommendations regarding such person's base salary level, annual cash bonus and LTI award. Our chief human capital officer also attends Compensation Committee meetings and assists the Compensation Committee and the chief executive officer in recommending the final compensation levels for our NEOs. Both the chief executive officer and the chief human capital officer leave the meetings during discussions of compensation actions affecting them personally. 
Role of Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage its own advisors to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. The Compensation Committee has engaged the Compensation Consultant to advise on compensation matters and provide experiential guidance on what is considered fair and competitive practice in our industry, primarily with respect to the compensation of our executive officers, and also with respect to director compensation. 
In 2018, the Compensation Consultant worked directly with the Compensation Committee to develop recommendations for compensation levels for our executive officers and non-employee directors. In addition, the Compensation Consultant provided competitive compensation program and policy data as well as information concerning compensation plan design. Finally, the Compensation Consultant conducted a risk assessment of the Company's executive compensation policies and practices. 
The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of the Compensation Consultant pursuant to SEC rules and has determined that the work provided by the Compensation Consultant did not raise a conflict of interest. 
Benchmarking 
We believe that a competitive pay package is a critical tool in our efforts to attract and retain qualified executives. During 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged the Compensation Consultant to prepare an analysis to benchmark and assess our overall compensation program and practices against marketplace standards. The Compensation Committee's purpose in requesting this analysis was to ensure that the Company's executive compensation practices are competitive with our peers, as well as other companies, including technology companies, with which we increasingly compete for talent. 
This engagement included a focused review of the composition of the Company's peer group, including consideration by the Compensation Committee of additional candidates for potential inclusion in the group. With the assistance of the Compensation Consultant, the Compensation Committee assessed these additional candidates in light of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the nature of the Company's business model and its strategic plan, including its technology-driven capabilities  strategy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the companies and industries with which the Company competes for executive talent; and

• considerations related to the candidates' respective industry, size and business operations.

[END TABLE]
Following this assessment, the Committee determined to maintain the peer group in 2018 without change. The companies within our peer group consisted of: 
Working with the Compensation Consultant, the Compensation Committee reviewed each NEO's total target compensation against the compensation levels of comparable positions within our peer group. In addition to peer group data, the Compensation Committee also reviewed pay data from Equilar's Executive Compensation survey covering financial services and investment services companies, as well as supplemental market data from asset management, data processing and investment firms. 
Our goal is to ensure that we continue to measure our compensation practices against organizations that compete with us for key executives, that are considered important benchmarks in our industry, and that are comparable in size and scope to our business. As companies comprising our peer group change due to merger or acquisition activity, market capitalization, or business model, the Compensation Committee will consider appropriate changes to the group.

Compensation Policies and Practices 
No Employment Agreements 
We do not have individual employment agreements with any of our executive officers, including our NEOs, although we have a practice of entering into offer letters with new executive officers that generally lay out the expected terms and conditions of their employment, including potential levels of compensation. Our executives serve at the will of the Board, and their rights to severance benefits following a termination of employment, if any, are determined under our Executive Severance Plan, which applies uniformly to executives at the managing director level and above. 
Executive Severance Plan 
Under our Executive Severance Plan, participants who experience a qualifying termination of employment are eligible to receive continued payment of base salary for one year, an amount equal to the most recent annual bonus paid or payable to the executive and a subsidy of COBRA continuation benefits for one year. 
Additional benefits, including possible accelerated vesting of time-based equity and equity-based awards, are described elsewhere in this proxy statement under "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control for the Year Ended December 31, 2018." 
Equity Ownership Guidelines 
We have adopted equity ownership guidelines that are intended to better align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders. Each executive at the managing director level and above (which includes our NEOs) is required to achieve and maintain ownership of our Common Stock at a threshold equal to three times his or her base salary, while our CEO is required to achieve and maintain a threshold equal to six times his base salary. Generally, executive officers have five years from the time they become an executive officer to meet the minimum ownership requirements. The after-tax spread value of all vested stock options, as well as all outstanding shares, held by the executive count as shares for purposes of satisfying the minimum ownership requirement. Unvested stock options, unvested PSUs and unvested RSUs do not count. Our equity ownership guidelines may be found on our website at www.lpl.com.

                            Compensation Discussion and Analysis         
[END TABLE]
As of March 8, 2019, Messrs. Arnold, Audette and White had satisfied the minimum stock ownership requirement pursuant to our guidelines. Mr. Seese, who joined the Company in 2017, and Mr. Steinmeier, who joined the Company within the last year, have not satisfied this requirement. Under the stock ownership guidelines, an NEO is not required to purchase additional shares to satisfy the ownership requirement in the event of a decline in the Company's stock price, but the NEO is generally prohibited from selling or transferring shares until the minimum ownership requirement has been achieved. 
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy 
We believe that hedging transactions may permit executives to own Company securities obtained through our executive compensation program or otherwise without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, an executive may no longer have the same interests as the Company's other stockholders. As a result, we have adopted a policy, included within our Insider Trading Policy, which prohibits hedging or engaging in monetization transactions by executives, including through the use of puts and call options, collars, exchange funds, prepaid variable forwards, and equity swaps. We also prohibit executives from holding Company securities in a margin account, because a margin or foreclosure sale may occur when an executive is aware of material nonpublic information or otherwise not permitted to trade. 
Rule 10b5-1 Plan Policy 
The Company has adopted a policy (the "10b5-1 Policy") for all executive officers and directors of the Company who adopt Rule 10b5-1 plans for trading in Company securities. The 10b5-1 Policy is designed to prevent inadvertent violations of the federal securities laws when implementing Rule 10b5-1 plans. 
Annual Compensation Risk Assessment 
The Compensation Committee annually reviews our executive compensation policies and practices to ensure that they do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks. The Compensation Consultant provided a "comfort letter" in connection with the 2018 review, the results of which are discussed elsewhere in this proxy statement under "Information Regarding Board and Committee Structure—Risk Management and Compensation Policies and Practices." 
Say-on-Pay Feedback from Stockholders 
In 2017, we held an advisory vote on the frequency with which our named executive officer compensation program would be submitted to our stockholders for an advisory vote, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" vote. Our stockholders recommended that say-on-pay votes occur every year. Each year, the Compensation Committee considers the results of the prior year's advisory vote as it reviews and determines the total compensation packages for our NEOs in the current year. In 2018, we received support for our named executive officer compensation program at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, as 99% of the total votes cast on the advisory vote on say-on-pay voted to approve the proposal. 
162(m) Policy and Bonus Plan and PSUs 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, generally limits the deductibility of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to certain executive officers, subject to certain grandfathering rules for compensation arrangements in effect November 2, 2017 and not materially modified thereafter. The Compensation Committee believes that, in establishing the cash and equity incentive compensation programs for the Company's executive officers, the potential deductibility of the compensation payable under those programs should be only one of a number of relevant factors taken into consideration. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to award or approve, and has so awarded or approved, compensation that is not tax deductible or otherwise limited as to tax deductibility in order to provide competitive levels of total compensation to our executive officers in a manner designed to incentivize achievement of our strategic goals and objectives and in furtherance of our compensation principles described above.

The aggregate grant date fair value of RSUs was determined using the closing price of the Common Stock on the grant  date. The aggregate grant date fair value of stock option awards was determined using the Black-Scholes model. The underlying valuation assumptions for PSUs and stock option awards are further disclosed in Note 15, Share-Based Compensation,  to our consolidated financial statements filed with our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and Note 14, Share-Based Compensation, to our consolidated financial  statements filed with our annual reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Pursuant to SEC rules, the amounts shown exclude the impact of estimated forfeitures related to  service-based vesting conditions. The table below shows the grant date fair value of PSU awards granted in 2018 and 2017 assuming target and maximum levels of performance are achieved (amounts under the "Stock Awards" column represent the  grant date fair value of PSUs based on the probable outcome of performance conditions, which for each of 2018 and 2017 assumed target level of performance was achieved).

(2)  Represents the number of threshold, target and maximum potential future payouts under the PSUs awarded under our 2010  Plan. PSUs are eligible to become earned PSUs based on the Company's TSR relative to the TSR of the Comparator Group over the Performance Period. The number of PSUs that is earned is determined based on the Company's relative ranking  between the 25th and 80th percentile of the Comparator Group's TSR results. Amounts in the threshold column (50% of the target award) reflect the number of PSUs that would be earned if threshold performance were achieved (a TSR percentile rank  at or above the 25% percentile); amounts in the target column (100% of the target award) reflect the number of PSUs that would be earned if target performance were achieved (a TSR percentile rank at or above 50%); and amounts in the maximum column  (200% of the target awards) reflect the number of PSUs that would be earned if maximum performance were achieved (a TSR percentile rank at or above 80%). The number of PSUs earned is interpolated between threshold, target and maximum performance  levels. The number of earned PSUs is capped at 100% of the target award if the Company's TSR is negative during the Performance Period. Earned PSUs become vested on the later of the third anniversary of the grant date and the date on which the  Compensation Committee certifies achievement of the performance criteria associated with the award and determines the number of PSUs that have become earned under the award agreement.

Executive Severance Plan 
All of our NEOs are eligible to participate in our Executive Severance Plan. As described in more detail below, our Executive Severance Plan provides a uniform framework for payments and benefits to be provided to all executive participants upon certain terminations of employment, subject to a participant's compliance with post-termination restrictive covenants and delivery of a general release agreement in favor of the Company. Our Executive Severance Plan can be amended or terminated at any time, in our discretion, and no eligible executive, including our NEOs, has a legally binding right to any payments or benefits under the plan. 
Restrictive Covenants 
As a condition to benefits under the Executive Severance Plan, an executive is not permitted to engage in prohibited competitive conduct for a period of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    12 months following termination of employment by the Company without cause or a termination by the executive for good  reason; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    18 months following termination of employment by the Company without cause or a termination by the executive for good  reason, in each case within 12 months following a change-in-control.  
[END TABLE]
Prohibited competitive conduct is set forth in the Executive Severance Plan, which includes provisions related to non-competition, non-solicitation and the confidentiality of the Company's proprietary information. 
Severance and Change-in-Control Payments 
We may become obligated to make severance payments to each of our NEOs upon the termination of the executive's employment under our Executive Severance Plan. These benefits are described below. We, however, have no obligation to grant any of the executive officers any "gross-up" or other "make-whole" compensation for any tax imposed on severance or change-in-control payments made to the executive officer, including "parachute payments." Severance payable in connection with a change-in-control under our Executive Severance Plan is subject to a so-called "modified golden parachute cutback" provision pursuant to which excess parachute payments would be reduced so that no portion of the payments would be subject to the excise tax, to the extent such reduction would result in greater after-tax benefits to the executive.

[END TABLE]
In addition, any performance-based equity or equity-based awards (such as outstanding PSUs) will remain outstanding and eligible to become earned in accordance with their terms, provided that the portion of the awards that becomes earned and vested will be prorated based upon the number of days that have elapsed in the applicable Performance Period. 
Further, upon a termination of employment by the Company without cause or by the executive for good reason within the 12-month period following the date of consummation of a change-in-control (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan), a Participant will be entitled to the following payments and benefits, subject to the execution of a release of claims and continued compliance with post-termination restrictive covenants:

[END TABLE]
The Participant is required to provide notice within 90 days following the "Good Reason" event (and the Company will have 30 days following such notice to cure).

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company (each of the  foregoing, a Business Combination), provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, a change-in-control is not deemed to occur as a result of a  Business Combination following which the individuals or entities who were beneficial owners of the outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Company immediately prior to such Business Combination  beneficially own, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the resulting, surviving, or acquiring corporation in such transaction.  
[END TABLE]
Termination Other than For Good Reason 
The Executive Severance Plan does not provide for any separation benefits or payments upon an executive's retirement or voluntary resignation from employment other than for good reason. Upon such a retirement or voluntary resignation, an eligible executive would be entitled to receive only base salary through such executive's separation date, reimbursements for reasonable business expenses, and any other employee benefit entitlements to which the executive is entitled under the Company's other employee benefit plans and programs. 
Death, Disability, and Retirement 
The Executive Severance Plan does not provide for any separation benefits or payments upon a termination due to death, disability, or voluntary termination (regardless of age). Upon such a termination, an eligible executive would be entitled to receive only base salary through the separation date, reimbursements for reasonable business expenses and any other employee benefit entitlements to which the executive is entitled under the Company's other employee benefit plans and programs.

Stock Options 
All stock options held by our NEOs as of December 31, 2018 were granted under our 2008 Stock Option Plan (the "2008 Plan") or our 2010 Plan. All stock options held by our NEOs that are outstanding under the 2008 Plan were fully vested as of December 31, 2018. 
In accordance with our NEOs' option agreements, unvested stock options are canceled upon termination of employment, unless (1) otherwise agreed by the Company, or (2) in the case of death or retirement, in which case any and all unvested portions of stock options shall become vested. The unvested portion of stock options granted subsequent to February 23, 2017 will also become vested in full in the event of disability (as defined in the stock option award agreement). Unless the NEO is terminated for cause, vested options will be exercisable for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

In accordance with the NEOs' RSU agreements, unvested portions of RSU awards are cancelled upon termination of employment, unless (1) otherwise agreed by the Company, or (2) in the case of death or retirement, in which case any and all unvested portions shall become vested. The unvested portion of RSUs granted subsequent to February 23, 2017 will become vested in full in the event of disability (as defined in the RSU award agreement). If the NEO is terminated for cause, the vested portion of the award will terminate. All RSUs held by our NEOs as of December 31, 2018 were granted under our 2010 Plan. 
Performance Share Units (PSUs) 
In accordance with the NEOs' PSU agreements, unvested portions of PSUs are forfeited upon termination of employment, except in the case of death, disability or retirement, in which case the PSUs will not terminate and will instead remain outstanding and eligible to become earned PSUs on a pro-rated basis in accordance with the terms of the PSU award agreement. All PSUs held by our NEOs as of December 31, 2018 were granted under our 2010 Plan. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the ratio of total annual compensation for Mr. Arnold, our president and chief executive officer (the "CEO"), to the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees (other than the CEO) (the "CEO Pay Ratio"). For 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Mr. Arnolds total annual compensation: $7,128,351  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Median annual total compensation of all employees (other than CEO): $84,199  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Ratio of the annual total compensation of the CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees (other  than CEO): 85:1  
[END TABLE]
We used the following methodology to determine the foregoing ratio: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• SEC rules allow a company to use the same median employee for three consecutive fiscal years. We decided to use our 2017  median employee for purposes of determining our 2018 pay ratio. However, as discussed below, the 2018 pay ratio was determined based on the 2017 median employee's 2018   
[END TABLE]

                            Compensation of Named Executive Officers compensation. We believe that it is appropriate to use the same median employee over two years because there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements  that we reasonably believe would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We determined our 2017 median employee from our employee population on December 31, 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To identify the median employee from our employee population, we first determined each employee's 2017 Box 1 W-2 wages ("Compensation Measure") for the 2017 calendar year ("Measurement Period"), as reflected in our payroll records and systems.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For those employees who were employed on December 31, 2017 but who were not employed for the full Measurement  Period, we annualized compensation paid to such employees during 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We then identified our 2017 median employee from our employee population based on this Compensation Measure.   
[END TABLE]
We then determined the annual total compensation for 2018 of the median employee and our CEO in accordance with the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median employee's annual total compensation represents the amount of such employee's compensation for 2018  that would have been reported in the Summary Compensation Table in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K if the employee were a named executive officer for 2018.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual total compensation of the CEO represents the amount reported in the "Total" column of our Summary  Compensation Table included on page 47 of this proxy statement.  
[END TABLE]
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above.

Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms or written representations from certain reporting persons received by us with respect to 2018, we believe that our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities have complied with all applicable filing requirements.

Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions 
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
In accordance with the charter of the Audit Committee and our written policy, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving related party transactions. If it is not feasible to approve related party transactions in advance, the Audit Committee is permitted to ratify such transactions after the Company has entered into them, subject to the procedures and considerations described below. 
The policy with respect to related party transactions applies to any transaction, arrangement or relationship, or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) in which: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    the aggregate amount involved exceeds or is expected to exceed $120,000;

◾    the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a participant; and

[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    any beneficial owner of more than five percent of our Common Stock; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    any immediate family member of the foregoing persons.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee is provided with the material facts of all transactions that require the Audit Committee's approval under the policy. In determining whether to approve or ratify a particular transaction, the Audit Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person's interest in the transaction. 
Under the policy, a director is not permitted to participate in any discussion or approval of a transaction for which he or she (or an immediate family member) is the related person, and such director must provide the Audit Committee with all material information concerning the transaction. If an approved transaction is ongoing, the Audit Committee may establish guidelines for management to follow in its dealings with such person and will annually review and assess compliance with such guidelines, and whether the transaction remains appropriate for the Company. 
Business Transactions with Certain Stockholders 
Janus Henderson Group PLC ("Janus") considered itself the direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than five percent of our Common Stock during 2018. The Company has entered into certain agreements in the ordinary course of business with affiliates of Janus and during the year ended December 31, 2018 received revenue of approximately $3.3 million under such agreements.

[END TABLE]
Proposal 2: Ratification of the Appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP 
by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors as 
Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and the Board has directed that management submit the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm for ratification by stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Deloitte has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since 2001. 
Although stockholder ratification of the selection of Deloitte is not required by our bylaws or otherwise, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board is submitting the appointment of Deloitte to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. The Board and the Audit Committee believe they have undertaken appropriate steps with respect to oversight of Deloitte's independence and that the continued retention of Deloitte to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
If the stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider the matter. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
Representatives of Deloitte are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement and respond to appropriate questions from stockholders. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THIS PROPOSAL.

 services) ("Pre-approved Services") for a particular year. On an annual basis, the Audit Committee reviews and pre-approves the scope and dollar limits associated with the various Pre-approved Services, as well as an overall pre-approved dollar limit for all engagements with the auditors, for the fiscal year. 
Under its policy, the Audit Committee may not delegate its pre-approval authority to management, and its full approval is required (and cannot be delegated) for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    the annual audit engagement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    any proposed engagement to assess the Companys internal controls (regardless of expected cost); or

[END TABLE]
Engagements for services outside the scope and dollar limits associated with Pre-approved Services and with fees up to $200,000 may be approved by the chair of the Audit Committee, to whom authority has been expressly delegated. 
Engagements for Pre-approved Services that are within the applicable scope and pre-approved dollar limit for a particular year may be undertaken by management without further authorization by the Audit Committee. 
The policy also requires that prior to the provision of any tax services or engagements for internal controls, written documentation must be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm describing the scope and nature of the proposed engagement. In addition, the potential effects of the engagement on the auditors' independence must be discussed with the Audit Committee. With respect to tax services engagements, the auditors must also provide descriptions of the fee structure and any other written agreement or amendment to an existing engagement letter relating to the provision of the tax service, and descriptions of the involvement of any third party.

Report of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Audit Committee") is comprised of the four directors named below. Each member of the Audit Committee is an independent director (as independence is defined in the listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act with respect to membership on audit committees). 
The Audit Committee has adopted a written charter, which has been approved by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited consolidated financial statements with management, which has primary responsibility for the consolidated financial statements, and with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for expressing opinions on the conformity of the Company's audited consolidated financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and on the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, which was Deloitte & Touche LLP and the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (collectively referred to as "Deloitte") for 2018 and 2017, the matters that are required to be discussed by applicable standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), including Auditing Standard 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees," as adopted by the PCAOB, as well as Rule 2-07 of Regulation S-X of the SEC-- "Communication with Audit Committees." Deloitte has also provided to the Audit Committee their communication required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, "Communications with Audit Committees Concerning Independence," and the Audit Committee discussed with Deloitte the firm's independence. The Audit Committee also considered and determined the provision by Deloitte of non-audit related services in 2017, which consisted of tax advisory services, an assessment of the Company's consolidated audit trail program and cyber incident response training, is compatible with the independence standard.

Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer Compensation 
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 28 of this proxy statement describes our executive compensation program and the compensation decisions that the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors made in 2018 with respect to the compensation of our named executive officers. The Board of Directors is asking stockholders to cast a non-binding, advisory vote FOR the following resolution: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.

[END TABLE]
As we describe in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, our named executive officer compensation is designed to closely align the interests of our named executive officers with those of our stockholders on both a short-term and long-term basis, and to attract and retain key executives critical to our success. 
We urge stockholders to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 28 of this proxy statement and to review the 2018 Summary Compensation table and related compensation tables and discussion, appearing on pages 47 through 55, which provide detailed information on the Company's compensation policies and practices. We believe stockholders should focus on the following areas when reviewing our named executive officer compensation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Pay for Performance 
 Annual Cash Bonus Opportunities. We provide annual cash bonus awards in order  to tie a significant portion of the overall cash compensation of each of our NEOs to the achievement of annually-established, key short-term corporate objectives and financial goals of the Company, as well as individual performance goals. At  the beginning of 2018, the Compensation Committee established a bonus funding framework based on an objective financial performance target and the collective achievement of the Company's five corporate goals for 2018. Each NEO's individual  target award amount was set by the Compensation Committee by reference to market compensation for comparable positions within our peer group as well as the nature of the NEO's role and responsibilities. By emphasizing executives'  contributions to the Company's overall performance rather than focusing only on their individual business or function, we believe that these cash bonuses provided a significant incentive to our NEOs to work towards achieving our overall Company  objectives. 
 Long-Term Incentives. The purpose of our long-term equity incentive program  is to promote achievement of goals that drive long-term stockholder value and retain key executives. We provide stock-based, long-term compensation to our NEOs through equity awards under our stockholder-approved equity plans. We believe this  long-term incentive compensation motivates our NEOs to sustain longer-term financial operational performance and rewards them when such efforts lead to increases in stockholder value. 
 Alignment with Long-Term Stockholder Interests 
 Our executive compensation is weighted towards variable, at-risk pay in  the form of annual and long-term incentives, with a large portion of executive compensation tied to long-term performance. In addition, we have adopted: 
 Equity Ownership Guidelines. We focus our executives on long-term stockholder  value by requiring that all executive officers own a significant amount of our equity.

                            Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on Named Executive Officer  Compensation         
 Performance-Based LTI Vehicles. In 2018, equity grants to our president and  chief executive officer consisted of 50% PSUs and 50% stock options (by grant date value) and equity grants to our other NEOs (other than Mr. Steinmeier, who received a sign-on grant of RSUs after  commencing employment with us in August 2018) consisted of 40% PSUs, 30% stock options and 30% RSUs. We believe that this blended approach aligns with our  pay-for-performance principles and provides appropriate incentives for long-term stock value creation. The use of stock options is aligned with stock appreciation on an  absolute basis and the use of PSUs puts appropriate focus on long-term alignment and pay relative both to market peers and stockholder returns. 
 Recoupment Policy. We have adopted a recoupment policy that permits the  Compensation Committee, in the event of a restatement of the Company's financial statements due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the securities laws, to review the annual cash bonuses, performance-based  compensation and time-based equity and equity-based awards awarded or paid to executive officers during the three-year period preceding the announcement by the Company of its obligation to restate its financial statements. If the amount of the  annual cash bonuses or performance-based compensation received would have been lower had the level of achievement of applicable financial performance goals been calculated based on such restated financial results, the Compensation Committee may seek  reimbursement from any of the covered executives in the amount of the excess compensation awarded or paid. 
 Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy. We believe that hedging transactions may  permit executives to own Company securities obtained through our executive compensation program or otherwise without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, an executive may no longer have the same objectives as the Company's  other stockholders. As a result, we have adopted a policy, included within our Insider Trading Policy, which prohibits hedging or monetization transactions by our executives, including through the use of puts and call options, collars, exchange  funds, prepaid variable forwards, and equity swaps. We also prohibit executives from holding Company securities in a margin account, because a margin or foreclosure sale may occur when an executive is aware of material nonpublic information or  otherwise not permitted to trade.
