[END TABLE]
Who Can Vote 
The Board of Directors has fixed January 11, 2019 as the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, only holders of record of shares of ESSA Bancorp common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at the close of business on such date will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. On January 11, 2019,11,819,814 shares of ESSA Bancorp common stock were outstanding and held by approximately 1,805 holders of record. The presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ESSA Bancorp common stock is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. 
How Many Votes You Have 
Each holder of shares of ESSA Bancorp common stock outstanding on January 11, 2019 will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record. However, ESSA Bancorp's Articles of Incorporation provide that stockholders of record who beneficially own in excess of 10% of the then-outstanding shares of common stock of ESSA Bancorp are not entitled to any vote with respect to the shares held in excess of that 10% limit. A person or entity is deemed to beneficially own shares that are owned by an affiliate, as well as by any person acting in concert with such person or entity. 
Matters to Be Considered 
The purpose of the Annual Meeting is to vote on the election of three directors; to ratify the appointment of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as our independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019; and to consider an advisory, non-binding resolution with respect to the executive compensation described in the Proxy Statement. 
You may be asked to vote upon other matters that may properly be submitted to a vote at the Annual Meeting. You also may be asked to vote on a proposal to adjourn or postpone the Annual Meeting. ESSA Bancorp could use any adjournment or postponement for the purpose, among others, of allowing additional time to solicit proxies. 
How to Vote 
You may vote your shares by completing and signing the enclosed Proxy Card and returning it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope or by attending the Annual Meeting. Alternatively, you may choose to vote your shares using the internet or telephone voting options explained on your Proxy Card. You should complete and return the Proxy Card accompanying this document, or vote using the internet or telephone voting options, in order to ensure that your vote is counted at the Annual Meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting, regardless of whether you plan to attend. Where no instructions are indicated, validly executed proxies will be voted "FOR" the election of the three director nominees named on the Proxy Statement as well as "FOR" each other proposal set forth in this Proxy Statement for consideration at the Annual Meeting.  If you are a stockholder whose shares are not registered in your own name, you will need appropriate documentation from the stockholder of record to attend the Annual Meeting. Examples of such documentation include a broker's statement or letter or other documentation that will confirm your ownership of shares of ESSA Bancorp common stock. If you want to vote your shares of ESSA Bancorp common stock that are held in street name in person at the Annual Meeting, you will need a written proxy in your name from the broker, bank or other nominee who holds your shares. 
The Board of Directors is currently unaware of any other matters that may be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting. If other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting, shares represented by properly submitted proxies will be voted, or not voted, by the persons named as proxies on the Proxy Card in their best judgment. 
Quorum and Vote Required 
The presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of ESSA Bancorp common stock is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted solely for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. A proxy submitted by a broker that is not voted is sometimes referred to as a broker non-vote. 
Directors are elected by a plurality of votes cast, without regard to either broker non-votes or proxies as to which authority to vote for the nominees being proposed is "WITHHELD." The ratification of the appointment of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as independent registered public accountants is determined by a majority of the votes cast, without regard to broker non-votes or proxies marked "ABSTAIN." As to the advisory, non-binding resolution with respect to our executive compensation as described in this Proxy Statement, a stockholder may: (i) vote "FOR" the resolution; (ii) vote "AGAINST" the resolution; or (iii) "ABSTAIN" from voting on the resolution. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, without regard to either broker non-votes or shares as to which the "ABSTAIN" box has been selected on the proxy card, is required for the approval of this non-binding resolution. While this vote is required by law, it will neither be binding on ESSA Bancorp or the Board of Directors, nor will it create or imply any change in the fiduciary duties of, or impose any additional fiduciary duty on ESSA Bancorp or the Board of Directors. 
Participants in the ESOP, 401(k) Plan and Equity Incentive Plan 
If you participate in the ESSA Bank & Trust Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") or if you hold ESSA Bancorp common stock through the ESSA Bank & Trust 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"), you will receive a vote authorization form that reflect all shares you may direct the trustees to vote on your behalf under the plans. Under the terms of the ESOP, the ESOP trustee will vote all shares held by the ESOP, but each ESOP participant may direct the trustee how to vote the shares of common stock allocated to his or her account. The ESOP trustee, subject to the exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, will vote all unallocated shares of common stock held by the ESOP and all allocated shares for which no voting instructions are received in the same proportion as shares for which it has received timely voting instructions. Under the terms of the 401(k) Plan, a participant is entitled to provide voting instructions for all shares credited to his or her 401(k) Plan account and held in the ESSA Bancorp Stock Fund. Shares for which no voting instructions are given or for which instructions were not timely received will be voted in the same proportion as shares for which voting instructions were received. Pursuant to the terms of the ESSA Bancorp 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, a participant is entitled to direct how to vote his or her non-vested restricted shares of ESSA Bancorp. The deadline for returning your voting instruction form is February 21, 2019.  Revocability of Proxies 
You may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Annual Meeting. You may revoke your proxy by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Written notices of revocation and other communications regarding the revocation of your proxy should be addressed to: 
ESSA Bancorp, Inc. 
200 Palmer Street 
Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania 18360 
Attention: Stephanie Lefferson, Corporate Secretary 
If your shares are held in street name, your broker votes your shares and you should follow your broker's instructions regarding the revocation of proxies. 
Solicitation of Proxies 
ESSA Bancorp will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from you. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, ESSA Bancorp will request that banks, brokers and other holders of record send proxies and proxy material to the beneficial owners of ESSA Bancorp common stock and secure their voting instructions. ESSA Bancorp will reimburse such holders of record for their reasonable expenses in taking those actions. ESSA Bancorp has also made arrangements with Laurel Hill Advisory Group, LLC to assist ESSA Bancorp in soliciting proxies and has agreed to pay them a fee of $5,500 plus reasonable expenses for these services. If necessary, ESSA Bancorp may also use several of its regular employees, who will not be separately compensated, to solicit proxies from stockholders, personally or by telephone, facsimile or letter. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors has determined that the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting are in the best interest of ESSA Bancorp and its stockholders, and the Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the election of the director nominees as well as each other matter to be considered.

The officers and directors of the Company and beneficial owners of greater than 10% of the common stock are required to file reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership of the common stock. Securities   and Exchange Commission rules require disclosure in the Company's Proxy Statement or Annual Report on Form 10-K of the failure of an officer, director or 10% beneficial owner of the common stock to file a Form 3, 4, or 5 on a timely basis. Based on the Company's review of ownership reports, all such reports were filed on a timely basis during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, other than one Form 4 filing for the Chief Financial Officer which was delayed due to an administrative error.  PROPOSAL I – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The Board of Directors currently consists of eleven (11) members and is divided into three classes, with one class of directors elected each year. William A. Viechnicki, D.D.S., is retiring from the Board of Directors effective as of the 2019 Annual Meeting. As a result, ESSA Bancorp will reduce the size of its Board of Directors from eleven (11) to ten (10), effective as of the commencement of the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Three (3) directors will be elected at the Annual Meeting and will serve until their successors have been elected and qualified. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has nominated Gary S. Olson, Joseph S. Durkin and Christine Davis Gordon to serve as directors for a three-year term. 
The biographies of each of the nominees and continuing board members below contain information regarding the person's business experience and the experiences, qualifications, attributes or skills that caused the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors to determine that the person should serve as a director. The principal occupation during the past five years of each of our directors is set forth below. All directors have held their present positions for at least five years unless otherwise stated. Each existing director is also a director of ESSA Bank & Trust. 
All of the nominees and directors continuing in office are or were long-time residents of the communities served by ESSA Bancorp and many of such individuals have operated, or currently operate, businesses located in such communities. As a result, each nominee and director continuing in office has significant knowledge of the businesses that operate in ESSA Bancorp's market area, an understanding of the general real estate market, values and trends in such communities and an understanding of the overall demographics of such communities. As the holding company for a community banking institution, ESSA Bancorp believes that the local knowledge and experience of its directors assists ESSA Bancorp in assessing the credit and banking needs of its customers, developing products and services to better serve its customers and assessing the risks inherent in its lending operations, and provides ESSA Bancorp with greater business development opportunities. 
It is intended that the proxies solicited on behalf of the Board (other than proxies in which the vote is withheld as to the nominees) will be voted at the Annual Meeting "FOR" the election of the nominees. If the nominees are unable to serve, the shares represented by all such proxies will be voted for the election of such substitute as the Board may recommend. At this time, the Board knows of no reason why the nominees would be unable to serve if elected. Except as indicated herein, there are no arrangements or understandings between the nominees and any other person pursuant to which such nominees were selected. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE NOMINEES LISTED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.

Corporate Governance and Code of Ethics and Business Conduct 
ESSA Bancorp is committed to maintaining sound corporate governance principles and the highest standards of ethical conduct and is in compliance with applicable corporate governance laws and regulations. 
The Board has adopted a code of ethics for the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and all persons performing similar functions. The code of ethics is designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote honest and ethical conduct, the avoidance of conflicts of interest, full and accurate disclosure and compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. The code of ethics is available on the Company's website at www.essabank.com. Amendments to and waivers from the code of ethics are disclosed on the Company's website.  Director Independence 
The Board has determined that, except for Mr. Olson, each member of the Board is an "independent director" within the meaning of the NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards and the Company's corporate governance policies. Mr. Olson is not considered independent as he is an executive officer of the Company. There were no transactions that the Board of Directors needed to review that are not required to be reported under "—Transactions with Certain Related Persons" that would bear in the determination of the independence of the directors. 
Our Board of Directors is currently chaired by William A. Viechnicki, D.D.S., who is a non-executive director. This structure ensures a greater role for the independent directors in the oversight of ESSA Bancorp and ESSA Bank & Trust, and active participation of the independent directors in setting agendas and establishing priorities and procedures for the work of the Board. Dr. Viechnicki is retiring from the Board of Directors effective as of the 2019 Annual Meeting. The Board anticipates that it will elect Robert C. Selig, Jr., as its new Chairperson. Mr. Selig is a non-executive director. 
The Board of Directors is actively involved in oversight of risks that could affect ESSA Bancorp. This oversight is conducted primarily through committees of the Board of Directors, but the full Board of Directors has retained responsibility for general oversight of risks. The Board of Directors satisfies this responsibility through full reports by each committee chair regarding such committee's considerations and actions, as well as through regular reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of particular risks within ESSA Bancorp. Risks relating to the direct operations of ESSA Bank & Trust are further overseen by the Board of Directors of ESSA Bank & Trust, which consists of the same individuals who serve on the Board of Directors of ESSA Bancorp. 
Board Meetings and Committees 
The Board of Directors of ESSA Bancorp met 12 times during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. No director attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of the total number of Board meetings and committee meetings on which he or she served (during the period in which he or she served) that were held during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. Executive sessions of the independent directors are conducted on a regular basis. Although not required, attendance of Board members at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders is encouraged. All of our directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
The Company has three standing Board committees: Compensation; Nominating and Corporate Governance; and Audit. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee consists of four independent directors: Ms. Weekes (Chair) and Messrs. Kutteroff, Durkin and Hosbach. The responsibilities of the Compensation Committee include reviewing the overall compensation philosophy of ESSA Bancorp, determining the salaries and other forms of compensation to be paid to the President and Chief Executive Officer and those executive officers who report directly to the President and Chief Executive Officer, review of directors' compensation and administration of management compensation plans. 
None of these individuals was an officer or employee of ESSA Bancorp or ESSA Bank & Trust during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, or is a former officer of ESSA Bancorp or ESSA Bank & Trust. Each member of the Compensation Committee is independent in accordance with the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market. Our Compensation Committee operates under a written charter, adopted by the Board of Directors, which is available at our website at www.essabank.com. This charter is reviewed and, if applicable, revised annually. The Compensation Committee met four (4) times during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. 
Analysis of Compensation Risk. In setting compensation, the Compensation Committee also considers the risks to ESSA's stockholders that may be inherent in the compensation program and to the achievement of our goals. Based on its review, the Compensation Committee believes our compensation programs represent an appropriate balance of short-term and long-term compensation and do not encourage executive officers or other employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Compensation Committee review also considered our internal controls, policies and risk-mitigating components in our incentive arrangements currently in place.  We considered the following elements, among others, of our executive compensation plans and policies when evaluating whether such plans and policies encourage our executives to take unreasonable risks: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we set performance goals that we believe are reasonable but challenging in light of past performance and market  conditions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we have a balanced portfolio between long-term and short-term compensation, variable and fixed pay, and cash and  equity with a compensation portfolio weighted similar to our peers; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our executive stock ownership guidelines require our executives to hold certain levels of stock which aligns an  appropriate portion of their personal wealth to the long-term performance of the Company.  
[END TABLE]
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which currently consists of Messrs. Henning (Chair), Kutteroff, Selig, Fallon and Ms. Weekes, is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become Board members and recommending a group of nominees for election as directors at each annual meeting of stockholders, ensuring that the Board and its committees have the benefit of qualified and experienced independent directors, and developing a set of corporate governance policies and procedures. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee operates under a written charter, adopted by the Board of Directors, which is available at our website at www.essabank.com, and each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is independent under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market. This charter is reviewed and, if applicable, revised annually. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met one (1) time during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies nominees by evaluating the current members of the Board willing to continue in service. Current members of the Board with skills and experience that are relevant to the Company's business and who are willing to continue in service are first considered for re-nomination, balancing the value of continuity of service by existing members of the Board with that of obtaining a new perspective. If any member of the Board does not wish to continue in service, or if the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or the Board decides not to re-nominate a member for re-election, or if the size of the Board is increased, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would solicit suggestions for director candidates from all Board members and may consider candidates submitted by stockholders. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is authorized by its charter to engage a third party to assist in the identification of director nominees. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would seek to identify a candidate who at a minimum satisfies the following criteria: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• has the highest personal and professional ethics and integrity and whose values are compatible with those of the  Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• has experiences and achievements that have given him/her the ability to exercise and develop good business  judgment;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is willing to devote the necessary time to the work of the Board and its committees, which includes being  available for Board and committee meetings;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is familiar with the communities in which the Company operates and/or is actively engaged in community  activities; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is involved in other activities or interests that do not create a conflict with his/her responsibilities to the  Company and its stockholders; and has the capacity and desire to represent the balanced, best interests of the stockholders of the Company as a group, and not primarily a special interest group or constituency.  
[END TABLE]
 The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will also take into account whether a candidate satisfies the criteria for "independence" in accordance with the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market, and, if a candidate with financial and accounting expertise is sought for service on the Audit Committee, whether the individual qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert." 
The Committee does not have a formal policy or specific guidelines regarding diversity among Board members, and generally views and values diversity from the perspective of professional and life experiences, as well as geographic location, representative of the markets in which we do business. The Committee recognizes that diversity in professional and life experiences may include consideration of gender, race, or national origin, in identifying individuals who possess the qualifications that the Committee believes are important to be represented on the Board. 
Procedures for the Consideration of Board Candidates Submitted by Stockholders 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has adopted procedures for the consideration of Board candidates submitted by stockholders.

Transactions with Certain Related Persons 
Loans and Extensions of Credit. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits us from making loans to our executive officers and directors, but it contains a specific exemption from such prohibition for loans made by ESSA Bank & Trust to our executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking regulations. Federal regulations require that all loans or extensions of credit to executive officers and directors of insured institutions must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. ESSA Bank & Trust is therefore prohibited from making any loans or extensions of credit to executive officers and directors at different rates or terms than those offered to the general public, except for loans made to executive officers under a benefit program maintained by ESSA Bank & Trust that is generally available to all other employees and that does not give preference to any executive officer over any other employee. 
In addition, loans made to a director or executive officer must be approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors. The aggregate amount of our loans to our officers and directors and their related entities was $1.6 million at September 30, 2018. As of September 30, 2018, these loans were performing according to their original terms. 
Set forth below is certain information as to loans made by ESSA Bank & Trust to certain of its directors and executive officers, or their affiliates, pursuant to the loan program disclosed above, whose aggregate indebtedness to ESSA Bank & Trust exceeded $120,000 at any time since October 1, 2017. Unless otherwise indicated all of the loans are secured loans and all loans designated as residential loans are secured by the borrower's principal place of residence.

 COMPENSATION MATTERS 
Compensation Committee 
Our Compensation Committee determines the salaries and other forms of compensation to be paid each year to the President and Chief Executive Officer and those executive officers who report directly to the President and Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee currently consists of Ms. Weekes (Chair) and Messrs. Kutteroff, Hosbach and Durkin. None of these individuals was an officer or employee of ESSA Bancorp or ESSA Bank & Trust during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, or is a former officer of ESSA Bancorp or ESSA Bank & Trust. 
We provide our stockholders with an annual opportunity to provide an advisory vote FOR or AGAINST the compensation of our Named Executive Officers (collectively, the "NEOs" or "Named Executive Officers"). At last year's annual meeting, a majority of our stockholders voted in favor of the compensation of our NEOs with approximately 91% of the votes cast approving the "say on pay" proposal. Although the say on pay vote is advisory and is not binding on our Board, the Compensation Committee is committed to understanding our shareholder views on our compensation program and seriously considers the outcome of the vote when making future executive compensation decisions. We have worked and will continue to work with outside independent advisors to ensure our programs follow best practices and are market competitive. 
Executive Summary 
In 2018, the Company used its strategic planning process to continue its progress in our transition to a high performing, more efficient and diversified community bank. Our strategic plan focused on regionalizing our banking teams, making operational enhancements to support productivity, analyzing facilities and business lines to maximize efficiency and implementing new technologies to support decision making. Building shareholder value through improved earnings remains our primary focus. 
Company Performance. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company reported net income of $6.5 million, or $0.60 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2018 compared to $7.3 million or 0.69 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. Net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 was negatively impacted by an unforeseen one-time charge to income tax expense of $3.7 million as a result of a reduction in the carrying value of the Company's deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate  under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Act").  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's income before income taxes increased $3.3 million, or 36.6% to $12.2 million for the  fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 compared to $8.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company decreased its operating expenses by 3.8% for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 and reduced its  efficiency ratio to 71.11% for fiscal 2018 compared to 77.14% for fiscal 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's return on average assets and return on average equity (which were important drivers for 2018  executive compensation payments), respectively, were 0.36% and 3.61% for the 2018 fiscal period.

The Company's budgeted return on average assets for fiscal 2018, which did not include the unforeseeable one-time tax  charge, was 0.47%.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total net loans outstanding increased $68.4 million, or 5.5% during the fiscal year ended September 30,  2017 to $1.3 billion at September 30, 2018 compared to an increase of $17.5 million, or 1.43%, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. The increase during 2018 included a decrease of $40.4 million in indirect auto  loans outstanding during the same period.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Considering the Company's performance with and without the impact of the  one-time tax charge of $3.7 million reflected in the Company's 2018 financial performance and its effects on ROA and ROE for the year, the Committee determined that the 2018 Executive/Management and  Long-Term Incentive Plan payouts should be made at the threshold levels according to each of the plans.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

Executive Compensation Objectives and Philosophy 
The primary objectives of the Company's executive compensation program are the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Institute pay programs that align executive interests with stockholder value creation  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align compensation with the external market in order to enable the Company to attract, motivate and retain key  executive talent  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Link pay and performance  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Balance risk and reward in order to mitigate unnecessary risk to the Company by avoiding certain compensation  practices that may incentivize risk  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Be appropriate from both an internal (company) and external (market) perspective  
[END TABLE]
To achieve these objectives, the Company has structured the NEO compensation program in the following manner: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Salary levels and merit increases that reflect position responsibilities, competitive market rates,  strategic importance of the position and individual performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual cash incentive (i.e., bonus) payments that are based on the Company's annual financial  performance, as approved by the Compensation Committee, and achievement of certain strategic non-financial performance objectives. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to take into consideration  extraordinary items that affect income gain, expense or loss and other factors it may deem relevant.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term equity-based incentives that reward outstanding performance with incentives that focus  our management team on creating stockholder value over the long term. By increasing the equity holdings of our NEOs, we provide them with a continuing stake in our long-term success. Performance-based targets were set for determining the size of a  portion of the grants of restricted stock made for the fiscal year, coupled with a four-year vesting schedule for such awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Benefit programs that provide all of our employees, including the NEOs, with access to health and  welfare benefits. All of our employees are also eligible to participate in retirement plans sponsored by the Company. Our benefit programs are designed to be competitive with our peers. To support these objectives, our total compensation (sum of  base salary, annual incentive, long-term incentives) and benefits package for our NEOs are generally positioned around median competitive levels for commensurate performance, taking into account the relative responsibilities of our NEOs. Actual  total compensation in any given year may be above or below the target level and market median, based on individual and corporate performance.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Decision Process 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing and overseeing the executive compensation program, annually reviewing and approving the compensation of the CEO and reviewing and approving the CEO's recommendations regarding the compensation of the other NEOs. The Compensation Committee makes reference to market data to determine changes in compensation of the NEOs, and it weighs a variety of different factors in its deliberations. 
The CEO does not play any role in the Compensation Committee's determination of his own pay. When appropriate, the Compensation Committee meets in executive session absent the CEO. The Compensation Committee does, however, solicit input from the CEO concerning the performance and compensation of the other NEOs. The CEO bases his recommendations on his assessment of each individual's performance, external market pay practices, retention risk and the Company's overall pay philosophy. All NEO compensation decisions are ultimately made by the Compensation Committee. 
Role of Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee engaged the services of an independent compensation consultant to assist it in evaluating executive compensation programs and in making determinations regarding executive officer compensation. The independent compensation consultant reports directly to the Compensation Committee and is available to advise the Compensation Committee. In addition to providing executive compensation consulting to the Compensation Committee, the consultant provided limited associated services to the Company. This work was done with the prior knowledge and approval of the Compensation Committee and was not in conflict with the services provided to the Committee. The independent compensation consultant has certified to the Compensation Committee that they are "independent" within the meaning of applicable laws, regulations and stock exchange requirements. 
Assessing Competitive Practice (Peer Groups) 
In order to ensure that the Company is providing a competitive executive compensation program that will attract and retain key executive talent, the Company conducts a market-based compensation analysis annually. The Company conducts this market analysis with the assistance of our independent compensation consultant using two types of market data: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Peer group data: The Compensation Committee used the pay levels and compensation practices of a 21-company peer group to guide decisions regarding pay levels for fiscal year 2018, as determined with the assistance of the independent compensation consultant. This peer group includes companies similar in asset  size, geographic region and within the same industry as the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Survey data: The Compensation Committee also considered third-party compensation data surveys that  focused on banks that were similar to the Company in asset size and geographic region since we believe that our most direct competitors for executive talent are not necessarily limited to the companies included in our peer group. The Compensation  Committee does not materially rely upon data from any individual company participating in any of the surveys in making compensation decisions.  
[END TABLE]
 Elements of the Compensation Package and 2018 Pay Outcomes 
Our total compensation package primarily consists of base salaries, annual incentives and long-term incentives. We also provide modest but competitive benefits available to all employees in addition to limited retirement benefits. 
Base Salaries. Executive officer base salary levels are evaluated by the Compensation Committee on an annual basis. In general, salary ranges are developed considering the results of the independent review of the competitiveness of the total compensation program for the position, as well as overall importance of each position within the organization. The Compensation Committee then takes into consideration the NEO's performance and contribution to the long-term goals of the Company, leadership, operational effectiveness and experience in the industry, overall competitiveness with market levels, as well as recent operating results, performance targets and other relevant factors. 
Fiscal Year 2018 Base Salaries 
The Committee did not increase the base salary for any of the Named Executive Officers except for Mr. Hangen for 2018. As Mr. Hangen's base salary was well below market median levels, the Committee determined that such an increase would help bring this salary closer to competitive rates. Mr. Hangen received an annual base salary increase of $14,850 (7%) which was effective beginning in the Company's fiscal 2018 year. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    2018 Salary      2017 Salary      Percent Change   
 Gary S. Olson    $ 420,000      $ 420,000        —     
 Allan A. Muto    $ 223,600      $ 223,600        —     
 Charles D. Hangen    $ 228,000      $ 213,150        7.0%  
[END TABLE]
Fiscal Year 2019 Base Salaries 
Base salaries for Named Executive Officers were increased for 2019. Mr. Olson received an annual base salary increase of $21,000 (5%) which was effective beginning in the Company's fiscal 2019 year. Mr. Muto received an annual base salary increase of $11,180 (5%) which was effective beginning in the Company's fiscal 2019 year. Mr. Hangen received an annual base salary increase of $9,120 (4%) which was effective beginning in the Company's fiscal 2019 year. 
Annual Incentives. The ESSA Bank & Trust Executive/Management Annual Incentive Plan is a cash bonus plan designed to motivate and reward participants, including the NEOs, for their contribution to the Company and for achieving annual financial goals. The Compensation Committee established bonus targets for each NEO as a percentage of base salary. For 2018, actual bonuses were paid out at 50.0% of target as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Target Bonus%     Actual Bonus as% of Base Salary     Actual Bonus Paid in Cash   
 Gary S. Olson      50%      25.0%    $ 105,000   
 Allan A. Muto      40%      20.0%    $ 44,720   
 Charles D. Hangen      45%      22.5%    $ 51,236   
[END TABLE]
The Company's Executive/Management Annual Incentive Plan is a formulaic annual incentive plan based on the Company's achievement of ROA goals relative to the Raymond James Mid-Atlantic Thrifts peer group of ("RJ Index"). For fiscal year 2018, the Company's ROA of 0.36%, was negatively impacted by an unforeseeable one-time charge to income tax expense of $3.7 million related to the reduction in the carrying value of the Company's deferred tax assets, which resulted from the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act. The Compensation Committee reviewed the Company's performance with and without the impact of the Tax Act and utilized its discretion to grant annual incentives at the plan's threshold level, or at 50% of the target level.  Long-Term Incentive Compensation. To further align the Company's compensation program with Company performance, the Company utilizes performance-based restricted stock awards to NEOs in combination with time-based restricted stock awards. The value of the long-term grants for 2018 was determined based on a number of factors, including the level of the executive's seniority, competitive market practice and the executive's performance leading up to the date of the grant. The 2018 long-term grants were split into two components: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 50% of the award value is granted in the form of time-based restricted stock, 25% of which vested at the  end of fiscal year 2018, with an additional 25% vesting annually on September 30, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. At each vesting date, awards are issued as Company common stock. The primary objective of the time-based restricted stock award  is to reward employee contributions and encourage continued employment (retention) with the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 50% of the award value is granted in the form of performance-based restricted stock subject to achievement of  performance criteria over a one-year performance period and additional vesting for any achieved awards. At each vesting date, awards are settled in cash.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executives can earn between 0% and 150% of the performance-based restricted stock award granted based upon the  Company's ROE performance over a one-year period (achievement will be interpolated between the various performance points described below), as adjusted by the Committee pursuant to the plan:   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The primary objectives of the performance-based restricted stock awards are to (i) reward the executive for  the Company's performance, (ii) align his or her financial interests with the long-term interests of the Company's stockholders, and (iii) encourage the continued retention of the executive. This plan addresses the Company's  intent to incorporate a financial goal that was measurable and controllable by the Company's management while acknowledging that multi-year performance goals are subject to changes in the market beyond the Company's control.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All performance-based awards will be settled in cash.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 65% of the performance target for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 was an ROE of 4.66% (which was  set by the Board at the beginning of the fiscal year), with a threshold performance of 3.37% (80% of the target level) and a maximum performance of 5.83% (125% of the target level). 35% of the performance target for the fiscal year ending  September 30, 2018 was an efficiency ratio of 74%, with a threshold performance of 75.5% and a maximum performance of 72.5%.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For the fiscal year 2018, the Company's actual ROE was negatively impacted by a one-time charge to income tax expense of $3.7 million related to the reduction in the carrying value of the Company's deferred tax assets, which resulted from the reduction in the federal corporate income  tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Taking this into consideration, the Compensation Committee decided to grant long term incentives at the plan's threshold level, or at 50% of the target level.  
[END TABLE]
Executives will forfeit any unvested restricted stock awards if their employment by the Company is terminated for any reason prior to vesting, except in the event of death, disability or involuntary termination following a change in control. 
Other Compensation. While the majority of each NEO's compensation packages are comprised of base salary, annual incentives and long-term incentives as discussed above, the Company does provide very limited benefits, which are discussed following our tabular disclosures on the pages that follow.  Other Compensation Policies and Guidelines 
Stock Ownership Guidelines. To align the interests of the Company's NEOs with the interests of the Company's shareholders, the Company maintains stock ownership guidelines, where NEOs are required to own shares of common stock equal to a specified multiple of their annual base salary. The applicable levels are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO    3x salary 
 CFO    2x salary 
 Other NEOs    1x salary 
[END TABLE]
NEOs have five years from the date of hire to meet these ownership requirements. As of September 30, 2018, all NEOs were in compliance with the Company's stock ownership guidelines. 
Clawback Policy. In accordance with our clawback policy and, as a condition to receiving incentive compensation, NEOs agree to return bonus and other incentive compensation paid by the Company (including cancellation of outstanding equity awards and reimbursement of any gains realized on such awards) if: (i) the payment or award was granted, earned or vested based in whole or in part on the attainment (i.e., a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company's financial statements); (ii) there is an accounting restatement of financial statements due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws (a "Restatement"); and (iii) the amount of the bonus or incentive compensation, as calculated under the restated financial results, is less than the amount actually paid or awarded under the original financial results. Only incentive compensation that is paid during (or with respect to) the three years preceding a Restatement is subject to the foregoing clawback. 
Tax Deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code places a $1.0 million limit on the amount of compensation that we may deduct for tax purposes for any year with respect to certain executive officers. The exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit for performance based compensation has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to our NEOs in excess of $1.0 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. None of our NEOs has compensation in excess of $1.0 million so this currently has no impact.  Summary Compensation Table 
The following table sets forth, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, certain information as to the total compensation paid to the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and the two other most highly compensated executive officers of the Company.

Other Benefit Plans and Agreements 
Employment Agreements. ESSA Bancorp has entered into employment agreements with each of the Named Executive Officers. The agreements have an initial term of three years and renew annually unless notice of non-renewal is provided. All employment agreements have renewed annually. Under the agreements, as of September 30, 2018, the base salaries for Messrs. Olson, Muto and Hangen are $441,000, $234,780 and $237,120, respectively. Base salaries will be reviewed at least annually and may be increased, but not decreased. In addition to the base salary, each agreement provides for, among other things, participation in bonus programs and other employee pension benefit and fringe benefit plans applicable to executive employees and use of an automobile (in the case of Mr. Olson). The executive's employment may be terminated for cause at any time, in which event the executive would have no right to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after termination. 
Each of the executives is entitled to severance payments and benefits in the event of his or her termination of employment under specified circumstances. In the event the executive's employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or the executive voluntarily resigns within 90 days following (1) the failure to elect or reelect or to appoint or reappoint the executive to his or her executive position or a material change in the executive's functions, duties, or responsibilities, which change would cause executive's position to become one of lesser responsibility, importance or scope; (2) the relocation of executive's principal place of employment to a location that is more than 50 miles from the location of ESSA Bank & Trust's principal executive offices (or in the case of Mr. Hangen, 50 miles from his place of principal employment) as of the date of the agreement; (3) a material reduction in benefits and perquisites including base salary (except for any bank-wide or officer-wide reduction); (4) the liquidation or dissolution of ESSA Bancorp or ESSA Bank & Trust; or (5) a breach of the employment agreement by ESSA Bancorp (collectively, a "Good Reason"), the executive would be entitled to a severance payment equal to three times (in the case of Messrs. Olson and Muto) or two times (for Mr. Hangen) the sum of the executive's base salary and the highest rate of bonus awarded to the executive during the prior three years (for Messrs. Olson and Muto) or the highest target bonus opportunity that was or could have been paid to Mr. Hangen with respect to the two completed fiscal years prior to the year in which the termination of employment occurred, payable in a lump sum within 30 days following the termination date, unless a 6-month delay in payment is required in order to comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. In addition, the executive would be entitled, at ESSA Bancorp's sole expense, to the continuation of life, medical, dental and vision coverage for 36 months (in the case of Messrs. Olson and Muto) or 24 months (for Mr. Hangen) after termination of the agreement. The executive would also receive a lump sum payment of the excess, if any, of the present value of the benefits he or she would be entitled to under the ESSA Bancorp or ESSA Bank & Trust's defined benefit pension plan if the executive had continued working for ESSA Bancorp for 36 months (in the case of Messrs. Olson and Muto) or 24 months (for Mr. Hangen) over the present value of the benefits to which the executive is actually entitled as of the date of termination. In the event that the severance payment provisions of the employment agreement were triggered for one of the covered executives at September 30, 2018, the executive would be entitled to a cash severance benefit in the amount of approximately $2.1 million, $1.1 million, and $736,000, in the case of Messrs. Olson, Muto and Hangen, respectively. 
If the executive's employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or the executive voluntarily resigns for Good Reason within 24 months following a change in control, the executive would be entitled to the same severance and benefits described in the above paragraph, except Mr. Hangen's severance multiplier described above increases from two to three; however, such payments may be reduced due to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. The employment agreements for the Named Executive Officers provide for a reduction in the amount of any payments made in connection with a change in control which would otherwise constitute "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. The total payment owed to the executive upon a change in control will be reduced to an amount that is $1.00 less than the amount that would otherwise be an "excess parachute payment" under Code Section 280G. 
Upon termination of the executive's employment other than in connection with a change in control, the executive agrees not to compete with ESSA Bancorp for one year following termination of employment within 50 miles of any existing branch of ESSA Bank & Trust or 50 miles of any office for which ESSA Bank & Trust or a subsidiary has filed an application for regulatory approval. 
In the event the executive becomes disabled, ESSA Bancorp would continue to pay the executive his or her base salary for the longer of the remaining term of the agreement or one year, provided that any amount paid to the   executive pursuant to any disability insurance would reduce the compensation the executive would receive and will provide life insurance, medical, dental and vision coverage until the earlier of executive's return to employment, age 65 or death. In the event that the disability benefit provisions of the employment agreement were triggered for one of the covered executives at September 30, 2018, the executive would be entitled to cash disability benefits in an amount up to approximately $1.3 million, $671,000 and $456,000 in the case of Messrs. Olson, Muto and Hangen, respectively. In the event the executive dies while employed by ESSA Bancorp, the executive's estate will be paid the executive's base salary for one year and the executive's family will be entitled to continuation of medical, dental and vision benefits for one year after the executive's death. In the event that the death benefit provisions of the employment agreement were triggered for one of the covered executives at September 30, 2018, Messrs. Olson, Muto and Hangen's beneficiaries would be entitled to a cash payment in the amount of approximately $443,000, $243,000, and $251,000, respectively. 
Stock Award and Stock Option Program. Stockholders approved the ESSA Bancorp, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2016 Equity Plan") on March 3, 2016. Under this plan, individuals may receive awards of Company common stock and grants of options to purchase Company common stock. The Compensation Committee believes that stock ownership provides a significant incentive in building stockholder value by further aligning the interests of our officers and employees with stockholders since such compensation is directly linked to the performance of the Company's common stock. In addition, stock options and restricted stock awards granted to our Named Executive Officers generally vest over a four-year period, with accelerated vesting in the event of death, disability, involuntary termination of employment (other than for cause) of service following a change in control, thereby aiding retention. 
Assuming that accelerated vesting occurred as of September 30, 2018 due to death, disability or an involuntary termination of employment (other than for cause) following a change in control, based on the closing price per share of Company common stock on that date, the value of a reasonable estimate of the awards made to the Named Executive Officers for the fiscal year which ended on September 30, 2018 would be as follows: Mr. Olson would receive $185,205 in value for accelerated restricted stock; Mr. Muto would receive $92,983 in value for accelerated restricted stock and Mr. Hangen would receive $105,389 in value for accelerated restricted stock. 
401(k) Plan. ESSA Bank & Trust maintains a non-standardized prototype 401(k) plan through Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. Employees may participate in the plan when they have attained age 21 and completed one year of service and have been credited with 1,000 hours during the year of service. Participants may make pre-tax salary deferrals to the plan not to exceed $19,000 (which is the 2019 limit; the limit is adjusted annually for IRS-announcedcost-of-living increases), provided, however, that a participant over age 50 may contribute an additional $6,000 to the 401(k) plan. In addition to salary deferrals, the 401(k) plan provides that ESSA Bank & Trust will make an employer matching contribution equal to 100% of a participant's salary deferral contribution, provided that such amount does not exceed 3% of a participant's compensation, plus 50% of a participant's salary deferral contribution that exceeds 3% but does not exceed 5% of a participant's compensation earned during the plan year (for a total maximum employer matching contribution of 4% of a participant's compensation). All contributions are 100% vested. Distributions will be made upon death, disability, termination of employment, or attainment of age 59-1/2. In addition to the other self-directed investment alternatives offered under the plan, participants are offered the opportunity to purchase stock in the Company through a unitized employer stock fund, consisting of approximately 95% stock and 5% cash. Benefits are paid in the form of lump sum. 
Employee Stock Ownership Plan. ESSA Bank & Trust sponsors the ESSA Bank & Trust Employee Stock Ownership Plan for the benefit of its employees. Employees who are at least 21 years old with at least one year of service during which the employee has completed at least 1,000 hours of service with ESSA Bank & Trust are eligible to participate. As part of ESSA Bank & Trust's 2007 stock offering, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan trust borrowed funds from the Company and used those funds to purchase a number of shares equal to 8% of the common stock sold in the offering (1,358,472 shares). Collateral for the loan is the common stock purchased by the Employee Stock Ownership Plan. The loan will be repaid principally from ESSA Bank & Trust's discretionary contributions to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan over a period of up to 30 years. The loan documents provide that the loan may be repaid over a shorter period, without penalty for prepayments. Shares purchased by the Employee Stock Ownership Plan will be held in a suspense account for allocation among participants as the loan is repaid.  Contributions to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan and shares released from the suspense account in an amount proportional to the repayment of the Employee Stock Ownership Plan loan will be allocated among Employee Stock Ownership Plan participants on the basis of compensation in the year of allocation. Participants will be 100% vested in benefits under the plan upon completion of three years of credited service, with credit given to participants for years of credited service with ESSA Bank & Trust's mutual predecessor. A participant's interest in his or her account under the plan will also fully vest in the event of termination of service due to a participant's early or normal retirement, death, disability, or upon a change in control (as defined in the plan). Vested benefits will be payable in the form of common stock and/or cash. ESSA Bank & Trust's contributions to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan are discretionary, subject to the loan terms and tax law limits. Therefore, benefits payable under the Employee Stock Ownership Plan cannot be estimated. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to record compensation expense each year in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares released or committed to be released from the suspense account. 
Defined Benefit Pension Plan. ESSA Bank & Trust maintains an individually designed, tax-qualified defined benefit plan (the "Pension Plan"). ESSA Bank & Trust annually contributes an amount to the plan necessary to at least satisfy the minimum funding requirements established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). Effective February 28, 2017, ESSA Bank & Trust "froze" all future enrollments and benefit accruals under the Pension Plan. 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. ESSA Bank & Trust maintains the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("Supplemental Retirement Plan") for Mr. Olson. 
The Supplemental Retirement Plan is designed to provide Mr. Olson with a normal retirement benefit, which is an annual benefit equal to 70% of his highest average compensation (determined over a consecutive 5-year period within the last 10 years of employment) reduced by the sum of fifty-percent of annual social security benefits, annualized benefits payable under ESSA Bank & Trust's tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan, and the annualized employer contributions to ESSA Bank & Trust's 401(k) Plan and ESOP. 
If Mr. Olson has been employed with ESSA Bank & Trust for at least 30 years upon normal retirement age (65) or early retirement age (60), then the benefit described in the Supplemental Retirement Plan will be paid to Mr. Olson for no less than 16 years following his retirement, unless Mr. Olson elects to receive the present value of the payments as a lump sum. Mr. Olson has elected a lump sum payment. The normal retirement benefit is reduced by 0.05% for each month Mr. Olson terminates employment after early retirement age but prior to normal retirement age. If Mr. Olson terminates employment within two years following a change-in-control, he will be entitled to the normal retirement benefit as if he had been employed to age 65, and the benefit will be paid in a lump sum. Benefits become vested after 5 years of service. Mr. Olson is fully vested in the benefit. If Mr. Olson dies or becomes disabled while actively employed by us, the amount accrued under the plan as of the date of his termination of employment will be paid to Mr. Olson (or beneficiary in the event of death) in a lump sum. Lump sum payments are determined by assuming payments would otherwise be made for 16 years and using a discount rate that is discussed in Note 12 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.. 
If Mr. Olson's employment terminated due to death, disability or change in control, respectively, on September 30, 2018, Mr. Olson would be entitled to $2.0 million, $2.0 million and $2.3 million, respectively. 
We recorded an expense of $477,000 for the Supplemental Retirement Plan during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. 
Split Dollar Life Insurance Agreements. The Company has entered into split dollar life insurance agreements with Messrs. Olson and Muto. Under the agreements, if the executive dies while employed by the Company, the executive's beneficiary will receive four times the executive's base salary (five times for Mr. Olson) in a lump sum. The Company has purchased bank-owned life insurance policies to fund these obligations. The Summary Compensation Table includes the value of these benefits.  Director Compensation 
Each of the individuals who serves as a director of ESSA Bancorp also serves as a director of ESSA Bank & Trust and each non-employee director earns director and committee fees in that capacity. Each non-employee director (except for the Chairman of the Board) is paid a fee of $2,000 per month for their service and $1,000 for each Board meeting attended. In addition, the Chairperson of a committee is paid $750 for each committee meeting attended and an annual retainer of $4,000 in the case of the Audit Committee Chairperson and $2,000 each in the case of the Chairpersons of the Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Committee members are paid $500 for each committee meeting attended. In lieu of the above mentioned fees, the Chairman of the Board is paid an annual retainer of $6,000 and $1,500 for each Board meeting attended. The Chairman of the Board is not compensated for attendance at any committee meetings. 
ESSA periodically reviews its non-employee director compensation programs relative to market practices. In fiscal year 2018, ESSA conducted this market analysis with the assistance of Mosteller & Associates using pay levels and compensation practices of the same peer group used to benchmark pay for ESSA's executive officers. Based on the review, Mosteller & Associates found that ESSA's non-employee director board retainers and fees were aligned with the peer group, although there was an overall director compensation gap due to the absence of an equity compensation component. Based on a review of the peer group, the Compensation Committee granted each independent director a stock award of 1,000 shares of Company common stock in order to make overall director compensation more aligned with the peer group. 
ESSA also has stock ownership guidelines for all non-employee directors. Under these ownership guidelines, directors are required to own shares of common stock equal to one and a half times the annual retainer paid to the directors. The annual retainer paid to non-employee directors (except for the Chairman of the Board) as of September 30, 2018 is $24,000. New directors have five years to meet this requirement. As of September 30, 2018, all non-employee directors who have served as directors of the Company for five years or more have met this requirement. 
The following table sets forth the total fees received by the non-management directors during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018:

[END TABLE]
Split Dollar Life Insurance Agreements. The Company entered into split dollar life insurance agreements with all of its directors except Messrs. Fallon, Hosbach, Durkin and Ms. Gordon. Under the agreements, when the director dies, the director's beneficiary will receive $100,000 in a lump sum. The Company has purchased bank-owned life insurance policies to fund these obligations. The Company also pays each director (other than Messrs. Fallon, Hosbach, Durkin and Ms. Gordon) an annual cash bonus equal to the value of the taxes the director must pay on the imputed value of the life insurance coverage.  PROPOSAL II – RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 
The Company's independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 were S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. ("Snodgrass"). The Audit Committee of the Board has approved the engagement of Snodgrass to be the Company's independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, subject to the ratification of the appointment by the Company's stockholders at the Annual Meeting. 
Stockholder ratification of the selection of Snodgrass is not required by the Company's Bylaws or otherwise. However, the Board will submit the selection of the independent registered public accountants to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection of Snodgrass, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may, at its discretion, direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such change is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
Fees Paid to Snodgrass 
Set forth below is certain information concerning aggregate fees for professional services rendered by Snodgrass during fiscal years 2018 and 2017. 
Audit Fees. The aggregate fees billed to the Company by Snodgrass for professional services rendered for the audit of the Company's annual consolidated financial statements, review of the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K and services that are normally provided by Snodgrass in connection with statutory and regulatory filings and engagements were $233,767 and $230,216 during fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Audit Related Fees. The aggregate fees billed to the Company by Snodgrass for assurance and related services rendered that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit of and review of the consolidated financial statements and that are not already reported in "Audit Fees" above, were $28,500 and $27,750 during fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. These services were primarily related to the audits of the Company's employee benefit plans. 
Tax Fees. The aggregate fees billed to the Company by Snodgrass for professional services rendered for tax compliance were $32,469 and $28,986 during fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Other Fees. The aggregate fees billed to the Company by Snodgrass for professional services rendered for facilitation of strategic planning were $25,760 and $0 during fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accountants 
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accountants. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. Pre-approval is provided for up to one year, and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is subject to a specific budget. The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to its Chair when necessary, with subsequent reporting to the Audit Committee. The independent registered public accountants and management are required to report to the Audit Committee quarterly regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accountants in accordance with this pre-approval policy, and the fees for the services performed to date.  Required Vote and Recommendation of the Board 
In order to ratify the appointment of Snodgrass as independent registered public accountants for fiscal 2019, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, either in person or by proxy. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF SNODGRASS AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS.  PROPOSAL III – ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The compensation of our Principal Executive Officer and our two other most highly compensated executive officers of ESSA Bancorp ("Named Executive Officers") is described in "PROPOSAL I—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS—Executive Compensation." Stockholders are urged to read the Executive Compensation section of this Proxy Statement, which discusses our compensation policies and procedures with respect to our Named Executive Officers. 
Based on the information and rationale contained in this Proxy Statement, included among other things our performance-drive compensation program, our risk-management, and our adherence to best governance practices, we believe stockholders should vote in favor of the compensation program. 
Stockholders will be asked at the Annual Meeting to provide their support with respect to the compensation of our Named Executive Officers by voting on the following advisory, non-binding resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of ESSA Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers described in the Executive Compensation section of the Proxy Statement. 
This advisory vote, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" advisory vote, is non-binding on the Board of Directors. Although non-binding, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee value constructive dialogue on executive compensation and other important governance topics with our stockholders and encourages all stockholders to vote their shares on this matter. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation programs. 
Unless otherwise instructed, validly executed proxies will be voted "FOR" this resolution. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE RESOLUTION SET FORTH IN PROPOSAL III.  STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING 
In order to be eligible for inclusion in the proxy materials for next year's Annual Meeting of Stockholders, any stockholder proposal to take action at such meeting must be received at the Company's Executive Office, 200 Palmer Street, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania 18360, no later than September 27, 2019. Any such proposals shall be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules adopted under the Exchange Act. 
Advance Notice of Business to be Conducted at an Annual Meeting 
Under our Bylaws, a stockholder must follow certain procedures to nominate persons for election as directors or to introduce an item of business at a meeting of stockholders. These procedures provide, generally, that stockholders desiring to make nominations for directors, or to bring a proper subject of business before the meeting, must do so by a written notice timely received generally not later than September 27, 2019. 
Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to require us to include in our proxy statement and proxy relating to an annual meeting any stockholder proposal that does not meet all of the requirements for inclusion established by the Securities and Exchange Commission in effect at the time such proposal is received. 
OTHER MATTERS 
The Board is not aware of any business to come before the Annual Meeting other than the matters described above in this proxy statement. However, if any matters should properly come before the Annual Meeting, it is intended that holders of the proxies will act in accordance with their best judgment. 
The Audit Committee Report included in this proxy statement shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates this information by reference. The Audit Report shall not otherwise be deemed "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the Securities and Exchange Commission under such Acts. 
An additional copy of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018, will be furnished without charge upon written or telephonic request to Stephanie Lefferson, Corporate Secretary, 200 Palmer Street, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, 18360 or call (570) 421-0531.
