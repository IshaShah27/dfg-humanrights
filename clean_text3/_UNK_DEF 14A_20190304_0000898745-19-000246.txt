VOTING INFORMATION
Voting procedures. We are furnishing this Proxy Statement to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Board to be used at the Meeting. Please vote your shares by mailing the enclosed card(s) in the enclosed postage-paid envelope or by following the instructions on the card(s) for voting by telephone or via the Internet. Shareholders who wish to attend the Meeting in person may call 1-800-222-5852 if they have any questions. If you complete and return the enclosed proxy card(s) (or if you give your proxy by telephone or via the Internet), the persons named on the card as proxies will vote your shares as you indicate on the proxy card(s) (or as you instruct by telephone or via the Internet) or for approval of each proposal for which there is no indication. You may change your vote and revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Meeting in any of the following ways: 
(i) by sending a written notice of revocation to the Meeting Secretary of Principal Funds, Inc. in care of Principal Financial Group, 711 High Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50392; 
(ii) by submitting another properly signed proxy card at a later date to the Meeting Secretary of Principal Funds, Inc. in care of Principal Financial Group, 711 High Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50392; 
(iii) by submitting another proxy by telephone or via the Internet at a later date; or 
(iv) being present and voting in person at the Meeting after giving oral notice of the revocation to the Chair of the Meeting.
Voting rights. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on February 21, 2019 (the "Record Date") are entitled to vote. The shareholders of all Funds and all share classes will vote together on Proposal 1 regarding the election of Directors. The shareholders of each Fund subject to the proposal will vote together and not by class of shares for Proposals 2 - 6. You are entitled to one vote on each proposal submitted to the shareholders of a Fund for each share of that Fund you hold, and fractional votes for fractional shares held. 
The affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares voted at the Meeting is required for the election of a Director under Proposal 1. This means that those nominees for Director receiving the highest number of votes cast at the Meeting will be elected. The nominees are running unopposed, so each nominee is expected to be elected as a Director because all nominees who receive votes in favor will be elected. Proposals 2 - 6 require for approval the vote of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities," which is defined in the 1940 Act to mean, with respect to a Fund, the affirmative vote of the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the voting securities of the Fund present in person or by proxy at the meeting of that Fund, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund are present in person or by proxy, or (2) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund (such lesser amount being a "Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities"). Under this definition, a proposal could be approved by as little as approximately one-third of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund to which that proposal applies. 
The number of votes eligible to be cast at the Meeting with respect to each Fund as of the Record Date and other share ownership information are set forth in Appendix A to this Proxy Statement.
Quorum requirements; abstentions and broker non-votes. A quorum must be present at the Meeting for the transaction of business by any Fund. For Proposal 1, the presence in person or by proxy of one-third of the shares of PFI outstanding at the close of business on the Record Date constitutes a quorum. For Proposals 2 - 6, the presence in person or by proxy of one-third of the shares of each applicable Fund outstanding at the close of business on the Record Date constitutes a quorum for a meeting of that Fund. 
Abstentions, if any, will be considered present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum but will be disregarded in determining the votes cast on a proposal. As a result, with respect to (i) Proposal 1 requiring the affirmative vote of a plurality of shares cast at the Meeting, abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of such proposal, and (ii) Proposals 2 - 6 requiring the affirmative vote of a Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities, as defined above, abstentions will have the effect of a vote against such proposals.
Broker non-votes, if any, will also be considered present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum but will be disregarded in determining the votes cast on a proposal. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker or nominee indicates it has not received voting instructions from a shareholder and is barred from voting the shares without such shareholder instructions because the proposal is considered non-routine under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Proposals 2 - 6 may be considered non-routine, so your broker or nominee likely will not be permitted to vote your shares if it has not received instructions from you, resulting in broker non-votes. A broker non-vote on Proposals 2 - 6 will have the same effect as a vote against such proposal.  Proposal 1 is considered routine under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, so if you do not give your broker or nominee voting instructions on this proposal, your broker or nominee may vote your shares in its discretion,  resulting in no broker non-votes. However, if your broker or nominee does not exercise such discretion and a broker non-vote results, such broker non-vote will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 1.
If the necessary quorum to transact business or the vote required to approve a proposal is not obtained at the Meeting, the persons named as proxies or any shareholder present at the Meeting may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting as to one or more proposals in accordance with applicable law to permit further solicitation of proxies. Any such adjournment as to a proposal or any other matter with respect to a Fund will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Fund present in person or by proxy at the Meeting. The persons named as proxies and any shareholder present at the Meeting will vote for or against any adjournment in their discretion.
Solicitation procedures. We intend to solicit proxies by mail. Officers or employees of PFI, PGI, or their affiliates may make additional solicitations by telephone, Internet, or personal contact. They will not be specially compensated for these services. Brokerage houses, banks, and other fiduciaries may be requested to forward soliciting materials to their customers and to obtain authorization for the execution of proxies. For those services, PFI will reimburse them for their out-of-pocket expenses. PFI has retained the services of a professional proxy soliciting firm, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., to assist in soliciting proxies and provide other services in connection therewith and estimates that the aggregate cost of such services will be approximately $8,000,000. 
Expenses of the Meeting. The Funds will pay the expenses of the Meeting, including those associated with the preparation and distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of proxies. The expenses will be allocated to the Fund(s) generating the expense, based on the number of shareholder accounts.  
PROPOSAL 1
ELECTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
(All Funds)
At its January 31, 2019 meeting, the Board named the twelve persons listed below as nominees for election as Directors. Eleven of the nominees currently serve as Directors. The other nominee, Timothy M. Dunbar, will become a Director immediately if he is elected as a Director at the Meeting. If elected, Mr. Dunbar will fill the vacancy on the Board created by the departure of Nora Everett, who on November 28, 2018 announced her intention to retire as Chair and member of the Board, effective March 12, 2019.
Each nominee has agreed to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected. The Board has no reason to believe that any of the nominees will become unavailable for election as a Director. However, if that should occur before the Meeting, your proxy will be voted for the individual(s) recommended by the Board to fill each resulting vacancy.
The following table presents certain information regarding PFI's Directors and the new nominee, including their principal occupations and other directorships. Ms. Everett is not standing for re-election at the Meeting because she is retiring from the Board prior to the date of the Meeting. Information is listed separately for those Directors and nominees who are "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of PFI (the "Interested Directors") and those Directors and nominees who are not interested persons of PFI (the "Independent Directors"). Three of the nominees for Independent Director, Ms. McMillan, Ms. Nickels, and Ms. VanDeWeghe, have not previously been elected Directors by PFI's shareholders. The Board's Nominating and Governance Committee, composed of two of PFI's Independent Directors, selected and nominated Ms. McMillan, Ms. Nickels, and Ms. VanDeWeghe as candidates for Director upon the recommendations of one or more of the Directors. Two of the nominees for Interested Director, Mr. Dunbar and Mr. Halter, have not previously been elected Directors by PFI's shareholders, and both were selected and nominated as candidates for Director upon the recommendations of affiliated persons of PGI, PFI's investment advisor. 
All individuals who are current Directors also serve as directors of PVC, another mutual fund sponsored by Principal Life, and as trustees of PETF, an exchange-traded fund sponsored by Principal Life. All individuals who are nominees as Directors are also currently standing as nominees for election as directors or trustees, as applicable, of PVC and PETF and, if elected by those respective shareholders, will serve as directors or trustees, as applicable, of PVC and PETF. If the same individuals are not elected by the shareholders of each of PFI, PVC, and PETF, the compositions of those boards will differ. PFI, PVC, and PETF (collectively, the "Fund Complex") currently offer shares of a combined total of 131 funds.
Each Director will serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until a successor is elected and qualified.

(1) Effective March 12, 2019, Ms. Everett will retire as Chair and member of the Board. Leadership Structure of the Board of Directors
Overall responsibility for directing PFI's business and affairs rests with the Board of Directors, who are elected by PFI's shareholders. In addition to serving on the PFI Board, each Director serves on the PVC Board and the PETF Board. The Board is responsible for overseeing PFI's operations in accordance with the 1940 Act, other applicable laws, and PFI's charter. The Board elects the officers of PFI to supervise its day-to-day operations. The Board meets in regularly scheduled meetings eight times throughout the year. Board meetings may occur in-person or by telephone. In addition, the Board holds special meetings or informal calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regularly scheduled meetings. Board members who are Independent Directors meet annually to consider renewal of PFI's advisory contracts. Each Director and Director nominee has significant prior senior management and/or board experience. 
As of the Record Date, the Board is composed of twelve members, nine of whom are Independent Directors.  As stated above, on November 28, 2018, Ms. Everett announced her intention to retire as Chair and member of the Board, effective March 12, 2019. Mr. Dunbar will fill the Board vacancy created by Ms. Everett's retirement, effective immediately, if he is elected a Director at the Meeting. Following Ms. Everett's retirement and if Mr. Dunbar is elected, the Board will continue to be composed of twelve members, nine of whom are Independent Directors.
     Currently, the Chair of the Board, Nora Everett, is an interested person of PFI.  The Independent Directors of PFI have appointed a lead Independent Director whose role is to review and approve, with the Chair, the agenda for each Board meeting and facilitate communication among PFI's Independent Directors as well as communication among the Independent Directors, PFI management and the full Board.  PFI has determined that the Board's leadership structure is appropriate given the characteristics and circumstances of PFI, including such items as the number of series that comprise PFI, the variety of asset classes those series reflect, the net assets of PFI, the committee structure of the Board and the distribution arrangements of PFI.  The appropriateness of this structure is enhanced by PFI's Board committees, which are described below, and the allocation of responsibilities among them.  Following Ms. Everett's retirement on March 12, 2019, the Board will elect a new Chair based upon its assessment of an appropriate leadership structure for the Board.
The Directors were selected to serve, and continue to serve, on the Board based upon their skills, experience, judgment, analytical ability, diligence and ability to work effectively with other Board members, a commitment to the interests of shareholders, and, for each Independent Director, a demonstrated willingness to take an independent and questioning view of management. In addition to these general qualifications, the Board seeks members who will build upon the diversity of the Board. The following is a brief discussion of the specific education, experience, qualifications, or skills that led to the conclusion that each person identified below should serve as a Director. As required by rules the SEC has adopted under the 1940 Act, PFI's Independent Directors select and nominate all candidates for Independent Director positions.

Board Committees
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee's primary purpose is to assist the Board in fulfilling certain of its responsibilities. The Audit Committee serves as an independent and objective party to monitor PFI's accounting policies, financial reporting, and internal control system, as well as the work of the independent registered public accountants. The Audit Committee assists Board oversight of (1) the integrity of PFI's financial statements; (2) PFI's compliance with certain legal and regulatory requirements; (3) the independent registered public accountants' qualifications and independence; and (4) the performance of PFI's independent registered public accountants. The Audit Committee also provides an open avenue of communication among PFI's independent registered public accountants, PGI's internal auditors, PFI management, and the Board. The Audit Committee is composed of Mr. Barnes, Mr. Damos, and Ms. Nickels.
A copy of the Audit Committee Charter of the Board is included as Appendix B to this Proxy Statement.
Executive Committee
The Executive Committee's primary purpose is to exercise certain powers of the Board when the Board is not in session. When the Board is not in session, the Executive Committee may exercise all powers of the Board in the management of the business of PFI except the power to (1) issue stock, except as permitted by law; (2) recommend to the shareholders any action that requires shareholder approval; (3) amend PFI's charter or bylaws; or (4) approve any merger or share exchange that does not require shareholder approval. As of the Record Date, the Executive Committee is composed of Mr. Grimmett, Mr. Beer, and Ms. Everett. Following Ms. Everett's retirement on March 12, 2019, the Board will appoint a third Director to serve on this committee.
Nominating and Governance Committee
The Nominating and Governance Committee's primary purpose is to oversee the structure and efficiency of the Board and the committees established by the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee responsibilities include evaluating Board membership and functions, committee membership and functions, insurance coverage, and legal matters.
The nominating functions of the Nominating and Governance Committee include selecting and nominating all candidates who are not "interested persons" of PFI for election to the Board. Generally, the Nominating and Governance Committee requests director nominee suggestions from the Board and management. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by PFI shareholders.
Director recommendations should be submitted in writing to Principal Funds, Inc. at 711 High Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50392. When evaluating a person as a potential nominee to serve as an Independent Director, the Nominating and Governance Committee will generally consider, among other factors: age; education; relevant business experience; geographical factors; whether the person is "independent" and otherwise qualified under applicable laws and regulations to serve as a director; and whether the person is willing to serve, and willing and able to commit the time necessary for attendance at meetings and the performance of the duties of an independent director. The Nominating and Governance Committee also meets personally with the nominees and conducts a reference check. The final decision regarding a nominee is based on a combination of factors, including the strengths and the experience a specific individual may bring to the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee believes the Board generally benefits from diversity of background, experience, and views among its members, and considers these factors in evaluating the composition of the Board. The Board does not use regularly  the services of any professional search firms to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential candidates or nominees. The Nominating and Governance Committee is composed of Ms. Ballantine and Mr. Grimmett.
A copy of the Nominating and Governance Committee Charter of the Board is included as Appendix C to this Proxy Statement. 
Operations Committee
The Operations Committee's primary purpose is to oversee the provision of administrative and distribution services to PFI, communications with PFI's shareholders, and review and oversight of PFI's operations. The Operations Committee is composed of Mr. Hirsch, Mr. Huang, Ms. McMillan, and Ms. VanDeWeghe.
15(c) Committee
     The 15(c) Committee's primary purpose is to assist the Board in performing the annual review of PFI's advisory and sub-advisory agreements pursuant to Section 15(c) of the 1940 Act. The 15(c) Committee's responsibilities include requesting and reviewing materials. The 15(c) Committee is composed of Mr. Damos, Mr. Grimmett, Mr. Hirsch, and Mr. Huang.

Compensation
PFI does not pay any remuneration to its Directors or officers who are employed by PGI or its affiliates. The Board annually considers a proposal to reimburse PGI for a portion of the Chief Compliance Officer's compensation. If the proposal is adopted, these amounts are allocated across all Funds based on relative net assets of each portfolio. Each Director who is not an "interested person" received compensation for service as a member of the Boards of PFI, PVC, and PETF based on a schedule that takes into account an annual retainer amount and the number of meetings attended. Responsibility for these fees and expenses are divided among the portfolios of PFI, PVC, and PETF based on their relative net assets.
      The following table provides information regarding the compensation received by the Independent Directors from PFI during the 2018 fiscal year. Information is provided separately for the Funds having fiscal years ended August 31, 2018 and October 31, 2018.

PROPOSAL 2
APPROVAL OF A NEW SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
WITH PRINCIPAL REAL ESTATE INVESTORS, LLC FOR THE DIVERSIFIED REAL ASSET FUND
(Diversified Real Asset Fund Only)
     At its meeting on December 11, 2018, the Board, including all the Independent Directors, approved a new sub-advisory agreement between PGI and Principal Real Estate Investors, LLC ("Principal-REI"), appointing Principal-REI as a sub-advisor to the Diversified Real Asset Fund ("DRA") for a new commercial mortgage-backed security ("CMBS") single asset, single borrower ("SASB") portion of its portfolio. If DRA's shareholders approve the new sub-advisory agreement with Principal-REI under this Proposal 2, the new agreement is expected to become effective in May 2019.
     DRA pursues multiple investment strategies or "sleeves," which are executed by multiple sub-advisors. PGI is responsible for, among other things, administering DRA's business and affairs and selecting, contracting with, compensating, and monitoring the sub-advisors that manage portions of DRA's assets. In managing DRA, PGI determines the allocation of DRA's assets among the different sleeves and sub-advisors. DRA's current sub-advisors are: BlackRock Financial Management, Inc. ("BlackRock") and sub-sub-advisor, BlackRock International Limited ("BIL"); BNP PARIBAS ASSET MANAGEMENT USA, Inc. ("BNP"); Mellon Investments Corporation ("Mellon"); Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC ("Credit Suisse"); Delaware Investments Fund Advisers ("Delaware Investments"); Pictet Asset Management SA ("Pictet"); Principal-REI; RARE Infrastructure (North America) Pty Limited ("RARE"); Symphony Asset Management LLC ("Symphony"); and Tortoise Capital Advisors, L.L.C. ("Tortoise"). Principal-REI is an affiliate of PGI.
     The sub-advisory agreements with BlackRock and BIL (both dated April 17, 2017), BNP (dated May 22, 2017), Credit Suisse (dated May 22, 2017), Delaware Investments (dated December 15, 2017), Mellon (dated October 1, 2017), Pictet (dated October 1, 2017), RARE (dated April 3, 2018), Principal-REI (dated January 1, 2019), Symphony (dated May 22, 2017), and Tortoise (dated January 31, 2018) were most recently approved for renewal by the Board (including a majority of the Independent Directors) on September 11, 2018, in connection with the Board's annual review and continuance of such agreements. The amended sub-advisory agreement with Principal-REI for the global real estate investment sleeve of DRA that it currently manages was approved by the Board (including a majority of the Independent Directors) on December 11, 2018 to reduce the sub-advisor fee rate effective as of January 1, 2019. The sub-advisory agreement with Principal-REI, which is an affiliate of PGI, was most recently approved by DRA's shareholders on March 16, 2010.
     PGI seeks to implement a CMBS SASB strategy managed by Principal-REI to complement DRA's existing real return segment. SASB is a subset of the broader CMBS market that represents single property (single asset) or a portfolio of properties owned by the same sponsor (single borrower). The CMBS SASB sleeve would be a new asset class within the real return segment of DRA, which currently consists of Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), floating rate bank loans, and currency. PGI selected Principal-REI to manage the CMBS SASB sleeve due to Principal-REI's deep expertise in the broad CMBS category. 
     Approval of the new sub-advisory agreement with Principal-REI will not result in an increase in the management fees that DRA pays to PGI as investment advisor nor will it result in a decrease in the level or quality of the sub-advisory services provided to DRA.
     Pursuant to exemptive orders issued by the SEC, PGI is not required to obtain shareholder approval of new sub-advisory agreements, or material amendments to sub-advisory agreements, with (i) unaffiliated sub-advisors or (ii) wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisors (i.e., affiliated sub-advisors that are at least 95% owned, directly or indirectly, by PGI or an affiliated person of PGI), provided shareholders of the relevant fund have approved the fund's use of the exemptive order. Principal-REI is a wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisor. However, because DRA shareholders have not approved DRA's reliance on such order, shareholders are being asked to approve the new sub-advisory agreement with Principal-REI. THE NEW AGREEMENT
     Except with respect to compensation as described below and its term, the provisions of the new sub-advisory agreement with Principal-REI related to the CMBS SASB sleeve are the same in all material respects as those of DRA's current sub-advisory and sub-sub-advisory agreements. The following is a brief summary of the material terms of the agreements. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of the new sub-advisory agreement attached as Appendix D to this Proxy Statement.
     Under the proposed sub-advisory agreement, as with the current sub-advisory agreements with the current sub-advisors, Principal-REI will, among other things:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) provide investment advisory services to DRA , including providing investment advice and recommendations with respect to DRA's investments consistent with DRA's investment objective, investment policies and restrictions; 
(2) arrange for the purchase and sale of DRA's portfolio securities; 
(3) provide, at its expense, all necessary investment and management facilities, including expenses for clerical and bookkeeping services; 
(4) advise and assist PFI's officers in taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the decisions of the Board regarding the general conduct of the investment business of DRA ; and  
(5) provide periodic reports regarding the investment services provided to DRA.  
[END TABLE]
     Compensation. Sub-advisory fees are paid by PGI out of the management fee DRA pays to PGI and are not an additional charge to DRA. Under the proposed and current sub-advisory agreements, PGI pays each sub-advisor a fee. 
     The appointment of Principal-REI is expected to benefit PGI by increasing, with respect to the assets of the Fund's CMBS SASB sleeve, the amount of the management fees that are retained by PGI and its affiliates rather than being paid to unaffiliated sub-advisors. In addition, this arrangement may be viewed as presenting a conflict of interest because PGI will have a financial incentive to allocate assets to Principal-REI rather than to unaffiliated sub-advisors of DRA. In recommending for approval the new sub-advisory agreement with Principal-REI, the Board, including the Independent Directors, considered such potential conflicts of interest and further considered  that PGI has a fiduciary duty to act in DRA's best interests.
PRINCIPAL-REI
 Principal-REI is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of PFG. Principal-REI manages commercial real estate across the spectrum of public and private equity and debt instruments, primarily for institutional investors. Principal-REI's headquarters are located at 711 High Street, Des Moines, Iowa  50392. 
     Management of Principal-REI. Set forth below are the names and principal occupations of the principal executive officer and directors of Principal-REI. The address of each such person is 711 High Street, Des Moines IA 50392.

     Similar Investment Companies Advised by Principal-REI. Principal-REI has advised PFI that it does not act as an investment advisor or sub-advisor of any registered investment company having the same investment objective and policies as those of the CMBS SASB sleeve that it will be managing for DRA. 
     Payments to Affiliates. Principal-REI is an affiliate of PGI and the Distributor. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, DRA paid PGI management fees of approximately $33,383,000 and the Distributor Rule 12b-1 distribution fees of approximately $498,000. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018, a total of $271,989 in brokerage commissions paid by DRA (representing 10.42% of total commissions paid by DRA) were paid to brokers affiliated with PGI or sub-advisors of PFI, as follows:

BOARD EVALUATION OF NEW SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
     On December 11, 2018, the Board considered the approval of a sub-advisory agreement with Principal-REI with respect to the new CMBS SASB sleeve of DRA. Based upon its review, the Board concluded that it was in the best interests of DRA to approve the new sub-advisory agreement. In reaching this conclusion, no single factor was determinative in the Board's analysis, but rather the Board considered a variety of factors.
     The Board considered the nature, quality and extent of the services expected to be provided under the sub-advisory agreement. The Board considered the reputation, qualifications and background of Principal-REI, the investment approach of Principal-REI, the experience and skills of Principal-REI's investment personnel who would be responsible for the day-to-day management of DRA, and the resources made available to such personnel. The Board noted that Principal-REI currently provides sub-advisory services for other PFI Funds, and that the Board had reviewed and had approved renewal of those sub-advisory agreements at its September 2018 Board meeting. In addition, the Board considered PGI's program for recommending, monitoring and replacing sub-advisors, that such program emphasizes the selection of Principal-affiliated sub-advisors that are determined to be qualified under its due diligence process and that PGI recommended Principal-REI based on that program. 
     As the CMBS SASB sleeve is a new investment sleeve for DRA, the Board did not review performance of the sleeve because no track record was available. However, the Board took note that Principal-REI has managed real estate security strategies for other series of PFI, the performance of which is reviewed by the Board. 
     The Board also reviewed the expected impact on profitability to PGI from the addition of Principal-REI. The Board considered the proposed sub-advisory fee to be paid to Principal-REI, noting that PGI compensates sub-advisors from its own management fee so that shareholders pay only the management fee. The Board considered whether there are economies of scale with respect to the sub-advisory services to be provided to DRA under the proposed sub-advisory agreement. The Board noted that the proposed sub-advisory fee schedule does not include breakpoints, but concluded that such fee schedule is appropriate at currently anticipated asset levels. The Board considered Principal-REI's representation that it does not have any advisory clients with a lower fee for the specific mandate that it will manage for DRA and PGI's statement that it found the proposed sub-advisory fee schedule is competitive. The Board also considered that Principal-REI's appointment is contingent upon DRA's shareholders approving the sub-advisory agreement, which will involve the costs of holding a shareholder meeting. On the basis of the information provided, the Board concluded that the proposed sub-advisory fee was reasonable.
     The Board also considered the character and amount of other fall-out benefits to be received by Principal-REI. The Board noted that Principal-REI does not intend to use soft dollars in advising the CMBS SASB of DRA. The Board concluded, on the basis of the information provided, that the proposed sub-advisory fee was reasonable.
     Based upon all of the information considered and the conclusions reached, the Board determined that the terms of the sub-advisory agreement are fair and reasonable and that approval of the sub-advisory agreement is in the best interests of DRA. Required vote. DRA's shareholders will vote separately on this Proposal 2.  Approval of the new sub-advisory agreement requires the affirmative vote of a Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities (as defined above under "Voting Information - Voting rights") of DRA. If the required shareholder approval is not obtained, DRA will continue to operate in the same manner as it currently does while the Board considers an appropriate course of action.
The Board of Directors, including all the Independent Directors, recommends that shareholders of DRA vote "For" the Proposal.  
PROPOSAL 3
APPROVAL OF A NEW SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
WITH FINISTERRE CAPITAL LLP FOR THE GLOBAL DIVERSIFIED INCOME FUND
(Global Diversified Income Fund Only)
     At its meeting on December 11, 2018, the Board, including all the Independent Directors, approved a new sub-advisory agreement between PGI and Finisterre Capital LLP ("Finisterre"), appointing Finisterre as a sub-advisor to the Global Diversified Income Fund ("GDI") for the emerging markets debt portion of its portfolio. If GDI's shareholders approve the new sub-advisory agreement with Finisterre under this Proposal 3, Finisterre will replace Stone Harbor Investment Partners LP ("Stone Harbor") as sub-advisor for part of the emerging markets debt portion of GDI. The new agreement is expected to become effective in May 2019.
     GDI pursues multiple investment strategies or "sleeves," which are executed by multiple sub-advisors. PGI is responsible for, among other things, administering the business and affairs of GDI and selecting, contracting with, compensating, and monitoring the sub-advisors that manage portions of GDI's assets. In managing GDI, PGI determines the allocation of GDI's assets among the different sleeves and sub-advisors. GDI's current sub-advisors are: DDJ Capital Management, LLC ("DDJ"); Logan Circle Partners, L.P. ("Logan Circle"); Post Advisory Group, LLC ("Post"); Principal Real Estate Investors, LLC ("Principal-REI"); Spectrum Asset Management, Inc. ("Spectrum"); Stone Harbor; and W. H. Reaves & Co., Inc. (doing business as Reaves Asset Management) ("Reaves"). Post, Principal-REI, and Spectrum are affiliates of PGI.
     The sub-advisory agreements with DDJ (dated October 2, 2017), Logan Circle (dated April 1, 2018), Post (dated January 1, 2018), Principal-REI (dated January 1, 2019), Spectrum (dated January 1, 2018), Stone Harbor (dated January 1, 2015), and Reaves (dated October 1, 2017) were most recently approved for renewal by the Board (including a majority of the Independent Directors) on September 11, 2018, in connection with the Board's annual review and continuance of such agreements.  The sub-advisory agreements with Principal-REI and Spectrum, which are affiliates of PGI, were most recently approved by GDI's shareholders on December 15, 2008. The sub-advisory agreement with Post, which is an affiliate of PGI, was most recently approved by GDI's shareholders on December 11, 2012. 
     The emerging markets debt sleeve is currently managed by Stone Harbor and Logan Circle. Based on Stone Harbor's performance and Finisterre's composite results in absolute, index-relative and risk-adjusted terms in this strategy, PGI recommended terminating Stone Harbor and appointing Finisterre as sub-advisor for a majority of that portion of the emerging markets debt sleeve managed by Stone Harbor.  As a result of this replacement, Finisterre would manage approximately 10% of GDI. Based on Finisterre's modeled results of the volatility and returns of its investment strategy, PGI believes that GDI's shareholders will benefit by the replacement of Stone Harbor as sub-advisor to GDI by Finisterre. 
     Approval of the new sub-advisory agreement with Finisterre will not result in an increase in the management fees that GDI pays to PGI as investment advisor, nor will it result in a decrease in the level or quality of the sub-advisory services provided to GDI.
     Pursuant to exemptive orders issued by the SEC, PGI is not required to obtain shareholder approval of sub-advisory agreements, or material amendments to sub-advisory agreements, with (i) unaffiliated sub-advisors or (ii) wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisors (i.e., affiliated sub-advisors that are at least 95% owned, directly or indirectly, by PGI or an affiliated person of PGI), provided shareholders of the applicable fund have approved the fund's use of that order. GDI shareholders have approved GDI's reliance on such order. However, because Finisterre is a majority-owned (but not wholly-owned) affiliate of PGI, shareholders are being asked to approve the new sub-advisory agreement with Finisterre.
THE NEW AGREEMENT
 Except with respect to compensation as described below and its term, the provisions of the new sub-advisory agreement with Finisterre related to the emerging markets debt sleeve are the same in all material respects as those of the current sub-advisory agreements for GDI. The following is a brief summary of the material terms of the agreements. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of the new sub-advisory agreement attached as Appendix E to this Proxy Statement.      Under the proposed sub-advisory agreement, as with the current sub-advisory agreements with the current sub-advisors, Finisterre will, among other things:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) provide investment advisory services to GDI, including providing investment advice and recommendations with respect to GDI's investments consistent with GDI's investment objective, investment policies and restrictions; 
(2) arrange for the purchase and sale of GDI's portfolio securities; 
(3) provide, at its expense, all necessary investment and management facilities, including expenses for clerical and bookkeeping services; 
(4) advise and assist PFI's officers in taking such steps as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the decisions of the Board regarding the general conduct of the investment business of GDI; and  
(5) provide periodic reports regarding the investment services provided to GDI.  
[END TABLE]
     Compensation. Sub-advisory fees are paid by PGI out of the management fee GDI pays to PGI and are not an additional charge to GDI. Under the proposed and current sub-advisory agreements, PGI pays each sub-advisor a fee. The fee schedule under the proposed sub-advisory agreement with Finisterre is set forth below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Sub-Advisor's Fee as a Percentage of Prior Month End Assets 
Assets less than $800M 0.35% on all assets 
Assets equal to or greater than $800M and less than $900M 0.34% on all assets 
Assets equal to or greater than $900M and less than $1B 0.33% on all assets 
Assets equal to or greater than $1B and less than $1.1B 0.32% on all assets 
Assets equal to or greater than $1.1B and less than $1.2B 0.31% on all assets 
Assets equal to or greater than $1.2B and less than $1.3B 0.30% on all assets 
Assets equal to or greater than $1.3B and less than $1.4B 0.29% on all assets 
Assets equal to or greater than $1.4B and less than $1.5B 0.28% on all assets 
Assets equal to or greater than $1.5B 0.27% on all assets 
[END TABLE]
     The appointment of Finisterre is expected to benefit PGI by increasing, with respect to the assets of GDI's emerging markets debt sleeve, the amount of the management fees that are retained by PGI and its affiliates rather than being paid to unaffiliated sub-advisors. In addition, this arrangement may be viewed as presenting a conflict of interest because PGI will have a financial incentive to allocate assets to Finisterre rather than to the unaffiliated sub-advisors of GDI. In approving the new sub-advisory agreement with Finisterre, the Board, including the Independent Directors, considered potential conflicts of interest and considered as well that PGI has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of GDI.

     The Board considered the nature, quality and extent of the services expected to be provided under the sub-advisory agreement. The Board considered the reputation, qualifications and background of Finisterre, the investment approach of Finisterre, the experience and skills of Finisterre's investment personnel who would be responsible for the day-to-day management of GDI, and the resources made available to such personnel. The Board noted that Finisterre currently provides sub-advisory services for other PFI Funds, and that the Board had reviewed and had approved renewal of those sub-advisory agreements at its September 2018 Board meeting. In addition, the Board considered PGI's program for recommending, monitoring and replacing sub-advisors, that such program emphasizes the selection of Principal-affiliated sub-advisors that are determined to be qualified under its due diligence process and that PGI recommended Finisterre based on that program. 
     The Board reviewed historical one-year and since inception (October 1, 2016) performance returns as of September 30, 2018 (gross and net of proposed fees) of Finisterre for a composite managed in accordance with the proposed investment strategy for the emerging markets debt sleeve of GDI, as compared to the historical  performance returns of the current sub-advisor for GDI's emerging markets debt sleeve and a relevant benchmark index for such investment sleeve. Based on such information, the Board concluded that Finisterre is qualified.
     The Board also reviewed the expected impact on profitability to PGI from the addition of Finisterre. The Board considered the proposed sub-advisory fee to be paid to Finisterre, noting that PGI compensates sub-advisors from its own management fee so that shareholders pay only the management fee. The Board considered whether there are economies of scale with respect to the sub-advisory services to be provided to GDI under the proposed sub-advisory agreement. The Board noted that the proposed sub-advisory fee schedule includes breakpoints and concluded that the sub-advisory fee schedule reflects an appropriate recognition of economies of scale at currently anticipated asset levels. The Board considered Finisterre's representation that it does not have any advisory clients with a lower fee for the specific mandate that it will manage for GDI and PGI's statement that it found the proposed sub-advisory fee schedule is competitive. The Board also considered that Finisterre's appointment is contingent upon GDI's shareholders approving the sub-advisory agreement, which will involve the costs of holding a shareholder meeting. In this connection, the Board noted GDI's proposed addition of a seven basis point contractual fee waiver through February 29, 2020. On the basis of the information provided, the Board concluded that the proposed sub-advisory fee was reasonable.
     The Board also considered the character and amount of other fall-out benefits to be received by Finisterre. The Board noted that Finisterre does not engage in soft dollar trading. The Board concluded, on the basis of the information provided, that the proposed sub-advisory fee was reasonable.
     Based upon all of the information considered and the conclusions reached, the Board determined that the terms of the sub-advisory agreement are fair and reasonable and that approval of the sub-advisory agreement is in the best interests of GDI.
Required vote. GDI's shareholders will vote separately on this Proposal 3. Approval of the new sub-advisory agreement requires the affirmative vote of a Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities (as defined above under "Voting Information - Voting rights") of GDI. If the required shareholder approval is not obtained, Stone Harbor will continue to serve as GDI's sub-advisor for a portion of the emerging markets debt sleeve pending further Board or shareholder action.
The Board of Directors, including all the Independent Directors, recommends that shareholders of GDI vote "For" the Proposal.

Background 
      Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act generally requires an investment company to obtain shareholder approval before retaining a new sub-advisor or making material changes to an existing sub-advisory agreement. On January 19, 1999, the SEC granted an exemptive order to, among others, the Group A Funds and PGI(1) that allows them to enter into and materially amend agreements with unaffiliated sub-advisors without requiring shareholder approval (the "Unaffiliated Order"). Subsequently, on September 8, 2014, the SEC granted an order that expanded and replaced the Unaffiliated Order by allowing the Group A Funds, among others, and PGI to enter into and materially amend agreements with wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisors (i.e., affiliated sub-advisors that are at least 95% owned, directly or indirectly, by PGI and/or an affiliated person of PGI) (the "Wholly-Owned Order"). However, each Group A Fund's shareholders must approve any such Fund's reliance on the expanded relief related to wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisors.
      The Board proposes that shareholders of each Group A Fund approve the proposal. The proposal would permit PGI, in its capacity as the investment manager to that Group A Fund and subject to Board approval, to enter into and/or materially amend sub-advisory agreements with wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisors (in addition to the already permitted unaffiliated sub-advisors) without obtaining shareholder approval pursuant to the Wholly-Owned Order. PGI could only do so if the Board concludes that the new or amended sub-advisory agreement would be in the best interests of such Group A Fund and its shareholders.
(1) The Unaffiliated Order and Wholly-Owned Order order were granted to Principal Management Corporation ("PMC"), including PMC's successors (defined to mean an entity resulting from a reorganization into another jurisdiction or a change in the type of business organization) and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with PMC or its successors. On May 1, 2017, PMC merged with and into PGI, both of which were indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFG and, therefore, under common control. All references to PGI in this Proposal 4 and Proposal 5 reflect the result of PMC's merger with and into its affiliate PGI.
Operation under the Wholly-Owned Order 
      If shareholders approve this Proposal 4, PGI will be permitted to hire, terminate, or replace unaffiliated or wholly-owned sub-advisors ("Eligible Sub-Advisors") and materially amend agreements with Eligible Sub-Advisors without obtaining shareholder approval. New sub-advisory agreements between PGI and an Eligible Sub-Advisor, and any material changes to such agreements, will require the approval of the Board, including the Independent Directors, as is the case today. The relief under the Wholly-Owned Order does not apply to the advisory agreement between PGI and any Group A Fund, and material changes to such agreement would continue to  require approval of shareholders. In accordance with the conditions of the Wholly-Owned Order, within 90 days of the hiring of an Eligible Sub-Advisor, shareholders will continue to be furnished essentially all information about the Eligible Sub-Advisor and sub-advisory agreement that would be required to be included in a proxy statement.
Board Consideration in Approving Use of Wholly-Owned Order 
      The Board believes that it is in the best interests of each Group A Fund and its shareholders to provide PGI and the Board with increased flexibility to select and contract with sub-advisors without incurring the significant delay and expense associated with obtaining shareholder approval. The Board believes that the additional flexibility under the Wholly-Owned Order would permit each Group A Fund to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively. Under the Unaffiliated Order, approval by the shareholders of sub-advisory agreements or material amendments thereto with respect to unaffiliated sub-advisors is not required. However, each Group A Fund must currently call and hold a shareholder meeting before it appoints a new wholly-owned sub-advisor or materially amends a sub-advisory agreement with a wholly-owned sub-advisor. Each time a shareholder meeting is called, the relevant Group A Fund must create and distribute proxy materials and solicit proxy votes from that Fund's shareholders. This process is time consuming and costly, and such costs are sometimes borne by the Group A Fund, thereby reducing shareholders' net investment returns. Additionally, approval of this Proposal 4 would permit PGI to act quickly in certain situations in which PGI and the Board (whose approval of all such matters will continue to be required) believes that a sub-advisor change or sub-advisory agreement change is warranted.
Required vote. Shareholders of each Group A Fund will vote separately on this Proposal 4. As to any Group A Fund, approval of the Wholly-Owned Order will require the affirmative vote of a Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities (as defined above under "Voting Information - Voting rights") of that Fund. If the required shareholder approval is not obtained by any Group A Fund, such Group A Fund will continue to be required to obtain shareholder approval to enter into and/or materially amend agreements with wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisors.
The Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders of each Group A Fund vote "For"
the Proposal applicable to such Group A Fund.

Background 
     The Group A Funds, among others, and PGI have applied for a further order that would permit PGI to enter into and materially amend agreements with majority-owned affiliated sub-advisors (i.e., affiliated sub-advisors that are at least 50% owned, directly or indirectly, by PGI and/or an affiliated person of PGI) (the "Majority-Owned Order"). 
      The SEC has not issued the Majority-Owned Order to any Group A Fund or PGI, and there is no guarantee that such order will be granted. The Board, however, is proposing that the shareholders of each Group A Fund approve a proposal to permit such Group A Fund to operate pursuant to the Majority-Owned Order if and when granted. It is anticipated that such order, if granted, will impose various conditions that are the same or similar to those currently imposed on each Group A Fund and PGI by the Wholly-Owned Order. As the Majority-Owned Order has not been issued, however, such terms and conditions may be different. This Proposal 5 requests approval of the use of the Majority-Owned Order under any terms or conditions that may be imposed by the SEC in the Majority-Owned Order. Each Group A Fund anticipates that the manager-of-managers structure will operate essentially in the same manner as under the Wholly-Owned Order, except that the expansion of such relief will also apply to majority-owned affiliated sub-advisors.
Board Consideration in Approving Reliance under Majority-Owned Order
      Similar to the consideration given by the Board in recommending the approval of the Wholly-Owned Order, the Board believes that expanding such relief to majority-owned sub-advisors is in the best interests of each Group A Fund and its shareholders by providing PGI and the Board increased flexibility in selecting and contracting with sub-advisors without incurring the significant delay and expense associated with obtaining shareholder approval.
Required vote. Shareholders of each Group A Fund will vote separately on this Proposal 5. As to any Group A Fund, approval of the Majority-Owned Order will require the affirmative vote of a Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities (as defined above under "Voting Information - Voting rights") of that Group A Fund. If the required shareholder approval is not obtained by any Group A Fund, and if the SEC grants the Majority-Owned Order, such Group A Fund will continue to be required to obtain shareholder approval to enter into and/or materially amend agreements with majority-owned affiliated sub-advisors.
The Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders of each Group A Fund vote "For"
the Proposal applicable to such Group A Fund.  
PROPOSAL 6
APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT OF
CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS
Introduction
      PFI has adopted certain investment policies for each Fund, which it generally refers to as "investment restrictions," that can only be changed by a vote of shareholders. Such investment restrictions are considered "fundamental."  The 1940 Act requires that certain policies, including those dealing with the issuance of senior securities, purchasing or selling commodities or real estate, borrowing money and making loans, diversification, industry concentration, and underwriting securities of other issuers be fundamental, and the Board may elect to designate other policies as fundamental. 
Shareholders of certain Funds are being asked to approve amendments to certain fundamental investment restrictions. The amendment to each investment restriction is set forth in a separate proposal below (Proposals 6(a) - 6(d)).
PGI has reviewed each of the current investment restrictions and has recommended to the Board that certain restrictions be amended. The proposed amendments are intended to clarify and simplify PFI's fundamental restrictions and to incorporate flexibility to accommodate future regulatory changes without the need for further shareholder action. Another purpose of the proposed amendments is to conform and standardize variations in investment restrictions that have been adopted over a period of many years for funds in the Principal Fund Complex. Standardizing, to the extent practicable, such investment restrictions is expected to facilitate more effective management of the Funds, enhance monitoring compliance with applicable restrictions, and eliminate conflicts among comparable restrictions resulting from minor variations in their terms. Finally, to reflect changes over time in industry practices and regulatory requirements, some of the proposed amendments update fundamental restrictions that are more restrictive than are required under the federal securities laws.
The proposed amendments are not expected to have any material effect on the manner in which any Fund is managed or on any Fund's current principal investment objective(s). 
     The Board has concluded that the proposed amendments to the investment restrictions are appropriate and will benefit the Funds and their shareholders. If approved by shareholders of a Fund, each amended investment restriction will become effective as to that Fund when PFI's Statement of Additional Information is revised or supplemented to reflect the amendment.
 Required vote. Shareholders of each Fund will vote separately on each proposed amendment that applies to that Fund. As to any Fund, approval of each of Proposals 6(a) - 6(d) will require the affirmative vote of a Majority of the Outstanding Voting Securities (as defined above under "Voting Information - Voting rights") of that Fund. If a proposed amendment is not approved by shareholders of a Fund, the current investment restriction will remain in effect as to that Fund.
The Board recommends that the shareholders of each Fund vote "For"
each Proposal applicable to the Fund.
Organization of Proposals
     The amendment to each fundamental investment restriction is set forth in a separate proposal below (Proposals 6(a) - 6(d)). The Funds that will vote on each proposal are identified under the caption for that proposal, and each proposal sets forth the proposed amended fundamental investment restriction as well as the restriction currently in effect. For each proposal, the term "Fund" or "Funds" refers to the Fund or Funds voting on the particular proposal.  
PROPOSAL 6(a)
APPROVAL OF AN AMENDED FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT RESTRICTION 
RELATING TO COMMODITIES FOR THE FUND
(Each Fund)
 Sections 8(b)(1)(F) and 13(a)(2) of the 1940 Act together require that each Fund have a fundamental restriction dealing with the purchase or sale of commodities. The 1940 Act does not prohibit a fund from investing in commodities.
 Proposed restriction: The Board is proposing that the Funds indicated above adopt the following fundamental investment restriction relating to commodities:
 The Fund may not purchase or sell commodities, except as permitted by applicable law, regulation or regulatory authority having jurisdiction.
 Current Restriction: Currently, each Fund has a fundamental investment restriction relating to commodities that differs from the proposed restriction. The current restriction is set forth below.
    "Each Fund may not purchase or sell commodities, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, as amended, and as interpreted, modified or otherwise permitted by regulatory authority having jurisdiction, from time to time."
     Discussion of proposed amendment. The proposed amendment is intended to clarify that each Fund's ability to purchase or sell commodities is limited by all laws applicable to such Fund, not just the 1940 Act. Under the proposed restriction, if current applicable law changes, each Fund could conform to such new law without shareholders taking further action.
Approval by any Fund of the proposed amended restriction relating to commodities is not expected to increase the risk of an investment in the Fund or affect the way the Fund is currently managed or operated.
PROPOSAL 6(b)
APPROVAL OF AN AMENDED FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT RESTRICTION 
RELATING TO DIVERSIFICATION FOR THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL FUND
(California Municipal Fund Only)
     Section 5(b)(1) of the 1940 Act sets forth the requirements that must be satisfied for an open-end investment company to be diversified. A diversified fund is limited as to the amount it may invest in any single issuer. A non-diversified fund is generally considered to be subject to greater risk than a diversified fund because a non-diversified fund may invest in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund.
Proposed restriction:   The Board is proposing that the Fund indicated above adopt the following fundamental investment restriction relating to diversification:
The Fund has elected to be treated as a "diversified" investment company, as that term is used in the 1940 Act, as amended, and as interpreted, modified or otherwise permitted by regulatory authority having jurisdiction, from time to time.
Current restriction:  Currently, the Fund indicated above has a fundamental restriction relating to diversification that differs from the proposed restriction. The current restriction is set forth below. 
      "The California Municipal Fund may not invest more than 5% of its total assets in the securities of any one issuer (other than obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities) or purchase more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer, except that this limitation shall apply only with respect to 75% of the total assets of the Fund." Discussion of proposed amendment. The proposed amendment would modify the Fund's fundamental restriction regarding the Fund's classification as a "diversified" fund under the 1940 Act to rely on the entire 1940 Act definition of the term "diversified," rather than stating certain specific limitations expressed under current law. In addition, the proposed amendment is expected to reduce administrative burdens by conforming the fundamental restriction to the language that applies to all funds in the Principal Fund Complex that have elected to be diversified funds.
Approval by the Fund of the proposed amended restriction relating to diversification is not expected to increase the risk of an investment in the Fund.

     Under the 1940 Act, a fund's policy regarding concentration of investments in the securities of companies in any particular industry must be fundamental. The staff of the SEC takes the position that any fund that invests more than 25% of its total assets in a particular industry (excluding the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities) is deemed to be "concentrated" in that industry.
 Proposed restriction: The Board is proposing that the Funds indicated above adopt the following fundamental investment restriction relating to concentration:
 The Fund may not concentrate, as that term is used in the 1940 Act, as amended, and as interpreted, modified or otherwise permitted by regulatory authority having jurisdiction, from time to time, its investments in a particular industry or group of industries.
 Current Restriction: Currently, the Funds indicated above have a fundamental investment restriction relating to concentration that differs from the proposed restriction. The current restriction is set forth below.
     "Each Fund may not concentrate, as that term is used in the 1940 Act, its investments in a particular industry, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, as amended, and as interpreted, modified or otherwise permitted by regulatory authority having jurisdiction, from time to time."
    Discussion of proposed amendment. Because the 1940 Act does not otherwise permit concentration, the exception stated in the current restriction is not meaningful. The proposed amendment is intended to clarify the restriction by deleting such exception. Each Fund currently has, and will continue to have, a fundamental investment restriction that prohibits the Fund from concentrating its investments in any one industry.
Approval by a Fund of the proposed amended restriction relating to concentration is not expected to increase the risk of an investment in the Fund.

     Under the 1940 Act, a fund's policy regarding concentration of investments in the securities of companies in any particular industry must be fundamental. The staff of the SEC takes the position that any fund that invests more than 25% of its total assets in a particular industry (excluding the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities) is deemed to be "concentrated" in that industry.
 Proposed restriction: The Board is proposing that the Funds indicated above adopt the following fundamental investment restriction relating to concentration:
 The Fund may not concentrate, as that term is used in the 1940 Act, as amended, and as interpreted, modified or otherwise permitted by regulatory authority having jurisdiction, from time to time, its investments in a particular industry or group of industries.
 Current Restriction: Currently, the Funds indicated above have a fundamental investment restriction relating to concentration that differs from the proposed restriction. The current restriction is set forth below.
     "Each Fund may not concentrate, as that term is used in the 1940 Act, its investments in a particular industry, except as permitted under the 1940 Act, as amended, and as interpreted, modified or otherwise permitted by regulatory authority having jurisdiction, from time to time."
     Discussion of proposed amendment. Because the 1940 Act does not otherwise permit concentration, the exception stated in the current restriction is not meaningful. The proposed amendment is intended to clarify the restriction by deleting such exception. Each Fund currently has, and will continue to have, a fundamental investment restriction that prohibits the Fund from concentrating its investments in any one industry.
Approval by a Fund of the proposed amended restriction relating to concentration is not expected to increase the risk of an investment in the Fund.  
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The firm of Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") has been selected as the independent registered public accounting firm for the PFI Funds for their fiscal years ending August 31, 2019 and October 31, 2019 and served as such for the last two fiscal years of the Funds. The independent registered public accounting firm audits annual financial statements for PFI and reviews regulatory filings that include those financial statements. Representatives of Ernst & Young are expected to be present at the Meeting, have been given the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to answer appropriate questions. 
The Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") has adopted the following policy regarding approval and pre-approval of audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm (the "independent auditor").
* * *
The Principal Funds
Policy on Auditor Independence
The purpose of this policy is to ensure the independence of the Principal Funds' primary independent auditor.  This policy is established by the Audit Committee (the "Committee") of the Boards of Directors of Principal Funds, Inc. and Principal Variable Contracts Funds, Inc. and the Board of Trustees of Principal Exchange-Traded Funds (the "Funds") (the "Boards of the Funds") effective for all engagements of the primary independent auditor.
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. The primary independent auditor, its subsidiaries and affiliates shall not provide Prohibited Services to the Funds.  For the purposes of this policy, Prohibited Services are: 
• Services that are subject to audit procedure during a financial statement audit; 
• Services where the auditor would act on behalf of management; 
• Services where the auditor is an advocate to the client's position in an adversarial proceeding; 
• Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the Funds, its subsidiaries and affiliates; 
• Financial information systems design and implementation; 
• Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-in-kind reports; 
• Actuarial services; 
• Internal audit functions or human resources; 
• Broker or dealer, investment advisor, or investment banking services; 
• Legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit; 
• Tax planning services related to listed, confidential and aggressive transactions; 
• Personal tax planning services to individuals in a financial reporting oversight role with regard to the Funds (other than members of the Boards of the Funds who are not also officers of the Funds), including the immediate family members of such individuals; 
• Any other service that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) determines, by regulation, is impermissible. 
2. (A) All services the primary independent auditor, its subsidiaries and affiliates provide to the Funds, and (B) Audit services, including audits of annual financial statements, audits of acquired or divested businesses or review of regulatory filings, any independent auditor provides, shall be approved by the Committee in advance in accordance with the following procedure: 
[END TABLE]
Each quarter, Management will present to the Committee for pre-approval, a detailed description of each particular service, excluding tax services, for which pre-approval is sought and a range of fees for such service.  The Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members provided such delegated member(s) shall present a report of any services approved to  the full Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.  The Committee Chairperson shall have pre-approval authority for changes to any range of fees applicable to services the Committee previously approved and for new services and the range of fees for such services that arise between regularly scheduled Committee meetings.
Similarly, the primary independent auditor will present to the Committee for pre-approval a written description of the nature and scope of all tax services not expressly prohibited, including the fee arrangements for such services, and the potential effects of such services on the audit firm's independence.
In considering whether to pre-approve the primary independent auditor's provision of non-audit services, the Committee will consider whether the services are compatible with the maintenance of such auditor's independence.  The Committee will also consider whether the primary independent auditor is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service, for reasons such as its familiarity with the Funds' business, people, culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance the Funds' ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality.
[BEGIN TABLE]
3. The provisions of this policy shall apply to all audit and non-audit services provided directly to the Funds.  Additionally, the provisions of this policy shall apply to non-audit services provided to Principal Global Investors, LLC ("PGI") or an affiliate of PGI that provides ongoing services to the Funds if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Funds. 
4. Not less than annually, the primary independent auditor shall report to the Committee in writing all relationships that may reasonably be thought to bear on independence between the auditor and the Funds or persons in financial reporting oversight roles with respect to any services provided by the auditor, its subsidiaries or affiliates as of the date of the communication, pursuant to Rule 3526 of the PCAOB.  The primary independent auditor shall discuss with the Committee the potential effects of such relationships on the independence of the auditor.  In addition, the primary independent auditor shall affirm, in writing, that, as of the date of the communication, it is independent within the meaning of the federal securities laws and Rule 3520 of the PCAOB. 
5. The Committee shall ensure that the lead and concurring partners of the Funds' primary independent auditor are rotated at least every five years and subject upon rotation to a five year "time out" period.  All other partners of the primary independent auditor, excluding partners who simply consult with others on the audit engagement regarding technical issues, shall rotate after seven years and be subject upon rotation to a two year "time out" period. 
6. Neither the Funds nor PGI may hire or promote any former partner, principal, shareholder or professional employee (Former Employee) of the primary independent auditor into a financial reporting oversight role unless the Former Employee (1) has severed his/her economic interest in the independent audit firm, and (2) was not a member of the audit engagement team for the Funds during the one year period preceding the date that the audit procedures began for the fiscal period in which the Funds or PGI proposes to hire or promote the Former Employee.  Neither the Funds nor PGI shall, without prior written consent of the primary independent auditor, hire or promote any Former Employee into a role not prohibited above if the Former Employee had provided any services to the Funds or PGI during the 12 months preceding the date of filing of the Funds' most recent annual report with the SEC.  Upon termination of the primary independent auditor, the Funds or PGI shall not, without prior written consent of the former primary independent auditor, hire or promote any Former Employee for a period of up to 12 months from termination. 
7.  For persons recently promoted or hired into a financial reporting oversight role (other than members of the Boards of the Funds who are not also officers of the Funds), any personal tax planning services pursuant to an engagement that was in progress before the hiring or promotion and provided by the primary independent auditor must be completed on or before 180 days after the hiring or promotion. 
8.  The phrase "financial reporting oversight role" means a role in which a person is in a position to exercise influence over the contents of the financial statements or anyone who prepares them, such as a member of the board of directors or similar management or governing body, chief executive officer, president, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, counsel, controller, chief internal auditor, or any equivalent positions. 
[END TABLE]
 The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to PFI's investment advisor (not including any sub-advisor whose role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment advisor), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the investment advisor that provides ongoing services to PFI that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

OTHER MATTERS
PFI does not know of any matters to be presented at the Meeting other than those mentioned in this Proxy Statement. If any other matters properly come before the Meeting, the shares represented by proxies will be voted in accordance with the best judgment of the person or persons voting the proxies.
PFI is not required to hold annual meetings of shareholders and, therefore, cannot determine when the next meeting of shareholders will be held. Shareholder proposals to be presented at any future meeting of shareholders of PFI or any Fund must be received by us a reasonable time before we commence soliciting proxies for that meeting in order for such proposals to be included in the proxy materials relating to that meeting.
Only one copy of this Proxy Statement may be mailed to households, even if more than one person in a household is a Fund shareholder of record, unless PFI has received instructions to the contrary. If you need additional copies of this Proxy Statement, or if you do not want the mailing of a Proxy Statement to be combined with those for other members of your household in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would rather receive just one copy for the household, please contact the Shareholder Services Department toll free at 1-800-222-5852 or by writing to PFI at P.O. Box 219971, Kansas City, MO 64121-9971. PFI will promptly deliver, upon request, a separate copy of this Proxy Statement to any shareholder residing at an address to which only one copy was mailed.
BY ORDER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

APPENDIX B
AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER
PRINCIPAL FUNDS1 
Audit Committee Charter (Amended March 13, 2018)
This charter sets forth the purpose, operating guidelines and responsibilities of the Audit Committee (the "Committee") of the Boards of Directors/Trustees of the Principal Funds (the "Funds"). The Committee reviews the charter at least annually.
Purpose
The primary purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling certain of its responsibilities. The Audit Committee serves as an independent and objective party to monitor the Funds' accounting policies, financial reporting and internal control system, as well as the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee assists Board oversight of (1) the integrity of the Funds' financial statements; (2) the Funds' compliance with certain legal and regulatory requirements;2 (3) the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence; and (4) the performance of the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also serves to provide an open avenue of communication among the independent registered public accounting firm, the Manager's internal auditors, Fund management, and the Board.
The Committee's role is limited to oversight. Fund management is responsible for preparing the Funds' financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and for establishing and maintaining appropriate systems for accounting, reporting and internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for conducting an audit of the Funds' financial statements in accordance with applicable legal and professional standards, including the standards set by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
Although the Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in this charter, it is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Funds' financial statements are complete and accurate and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Nothing in this charter shall be construed to reduce the responsibilities or liabilities of the Funds' service providers, including the independent registered public accounting firm. The independent registered public accounting firm is ultimately accountable to the Funds' Board and the Committee.
Operating Guidelines
The Board shall appoint the members of the Committee and the Committee's Chair. Members of the Committee may not be interested persons of the Funds, as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The number of Committee members shall satisfy each of the securities exchanges on which the Funds offers shares. In addition, a member of the Committee may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the Committee, the Board or any other board committee, accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the Funds or any affiliate of the Funds.
Each member of the Committee shall be financially literate, as such qualification is interpreted by the Funds' Board in its business judgment. At least one member of the Committee must have accounting or related financial management expertise, as the Board interprets such qualification in its business judgment. The Board will determine whether any member of the Committee is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR.
____________________
1 Includes Principal Funds, Inc., Principal Variable Contracts Funds, Inc. and Principal Exchange-Traded Funds
2 The Board has delegated to other committees oversight of various legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee's function is limited to the activities set forth in this charter.
B-1
There shall be four regular meetings of the Committee each year. In conjunction with these meetings, the Committee shall meet in private executive sessions. The Committee or its Chair may call additional meetings as each deems appropriate. The Committee shall meet periodically, in separate executive sessions, with representatives of Fund Management, the Manager's internal auditors and the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee may also request to meet with internal legal counsel and compliance personnel of the Manager and with personnel of entities that provide significant accounting or administrative services to the Funds to discuss matters relating to the Funds' accounting and compliance as well as other Fund-related matters.
Except as provided by law, the following provisions shall govern the conduct of Committee meetings:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Notice. Notice shall be given as provided for meetings of the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Principal Funds. 
• Quorum. At any Committee meeting a majority of the Committee members then in office shall constitute a quorum. Any meeting may be adjourned from time to time by a majority of the votes cast upon the question, whether or not a quorum is present, and the meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice. 
• Action by Vote. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a majority of Committee members may take any action. 
• Action by Writing. Any action required or permitted to be taken at any Committee meeting may be taken without a meeting if all of the Committee members consent to the action in writing and such written consents are filed with the records of the meetings of the Committee. Such consent shall be treated for all purposes as a vote taken at a Committee meeting. 
• Presence Through Communications Equipment. The members of the Committee may participate in a Committee meeting by means of a conference telephone, or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time. Participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at a meeting. 
• Minutes. Minutes of the meeting shall be taken and circulated to all members of the Committee in a timely manner. 
[END TABLE]
Responsibilities
The Responsibilities of the Committee include, but are not limited to, the following:

Principal Financial Group's whistleblower procedures are intended to empower employees and others to confidentially and anonymously report any unethical employee behavior, and those procedures will be used to facilitate the identification by the Principal Financial Group's Chief Internal Auditor and the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer of complaint information for the Audit Committee's review.  
• Review with the Funds' principal executive officer and/or principal financial officer, in connection with the required certifications on Form N-CSR and Form N-Q, any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting or material weaknesses therein and any reported evidence of fraud involving management or other employees who have a significant role in the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.

• Review and pre-approve all services, including all audit and non-audit services, performed by the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm for the Funds. 
• Review and pre-approve all non-audit services performed by the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm for the Manager or any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Manager that provides ongoing services to the Funds, if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Funds; and to develop, to the extent deemed appropriate by the Committee, policies and procedures for pre-approval of the engagement of the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm to provide any of these non-audit services.

(g) Upon request, provide assistance and recommendations for the determination of the fair value of certain securities when reliable market quotations are not readily available for purposes of calculating net asset value in accordance with procedures and methods established by the Fund's Board of Directors. 
(h) Furnish, at its own expense, (i) all necessary investment and management facilities, including salaries of clerical and other personnel required for it to execute its duties faithfully, and (ii) administrative facilities, including bookkeeping, clerical personnel and equipment necessary for the efficient conduct of the investment advisory affairs of the Series.

To the extent consistent with applicable law, purchase or sell orders for the Series may be aggregated with contemporaneous purchase or sell orders of other clients of the Sub-Advisor.

To the extent consistent with applicable law, the Sub-Advisor may pay a broker or dealer an amount of commission for effecting a securities or derivatives transaction in excess of the amount of commission or dealer spread another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the Sub-Advisor determines in good faith that such amount of commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research products and/or services provided by such broker or dealer. This determination, with respect to brokerage and research products and/or services, may be viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities which the Sub-Advisor and its affiliates have with respect to the Series as well as to accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Not all such services or products need be used by the Sub-Advisor in managing the Series. In addition, joint repurchase or other accounts may not be utilized by the Series except to the extent permitted under any exemptive order obtained by the Sub-Advisor provided that all conditions of such order are complied with.
