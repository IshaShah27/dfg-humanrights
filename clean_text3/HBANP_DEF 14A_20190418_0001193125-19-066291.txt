Dear Fellow Shareholders: 
We are pleased to invite you to the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on Thursday, April 18, 2019, at 2:00 pm (local time) at our Easton Business Service Center in Columbus, Ohio. We will consider the matters described in the following Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and review highlights of the past year. We hope you will attend the meeting. 
2018 was another year of strong performance for Huntington, with record net income for the fourth consecutive year and annual positive operating leverage for the sixth consecutive year. For the first time, we achieved all five of our long-term financial goals established in the 2014 Strategic Plan. This achievement accelerated our ability to provide enhanced long-term targets as a part of the new strategic plan announced in the fourth quarter of 2018. Our strategy is based on capitalizing on our sustainable competitive advantages, driving organic revenue growth, and adhering to our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite. 
Your vote is important to us. Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, we encourage you to read the Proxy Statement carefully. Please vote via internet, telephone or mail to ensure that your shares are represented. 
Thank you for your support of Huntington. 
Best wishes,

Proxy Statement Summary 
Our ESG Strategy 
At Huntington we focus our ESG strategic approach on the issues that are most important to our businesses and our stakeholders. To quantify and qualify that alignment, Huntington undertook a process with a third-party consultant to conduct a materiality assessment. We deliberately took an integrated approach to conducting our assessment by directly considering our risk management priorities, overall corporate strategy and purpose. We recognize that each issue in our assessment is important, but the final results focus us on a relative prioritization of these important issues. As a result, the assessment reflects that Huntington's most important stakeholder and business priorities are financial performance; corporate governance; customer advocacy and security; ethical and purpose-driven culture; diversity & inclusion; and responsible and innovative products and services. 
Driven by our purpose and guided into action through our core values, we are focused on ensuring top-tier performance and creating long-term value for our four primary constituencies: our shareholders, our customers, our colleagues and communities. At its heart, our strategy is differentiated through our relentless focus on customer experience, supported by a robust risk management culture and by a distinguished customer- and community-centric mindset. We believe this shared value approach to responsible growth, delivered by our inclusive and highly engaged colleagues, has allowed us to retain and develop deeper relationships with our customers, expand our relationships across our footprint and reinvest in community development for the markets we serve. 
We recognize that creating and effectively reporting value requires a holistic approach. We have adapted an ESG performance management framework that considers governance, strategy and operations grounded in the ESG considerations most material to our stakeholders. This ESG framework will ensure we formalize and standardize our approach to integrating ESG considerations into our board and executive management, business strategy and business platforms. Strong governance and an engaged board ensure accountability. 
ESG Performance Management Framework — prioritizing the ESG considerations most material to our stakeholders: 
Governance. Strong corporate governance is essential to the long-term success of the company. Effective risk management is critical to profitability, stability and long-term growth. The concept of "everyone owns risk" is deeply embedded in our culture. 
Social. Our social responsibility starts with our colleagues. Our colleagues are our most important asset and the key to fulfilling our mission to make people's lives better, help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve. 
Environment. Climate change is a serious issue that deserves a proactive response. We embrace responsible practices for energy conservation and environmental sustainability.

   Our Colleagues are Key to Our Brand and Success   
   Our Colleagues are Key to Our Brand and Success   
   Our Colleagues are Key to Our Brand and Success   
   At Huntington, we strive to have highly engaged colleagues committed to looking out for each other and our customers. Our colleagues are our most  important asset and the key to fulfilling our purpose to make peoples lives better, help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve. We are focused on making the colleague experience better than ever. Our transformation has been  underway for several years  it is being shaped by colleague feedback and focuses on three key areas:   Investing in Physical, Financial and Personal Well-Being     We continue to make  important investments in our colleagues. We announced an increase to our minimum salary commitment, for the third consecutive year, to $16/hour, as of May 2019.     We further enhanced several  key programs, including short-term and long-term disability programs, family and caregiver time off, and our colleague emergency assistance fund, Huntington Cares, to better help our colleagues when they need help most.     We have taken deliberate steps to ensure our health, welfare, and retirement programs are competitive, cost-effective and meet the needs of our diverse colleague base. We  provide strong core programs, plus innovative, value-added offerings to our colleagues and their families. For 2019, we introduced two new levels within our medical plan for colleagues with salaries less than $100,000, and we rolled back the cost of  their medical premiums; we also reduced deductibles for all participants.     Our wellness program is an  important part of who we are. Colleagues and family members participate in a variety of healthy activities, including health assessments and biometric screenings and coaching. We opened new fitness centers in our Columbus, Ohio (Easton and Gateway)  and Akron, Ohio operations centers  we now have three fitness centers, with more than 1,300 active colleague members.     We offer equal employment  to colleagues in every aspect of employment. We hire based on qualifications and evaluate, recognize, reward and promote colleagues based on performance. We do not discriminate based on any category protected by federal, state or local law. Pay  equality is fundamental to our philosophy of fair and equitable treatment. We regularly review and analyze our pay practices and engage in ongoing efforts to ensure pay equality for all colleagues.   Empowering Professional Growth and Development     We are focused on engaging, developing, retaining and attracting talented colleagues.     We are making a significant  investment in developing our managers. We established the Executive Leader Forum, where we bring together our top 100 leaders twice a year, to equip and enable them to uphold our purpose, align their work to it, and inspire their teams to do the  same. Additional new leader development programs include Women in Leadership and Emerging Leaders.     We are elevating our  Performance Management process to Performance Engagement, with conversations with equal emphasis on what and how we deliver, as well as more frequent development conversations with colleagues. We believe these are  key moments for our leaders to engage our colleagues, encourage expected behaviors in support of our values, and help enable our colleagues to grow professionally.     We are leveraging  opportunities presented by several significant best-in-class technology investments to take our management of talent to the next level, improving the quality,  engagement, and retention of talent across the organization.   Driving  Inclusion Through a Diverse Workforce and Supplier Base     We continue to create a workplace that is welcoming, inclusive and respectful to all. Our world of diversity and inclusion extends beyond gender, race,  ethnicity, age and sexual orientation to include different thoughts, skills, experiences and backgrounds.     We are a signatory on the  CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. As part of this initiative, colleagues at more than 150 organizations  joined in a Day of Understanding to engage in dialogue around topics such as unconscious bias.     Our voluntary  colleague-driven Business Resources Groups, organized around a shared interest or common diversity dimension, along with our voluntary Inclusion Councils, have led enterprise-wide initiatives that have improved our disability equality score, our  family time off policies, and our benefits for all colleagues.     We launched a program to  recognize colleagues for advancing diversity and inclusion efforts and demonstrating how inclusive practices drive performance. Recipients of the awards are selected based on their consistent and strategic engagement in embracing our commitment to  inclusion.     26.1% spend with diverse-owned companies far exceeds the financial industry average.

Additional new leader development programs include Women in Leadership and Emerging Leaders.     We are elevating our  Performance Management process to Performance Engagement, with conversations with equal emphasis on what and how we deliver, as well as more frequent development conversations with colleagues. We believe these are  key moments for our leaders to engage our colleagues, encourage expected behaviors in support of our values, and help enable our colleagues to grow professionally.     We are leveraging  opportunities presented by several significant best-in-class technology investments to take our management of talent to the next level, improving the quality,  engagement, and retention of talent across the organization.

We announced an increase to our minimum salary commitment, for the third consecutive year, to $16/hour, as of May 2019.     We further enhanced several  key programs, including short-term and long-term disability programs, family and caregiver time off, and our colleague emergency assistance fund, Huntington Cares, to better help our colleagues when they need help most.     We have taken deliberate steps to ensure our health, welfare, and retirement programs are competitive, cost-effective and meet the needs of our diverse colleague base. We  provide strong core programs, plus innovative, value-added offerings to our colleagues and their families.

We announced an increase to our minimum salary commitment, for the third consecutive year, to $16/hour, as of May 2019.     We further enhanced several  key programs, including short-term and long-term disability programs, family and caregiver time off, and our colleague emergency assistance fund, Huntington Cares, to better help our colleagues when they need help most.     We have taken deliberate steps to ensure our health, welfare, and retirement programs are competitive, cost-effective and meet the needs of our diverse colleague base. We  provide strong core programs, plus innovative, value-added offerings to our colleagues and their families. For 2019, we introduced two new levels within our medical plan for colleagues with salaries less than $100,000, and we rolled back the cost of  their medical premiums; we also reduced deductibles for all participants.     Our wellness program is an  important part of who we are. Colleagues and family members participate in a variety of healthy activities, including health assessments and biometric screenings and coaching. We opened new fitness centers in our Columbus, Ohio (Easton and Gateway)  and Akron, Ohio operations centers  we now have three fitness centers, with more than 1,300 active colleague members.     We offer equal employment  to colleagues in every aspect of employment. We hire based on qualifications and evaluate, recognize, reward and promote colleagues based on performance. We do not discriminate based on any category protected by federal, state or local law. Pay  equality is fundamental to our philosophy of fair and equitable treatment. We regularly review and analyze our pay practices and engage in ongoing efforts to ensure pay equality for all colleagues.   Empowering Professional Growth and Development     We are focused on engaging, developing, retaining and attracting talented colleagues.     We are making a significant  investment in developing our managers. We established the Executive Leader Forum, where we bring together our top 100 leaders twice a year, to equip and enable them to uphold our purpose, align their work to it, and inspire their teams to do the  same. Additional new leader development programs include Women in Leadership and Emerging Leaders.     We are elevating our  Performance Management process to Performance Engagement, with conversations with equal emphasis on what and how we deliver, as well as more frequent development conversations with colleagues. We believe these are  key moments for our leaders to engage our colleagues, encourage expected behaviors in support of our values, and help enable our colleagues to grow professionally.     We are leveraging  opportunities presented by several significant best-in-class technology investments to take our management of talent to the next level, improving the quality,  engagement, and retention of talent across the organization.   Driving  Inclusion Through a Diverse Workforce and Supplier Base     We continue to create a workplace that is welcoming, inclusive and respectful to all. Our world of diversity and inclusion extends beyond gender, race,  ethnicity, age and sexual orientation to include different thoughts, skills, experiences and backgrounds.     We are a signatory on the  CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. As part of this initiative, colleagues at more than 150 organizations  joined in a Day of Understanding to engage in dialogue around topics such as unconscious bias.     Our voluntary  colleague-driven Business Resources Groups, organized around a shared interest or common diversity dimension, along with our voluntary Inclusion Councils, have led enterprise-wide initiatives that have improved our disability equality score, our  family time off policies, and our benefits for all colleagues.     We launched a program to  recognize colleagues for advancing diversity and inclusion efforts and demonstrating how inclusive practices drive performance. Recipients of the awards are selected based on their consistent and strategic engagement in embracing our commitment to  inclusion.     26.1% spend with diverse-owned companies far exceeds the financial industry average.   
   At Huntington, we strive to have highly engaged colleagues committed to looking out for each other and our customers.

As part of this initiative, colleagues at more than 150 organizations  joined in a Day of Understanding to engage in dialogue around topics such as unconscious bias.     Our voluntary  colleague-driven Business Resources Groups, organized around a shared interest or common diversity dimension, along with our voluntary Inclusion Councils, have led enterprise-wide initiatives that have improved our disability equality score, our  family time off policies, and our benefits for all colleagues.     We launched a program to  recognize colleagues for advancing diversity and inclusion efforts and demonstrating how inclusive practices drive performance. Recipients of the awards are selected based on their consistent and strategic engagement in embracing our commitment to  inclusion.     26.1% spend with diverse-owned companies far exceeds the financial industry average.   
   At Huntington, we strive to have highly engaged colleagues committed to looking out for each other and our customers. Our colleagues are our most  important asset and the key to fulfilling our purpose to make peoples lives better, help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve. We are focused on making the colleague experience better than ever. Our transformation has been  underway for several years  it is being shaped by colleague feedback and focuses on three key areas:   Investing in Physical, Financial and Personal Well-Being     We continue to make  important investments in our colleagues. We announced an increase to our minimum salary commitment, for the third consecutive year, to $16/hour, as of May 2019.     We further enhanced several  key programs, including short-term and long-term disability programs, family and caregiver time off, and our colleague emergency assistance fund, Huntington Cares, to better help our colleagues when they need help most.     We have taken deliberate steps to ensure our health, welfare, and retirement programs are competitive, cost-effective and meet the needs of our diverse colleague base. We  provide strong core programs, plus innovative, value-added offerings to our colleagues and their families. For 2019, we introduced two new levels within our medical plan for colleagues with salaries less than $100,000, and we rolled back the cost of  their medical premiums; we also reduced deductibles for all participants.     Our wellness program is an  important part of who we are. Colleagues and family members participate in a variety of healthy activities, including health assessments and biometric screenings and coaching. We opened new fitness centers in our Columbus, Ohio (Easton and Gateway)  and Akron, Ohio operations centers  we now have three fitness centers, with more than 1,300 active colleague members.     We offer equal employment  to colleagues in every aspect of employment. We hire based on qualifications and evaluate, recognize, reward and promote colleagues based on performance. We do not discriminate based on any category protected by federal, state or local law. Pay  equality is fundamental to our philosophy of fair and equitable treatment. We regularly review and analyze our pay practices and engage in ongoing efforts to ensure pay equality for all colleagues.   Empowering Professional Growth and Development     We are focused on engaging, developing, retaining and attracting talented colleagues.     We are making a significant  investment in developing our managers. We established the Executive Leader Forum, where we bring together our top 100 leaders twice a year, to equip and enable them to uphold our purpose, align their work to it, and inspire their teams to do the  same. Additional new leader development programs include Women in Leadership and Emerging Leaders.     We are elevating our  Performance Management process to Performance Engagement, with conversations with equal emphasis on what and how we deliver, as well as more frequent development conversations with colleagues. We believe these are  key moments for our leaders to engage our colleagues, encourage expected behaviors in support of our values, and help enable our colleagues to grow professionally.     We are leveraging  opportunities presented by several significant best-in-class technology investments to take our management of talent to the next level, improving the quality,  engagement, and retention of talent across the organization.

Additional new leader development programs include Women in Leadership and Emerging Leaders.     We are elevating our  Performance Management process to Performance Engagement, with conversations with equal emphasis on what and how we deliver, as well as more frequent development conversations with colleagues. We believe these are  key moments for our leaders to engage our colleagues, encourage expected behaviors in support of our values, and help enable our colleagues to grow professionally.     We are leveraging  opportunities presented by several significant best-in-class technology investments to take our management of talent to the next level, improving the quality,  engagement, and retention of talent across the organization.   Driving  Inclusion Through a Diverse Workforce and Supplier Base     We continue to create a workplace that is welcoming, inclusive and respectful to all. Our world of diversity and inclusion extends beyond gender, race,  ethnicity, age and sexual orientation to include different thoughts, skills, experiences and backgrounds.     We are a signatory on the  CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. As part of this initiative, colleagues at more than 150 organizations  joined in a Day of Understanding to engage in dialogue around topics such as unconscious bias.     Our voluntary  colleague-driven Business Resources Groups, organized around a shared interest or common diversity dimension, along with our voluntary Inclusion Councils, have led enterprise-wide initiatives that have improved our disability equality score, our  family time off policies, and our benefits for all colleagues.     We launched a program to  recognize colleagues for advancing diversity and inclusion efforts and demonstrating how inclusive practices drive performance. Recipients of the awards are selected based on their consistent and strategic engagement in embracing our commitment to  inclusion.     26.1% spend with diverse-owned companies far exceeds the financial industry average.   
   At Huntington, we strive to have highly engaged colleagues committed to looking out for each other and our customers. Our colleagues are our most  important asset and the key to fulfilling our purpose to make peoples lives better, help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve. We are focused on making the colleague experience better than ever. Our transformation has been  underway for several years  it is being shaped by colleague feedback and focuses on three key areas:   Investing in Physical, Financial and Personal Well-Being     We continue to make  important investments in our colleagues. We announced an increase to our minimum salary commitment, for the third consecutive year, to $16/hour, as of May 2019.     We further enhanced several  key programs, including short-term and long-term disability programs, family and caregiver time off, and our colleague emergency assistance fund, Huntington Cares, to better help our colleagues when they need help most.     We have taken deliberate steps to ensure our health, welfare, and retirement programs are competitive, cost-effective and meet the needs of our diverse colleague base. We  provide strong core programs, plus innovative, value-added offerings to our colleagues and their families. For 2019, we introduced two new levels within our medical plan for colleagues with salaries less than $100,000, and we rolled back the cost of  their medical premiums; we also reduced deductibles for all participants.     Our wellness program is an  important part of who we are. Colleagues and family members participate in a variety of healthy activities, including health assessments and biometric screenings and coaching. We opened new fitness centers in our Columbus, Ohio (Easton and Gateway)  and Akron, Ohio operations centers  we now have three fitness centers, with more than 1,300 active colleague members.     We offer equal employment  to colleagues in every aspect of employment. We hire based on qualifications and evaluate, recognize, reward and promote colleagues based on performance. We do not discriminate based on any category protected by federal, state or local law. Pay  equality is fundamental to our philosophy of fair and equitable treatment. We regularly review and analyze our pay practices and engage in ongoing efforts to ensure pay equality for all colleagues.

We opened new fitness centers in our Columbus, Ohio (Easton and Gateway)  and Akron, Ohio operations centers  we now have three fitness centers, with more than 1,300 active colleague members.     We offer equal employment  to colleagues in every aspect of employment. We hire based on qualifications and evaluate, recognize, reward and promote colleagues based on performance. We do not discriminate based on any category protected by federal, state or local law.

Empowering Professional Growth and Development     We are focused on engaging, developing, retaining and attracting talented colleagues.     We are making a significant  investment in developing our managers. We established the Executive Leader Forum, where we bring together our top 100 leaders twice a year, to equip and enable them to uphold our purpose, align their work to it, and inspire their teams to do the  same. Additional new leader development programs include Women in Leadership and Emerging Leaders.     We are elevating our  Performance Management process to Performance Engagement, with conversations with equal emphasis on what and how we deliver, as well as more frequent development conversations with colleagues. We believe these are  key moments for our leaders to engage our colleagues, encourage expected behaviors in support of our values, and help enable our colleagues to grow professionally.     We are leveraging  opportunities presented by several significant best-in-class technology investments to take our management of talent to the next level, improving the quality,  engagement, and retention of talent across the organization.   Driving  Inclusion Through a Diverse Workforce and Supplier Base     We continue to create a workplace that is welcoming, inclusive and respectful to all. Our world of diversity and inclusion extends beyond gender, race,  ethnicity, age and sexual orientation to include different thoughts, skills, experiences and backgrounds.     We are a signatory on the  CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. As part of this initiative, colleagues at more than 150 organizations  joined in a Day of Understanding to engage in dialogue around topics such as unconscious bias.     Our voluntary  colleague-driven Business Resources Groups, organized around a shared interest or common diversity dimension, along with our voluntary Inclusion Councils, have led enterprise-wide initiatives that have improved our disability equality score, our  family time off policies, and our benefits for all colleagues.     We launched a program to  recognize colleagues for advancing diversity and inclusion efforts and demonstrating how inclusive practices drive performance. Recipients of the awards are selected based on their consistent and strategic engagement in embracing our commitment to  inclusion.     26.1% spend with diverse-owned companies far exceeds the financial industry average.

Our transformation has been  underway for several years  it is being shaped by colleague feedback and focuses on three key areas:   Investing in Physical, Financial and Personal Well-Being     We continue to make  important investments in our colleagues. We announced an increase to our minimum salary commitment, for the third consecutive year, to $16/hour, as of May 2019.     We further enhanced several  key programs, including short-term and long-term disability programs, family and caregiver time off, and our colleague emergency assistance fund, Huntington Cares, to better help our colleagues when they need help most.     We have taken deliberate steps to ensure our health, welfare, and retirement programs are competitive, cost-effective and meet the needs of our diverse colleague base.

PROXY STATEMENT 
We are providing this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation by the board of directors of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, a Maryland corporation ("we", "us", "our", the "company" or "Huntington"), of proxies to be voted at our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders to be held on April 18, 2019, and at any adjournment. We are sending or making this proxy statement available to our shareholders on or about March 7, 2019. 
General Information about the Meeting 
Voting Procedures 
Holders of common stock at the close of business on February 14, 2019, are entitled to vote at the annual meeting. As of that date, there were 1,050,954,795 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Holders of our Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock are not entitled to vote. 
Each holder of common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter submitted at the annual meeting for each share of stock held of record at the close of business on February 14, 2019. The shares represented by a properly submitted proxy will be voted as directed provided we receive the proxy prior to or at the meeting. A properly executed proxy without specific voting instructions will be voted FOR Proposal 1 — Election of Directors, FOR Proposal 2 — Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and FOR Proposal 3 — Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation. A properly submitted proxy will also confer discretionary authority to vote on any other matter which may properly come before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting. 
You may vote by executing and returning your proxy card in the envelope provided, or by voting electronically over the internet or by telephone. Please refer to the proxy card for information on voting electronically. If you attend the meeting, you may vote in person and the proxy will not be used. 
We are not currently aware of any matters that may properly be presented other than those described in this proxy statement. If any matters not described in the proxy statement are properly presented at the meeting, the proxies will use their own judgment to determine how to vote your shares. If the meeting is adjourned, the proxies can vote your common stock at the adjournment as well, unless you have revoked your proxy instructions. 
Revoking Your Proxy 
If your common stock is held in street name, you must follow the instructions of your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your voting instructions. If you are a holder of record and wish to revoke your proxy instructions, you must advise our secretary in writing before the proxies vote your common stock at the meeting, deliver later dated proxy instructions, or attend the meeting and vote your shares in person. 
Expenses of Solicitation 
We will pay the expenses of this proxy solicitation, including the reasonable charges and expenses of brokerage firms and others for forwarding solicitation material to their customers who are beneficial owners. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail and via the Internet, our employees may also solicit proxies by telephone and in person. We have retained Morrow Sodali LLC, 470 West Ave., Stamford, CT 06902, to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $10,000 plus reimbursement of expenses. 
General Information about the Meeting 
Vote Required 
A quorum is required to conduct business at the annual meeting. Shareholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the annual meeting, present in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum. Proposal 1: a nominee for election to the board of directors at a meeting of shareholders at which a quorum is present will be elected only if the number of votes cast "for" such nominee's election exceeds the total number of votes cast "against" or affirmatively "withheld" as to such nominee's election; provided, however, that if, on either the date of the company's proxy statement for the meeting or on the date of the meeting, the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of all the votes cast at the meeting. Each of Proposals 2 and 3 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes cast on the matter by the holders of common stock at a meeting at which a quorum is present. 
Broker Voting 
Under the laws of Maryland, our state of incorporation, abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum, but are not counted as votes cast at the meeting. Broker non-votes occur when brokers who hold their customers' shares in street name submit proxies for such shares on some matters, but not others. Generally, this would occur when brokers have not received any instructions from their customers. In these cases, the brokers, as the holders of record, are permitted to vote on "routine" matters, which typically include the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm, but not on non-routine matters. Brokers are no longer permitted to vote on the election of directors or on matters related to executive compensation without instructions from their customers. Broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on the election of any director or the approval of the other matters described above since they are not counted as votes cast at the meeting, but votes affirmatively "withheld" from the election of any nominee will have the effect of a vote against that nominee's election as a director. 
The board of directors recommends that you vote FOR all of the director nominees and FOR
Proposals 2 and 3. 
Our board of directors believes that strong corporate governance is critical to Huntington's long-term success. The board regularly evaluates the size and composition of the board to ensure there is a well-rounded variety of skills, knowledge, background and experience represented, in alignment with our corporate strategy.

The board of directors held a total of 17 regular and special meetings in 2018. We believe that regular attendance at meetings and active and engaged participation is of utmost importance, and we expect our directors to attend the annual shareholders' meetings and all regularly scheduled board and committee meetings. During 2018 each director attended at least 95% of the meetings of the full board of directors and the committees on which he or she served. All directors then serving attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. 
Our board currently has seven standing committees: Audit, Community Development, Compensation, Executive, Nominating and Corporate Governance, Risk Oversight and Technology. During 2018, the board of directors reevaluated its committee structure in light of the company's priorities and the results of the annual board self-assessment. As a result of the evaluation, the board dissolved the Significant Event Committee and the Huntington Investment Company Oversight Committee. The primary responsibilities of the Significant Event Committee will be handled by the board and its committees. The Technology Committee will continue to oversee cyber information and security risk management and incident response programs. The board determined that the Huntington Investment Company Oversight Committee had fulfilled its purpose and that ongoing oversight of the Huntington Investment Company was best managed at this time by the Huntington Investment Company board of directors and management. As needed or determined appropriate, the board of directors may establish an ad hoc committee. 
As further discussed under "Independence of Directors", below, the board of directors has determined that each member of the Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees, as well as the Community Development, Risk Oversight and Technology Committees, is independent as the term is defined in the Nasdaq Stock Market Marketplace Rules. 
Corporate Governance 
All board members have access to all committee reports and materials. In addition, all board members are welcome to attend any meetings of the standing committees. Each standing committee has a separate written charter. Current copies of the committee charters are posted on the Investor Relations pages of our website at www.huntington.com. Information about the board's standing committees, including the committee members and a brief review of each committee's responsibilities, is set forth below.

  Members:     Richard W. Neu  (Chair)   Ann B. (Tanny) Crane   Gina D.  France     Meetings Held in 2018:  19     (includes 6 held jointly with the   Risk Oversight Committee)      The Audit Committees duties and responsibilities are to:     oversee the integrity of the consolidated financial statements, including policies, procedures, and practices regarding the preparation of financial statements, the financial  reporting process, disclosures and internal control over financial reporting;     oversee the internal audit  division; the independent registered public accounting firms qualifications, performance and independence; and     oversee compliance with our  Financial Code of Ethics for the chief executive officer and senior financial officers; compliance with corporate securities trading policies; compliance with legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the companys financial statements;  and financial risk exposures.   While the Audit Committee has the duties and  responsibilities described above and as set forth in its charter, our management is responsible for the internal controls and the financial reporting process, and the independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an  independent audit of our financial statements and our internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and issuing a report thereon.

Report of the Audit Committee 
The primary responsibility of the Audit Committee is to oversee the integrity of Huntington's consolidated financial statements. In carrying out its duties, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 with Huntington management and with Huntington's independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. This discussion included the selection, application and disclosure of critical accounting policies, as well as the firm's views on fraud risks and how it demonstrates its independence and skepticism. The Audit Committee has also reviewed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP its judgment as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of Huntington's accounting principles and such other matters required to be discussed under auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's (PCAOB's) Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communication with Audit Committees. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by the PCAOB in Rule 3526 regarding PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP its independence from Huntington. Based on this review and discussion, and a review of the services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during 2018, the Audit Committee believes that the services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in 2018 are compatible with, and do not impair, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's independence. 
Based on these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Huntington's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 which was filed with the SEC on February 15, 2019.

Corporate Governance 
Compensation Governance 
The Compensation Committee has the resources and authority appropriate to discharge its duties and responsibilities. This includes authority to select, retain, oversee, terminate and approve fees and other retention terms of advisors, including legal counsel and other advisors. The Compensation Committee also works with other board committees and with senior management in fulfilling its responsibilities. 
Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC, an independent consulting firm, to provide advisory services related to executive and director compensation. The individual consultant managing the relationship with Huntington (the compensation consultant) reports directly to the Compensation Committee, and is evaluated by the Compensation Committee on an annual basis. 
The compensation consultant is available as needed for expert guidance and support, provides updates on emerging trends and best practices, and regularly attends meetings of the Compensation Committee. Services provided by the compensation consultant during 2018 included reviewing our selected peer group, benchmarking compensation and performance, and establishing total compensation guidelines, including targets for short and long-term incentive plans, and modeling payouts under various performance scenarios. During 2018 the compensation consultant did not provide any services other than advice and recommendations related to executive and director compensation. 
The Compensation Committee has received representations from the compensation consultant with respect to independence, including with respect to: the fees received by the consulting firm from Huntington as a percentage of total revenue of the consulting firm; the policies or procedures maintained by the consulting firm designed to prevent a conflict of interest; any business or personal relationship between the compensation consultant and any Compensation Committee member; any business or personal relationship between the compensation consultant and executive officers of Huntington; and any Huntington stock owned by the compensation consultant. Based on review of these representations and the services provided by the compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee has determined that the compensation consultant is independent and that the consultant's work has not created any conflicts of interest. 
Procedures for Determining Executive Compensation 
Although the Compensation Committee makes independent determinations on all matters related to compensation of executive officers, certain members of management are requested to attend committee meetings and provide input to the Compensation Committee. Input may be sought from the chief executive officer, Human Resources, Finance and Risk Management colleagues and others as needed to ensure the Compensation Committee has the information and perspective it needs to carry out its duties. In particular, the Compensation Committee will seek input from the chief executive officer on matters relating to strategic objectives, company performance goals and input on his assessment of the other executive officers. The chief human resources officer and representatives of Human Resources work with the chair of the Compensation Committee to ensure he or she has the background, information and data needed to facilitate meetings. The Committee also receives updates from the chief risk officer and chief financial officer throughout the year as appropriate. 
The Compensation Committee meets with representatives of the Audit Committee as appropriate in making determinations. The Audit Committee chair is consulted when the Compensation Committee certifies company performance against the established incentive plan performance goals. 
The Compensation Committee may delegate all or a portion of its duties and responsibilities to a subcommittee of the Compensation Committee, or in accordance with the terms of a particular compensation plan, to a management committee. The Compensation Committee delegates some responsibilities to management to assist in development of design 
Corporate Governance considerations, with permission to work with the Committee's compensation consultant to develop proposals for the Committee's consideration. The Compensation Committee may not, however, delegate the determination of compensation for executive officers to management. From time to time, the Compensation Committee may obtain the approval of the board of directors with respect to certain executive and director compensation matters. 
The Compensation Committee takes risk into account when determining compensation and supports an executive compensation philosophy that balances risk and reward with a mix of base pay, short-term incentives and long-term incentives, with greater emphasis on long-term incentives. The Compensation Committee's role in the oversight of incentive compensation risk is discussed under "The Board's Role in Risk Oversight" below. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation. We have no compensation committee interlocks. In addition, no member of the Compensation Committee has served as one of our officers or employees. 
Report of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this proxy statement. Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in Huntington's proxy statement for its 2019 annual meeting of shareholders.

Shareholders who wish to send communications to the board of directors may do so via the Board of Directors page in the About Us section of Huntington's website at www.huntington.com. 
Shareholder Outreach and Engagement 
We value the views of our investors and welcome feedback from them. Our standard outreach and engagement practice is to have conversations about corporate governance and executive compensation matters with our largest investors biannually. During 2018, we held conversations with investors collectively holding greater than 17% of our outstanding common stock. The board and management have gained valuable insight from these interactions and will continue to seek shareholder input. 
Corporate Governance 
Director Nomination and Board Evaluation 
Our board of directors is committed to maintaining a well-rounded and effective board aligned with the company's business strategy. 
The board believes that one of its most important responsibilities is identifying, evaluating and selecting candidates for the board. Board refreshment is viewed as a significant factor in overall board effectiveness and to assure alignment with our long-term strategy. At least annually the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assesses the size of the board and reviews the composition of the board to assure that the appropriate knowledge, skills and experience are represented, in the Committee's judgment. The board also believes that candid and thorough self-assessment is necessary to ensure that the board and board committees are productively and efficiently fulfilling their duties. 
The board of directors is committed to board refreshment. Five new independent directors have joined our board since the 2016 annual meeting, and a new candidate has been nominated for election at this annual meeting ensuring fresh perspectives. The board also benefits from directors having a range of tenures as this provides continuity and ensures institutional knowledge. The tenures of our current board members range from two years to 15 years (as of the date of this annual meeting). 
Selection of Director Nominees 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee thoroughly reviews the qualifications of potential director candidates and makes recommendations to the full board. Each of the director nominees meets the standards listed below. Diversity is a priority and the board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee actively seek candidates who possess varied gender, race, ethnicity, age, background and other attributes. The board believes that board membership should reflect the diversity of the markets in which we do business. From time-to-time the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will identify additional selection criteria for board membership, taking into consideration the company's business strategy, the business environment and current board composition.

Our bylaws provide that no person shall be nominated or elected a director of the company after having attained the age of 72 years, unless the board of directors, or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, first determines that this age restriction shall not apply to a particular individual. We added this exception to the age limit in 2017 to enhance our ability 
Corporate Governance to maintain a well-rounded board of directors with the appropriate skills, and to not unduly limit the service of highly qualified individuals. In accordance with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, any determination that the age restriction shall not be applicable to any person shall be made only after consideration of whether such person brings a specific expertise to the board; has valuable industry specific knowledge and experience; holds unique relationships with third parties, such as regulators; has capacity to devote time to special projects; has developed significant institutional knowledge; or possesses some other attributes or qualifications deemed essential by the board of directors, or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Any determination that the age restriction shall not apply shall be made not more than three times with respect to any one person. 
Shareholders may recommend director candidates for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee by sending a written notice to the Secretary at Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, Huntington Center, 41 South High Street, Columbus, Ohio 43287. The notice should indicate the name, age, and address of the person recommended, the person's principal occupation or employment for the last five years, other public company boards on which the person serves, whether the person would qualify as independent as the term is defined under the Marketplace Rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, and the class and number of shares of Huntington securities owned by the person. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may require additional information to determine the qualifications of the person recommended. The notice should also state the name and address of, and the class and number of shares of our securities owned by, the person or persons making the recommendation. There have been no material changes to the shareholder recommendation process since we last disclosed this item. 
Regular Self-Assessment 
Each year, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the self-assessment process for the board and its committees. This self-assessment is a necessary process in ensuring that the board and its committees are best equipped to create value for the company's shareholders. Although the specific method or methods of evaluation may vary, the process is designed to ensure that board members have the opportunity to speak openly and candidly. Periodically, the board will engage an experienced third party to facilitate the board's self-assessment and assessments of individual directors. 
In addition to participating in the annual self-assessment process, directors are encouraged to raise any topics related to board performance and effectiveness at any time with the lead director, the chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the chair of an applicable committee, the chairman of the board, or with the board, as appropriate. 
The following sets forth the process for the board's 2018 self-assessment: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  One-on-One Discussions. Prior to the board's and committees' full evaluation, the lead director, who also serves as the chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, held individual discussions with each director to obtain their candid feedback  on board operations, functioning and performance, among other things.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  Committee Discussions. Each committee conducted its own self-assessment on topics applicable to the  committee. Committee self-assessments were facilitated by each committee's chair.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  Reporting to the board. Following the  one-on-one discussions, the lead director provided a summary of those discussions to the independent directors during an executive session of the board.   
[END TABLE]

Nominees for Election at the 2019 Annual Meeting 
After consideration of the current composition of the board, the results of the annual self-assessment and the company's strategic objectives and goals, the board proposes the election of 13 directors, including the 12 directors currently serving, at the 2019 annual meeting. The board has nominated Katherine M. A. (Allie) Kline for election by shareholders for the first time. Ms. Kline possesses significant digital media and strategic marketing expertise. She will be appointed to serve on the Technology Committee; her digital and marketing background will be valuable to the board with respect to oversight of marketing technology and with a focus on digital capabilities and delivery. Ms. Kline was recommended for consideration by a third-party consulting firm engaged to assist the board of directors in selecting qualified candidates. The nominees for director also include Steven G. Elliott, who attained age 72 since the 2018 Annual Meeting. The board has determined to waive the age limit for Mr. Elliott and proposes the reelection of Mr. Elliott at the 2019 Annual Meeting. This decision was based on Mr. Elliott's substantial financial services industry and risk management expertise as well as the institutional knowledge he has accumulated through oversight of the company's risk management program as chair of the Risk Oversight Committee since 2011. See Election of Directors below for additional information about all of the nominees. 
Corporate Governance 
Skills, Knowledge, Experience and Perspectives 
Our nominees for director embody a well-rounded variety of skills, knowledge, background and experience. The average tenure of our current directors is six years (as of the 2019 annual meeting). The director nominees range in age from 47 to 72 years. 
A graphic summary of the qualifications of our director nominees is presented below. 
Corporate Governance 
A graphic presentation of the characteristics of our director nominees, including tenure, age, gender and independence, is presented below. 
Independence of Directors 
Our board of directors and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee have reviewed and evaluated transactions and relationships with board members and the new nominee to determine the independence of each. The board of directors does not believe that any of its non-employee members (including the new nominee) has relationships with us that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as director. Further, the board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee have determined that all of the board's members and nominees, with the exclusion of the CEO, are "independent directors" as the term is defined in the Nasdaq Stock Market Marketplace Rules. The directors determined to be independent under this definition are: Lizabeth Ardisana, Ann B. (Tanny) Crane, Robert S. Cubbin, Steven G. Elliott, Gina D. France, J. Michael Hochschwender, John C. (Chris) Inglis, Peter J. Kight, Richard W. Neu, David L. Porteous and Kathleen H. Ransier. Nominee Katherine M. A. (Allie) Kline has also been determined to be independent under this definition. In addition, former directors Michael J. Endres, Jonathan A. Levy, and Eddie R. Munson, who served on the board until April 19, 2018 were also determined to be independent. The board of directors has also determined that each member of the Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees is independent under such definition and that the members of the Audit Committee are independent under the additional, more stringent requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market applicable to audit committee members. 
In making the independence determinations for each of the directors, the board took into consideration the transactions disclosed in this proxy statement under "Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons" below. In addition, the board of directors considered that the directors and their family members are customers of our affiliated financial 
Corporate Governance and lending institutions. Many of the directors have one or more transactions, relationships or arrangements where Huntington's affiliated financial and lending institutions, in the ordinary course of business, act as depository of funds, lender or trustee, or provide similar services. Directors may also be affiliated with entities which are customers of our affiliated financial and lending institutions and which enter into transactions with such affiliates in the ordinary course of business. The board also considered charitable donations to organizations in which directors have an interest, and determined them to be immaterial. 
The Board's Leadership Structure 
Our chief executive officer, Stephen D. Steinour, serves as chairman of the board. Director David L. Porteous has served as independent lead director since the board established the role in 2007. To ensure independent leadership, the board has determined that there will be a lead director appointed whenever the positions of chairman and chief executive officer are combined. Each year the board evaluates its leadership and its leadership structure in light of current and anticipated future circumstances and believes that having a combined chief executive officer and chairman along with a strong independent lead director provides an efficient and effective arrangement for Huntington. The board has also considered our leadership structure in light of the company's size, the nature of its business, the regulatory framework in which it operates, and its peers and determined that the board's leadership structure is appropriate for our company at this time.

[END TABLE]
Mr. Porteous performs these duties and provides leadership in numerous additional ways. He is available to the chief executive officer and frequently acts as a sounding board for a variety of matters. He meets regularly with Huntington's regulators. He promotes good governance and fosters dialogue among the directors and between the board and management. Mr. Porteous also takes an active role in outreach efforts with various constituents, including Huntington employees. He regularly engages with the employees and acts as a liaison between employees and the board. The board believes that having an independent lead director performing these duties effectively complements and counterbalances the role of the combined chairman / chief executive officer. 
Corporate Governance 
In addition to having an engaged and independent lead director, additional factors contribute to the board's comfort with Mr. Steinour serving in the combined roles of chairman and chief executive officer. These factors include our strong corporate governance practices, our board's independence, and the accountability of the chief executive officer to the board. Executive sessions, excluding the chairman and chief executive officer, are held in conjunction with regularly scheduled board meetings at least twice each year to ensure open dialogue with the lead director. Moreover, there is regular reporting by senior management to the board of directors as further described under "The Board's Role in Risk Oversight" below. 
The interaction of the roles of our chairman / chief executive officer and our independent lead director is reflected in the table below.

The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The board of directors has established an aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite and requires risks to be managed through a comprehensive, coordinated and effective governance and management structure. 
We rely on comprehensive risk management processes to identify, measure, monitor, control and report risks and to aggregate risks across the enterprise. This system enables the board to establish a mutual understanding with management of the effectiveness of the company's risk management practices and capabilities, to review the company's risk exposure, and to elevate certain key risks for discussion at the board level. 
Our Risk Governance and Risk Appetite Framework (the Framework) serves as the foundation for consistent and effective risk management. It outlines the seven types of risk that the company faces: compliance risk; credit risk; operational risk; liquidity risk; market risk; reputation risk; and strategic risk. It describes components of our risk management approach, including our risk appetite and risk management processes, with a focus on the role of all colleagues in managing risk. The Framework also defines the aggregate risk levels and types of risk our board and management believe appropriate to achieve the company's strategic objectives and business plans. 
While the board has three board committees that primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk appetite and the monitoring of our risk profile — the Risk Oversight Committee, Audit Committee and the Technology Committee — the full board is engaged in discussing all risks. All standing board committees report their deliberations and actions at each full board meeting. Noteworthy issues from each committee agenda are called to the attention of the full board in advance. In addition, all directors have access to information provided to each committee, and all scheduled committee meetings are open to all directors. The directors regularly communicate directly with members of senior management, and the board and committees regularly meet in executive session without management present. 
Corporate Governance 
The Critical Role of Board Committees 
All members of the board of directors are also members of The Huntington National Bank's board of directors, and each committee of the board also functions as the committee of The Huntington National Bank's board. 
The Risk Oversight Committee assists the board of directors in overseeing the company's enterprise-wide risk management function consistent with its strategy and risk appetite, including oversight of its policies, and risk control infrastructure for compliance risk, credit risk, operational risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, market risk, reputation risk, and strategic risk; management's establishment and operation of the Framework, including review and approval of the Framework and of the Company's risk appetite metrics; the risk management organization including the chief risk officer and risk management budget; approval and monitoring of the company's capital position and plan supporting our overall aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile; the risk governance structure; compliance with applicable laws and regulations; and determining adherence to the board's stated risk appetite. This Committee also oversees our capital management and planning process, and ensures that the amount and quality of capital are adequate in relation to expected and unexpected risks and that our capital levels exceed "well-capitalized" requirements. The Risk Oversight Committee regularly receives reports directly from the chief risk officer. 
The Audit Committee assists the board in overseeing the integrity of the consolidated financial statements, including policies, procedures, and practices regarding the preparation of financial statements, the financial reporting process, disclosures, and internal control over financial reporting; the internal audit department and the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence; compliance with our Financial Code of Ethics for the chief executive officer and senior financial officers; compliance with corporate securities trading policies; compliance with legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the company's financial statements; and financial risk exposures. The chief internal auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee. 
The Risk Oversight and Audit Committees routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management. On a regular basis, the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both. The Audit Committee regularly meets in executive session with the independent registered public accounting firm. 
The Technology Committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to all technology and innovation strategies and plans developed by management, information and cyber security risk management program, and the third-party risk management program. 
Further, through its Compensation Committee, the board of directors seeks to ensure that compensation plans are designed and administered to drive sustainable, long-term results in an effective and ethical manner, with a commitment to Do the Right Thing for customers, colleagues, shareholders and communities, while not exposing the organization to material risks. The Compensation Committee reviews and evaluates the company's compensation policies and practices and the relationship among risk, risk management and compensation to ensure that incentive compensation practices appropriately balance risk and financial results, incentives do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking or expose the company to imprudent risks, the incentive programs are compatible with effective controls and risk management, incentive programs are supported by strong corporate governance and the compensation policies are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company. The Compensation Committee meets regularly with members of senior management, including the chief risk officer and the chief financial officer. The Compensation Committee also supports the board of directors with succession planning for key management positions. 
The Community Development Committee promotes the company's mission of local involvement and leadership in the communities where the company is located and where its colleagues work. The committee will consider matters relating to community development and involvement, philanthropy, government affairs, fair and responsible lending, and inclusion. 
Corporate Governance 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the company's commitment to its environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues and the company's ESG practices and activities strategy. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee receives periodic updates from management with respect to ESG issues. 
The role of each of the board committees is further described under "Board Meetings and Committee Information" above. 
Company Strategy and Leadership 
The full board of directors focuses direct oversight on risks related to company strategy and leadership. Our aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite is an integral part of our strategy and strategic planning process. The board meets frequently with senior management and is devoted to review of strategic priorities. In addition, the CEO reserves time at the beginning of every board meeting to discuss priorities and initiatives. Periodically, special board sessions are held to discuss and analyze specific possible risk scenarios, such as cybersecurity incidents. 
The full board of directors oversees succession planning for the positions of the CEO and other members of the executive leadership team. As selecting and appointing qualified executive leadership for the company is a priority for the board of directors, succession planning is discussed frequently. At least annually, the CEO and the chief human resources officer review with the board the succession plans in place for executive leadership. Management also maintains succession plans for the positions reporting to the executive leadership team. 
Continual Director Education 
Huntington provides robust onboarding for new directors and ongoing comprehensive education and training for all board members on key matters to foster board effectiveness. In addition, all board members are encouraged to participate in relevant external director education opportunities. 
Director onboarding involves a combination of written materials, oral presentations and meetings with members of the board and management. Among the topics covered during onboarding are company history, strategy, revenue streams, risks, safety and soundness and corporate governance. 
In-house educational sessions facilitated by management are provided to all directors throughout the year with a focus on topics specific to the company and the financial services industry. Continuing director education may be provided before, during or after board and committee meetings, and as standalone information sessions outside of meetings. Subjects covered include, among others: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) issues;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Fair lending responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Avoidance of UDAAP (Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cyber risks and breaches; and

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Legal, regulatory and supervisory requirements and trends applicable to Huntington.  
[END TABLE]
Additional topics may be included as appropriate, related to complex products, services or lines of business that have the potential to significantly impact the company and other topics as identified by the board of directors or executive management from time-to-time. External experts and facilitators are also invited to attend board or committee meetings to discuss leading practices, or issues germane to Huntington, the financial services industry or public companies in general. Outside experts bring an array of experience and perspectives and foster dialogue among board members on relevant topics. The outside experts may also be invited to attend a board dinner the evening before the board meeting where they may engage informally with the directors. 
Corporate Governance 
Huntington periodically provides board members with external director education opportunities covering a range of issues facing the board to assist directors in staying abreast of the latest developments. Insights gained from external continuing education programs are shared with the full board of directors. In 2018, all eleven of the non-employee directors attended director education conferences or seminars, totaling approximately 286 hours of instruction. 
Risk Assessment of Incentive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee oversees the company's compensation policies and practices and the relationship among risk, risk management and compensation. The Compensation Committee's oversight is supported by the Incentive Compensation Oversight Committee (the "Oversight Committee"), an executive level management committee. The Oversight Committee consists of senior management from Human Resources, Finance, Legal, Credit Administration, and Risk Management and is co-chaired by the chief human resources officer and the chief risk officer. The Oversight Committee reports directly to the Compensation Committee. 
Under the direction of the Oversight Committee, Huntington performs an annual risk assessment of each incentive plan. The review includes economic analysis as well as evaluation of plan design features, risk balancing mechanisms and governance policies and practices, and adherence to incentive compensation guiding principles developed by the Oversight Committee. A key tool for managing incentive compensation risk is an annual enterprise-level significant risk events review process overseen by the chief risk officer and the chief credit officer. This year-end significant risk events review may result in incentive payment adjustments where warranted. 
Huntington uses a variety of plan design features to balance risk and rewards. Governance policies and practices also play an important role in managing incentive plan risk. We regularly monitor our incentive compensation arrangements for employees at all levels and strive to enhance our risk review in light of developing best practices and regulatory guidance. The Compensation Committee receives in-depth reviews of select business unit incentive plans chosen by the committee or recommended by management.

[END TABLE]
For executive officers, our compensation philosophy balances risk and reward with a mix of base pay, short-term incentives and long-term incentives, with greater emphasis on long-term incentives. We maintain stock ownership guidelines for executives and impose a "hold until retirement" requirement of up to 50% of the net shares. See "Compensation of Executive Officers" below for detail about our executive compensation philosophy and programs. 
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the board of directors oversees our Related Party Transactions Review Policy, referred to as the Policy. This written Policy covers "related party transactions", including any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, either currently proposed or existing since the beginning of the last fiscal year in which we were or will be a participant, involving an amount exceeding $120,000 and in which a director, nominee for director, executive officer or his or her immediate family member 
Corporate Governance has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. The Policy requires our senior management and directors to notify the general counsel of any existing or potential "related party transactions." Our general counsel reviews each reported transaction, arrangement or relationship that constitutes a "related party transaction" with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines whether or not "related party transactions" are fair and reasonable for us. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also determines whether any "related party transaction" in which a director has an interest impairs the director's independence. Approved "related party transactions" are subject to on-going review by our management on at least an annual basis. Loans to directors and executive officers and their related interests made and approved pursuant to the terms of Federal Reserve Board Regulation O are deemed to be approved under this Policy. Any of these loans that become subject to specific disclosure in our annual proxy statement are reviewed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee at that time. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would also consider and review any transactions with a shareholder having beneficial ownership of more than 5% of Huntington's voting securities in accordance with the Policy. 
Indebtedness of Management. Many of our directors and executive officers and their immediate family members are customers of our affiliated financial and lending institutions in the ordinary course of business. In addition, our directors and executive officers also may be affiliated with entities which are customers of our affiliated financial and lending institutions in the ordinary course of business. Loan transactions with directors, executive officers and their immediate family members and affiliates have been made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other customers otherwise not affiliated with us. Such loans also have not involved more than the normal risk of collectability or presented other unfavorable features. 
Certain Other Transactions. Paul McMahon, who is the son-in-law of director David L. Porteous, has been employed by The Huntington National Bank since 2006 and currently serves as a Commercial Portfolio Manager — Team Lead in the Commercial Banking Department. Mr. McMahon serves in a non-executive capacity four reporting levels below the Commercial Banking Director. He is one of approximately 16,000 employees and is compensated in accordance with the employment compensation practices and policies applicable to all employees with equivalent qualifications and responsibilities in similar positions. For 2018, Mr. McMahon received base salary and incentive compensation totaling approximately $180,000, as well as benefits generally available to all employees. 
Compensation of Directors 
Our compensation philosophy for the board of directors is to provide a compensation arrangement to outside directors that reflects the significant time commitment and substantial contributions the directors are expected to make to the value creation and governance of Huntington. 
The compensation levels and structure for directors are designed, with the input of the independent compensation consultant, to enable us to attract and retain high caliber talent at a national level, and also to align the directors' interests with those of the shareholders. Our compensation program for non-employee directors is a combination of cash and equity. The CEO does not receive compensation for his service as director. 
Fees Payable in Cash. Each non-employee director earns an annual retainer of $45,000. We pay an additional annual retainer of $65,000 to the lead director, and $20,000 to the chairs of all standing board committees. We pay meeting fees at the standard rate of $2,000 for each board of directors or committee meeting the director attends and $1,000 for each teleconference board of directors or committee meeting in which the director participates. In addition, we pay directors fees of $2,000 per day in the event Huntington requests a director to attend or participate in an event or meeting, in person, in his or her capacity as a director. All fees are payable quarterly. Retainer fees are payable in four equal quarterly installments. A 
Corporate Governance director may defer all or a portion of the cash compensation payable to the director if he or she elects to participate in the Director Deferred Compensation Plan. 
Equity Compensation. To align the interests of directors with shareholders, a meaningful portion of director compensation is paid in equity that is subject to holding requirements. The Compensation Committee considers equity grants for non-employee directors on an annual basis, and the form and amounts of any equity grants for directors are determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Since 2006, the equity grants for directors have been in the form of deferred stock units which are vested upon grant but not released to the director until six months following separation of service. Based on market data and a peer review facilitated by the independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee approved a deferred stock award for each director having a value of $105,000, effective May 1, 2018. Divided by the stock price of $14.81 on the date of grant, each director was awarded 7,089 deferred stock units, rounded down to the nearest whole share. The Compensation Committee awarded an additional $20,000 grant value to the chairpersons of the Audit, Compensation and Risk Oversight Committees which converted to an additional 1,351 deferred stock units. 
In addition to the mandated holding of shares imposed by the deferred stock units, the Compensation Committee has established a minimum ownership level guideline for directors based on five times the annual retainer fee (excluding committee chairmanship retainers). Based on the retainer fee and the fair market value of our common stock on the date the guidelines were established, the guideline for directors was set at 40,603 shares. Directors have five years to meet the minimum guidelines. Each director who has served at least five years has met the guidelines.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our officers, directors, and persons who are beneficial owners of more than ten percent of Huntington common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Reporting persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed by them. To the best of our knowledge, and following a review of the copies of Section 16(a) forms received, we believe that during 2018 all filing requirements applicable for reporting persons were met.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance that creates long-term shareholder value. 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes Huntington's executive compensation program for 2018 for our CEO and the additional executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table (the "named executive officers" or "NEOs"). Our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance that creates long-term shareholder value. The Compensation Committee has developed a straightforward and balanced compensation program for executives that incorporates many key compensation and governance practices.

Compensation of Executive Officers 
Overview 
The Compensation Committee provides independent oversight of our executive compensation and has engaged an independent compensation consultant, Pearl Meyer & Partners LLC, to provide advice with respect to the amount and form of executive compensation. 
Long-Term Focus. With long-term incentives comprising the most significant portion of compensation and consisting primarily of performance-based awards (75% – 80% of annual equity awards), combined with our robust stock ownership and holding requirements, Huntington's compensation program for executives is exceptionally long-term focused and aligned with interests of our shareholders. 
The Committee also oversees the company's broader compensation policies and practices to assure that these are consistent with our values and reinforce our culture and thus support our goal of producing top-tier performance and long-term value. 
Risk Management Culture. The Committee's oversight responsibility includes the relationship among risk takers, risk management and compensation. We regularly monitor our incentive arrangements for colleagues at all levels and strive to enhance incentive risk management in light of developing best practices and regulatory guidance. Risk assessment of incentive compensation is discussed in greater detail above under "The Board's Role in Risk Oversight". 
We have a legacy of strong customer service and we require that all of our colleagues follow both the letter and intent of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Moreover, Huntington maintains a robust Recoupment and Clawback Policy which is a tool for recovery of incentive compensation in appropriate situations. Colleagues at all levels in the organization are subject to this policy. Incentive compensation subject to possible clawback or recoupment includes any cash incentive or equity compensation, vested or unvested. In general, situations that trigger a review under this policy involve behaviors or actions outside the bounds of the company's overall risk appetite and governance structure. The Committee would make any compensation recoupment or clawback determination with respect to executive officers. Additional detail about the Recoupment and Clawback Policy can be found later in this discussion. 
The Importance of Stock Ownership. Huntington is committed to a culture of stock ownership which aligns management's interests with those of shareholders. The requirement to own Huntington common stock is a critical foundation of our executive compensation philosophy. Mr. Steinour's commitment to this principle, and to the company, is evidenced by his significant personal investment in Huntington. Since joining Huntington in January 2009, Mr. Steinour has purchased over 1.63 million shares of Huntington common stock in open market transactions. As of January 31, 2019, Mr. Steinour directly and indirectly owned shares of Huntington common stock equal to approximately 68X his salary, significantly exceeding our industry-leading practice 10X salary ownership guideline for the CEO. Each other executive officer has an ownership guideline ranging from 2X to 3X salary. In addition, executive officers are subject to a holding requirement equal to 50% of net shares received upon the exercise of a stock option or upon the release of full value awards. This amount of shares must be held until retirement or other departure from the company. Our directors and colleagues collectively represent our seventh largest shareholder. See additional detail under "Stock Ownership & Holding Requirements" later in this discussion. 
Compensation of Executive Officers 
Consideration of "Say-on-Pay" / Shareholder Outreach. We are pleased that more than 96% of the votes cast for our "say-on-pay" advisory vote at our 2018 annual meeting and 95% or more of votes cast at each annual meeting since 2013 were in favor of our executive compensation programs. Nevertheless, we strive to continually strengthen our compensation practices based on our philosophy, market best practices and feedback received from shareholders. During 2018, we continued our biannual shareholder outreach, extending invitations to investors collectively owning approximately 54% of our outstanding common stock. We held conversations with shareholders owning in the aggregate greater than 17% of our outstanding common stock. Based on the "say-on-pay" votes and other feedback, the Compensation Committee maintained the essential design of our compensation program for 2018. We did adjust certain measures and weightings to ensure alignment between our pay and performance. We will continue to monitor emerging trends and best practices and seek ways to improve our compensation programs.

Key Highlights 
2018 — Another Year of Strong Performance. In 2018 we reported record net income for the fourth consecutive year. Importantly, we achieved all five of our long-term financial goals on a full-year GAAP basis in 2018, two years ahead of schedule. Our strong financial performance also enabled us to increase our capital return to our shareholders in 2018. Last year marked the eighth consecutive year of an increased cash dividend. Coupling the increased dividend payout with $939 million of share repurchases during the year, we returned nearly $1.5 billion to our shareholders, which represented a total payout ratio of 112% of our 2018 earnings.

Our Purpose and Our Strategy. We are focused on driving sustained, long-term financial performance for our shareholders. The best way to achieve our long-term financial goals and generate sustainable, through-the-cycle returns is to fulfill our purpose to make people's lives better, help businesses thrive, and strengthen the communities we serve. 
During 2018 we continued to execute our strategic plan, which was launched in 2009 and re-set in 2014 and again in 2018. While we regularly make tactical adjustments, the plan has remained built around the same core goals: increase our market share and increase our share of wallet of consumers and businesses. Our strategic plan significantly advanced the company's financial performance and competitive positioning, and established Huntington as an industry leader in customer experience. 
As a result of the expectation that Huntington would achieve all five of its long-term financial goals in 2018, two years ahead of schedule, as well as the significant amount of technological innovation occurring in the financial services industry, the board decided to accelerate the strategic planning process originally planned for 2020 to 2018. In the 2018 strategic planning process, our primary theme was continuing to differentiate Huntington based on superior customer experience. We focused on extending our customer experience advantage across our businesses to improve customer acquisition, reduce attrition and deepen relationships with our customers. We remain focused on deepening relationships through our optimal customer relationship strategy as there is still significant opportunity within our now much larger customer base. Another important theme is to build on our local advantage by further leveraging our regional management, our local presence and our deep ties within the communities we serve. 
See the Proxy Statement Summary above for additional information about our strategy.

Consistent with Huntington's "pay for performance" philosophy, the Compensation Committee's 2018 compensation program for executive officers emphasized performance-based compensation designed to drive profitable growth and returns within our aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile while doing the right thing for our customers, colleagues, shareholders and communities. 
Huntington's 2018 performance against the Management Incentive Plan (MIP) metrics was 122.6% of target. The named executive officers earned annual incentive awards ranging from 117% to 128% of target. Executive officers also received long-term incentive awards in 2018 comprised of performance stock units ("PSUs"), restricted stock units ("RSUs") and stock options.

2018 Pay Mix 
The targeted direct compensation mix, below, illustrates the emphasis on variable, at-risk incentive-based compensation. Fixed compensation consists of base salaries. Variable, performance-based compensation includes our annual incentive payouts in cash and RSUs, the target value of PSUs and the grant date fair value of stock options and RSUs. 
Determination of Compensation 
Philosophy and Decision-Making Process 
We provide a balanced and straightforward total compensation package, which includes both fixed and variable, performance-based elements. The use of both short-term and long-term incentives ensures that the ultimate compensation delivered is dependent upon achievement of our annual business goals, as well as delivering long-term shareholder value. Our performance and evaluation process considers company, business segment and individual performance, as well as performance relative to industry peers. Our target pay levels are designed to be competitive with market practice. Since a majority of our pay is variable and based on performance, our actual pay positioning will vary appropriately to reflect our performance. 
Compensation of Executive Officers 
While overall compensation policies generally apply to all executives, we recognize the need to differentiate compensation by individual, reflecting on his or her role, performance, experience and expected contributions. Base salaries and incentive targets are the primary means for differentiating compensation opportunities to reflect executive role and scope of responsibility. For example, Mr. Steinour has a higher base salary and higher potential incentive award opportunities due to his responsibilities as CEO. He is also held to a higher stock ownership guideline, reflecting his increased stake in our performance. 
The Compensation Committee develops and approves our executive compensation with input from our management and the independent compensation consultant. Services provided by the compensation consultant during 2018 included review of our selected peer group, benchmarking compensation and performance, and establishing total compensation guidelines, including targets for short and long-term incentive plans, and modeling payouts under various performance scenarios. Our management provides information and may make recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to the amount and form of executive compensation. In addition, our CEO and CFO make recommendations to the Compensation Committee when it sets specific financial measures and goals for determining incentive compensation. Our CEO provides input and makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding the performance and compensation of his direct reports, which include the NEOs. The CEO consults in advance with the chairs of the respective board committees regarding recommendations for key control positions. The CEO does not make recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding his own compensation, other than requests in prior years that the Compensation Committee defer consideration of a base salary increase for him. From time to time, the Compensation Committee consults with other committees of the board and may obtain the approval of the full board of directors with respect to certain executive and director compensation matters. For additional detail, see "Procedures for Determining Executive Compensation" in the Corporate Governance section above.

Market Referencing 
The Compensation Committee regularly reviews peer and industry information concerning levels of compensation and performance as a competitive frame of reference. The Compensation Committee uses this information and analysis as a benchmarking reference for setting pay opportunities and making pay decisions, such as changes to base salaries, annual incentive awards and long-term incentive grants. A key source of information is a peer group of regional banks similar to Huntington in terms of size and business model. The table below lists the peer banks approved by the Compensation Committee for 2018.

The peer banks are chosen each year using an objective process recommended by the independent compensation consultant and approved by the Compensation Committee. The process began with the selection of U.S. based publicly traded commercial banks considering asset size as of December 31, 2017. A number of banks with relevant asset size were eliminated due to a business model which included one or more of: international process or focus, a focus on different services, or off-shore headquarters. The resulting group was the same as in 2017 and consisted of ten bank holding companies; seven larger and three smaller, positioning Huntington between the 25th and the 50th percentile for asset size. The Compensation Committee chose the ten peers to represent the most appropriate market comparators for Huntington in terms of industry and size. The independent compensation consultant also provided the Compensation Committee with industry surveys as appropriate to supplement the peer group data. When using survey data, the information was reflective of Huntington's size and industry. This included utilizing size adjusted comparisons representing data from companies that fell closest to our asset size. 
The Compensation Committee also relied on the independent compensation consultant to provide a broader industry perspective of emerging trends and best practices. Among the peer and industry data considered in 2018 were three-year total shareholder return relative to peers, three-year relative performance in incentive measures and realizable pay over the prior three years relative to peers. With the assistance of the independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee performs a pay and performance analysis on an annual basis to review the appropriateness of the company's executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee determined that the pay and performance analyses for the year 2017 and for the period 2015 — 2017 reflected appropriate alignment between actual pay and relative performance.

2018 Compensation Decisions 
Timing of Compensation Decisions 
Shortly after each year-end, the Compensation Committee approves annual incentive awards tied directly to the prior year's performance. These awards are based on metrics chosen by the Compensation Committee early in the preceding year. During the second quarter of the year, the Compensation Committee will make decisions with respect to base salary adjustments and annual equity-based long-term incentive based on performance and on other factors discussed below. With respect to the incentive compensation amounts reported for 2018 in the Summary Compensation Table: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual incentives based on 2018 performance are reported under the "Non-Equity  Incentive Plan" column.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual long-term incentives granted on May 1, 2018 are reported under the columns "Stock Awards" and  "Option Awards". These awards were determined based on a multi-faceted approach that includes company and individual performance and contributions, retention value of current equity ownership, historical long-term incentive compensation  awards and the market-based framework the independent consultant developed.  
[END TABLE]
Decisions with respect to base salary adjustments, annual incentive awards under the Management Incentive Plan (MIP) and annual equity grants are discussed below. 
Base Salary 
Following the Compensation Committee's annual review of current salaries, previous salary increases, and competitive market data, one NEO received a base salary increase in 2018. The Compensation Committee approved a merit-based and market competitive base salary increase for Mr. Harmening of 4.2%, equal to $25,000. 
Annual Incentive Award 
Huntington's annual incentive awards under MIP reflect company performance on key short-term measures, adjusted at the discretion of the CEO and the Compensation Committee, for business segment and individual performance. Each executive has an annual target incentive opportunity expressed as a percentage of his or her base salary. The specific threshold, target and maximum opportunity for each executive is reflective of the executive's role and competitive market practice. For 2018, the CEO's target incentive was equal to 150% of his base salary. For the other participating NEOs, the 2018 MIP target was equal to 100% of base salary. These targets were consistent with the prior year and were determined to be market competitive based on Huntington's asset size. 
Metrics and Performance. The Compensation Committee considers the appropriate corporate performance metrics for each year. To measure 2018 performance, the Compensation Committee selected the metrics of earnings per share, operating leverage and pre-tax pre-provision earnings growth (PTPP Growth). Earnings per share and operating leverage were also metrics for the prior year; PTPP Growth replaced return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) as the third metric. These three performance metrics were chosen from among the list of available criteria under MIP and represented key short-term strategic areas of focus intended to support profitable growth and returns. The choice of metrics also reflected a balanced approach to measuring success. The metric of operating leverage ensures that our incentives are aligned with our commitment to shareholders to grow revenue faster than expenses. PTPP Growth is a core operating performance indicator and adds a growth component. ROTCE remains an important measure and was retained as a metric for the PSUs granted in 2018. For each metric the Compensation Committee determined a threshold, target and maximum level of achievement based on the company's operating plan for 2018. The impact of tax reform under the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" on the company's operations was incorporated into the 2018 operating plan, and thus into the incentive goals as well. The operating leverage target for 2018 was set below the target for the prior year because in 2017 the company benefited from the cost-savings resulting from the acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation effective in August 2016. 
Compensation of Executive Officers 
MIP allows for awards to be earned under each plan criterion, independent of the other criteria, provided that no awards will be paid unless threshold performance is achieved. We interpolate between the threshold, target and maximum goals to ensure sound incentive compensation arrangements and appropriate pay for performance alignment. In determining whether a performance goal has been met, the Committee will include or exclude "extraordinary events" or any other objective events or occurrences, in either establishing the performance goal based on the qualifying performance criteria or in determining whether the performance goal has been achieved; provided, however, that the Committee retains the discretion to reduce or eliminate an award that would otherwise be paid to any participant based on the Committee's evaluation of such events or other factors. Awards may be paid only after the Compensation Committee has certified in writing that the performance goals have been met. 
No awards would have been paid to the NEOs if net income had not been achieved for 2018. Consistent with recent years, the 2018 cycle of MIP included an individual funding mechanism for each of the NEOs, equal to a maximum of 0.5% of net income for the CEO and a maximum of 0.2% of net income for the other NEOs. 
The company's 2018 performance was reviewed in accordance with the MIP and certified by the Compensation Committee in January 2019. Excluding significant items, actual performance against each of the EPS, PTPP Earnings Growth and Operating Leverage goals was above target. 
The table below provides the schedule of metrics and goals that the Compensation Committee approved for 2018, along with the company's performance.

ROTCE results are measured annually, adjusted for extraordinary items, and averaged using year-end reported amounts. The range of potential payouts, 0% to 150% of the target number of share units, was consistent with the design of PSUs awarded in the prior year, and determined to be within competitive market practice, and reasonable from an annual share run rate and dilution perspective. 
Determination of individual LTI Grants. The Compensation Committee independently evaluated the CEO's performance for the purpose of determining a 2018 long-term incentive award and assessed the competitive pay positioning that would result from the awards to be consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. 
In determining award values for the other NEOs, the Compensation Committee considered the CEO's performance assessments for each NEO, as well as additional input from the CEO, and the market guidelines provided by the consultant. Consistent with the company's philosophy, the CEO's evaluation was based on a holistic approach that included individual performance and contributions, retention value of current equity ownership, historical long-term incentive compensation awards and the market-based framework the independent consultant developed. The key factors included in the evaluation of each NEO are discussed under "Compensation Decisions for each Named Executive Officer" below. The Compensation Committee approved awards in 2018 for the NEOs (other than the CEO) as recommended by the CEO. 
Compensation Decisions for each Named Executive Officer 
In addition to rewarding executives for achievement of financial goals, the Compensation Committee applies its discretion to reinforce behaviors and values that contribute to the company's long-term success. When evaluating base salary increases, adjusting MIP awards for business segment and individual performance, and determining the grant-date value of long-term incentive compensation awards, the CEO and Compensation Committee considered the performance of each executive under the following common factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Further, the Compensation Committee differentiated compensation for the NEOs other than the CEO by taking into consideration the CEO's evaluation of each executive's performance, role and relative contribution to overall company performance. Although there were no predetermined quantifiable goals against which business unit and individual performance were evaluated independently for purposes of determining compensation, highlights of the specific 2018 individual and business unit performance considered by the Compensation Committee for each NEO are set forth below.

Recently Completed PSU Performance Cycles 
2016 — 2018 Cycle. December 31, 2018 marked the end of the three-year performance cycle for PSU awards granted in 2016. The Compensation Committee expects to certify the results and determine the final values for these PSU awards in April 2019. The metrics for this cycle were relative TSR targeted at the 50th percentile performance for the selected peer group and relative return on tangible common equity targeted at the 50th percentile averaged over the three years, all adjusted for significant items. During the period January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018, relative ROTCE was above target performance, and relative TSR was below threshold performance. 
2015 — 2017 Cycle. In April 2018, the Compensation Committee determined the final award values for the PSU awards granted in 2015, which had a three-year performance cycle that ended on December 31, 2017. These awards were paid in shares of stock reported on a Form 4 report filed for each participating executive officer. The metrics for this cycle were relative TSR targeted at the 50th percentile performance for the selected peer group and return on tangible common equity targeted at 12.25% averaged over the three years, all adjusted for significant items. During the period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017, absolute adjusted ROTCE exceeded maximum performance, and relative TSR was below threshold performance. Final awards were equal to 75% of target. 
Other Policies & Practices 
Stock Ownership & Holding Requirements 
To reinforce the importance of stock ownership to the company's compensation philosophy, the Compensation Committee has imposed ownership requirements since 2006. Executive officers and other colleagues subject to the policy are required 
Compensation of Executive Officers to meet and maintain a dollar value of ownership based on a multiple of salary. Ownership levels are evaluated as of September 30 each year based on then current stock prices. The colleague's current base salary is multiplied by his or her assigned multiple and compared to current holdings, valued based on a 30-day average closing stock price. After becoming subject to the guidelines, colleagues generally have five years to meet their ownership levels and thereafter must continue to meet the requirements on an on-going basis. Executive officers continue to be subject to a holding requirement equal to 50% of net shares received upon the exercises of a stock option or upon the release of full value awards. This amount of shares must be held until retirement or other departure from the company. The Compensation Committee may permit a discretionary hardship exemption from the ownership and/or holding requirements, on a case-by-case basis. Each of the NEOs, other than Mr. Harmening who has been with the company for less than two years, currently exceeds his or her ownership guidelines. In addition to the executive officers, stock ownership requirements extend to approximately 70 additional executive leaders and the shareholding requirements extend to approximately 1,200 additional senior leaders.

[END TABLE]
Hedging & Pledging Provisions 
The Compensation Committee has a policy prohibiting Huntington's executive officers from hedging their ownership of Huntington stock, as this would be inconsistent with the goals of the compensation program. Prohibited hedging activity includes trading in financial instruments designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Huntington stock. These financial instruments include prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds. 
In addition, executive officers and directors are discouraged from pledging their Huntington securities. The general counsel may, however, grant consent to the pledge of shares owned by executive officers or directors in excess of stock ownership guidelines after consideration of the particular circumstances. Any such request, along with the general counsel's response, must be communicated to the Compensation Committee. None of Huntington's executive officers or directors currently has shares of Huntington stock pledged, or had shares pledged during 2018 or anytime during at least the past ten years. 
Annual Long-Term Incentive Award Grant Practices 
The 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan permits the Compensation Committee to designate a grant date effective following the date of the committee action. The Committee has adopted a practice of granting equity awards on a pre-established date to avoid coinciding with trading blackouts. Since 2012 we have granted our annual long-term incentive awards effective May 1. The exercise price for each stock option award is equal to the fair market value of a share of common stock on the grant date. Under the company's stock plan, fair market value is generally defined as the closing price on the applicable date. We prohibit the repricing of stock options. 
Compensation of Executive Officers 
Recoupment / Clawback Provisions 
Our Recoupment / Clawback Policy (Recoupment Policy) is a tool for recovery of incentive compensation in appropriate situations to the extent permitted (or required) by law and by the company's plans, policies and agreements. In addition, we have included clawback provisions in incentive plans for executive officers and for all employees. Our NEOs are subject to recoupment and clawback as set forth below. 
Recoupment/Clawback Policy 
Incentive Compensation subject to possible clawback or recoupment includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a)  any bonus or other cash incentive payment, including commissions, previously paid or payable, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(b)  any equity compensation, vested or unvested (including without limitation, performance shares and performance share units,  restricted stock and restricted stock units and stock options) and net proceeds of any exercised or vested equity awards.  
[END TABLE]
The policy is applicable to all colleagues, including the named executive officers. In general, situations that trigger a review under this policy involve behaviors or actions outside the bounds of the company's overall risk appetite and governance structure. In determining whether to require reimbursement or forfeiture of an executive officer's incentive compensation, the Compensation Committee shall take into account such considerations as it deems appropriate, such as the extent to which the employee's actions or inactions were in violation of the code of conduct; whether the action or inaction could reasonably be expected to cause financial or reputational harm to the company; the egregiousness of the conduct; the tax consequences to the affected employee; and other factors as the Committee deems appropriate under the circumstances. For employees who are not executive officers, the decision to recoup or clawback incentive compensation is made by the CEO jointly with the Chief Human Resources Officer, and reported to the Committee. 
Specific provisions apply in the event of a financial restatement. If it is determined by the board of directors that gross negligence, intentional misconduct or fraud by an employee or former employee caused or partially caused the company to have to restate all or a portion of its financial statements, the board, in its sole discretion, may, to the extent permitted by law and the company's benefit plans, policies and agreements, and to the extent it determined in its sole judgment that it is in the best interests of the company to do so, require repayment of a portion or all of any incentive compensation if (1) the amount or vesting of the incentive compensation was calculated based upon, or contingent on, the achievement of financial or operating results that were the subject of or affected by the restatement; and (2) the amount or vesting of the Incentive Compensation would have been less had the financial statements been correct. 
Further, pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act, if the company is required to restate any of its financial statements because of a material financial reporting violation, the company shall recover the amount in excess of the incentive compensation payable under the company's restated financial statements, or such other amount required under the Dodd-Frank Act or any other applicable law or policy. The company shall recover this amount from any current or former employee who received incentive compensation during the three-year period preceding the date on which the restatement is required, or from any other individual specified in the Dodd-Frank Act. 
Stock Plans 
We have forfeiture and recoupment provisions in the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan specific to awards under this plan. Except following a change in control event, should the Compensation Committee determine that a participant has committed a serious breach of conduct or has solicited or taken away customers or potential customers with whom the participant had contact during the participant's employment with us, the Compensation Committee may terminate any outstanding award, in whole or in part, whether or not yet vested. If such conduct or activity occurs within three years following the exercise or payment of an award, the Compensation Committee may require the participant or former participant to repay to us any gain realized or payment received upon exercise or payment of such award. A serious breach of conduct includes, without limitation, any conduct prejudicial to or in conflict with Huntington or any securities law violations including any violations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, awards may be forfeited upon termination of employment for cause. 
Annual Incentive Plan 
The Management Incentive Plan (MIP) provides that if Huntington is required to restate any of its financial statements because of a material financial reporting violation, Huntington will recover the amount in excess of the award payable under Huntington's restated financial statements, or such other amount required under the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, if the Compensation Committee determines that a participant took unnecessary or excessive risk, manipulated earnings, or engaged in any misconduct described in our Recoupment Policy, the Committee may terminate the participant's participation in the plan and require repayment of any amount previously paid in accordance with the Recoupment Policy, any other applicable policies and any other applicable laws and regulations. 
Compensation of Executive Officers 
Benefits 
Executive officers participate in the same broad-based benefit programs generally available to all colleagues. A limited number of additional benefits are offered to executive officers and certain other officers and are designed to represent a modest portion of total compensation. Following is a list of the additional benefits and compensation elements offered to executive officers during 2018. 
Supplemental Savings: The NEOs are eligible to participate in a supplemental defined contribution plan. This plan is further discussed following the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation 2018 table below. 
Deferred Compensation: Our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, a non-qualified plan, provides a vehicle for participants to defer receipt of cash or stock to a time when taxes may be at a more personally beneficial rate and / or to save for long-term financial needs. This plan is discussed in more detail following the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation 2018 table below. 
Perquisites: A very limited number of perquisites are utilized at Huntington; they represent a small component of compensation. We offer an incurred expense reimbursement allowance for tax and financial planning to our NEOs, up to 2% of base salary per year. For the chief executive officer, we provide security monitoring of his personal residence, and for security, personal safety, and efficiency, use of our cars and drivers and a corporate aircraft. Personal use of the corporate aircraft is in accordance with Huntington's Aircraft Usage Policy. We also provide relocation benefits to senior level colleagues to facilitate transition when moving their residence to a new work location. 
Employment Agreement: Only one executive officer, the CEO, has an employment agreement with us, which is described under "Mr. Steinour's Employment Agreement" below. 
Severance Arrangements: Huntington has change-in-control agreements, referred to as Executive Agreements, with our NEOs. The objectives of the Executive Agreements are to provide severance protections for the NEOs in the event of a qualifying termination of employment in connection with a change-in-control of Huntington and to encourage their continued employment in the event of any actual or threatened change-in-control of Huntington. The Executive Agreements are further described under "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" below. 
(Frozen) Supplemental Pension: The CEO is a participant in the frozen pension plan and a frozen supplemental defined benefit plan (both were frozen on December 31, 2013). These plans are further discussed under the Pension Benefits 2018 table, below. 
Tax & Accounting Considerations 
Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) generally places a $1 million limit on the amount of compensation a publicly-traded company can deduct in any one year for certain executive officers. Historically, including when we made compensation decisions with respect to taxable years that began before the taxable year beginning January 1, 2018, Code Section 162(m) contained an exception to the $1 million limit on deductibility for "performance-based" compensation. Regulations under Code Section 162(m) required several requirements to be satisfied in order for compensation to qualify as performance-based. Over the years we have worked to balance our compensation philosophy with the goal of achieving maximum deductibility under Code Section 162(m). Certain awards outstanding under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan were structured so that awards for "covered officers" might qualify as performance-based compensation deductible for federal income tax purposes under Code Section 162(m). To maintain flexibility and the ability to pay competitive compensation, we did not require all compensation to be deductible. 
The "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" eliminated the performance-based exception under Code Section 162(m), effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to our covered executive officers (including stock 
Compensation of Executive Officers options) in excess of $1 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief that applies to compensation paid under binding contracts that were in effect as of November 2, 2017. Because of the lack of regulatory and other guidance pertaining to the future interpretation of Code Section 162(m) and the transition rule, no assurance can be given that compensation intended to qualify for Code Section 162(m)'s performance-based exception in fact will. Further, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are consistent with Huntington's business needs. Huntington will continue to evaluate the impact of the elimination of the performance-based exception and the impact of the transition rule on its compensation programs. In addition, the Compensation Committee may award compensation in the future that is not fully deductible under Code Section 162(m) if the Compensation Committee believes that such compensation packages will best attract, retain, and award successful executives and contribute to achievement of Huntington's business objectives. 
Huntington also takes into consideration Internal Revenue Code Section 409A with respect to non-qualified deferred compensation programs, and ASC 718, "Compensation — Stock Compensation" in administering its equity compensation program.

(1)   Awards of stock options granted in 2014 through 2018 become exercisable in four equal annual increments from the date  of grant and are fully vested on the fourth anniversary. The earlier awards of stock options reported in the table have all become exercisable and are fully vested.  
(2)  The awards of RSUs granted on May 1st each year vest over a period of four years, with 50% of the award vesting in year  three and 50% of the award vesting in year four. Each other award of RSUs reflected in this column was granted in partial payment of annual incentive earned under the MIP and vests in 3 equal increments over a period of 3 years commencing on the  first anniversary of the date of grant. The awards granted on and after May 1, 2015, reflect the impact of dividend reinvestment.  
(3)  The market value of the awards of RSUs that have not yet vested was determined by multiplying the closing price of a  share of Huntington common stock on December 31, 2018 ($11.92) by the number of units.  
(4)  The PSUs reported in these columns will vest subject to achievement of the applicable performance goals as of the end  of a three-year performance period. Each PSU is equal to one share of common stock. The number of PSUs and the market value reported were determined on the basis of achieving target performance goals. The market value of the PSUs was determined by  multiplying the closing price of a share of Huntington common stock on December 31, 2018 ($11.92) by the number of units. The PSUs granted on May 1, 2016 vested on December 31, 2018; awards will be released in April 2019 after final  award values are determined and certified by the Compensation Committee. Awards granted on and after May 1, 2015, reflect the impact of dividend reinvestment.

(1)   The value realized upon exercise of options reflects the difference between the market value of the shares on the  exercise date and the exercise price of the options. The value realized upon vesting of stock awards (RSUs and PSUs) was determined by multiplying the number of shares by the market value on the vesting date. Mr. Steinour deferred 240,762  shares, Mr. McCullough deferred 51,605 shares, and Ms. Houston deferred 14,643 shares, respectively, acquired upon vesting pursuant to the terms of the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan described below.

Compensation of Executive Officers 
We maintain two plans under which executive officers may defer compensation on a non-qualified basis: the Supplemental 401(k) Plan (formerly the Supplemental Stock Purchase and Tax Savings Plan and Trust) referred to as the Supplemental Plan, and the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, referred to as the EDCP. For each named executive officer, information about participation in the Supplemental Plan and the EDCP is contained in the table below.

The Supplemental 401(k) Plan 
The purpose of the Supplemental Plan is to provide a supplemental savings program for eligible employees (as determined by the Compensation Committee) who may otherwise be limited by Internal Revenue Code limits to the Huntington 401(k) Plan, a tax qualified 401(k) plan referred to as the 401(k) Plan. Eligible individuals elect to participate in the Supplemental Plan and designate the percentage of base pay that is to be contributed to the Supplemental Plan — between 1% and 75% of base pay — prior to the beginning of each Plan year. All contributions to the Supplemental Plan are on a pre-tax basis. We then match contributions up to 100% on the first 4% of base compensation. Under the Supplemental Plan, employee contributions can be invested in any of the available investment alternatives as in the 401(k) Plan. Our matching contributions are invested in Huntington common stock, but can be diversified at any time. A participant cannot receive a distribution of any part of their Supplemental Plan account until his or her employment terminates. Once employment terminates, shares of common stock in a participant's account are to be distributed to the participant in-kind. Distributions from the Supplemental Plan are subject to federal and state income tax withholding. 
Compensation of Executive Officers 
The Executive Deferred Compensation Plan 
The EDCP provides senior officers designated by the Compensation Committee the opportunity to defer up to 90% of base salary, annual bonus compensation and certain equity awards. An election to defer can only be made on an annual basis and is generally irrevocable. Generally, contributions to this plan consist of compensation deferred by the participants. Deferrals of common stock are held as common stock until distribution. Cash amounts deferred will accrue interest, earnings and losses based on the performance of the investment option selected by the participant and tracked by a book-keeping account. Contributions can be invested in any of the available investment options under the 401(k) Plan. 
At the time of each deferral election, a participant elects the method and timing of account distribution to be effective upon a separation of service. In addition, a participant may elect an in-service distribution. Accounts distributed upon a separation of service may be distributed in a single lump sum payment or in installments. A participant may request a hardship withdrawal prior to a separation of service. In addition, for amounts earned and vested on or before December 31, 2004, a participant may obtain an in-service withdrawal subject to a 10% penalty and suspension of future contributions for at least 12 months. Cash that is deferred is paid out in cash, except that any cash that is invested in our common stock at the time of distribution is distributed in shares. Common stock that is deferred is distributed in kind. 
The table below sets forth the rate of return for the one-year period ending December 31, 2018 for each of the investment options under the Supplemental Plan and the EDCP.

(1)   Years of credited service reported in the table are the final years of credited service, frozen as of December 31,  2013.  
(2)  This column reflects the actuarial present value of the executive officer's accumulated benefit under the  Retirement Plan and the SRIP as of December 31, 2018. The valuation method used to determine the benefit figures shown, and all material assumptions applied, are discussed in Note 15 "Benefit Plans" of the Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
The NEOs other than Mr. Steinour were hired after January 1, 2010 and are not eligible to participate in the Retirement Plan. Eligibility for participation in the SRIP is limited to employees eligible to participate in the Retirement Plan who (a) have been nominated by the Compensation Committee; and (b) earn compensation in excess of the limitation imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) or whose benefit exceeds the limitation of Code Section 415(b). 
Benefits under both the Retirement Plan and the SRIP are based on levels of compensation and years of credited service. Benefits under the SRIP, however, are not limited by Code Sections 401(a)(17) and 415(b). Code Section 401(a)(17) limits the annual amount of compensation that may be taken into account when calculating benefits under the Retirement Plan. For 2018, this limit was $275,000. Code Section 415 limits the annual benefit amount that a participant may receive under the Retirement Plan. For 2018, this amount was $220,000. 
The benefit formula under the Retirement Plan was previously revised for benefits earned beginning on January 1, 2010. While the change did not affect the benefit earned under the Retirement Plan through December 31, 2009, there was a reduction in future benefits. The benefit earned in the Retirement Plan prior to January 1, 2010 is based on compensation earned in the five consecutive highest years of service. For service on and after January 1, 2010 and through December 31, 2013, the benefit earned in the Retirement Plan is based on compensation earned each year. For executives who are eligible for retirement or early retirement, the benefit earned in the SRIP is based on compensation earned in the five consecutive 
Compensation of Executive Officers highest years of service and the Retirement Plan formula in effect on December 31, 2009. For executives who are not eligible Compensation of Executive Officers for retirement or early retirement, the accrued benefit under the SRIP is based on the Retirement Plan formula in effect on and after January 1, 2010. Compensation consists of base salary and 50% of overtime, bonuses, incentives and commissions paid pursuant to plans with a measurement period of one year or less. Bonuses are taken into account in the year paid rather than earned. A participant who is at least 55 years of age with at least 10 years of service may retire and receive an early retirement benefit, reduced to reflect the fact that he or she will be receiving payments over a longer period of time. Mr. Steinour became eligible for early retirement in 2018 under the Retirement Plan and the SRIP. 
The years of credited service have been capped for participants to the actual years of service with us through December 31, 2013, the date the plans were frozen. The maximum years of credited service recognized by the Retirement Plan and the SRIP is 40. 
Benefit figures shown are computed on the assumption that participants retire at age 65, the normal retirement age specified in the plans. The normal form of benefit under the Retirement Plan is a life annuity. The Retirement Plan offers additional forms of distribution that are actuarially equivalent to the life annuity. Benefits with a present value greater than the applicable dollar limit under Code Section 402(g) ($18,000 for 2018) are paid from the SRIP in the form of a life annuity. The SRIP also offers additional forms of distribution that are actuarially equivalent to the life annuity. Benefits with a present value equal to or less than the applicable dollar limit under Code Section 402(g) are paid in the form of a lump sum distribution. 
Payments upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control 
Each of our named executive officers has a change in control agreement with us referred to as an Executive Agreement. The purposes of these agreements are to encourage retention of our key executives and to provide protection from termination related to a change in control of our company. These agreements do not include a "golden parachute" excise tax gross-up provision or a right to terminate employment as a result of a change-in-control. In addition, these agreements contain restrictions relating to the disclosure of confidential information and competing with Huntington (three-year non-competition for the chief executive officer, and one year non-competition for the other named executive officers, post termination). 
Huntington has an employment agreement with Mr. Steinour pursuant to which Mr. Steinour will continue to serve as Huntington's president and chief executive officer through December 31, 2019. The agreement became effective December 1, 2012 for an initial three-year term, subject to three-year renewal periods upon expiration of the initial term and each renewal term, unless either party gives timely notice of nonrenewal. Mr. Steinour's employment agreement provides for certain payments to him upon termination in certain situations other than a change in control. 
In addition, each of the named executive officers has outstanding RSU awards and PSU awards which may be subject to accelerated vesting upon involuntary termination (not for cause), death or disability. 
Executive Agreements 
Under the Executive Agreements, change in control generally includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 25% or more of our outstanding voting securities;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a change in the composition of the board of directors if a majority of the new directors were not appointed or nominated by  the directors currently sitting on the board of directors or their subsequent nominees;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a merger involving our company where our shareholders immediately prior to the merger own less than 51% of the combined  voting power of the surviving entity immediately after the merger;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the dissolution of our company; and  
[END TABLE]
Compensation of Executive Officers 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a disposition of assets, reorganization, or other corporate event involving our company which would have the same effect as  any of the above-described events.  
[END TABLE]
Under each Executive Agreement, we, or our successor, will provide severance benefits to the executive officer if his employment is terminated (other than on account of the officer's death or disability or for cause): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by us, at any time within 24 months after a change in control;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by us, at any time prior to a change in control but after commencement of any discussions with a third party relating to a  possible change in control involving such third party if the executive officer's termination is in contemplation of such possible change in control and such change in control is actually consummated within 12 months after the date of such  executive officer's termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by the executive officer voluntarily with good reason at any time within 24 months after a change in control of our company;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by the executive officer voluntarily with good reason at any time after commencement of change in control discussions if  such change in control is actually consummated within 12 months after the date of such officer's termination.  
[END TABLE]
Good reason generally means the assignment to the executive officer of duties which are materially different from such duties prior to the change in control, a reduction in such officer's salary or benefits, or a demand to relocate to an unacceptable location, made by us or our successor either after a change in control or after the commencement of change in control discussions if such change or reduction is made in contemplation of a change in control and such change in control is actually consummated within 12 months after such change or reduction. An executive officer's determination of good reason will be conclusive and binding upon the parties if made in good faith. 
In addition to any accrued salary and annual cash incentive payable as of termination, severance payments and benefits under the Executive Agreements consist of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump-sum cash payment equal to three times annual base salary for the chief  executive officer and two and one-half times annual base salary for each of the other named executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump-sum cash payment equal to three times for the chief executive officer, and  two and one-half times for the other named executive officers, of the greater of the executive's target annual incentive award for the calendar year during which the change in control occurs or the  immediately preceding calendar year, provided the executive was a participant in the Management Incentive Plan during the calendar year, or the immediately preceding calendar year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a pro-rata annual incentive award paid upon a change in control under the Management  Incentive Plan based on either the actual level of year-to-date performance, or the target award as a percent of base salary for the plan year preceding the change in  control, whichever is greater, in accordance with the terms of the Management Incentive Plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 36 months of continued insurance benefits for the chief executive officer, and 30 months for the other named executive  officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• fees for outplacement services for the executive up to a maximum amount equal to 15% of the executive's annual base  salary plus reimbursement for job search travel expenses up to $5,000;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• stock options, restricted stock, RSU, and PSU awards under our stock and incentive plans become vested according to the  terms of the plans; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• other benefits to which the executive was otherwise entitled including perquisites, benefits, and service credit for  benefits.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation of Executive Officers 
The Executive Agreements also provide for 36 months of additional service credited for purposes of retirement benefits for the chief executive officer and 30 months for the other named executive officers. Because the Retirement Plan and the SRIP were frozen as of December 31, 2013, this provision will not operate to increase accrued benefits under these plans. Additional service and compensation earned after the freeze date are not included in the calculation of benefits under the Executive Agreements. The additional service period will count for purposes of determining vesting or entitlement to early retirement benefits under these plans. The chief executive officer is the only NEO participating in the Retirement Plan and the SRIP. 
The Executive Agreements have a best-net-benefit clause which replaced the excise tax gross-ups. If an executive triggers the excise tax, the individual will either be "cut-back" to an amount that is $1 less than such amount that would cause the excise tax, or the executive will have the opportunity to pay the excise tax himself, depending on the result that provides the better after-tax result. 
For a period of five years after any termination of the executive officer's employment, we will provide the executive officer with coverage under a standard directors' and officers' liability insurance policy at our expense, and will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the officer to the fullest extent permitted under Maryland law against all expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred by the officer in connection with or arising out of any action, suit, or proceeding in which he may be involved by reason of having been a director or officer of our company or any subsidiary. 
In the event an executive officer is required to enforce any of the rights granted under his Executive Agreement, we, or our successor, will pay the cost of counsel (legal and accounting). In addition, the executive officer is entitled to prejudgment interest on any amounts found to be due in connection with any action taken to enforce such officer's rights under the Executive Agreement. 
As a condition to receiving the payments and benefits under the Executive Agreements, the executive officer will be required to execute a release. Severance benefits payable in a lump sum will be paid not later than 45 business days following the date the executive's employment terminates, subject to applicable laws and regulations. 
The Executive Agreements are extended annually and are subject to an extension for 24 months upon a change in control. An Executive Agreement will terminate if the executive officer's employment terminates under circumstances that do not trigger benefits under the agreement. We may elect not to renew an agreement upon 30 days prior written notice. 
The estimated payments and benefits that would be paid in the event each named executive officer terminated employment on December 31, 2018 and became entitled to benefits under his or her Executive Agreement are set forth below. For purposes of quantifying these benefits, we assumed that a change in control occurred on December 31, 2018 and that the executive officer's employment was terminated on that date without cause. The closing price of a share of our common stock on December 31, 2018, the last business day of the year, was $11.92.

[END TABLE]
Mr. Steinour's Employment Agreement 
Mr. Steinour's employment agreement provides for certain payments upon a termination of his employment without "cause" or for "good reason" (each as defined in the agreement). The potential payments under these agreements are described and quantified below. 
Upon termination without "cause" or for "good reason", Mr. Steinour is entitled to payment of the following amounts: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accrued amounts consisting of unpaid base salary through termination, earned but unpaid annual incentive payments for the  prior period, accrued and unused paid time off and incurred but unreimbursed business expenses;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a pro-rata incentive payment in respect of the fiscal year of the company in which  the date of termination occurs, with such amount to equal the amount determined by the Compensation Committee based on the Company's actual performance for the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs and otherwise on a basis no less  favorable than annual incentive award determinations are made by the Compensation Committee for the company's executive officers; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a severance payment equal to two times his annual base salary and the higher of the target incentive payment for the year of  termination or the incentive payment paid or payable with respect to the prior fiscal year; and  
[END TABLE]
Mr. Steinour would also be entitled to payment and provision of any other amounts or benefits to which he was otherwise entitled. 
If Mr. Steinour had terminated employment with us without "cause" or for "good reason" as of December 31, 2018, he would have been entitled to, in addition to accrued amounts and benefits, a pro rata annual incentive payment equal to $2,025,000 and a severance payment equal to $6,200,000. 
If Mr. Steinour had terminated employment as of December 31, 2018, due to death or disability, he or his estate would have been entitled to a pro rata annual incentive payment for the year of termination (based on the company's actual performance for the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs and otherwise on a basis no less favorable than annual incentive award determinations are made by the Compensation Committee for the company's executive officers) equal to $2,025,000 and accrued obligations and benefits. 
If Mr. Steinour had terminated employment as of December 31, 2018 without "good reason" and due to his retirement, he would have been entitled to a pro rata annual incentive payment for the year of termination equal to $2,025,000. Mr. Steinour was not eligible for normal retirement benefits as of December 31, 2018. 
Severance benefits and payments are subject to execution and non-revocation of a release of claims.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   In the event accelerated vesting applies to a prorated award rather than the full award, the proration is based on the  number of months from the grant date to the month of termination. For PSUs awarded prior to 2018, proration is calculated on the target number of shares, subject to adjustment at the end of the performance cycle when the shares would be released  along with all other PSU awards for the same cycle. Starting with 2018 PSU awards, PSUs are prorated at target and adjusted to reflect the lesser of target or the most recent performance result reported to the Compensation Committee. Dividends for  awards granted prior to May 1, 2015 are accumulated and paid in cash. Dividends for awards granted on or after May 1, 2015 are reinvested and accumulated as additional award shares.  
(2)  There is full forfeiture of any unvested awards in the event of termination for cause.  
(3)  Involuntary termination (not for cause) results in accelerated vesting of a prorated number of shares unless the  executive meets the "normal retirement" provisions which result in continued vesting post-termination.  
(4)  Termination in the event of death results in acceleration in full for all awards granted on or after May 1, 2016,  and acceleration of a prorated number of shares for all awards granted prior to May 1, 2016. PSUs granted on and after May 1, 2016 that are subject to accelerated vesting due to termination in the event of death are not subject to  adjustment at the end of the performance cycle.  
(5)  Termination due to disability results in accelerated vesting of a prorated number of shares for all awards granted  prior to May 1, 2016 and after May 1, 2017; awards granted between May 1, 2016 and April 30, 2017 provide for acceleration of vesting in full. PSUs granted on or after May 1, 2016 that are subject to continued vesting due to  termination in the event of disability are subject to adjustment at the end of the performance cycle.

Compensation of Executive Officers 
Pay Ratio Disclosure 
We are providing this disclosure pursuant to a rule adopted by the SEC implementing a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Act. The rule requires disclosure of the median annual total compensation of all employees, excluding the CEO, the annual total compensation of the CEO and the ratio of these amounts. For purposes of this disclosure, annual total compensation for both the median employee and the CEO is determined in accordance with the definition of annual total compensation as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table. 
In accordance with the rule, we are using the same median employee identified in the proxy statement for last year's annual meeting of shareholders because there has been no change in our employee population or our employee compensation arrangements that resulted in a significant change of the pay distribution to our employee population, or would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure. The median employee was determined from among the company's employees (excluding the CEO) using a consistently applied compensation measure. The consistently applied compensation measure was 2017 W-2 Box 1 data as reflected in the company's payroll records for each colleague (full-time, part-time, seasonal or temporary, and on long-term leave, but excluding the CEO) employed as of December 29, 2017. The median employee provides customer service in the commercial banking division. 
The median employee's annual total compensation for 2018 was determined for purposes of this disclosure. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC Regulation S-K Item 402(u). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Median Employee Annual Total Compensation     $  58,188    
 CEO Annual Total Compensation     $  8,556,915    
 Ratio        147:1

Proposal 1 — Election of Directors 
The board of directors proposes the election of thirteen directors at this annual meeting. Directors elected at the meeting will each serve a one-year term expiring at our 2020 annual meeting when their successors are duly elected and qualify. 
Upon consultation with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the board of directors has increased the number of directors to thirteen, effective with this annual meeting, and has nominated the following directors currently serving: Lizabeth Ardisana, Ann B. (Tanny) Crane, Robert S. Cubbin, Steven G. Elliott, Gina D. France, Michael J. Hochschwender, John C. (Chris) Inglis, Peter J. Kight, Richard W. Neu, David L. Porteous, Kathleen H. Ransier, and Stephen D. Steinour. The board has also nominated Katherine M. A. (Allie) Kline. 
For additional information about the selection of director nominees, see Director Nomination and Board Evaluation, above. 
Unless otherwise directed, the shares represented by a properly submitted proxy will be voted FOR the election of each nominee. We have no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable or unwilling to serve as a director if elected. However, in the event that any of these nominees should become unavailable, the board of directors may decrease the number of directors pursuant to the bylaws, or the board of directors may designate a substitute nominee, for whom shares represented by a properly submitted proxy would be voted. 
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR the election of each of the nominees for director.

Proposal 2 — Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee regularly evaluates the qualifications, performance, and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm, and whether the independent registered public accounting firm should be rotated. 
After assessing the qualifications, performance and independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our current auditors, the Audit Committee has again selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since 2015. The Audit Committee and the board of directors believe that the continued retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the company and its investors. Although not required, we are asking shareholders to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 because we value our shareholder's views on the company's independent registered public accounting firm and as a matter of good corporate governance. The Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP if its selection is not ratified by the shareholders. 
Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP regularly attend meetings of the Audit Committee and will be present at the annual meeting. These representatives will have an opportunity at the annual meeting to make a statement if they desire to do so and also will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Audit Fees, Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and All Other Fees 
The table below reflects the aggregate fees and out of pocket expenses billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for services rendered for us for 2017 and 2018.

Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with the retention of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has a policy that it will pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, and will not engage the independent registered public accounting firm to perform any specific non-audit services prohibited by law or regulation. The Audit Committee has given general pre-approval for specified audit, audit-related and tax services. The terms of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee specifically provides for a different term. The Audit Committee will annually review the services for which general pre-approval is given. The Audit Committee may revise the list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based upon subsequent determinations. Unless a type of service to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm has received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. Pre-approval fee levels for all services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm are established annually by the Audit Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these levels will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to a member of its committee, and has currently delegated pre-approval authority to its chair. The decisions of the chair or other member to whom pre-approval authority is delegated must be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All of the services covered by the fees disclosed above were pre-approved by the Audit Committee or its chair. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to management. The Audit Committee has considered and determined that the services described above are compatible with maintaining the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. 
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
Proposal 3 — Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation 
As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement, our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance. Our program places heavy emphasis on performance-based compensation, particularly in the form of long-term incentives. We continually strengthen our compensation practices based on our philosophy, market best practices and feedback received from shareholders. Our compensation policies, practices and decisions for executive officers are described in detail under "Compensation of Executive Officers" above. 
We believe that our compensation policies and procedures strongly align the interests of executives and shareholders. We encourage our executives to focus on long-term performance with long-term incentives and also stock ownership and retention requirements. We further believe that our culture focuses executives on sound risk management and appropriately rewards executives for performance. The resolution set forth below gives the shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation of our executives. Consideration of this resolution is required pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
Upon the recommendation of the board of directors, we ask shareholders to consider adoption of the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including in the Summary Compensation Table, the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the additional compensation tables and the accompanying narrative disclosure, is hereby approved on an advisory, non-binding basis." 
Because this is an advisory vote, it will not bind the board of directors, however, the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
The board of directors recommends a vote FOR the adoption of the resolution regarding executive compensation, as set forth above.
