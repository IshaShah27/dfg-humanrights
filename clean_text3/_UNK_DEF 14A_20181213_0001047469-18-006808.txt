October 19, 2018 
Dear Fellow Shareholder: 
              You are cordially invited to attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of FS Energy and Power Fund (the "Company") to be held on December 13, 2018 at 10:30 a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of the Company, located at 201 Rouse Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19112 (the "Annual Meeting"). 
              Your vote is very important! Your immediate response will help avoid potential delays and may save the Company significant additional expenses associated with soliciting shareholder votes.
              The Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and proxy statement accompanying this letter provide an outline of the business to be conducted at the meeting. At the meeting, you will be asked to: 
              (i) elect the eight members of the board of trustees named in the enclosed proxy statement to serve as trustees of the Company until the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified; and 
              (ii) ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. 
              The Company's board of trustees unanimously recommends that you vote FOR each of the proposals to be considered and voted on at the Annual Meeting.
              The Company has elected to provide access to its proxy materials to certain of its shareholders over the Internet under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's "notice and access" rules. On or about October 26, 2018, the Company intends to mail to most of its shareholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions on how to access the proxy statement and annual report and how to submit proxies over the Internet. All other shareholders will receive a copy of the proxy statement and annual report by mail. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also contains instructions on how you can elect to receive a printed copy of the proxy statement and annual report. The Company believes that providing its proxy materials over the Internet will expedite shareholders' receipt of proxy materials, lower the costs associated with the Annual Meeting and conserve resources. 
              It is important that your common shares be represented at the Annual Meeting. If you are unable to attend the meeting in person, I urge you to complete, date and sign the enclosed proxy card and promptly return it in the envelope provided, or follow the instructions printed on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or the proxy card to authorize a proxy through the Internet or by telephone. 
              Your vote and participation in the governance of the Company are very important to us.

    FS ENERGY AND POWER FUND              201 Rouse Boulevard   Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19112     
    ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS   To Be Held On December 13, 2018         
    PROXY STATEMENT         
    GENERAL         
              This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the board of trustees (the "Board") of FS Energy and Power Fund, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Company"), for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company to be held at the offices of the Company, located at 201 Rouse Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19112, on December 13, 2018 at 10:30 a.m., Eastern Time, and any adjournments or postponements thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). This proxy statement and the accompanying materials, or a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions on how to access the proxy statement and annual report and how to submit proxies over the Internet, are being mailed on or about October 26, 2018 to shareholders of record described below and are available at www.proxyvote.com. 
              All properly executed proxies representing common shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Common Shares") received prior to the Annual Meeting will be voted in accordance with the instructions marked thereon. If no instructions are marked, the Common Shares will be voted FOR:
              (i) the proposal to elect the eight members of the board of trustees named in the enclosed proxy statement to serve as trustees of the Company until the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders and until their successor is duly elected and qualified (the "Trustee Proposal"); and 
              (ii) the proposal to ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 (the "Accountant Proposal"). 
              Any shareholder who has given a proxy has the right to revoke it at any time prior to its exercise. Any shareholder who executes a proxy may revoke it with respect to any proposal by attending the Annual Meeting and voting his or her Common Shares in person, or by submitting a letter of revocation or a later-dated proxy to the Company at the above address prior to the date of the Annual Meeting. 
   Quorum  
              Shareholders of the Company are entitled to one vote for each Common Share held. Under the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws, one third of the number of Common Shares entitled to be cast, present in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business. Abstentions will be treated as Common Shares that are present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for transacting business at the Annual Meeting. Common Shares for which brokers have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the Common Shares and do not have, or choose not to exercise, discretionary authority to vote the Common Shares on certain proposals (which are considered "broker non-votes" with respect to such proposals) also will be treated as Common Shares present for quorum purposes. 
   Adjournments  
              In the event that a quorum is not present at the Annual Meeting, the chairman of the Annual Meeting or the shareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, present in person or by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time to a date not more than 120 days after the original record date without notice other than the announcement at the Annual Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. The persons named as proxies will vote those proxies for such adjournment, unless marked to be voted against any proposal for which an adjournment is sought. Any business that might have been transacted at the Annual Meeting as originally called may be transacted at any such adjourned session(s) at which a quorum is present. 
              If it appears that there are not enough votes to approve any proposal at the Annual Meeting, the chairman of the Annual Meeting may adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time to a date not more than 120 days after the record date originally fixed for the Annual Meeting without notice other than announcement at the Annual Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. The persons named as proxies for the Company will vote proxies held by them for such adjournment, unless marked to be voted against any proposal for which an adjournment is sought, to permit the further solicitation of proxies. 
              If sufficient votes in favor of one or more proposals have been received by the time of the Annual Meeting, the proposals will be acted upon and such actions will be final, regardless of any subsequent adjournment to consider other proposals. 
   Record Date  
              The Board has fixed the close of business on October 17, 2018 as the record date (the "Record Date") for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting and all adjournments or postponements thereof. As of the Record Date, there were 436,103,833 Common Shares outstanding. 
   Required Vote  
              Election of Trustee Nominees.    Each trustee shall be elected by a plurality of all the votes cast at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy, provided that a quorum is present. Plurality voting means that the trustee nominee with the most votes for a particular seat is elected for that seat. Because all of the trustee nominees are running unopposed, all eight trustee nominees are expected to be elected as trustees of the Company, as all nominees who receive votes in favor will be elected. Each share may be voted for as many individuals as there are trustee nominees and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted. Abstentions will not be included in determining the number of votes cast and, as a result, will have no effect on the Trustee Proposal. Common Shares represented by broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and thus have no effect on the Trustee Proposal. Shareholders may not cumulate their votes. 
               Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.    The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy, provided that a quorum is present, is required to ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Abstentions will not be included in determining the number of votes cast and, as a result, will not have any effect on the result of the vote with respect to the Accountant Proposal. Because brokers will have discretionary authority to vote for the ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm in the event that they do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the Common Shares, there will not be any broker non-votes with respect to the Accountant Proposal. 
   Householding  
              The Company combines mailings for multiple accounts going to a single household by delivering to that address, in a single envelope, a copy of the document (annual reports, prospectuses, proxy statements, etc.) or other communications for all accounts who have consented or are deemed to have consented to receiving such communications in such manner in accordance with the rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). If you do not want the Company to continue consolidating your mailings from the Company and would prefer to receive separate mailings of Company  communications, please contact the Company's transfer agent, DST Systems, Inc. by telephone at (877) 628-8575 or by mail to FS Energy and Power Fund, c/o DST Systems, Inc., 430 W. 7th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64105. 
   Voting  
              You may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or by proxy in accordance with the instructions provided below. You may also authorize a proxy by telephone or through the Internet using the toll-free telephone number or web address included in your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or your proxy card. Authorizing a proxy by telephone or through the Internet requires you to input the control number located on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or your proxy card. After inputting the control number, you will be prompted to direct your proxy to vote on each proposal. You will have an opportunity to review your directions and make any necessary changes before submitting your directions and terminating the telephone call or Internet link. Shareholders of the Company are entitled to one vote for each Common Share held. 
              When voting by proxy and mailing your proxy card, you are required to:
              Important notice regarding the availability of proxy materials for the Annual Meeting.    The Company's proxy statement, the proxy card and the Company's annual report to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the "Annual Report") are available at www.proxyvote.com. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials contains instructions on how you can elect to receive a printed copy of the proxy statement and Annual Report. 
              If you plan on attending the Annual Meeting and voting your Common Shares in person, you will need to bring photo identification in order to be admitted to the Annual Meeting. To obtain directions to the Annual Meeting, please call the Company at (877) 628-8575.
   Other Information Regarding This Solicitation  
              The Company will bear the expense of the solicitation of proxies for the Annual Meeting, including the cost of preparing, printing and mailing this proxy statement, the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the proxy card, the Annual Report and the Notice of Internet availability of Proxy Materials. The Company has requested that brokers, nominees, fiduciaries and other persons holding Common Shares in their names, or in the name of their nominees, which are beneficially owned by others, forward the proxy materials to, and obtain proxies from, such beneficial owners. The Company will reimburse such persons for their reasonable expenses in so doing. 
              In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, proxies may be solicited in person and by telephone or facsimile transmission by trustees, officers or regular employees of the Company and its affiliates (without special compensation therefor). The Company has also retained Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for an estimated fee of approximately $10,000, plus out-of-pocket expenses. Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by notice from the person giving the proxy at any time before it is exercised. Any such notice of revocation should be provided in writing and signed by the shareholder in the same manner as the proxy being revoked and delivered to the Company's proxy tabulator.     Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials  
              In accordance with SEC regulations, the Company has made this proxy statement, the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and the Annual Report available to shareholders on the Internet. Shareholders may (i) access and review the Company's proxy materials, (ii) authorize their proxies, as described in "Voting," and/or (iii) elect to receive future proxy materials by electronic delivery, via the Internet address provided below. 
              This proxy statement, the Notice of Annual Meeting and the Annual Report are available at www.proxyvote.com.
   Electronic Delivery of Proxy Materials  
              Pursuant to the rules adopted by the SEC, the Company furnishes proxy materials by email to those shareholders who have elected to receive their proxy materials electronically. While the Company encourages shareholders to take advantage of electronic delivery of proxy materials, which helps to reduce the environmental impact of annual meetings and the cost associated with the physical printing and mailing of materials, shareholders who have elected to receive proxy materials electronically by email, as well as beneficial owners of Common Shares held by a broker or custodian, may request a printed set of proxy materials. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials contains instructions on how you can elect to receive a printed copy of the proxy statement and Annual Report. 
   Security Ownership of Management and Certain Beneficial Owners  
              The following table sets forth, as of the Record Date, the beneficial ownership of the trustee nominees, the Company's executive officers and trustees, each person known to the Company to beneficially own 5% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, and all of the Company's executive officers and trustees as a group. 
              Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and includes voting or investment power with respect to the Common Shares. There are no Common Shares subject to options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of October 17, 2018. Ownership information for those  persons who beneficially own 5% or more of the Common Shares is based upon information furnished by the Company's transfer agent and other information provided by such persons, if available.

   Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance  
              Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, the Company's trustees and executive officers, and any persons holding more than 10% of its Common Shares, are required to report their beneficial ownership and any changes therein to the SEC and the Company. Specific due dates for those reports have been established, and the Company is required to report herein any failure to file such reports by those due dates. Based on the Company's review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed by such persons and information provided by the Company's trustees and officers, the Company believes that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to such persons were timely filed.      PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF TRUSTEES         
              At the Annual Meeting, shareholders of the Company are being asked to consider the election of eight trustees of the Company. Pursuant to the Company's Third Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, the number of trustees on the Board may not be fewer than either the minimum number required by the Delaware General Corporation Law or three, except for a period of up to 60 days after the death, removal or resignation of a trustee pending the election of such trustee's successor, or greater than twelve. Trustees of the Company are elected annually for a term of one year, and serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. The Board is currently comprised of eight trustees. Each trustee below has been nominated for election by the Board to serve a one-year term until the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualified: (i) Michael C. Forman, (ii) William C. Sonneborn, (iii) Sidney R. Brown, (iv) Stephen T. Burdumy, (v) Gregory P. Chandler, (vi) Richard I. Goldstein, (vii) Charles P. Pizzi and (viii) Pedro A. Ramos. 
              Each trustee has agreed to serve as a trustee if elected and has consented to being named as a nominee. No person being nominated as a trustee is being proposed for election pursuant to any agreement or understanding between such person and the Company. 
              A shareholder can vote for, or withhold his or her vote from, any or all of the trustee nominees. In the absence of instructions to the contrary, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies to vote such proxy FOR the election of each of the trustee nominees named below. If any of the trustee nominees should decline or be unable to serve as a trustee, the persons named as proxies will vote for such other nominee as may be proposed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company. The Board has no reason to believe that any of the persons named will be unable or unwilling to serve. 
   Information about the Board and Trustee Nominees  
              The role of the Board is to provide general oversight of the Company's business affairs and to exercise all of the Company's powers except those reserved for the shareholders. The responsibilities of the Board also include, among other things, the oversight of the Company's investment activities, the quarterly valuation of the Company's assets, the oversight of the Company's financing arrangements and corporate governance activities. 
              A majority of the members of the Board are not "interested persons," as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), of the Company or FS/EIG Advisor, LLC, the Company's investment adviser ("FS/EIGAdvisor") and are "independent" as defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. These individuals are referred to as the Company's independent trustees (the "Independent Trustees"). Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act defines an "interested person" to include, among other things, any person who has, or within the last two years had, a material business or professional relationship with the Company. The members of the Board who are not Independent Trustees are referred to as interested trustees (the "Interested Trustees"). 
              The Board is currently comprised of eight trustees, six of whom are Independent Trustees. Messrs. Vague and Williams have not been nominated for reelection at the Annual Meeting. The Board has determined that the following trustees and trustee nominees are, or if applicable will be, Independent Trustees: Messrs. Brown, Burdumy, Chandler, Goldstein, Pizzi, Ramos Vague and Williams. Based upon information requested from each trustee concerning their background, employment and affiliations, the Board has affirmatively determined that none of the Independent Trustees has, or within the last two years had, a material business or professional relationship with the Company, other than in their capacity as a member of the Board or any Board committee or as a shareholder. If each of the trustee nominees is elected, the Board will be comprised of eight trustees, six of whom will be Independent Trustees.                In considering each trustee and the composition of the Board as a whole, the Board seeks a diverse group of experiences, characteristics, attributes and skills, including diversity in gender, ethnicity and race, that the Board believes enables a trustee to make a significant contribution to the Board, the Company and its shareholders. These experiences, characteristics, attributes and skills, which are more fully described below, include, but are not limited to, management experience, independence, financial expertise and experience serving as directors or trustees of other entities. The Board may also consider such other experiences, characteristics, attributes and skills as it deems appropriate, given the then-current needs of the Board and the Company. 
              These experiences, characteristics, attributes and skills relate directly to the management and operations of the Company. Success in each of these categories is a key factor in the Company's overall operational success and creating shareholder value. The Board believes that trustees who possess these experiences, characteristics, attributes and skills are better able to provide oversight of the Company's management and the Company's long-term and strategic objectives. 
              The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Independent Trustee nominees, Interested Trustee nominees and Independent Trustees who are not nominees, including a description of  the experience, characteristics, attributes and skills of each trustee nominee that led the Board to conclude that each such person should serve as a trustee.

 15 17    Risk Oversight and Board Structure  
   Board's Role in Risk Oversight  
              Through its direct oversight role, and indirectly through its committees, the Board performs a risk oversight function for the Company consisting of, among other things, the following activities: (1) at regular and special Board meetings, and on an ad hoc basis as needed, receiving and reviewing reports related to the performance and operations of the Company; (2) reviewing and approving, as applicable, the compliance policies and procedures of the Company; (3) reviewing investment strategies, techniques and the processes used to manage related risks; (4) overseeing the Company's investment valuation process through the Company's Valuation Committee that operates pursuant to authority assigned to it by the Board; (5) overseeing the Company's cyber security risk management program through the Company's Audit Committee; (6) meeting with representatives of, or reviewing reports prepared by or with respect to, key service providers, including the investment adviser, administrator, distributor, transfer agent, custodian and independent registered public accounting firm of the Company, to review and discuss the activities of the Company and to provide direction with respect thereto; (7) reviewing periodically, and at least annually, the Company's fidelity bond, trustees and officers, and errors and omissions insurance policies and such other insurance policies as may be appropriate; and (8) overseeing the Company's accounting and financial reporting processes, including supervision of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that they provide timely analyses of significant financial reporting and internal control issues. 
              The Board also performs its risk oversight responsibilities with the assistance of the Company's chief compliance officer. The Board receives a quarterly report from the chief compliance officer, who reports on, among other things, the Company's compliance with applicable securities laws and its internal compliance policies and procedures. In addition, the Company's chief compliance officer prepares a written report annually evaluating, among other things, the adequacy and effectiveness of the compliance policies and procedures of the Company and certain of its service providers. The chief compliance officer's report, which is reviewed by the Board, addresses at a minimum: (1) the operation and effectiveness of the compliance policies and procedures of the Company and certain of its service providers since the last report; (2) any material changes to such policies and procedures since the last report; (3) any recommendations for material changes to such policies and procedures as a result of the chief compliance officer's annual review; and (4) any material compliance matters that have occurred since the date of the last report about which the Board would reasonably need to know to oversee the Company's compliance activities and risks. The chief compliance officer also meets separately in executive session with the Independent Trustees at least once each year. In addition to compliance reports from the Company's chief compliance officer, the Board also receives reports from legal counsel to the Company regarding regulatory compliance and governance matters. 
   Board Composition and Leadership Structure  
              Mr. Forman, who is an "interested person" of the Company (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act), serves as both the chief executive officer of the Company and chairman of the Board. The Board believes that Mr. Forman, as co-founder and chief executive officer of the Company, is the trustee with the most knowledge of the Company's business strategy and is best situated to serve as chairman of the Board. The Company's Third Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as well as regulations governing business development companies ("BDCs") generally, requires that a majority of the Board be persons other than "interested persons" of the Company, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. 
              While the Company currently does not have a policy mandating a lead Independent Trustee, the Board believes that having an Independent Trustee fill the lead trustee role is appropriate. On March 9, 2015, the Board appointed Mr. Goldstein as lead Independent Trustee. The lead Independent Trustee, among other things, works with the Chairman of the Board in the preparation of the agenda for each  Board meeting and in determining the need for special meetings of the Board, chairs any meeting of the Independent Trustees in executive session, facilitates communications between other members of the Board and the chairman of the Board and/or the chief executive officer and otherwise consults with the chairman of the board and/or the chief executive officer on matters relating to corporate governance and Board performance. 
              The Board, after considering various factors, has concluded that its structure is appropriate given the current size and complexity of the Company. 
   Board Meetings and Attendance  
              The Board met 16 times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, including four regular quarterly meetings. Each trustee attended at least 75% of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board to which they were invited during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, with the exception of Mr. Brown. The Company does not have a formal policy regarding trustee attendance at an annual meeting of shareholders. None of the trustees attended the Company's annual meeting held on June 12, 2017. 
   Committees of the Board  
              The Board has established three standing committees of the Board, which consist of an Audit Committee, a Valuation Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
              The Board has not established a standing compensation committee because the executive officers of the Company do not receive any direct compensation from the Company. The Board, as a whole, participates in the consideration of trustee compensation and decisions on trustee compensation are based on, among other things, a review of data of comparable BDCs. 
   Audit Committee  
              The Board has established an Audit Committee that operates pursuant to a charter and consists of three members, including a Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee members are currently Messrs. Chandler (Chairman), Vague and Williams, each an Independent Trustee. The Board has determined that Mr. Chandler is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act. The primary function of the Audit Committee is to oversee the integrity of the Company's accounting policies, financial reporting process and system of internal controls regarding finance and accounting policies. The Audit Committee is responsible for selecting, engaging and discharging the Company's independent accountants, reviewing the plans, scope and results of the audit engagement with the Company's independent accountants, approving professional services provided by the Company's independent accountants (including compensation therefor), reviewing the independence of the Company's independent accountants and reviewing the adequacy of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee held six meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Each member of the Audit Committee who served on such committee during the 2017 fiscal year attended over 75% of the aggregate of all the meetings held during 2017, with the exception of Mr. Vague. The Audit Committee charter is available on the Company's website at www.fsinvestments.com. 
   Valuation Committee  
              The Board has established a Valuation Committee that operates pursuant to a charter and consists of four members, including a Chairman of the Valuation Committee. The Valuation Committee members are currently Messrs. Brown, Chandler and Goldstein (Chairman). The primary function of the Valuation Committee is to establish guidelines and make recommendations to the Board on matters relating to the valuation of the Company's investments. The Valuation Committee held four meetings during the fiscal  year ended December 31, 2017. Each member of the Valuation Committee who served on such committee during the 2017 fiscal year attended over 75% of the aggregate of all the meetings held during 2017. 
   Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee  
              The Board has established a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee that operates pursuant to a charter and consists of three members, including a Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members are currently Messrs. Pizzi and Williams. The primary function of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is to consider and make recommendations to the Board regarding certain governance matters, including selection of trustees for election by shareholders, selection of trustee nominees to fill vacancies on the Board or a committee thereof, development and revision, as appropriate, of applicable corporate governance documentation and practices and oversight of the evaluation of the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held three meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee who served on such committee during the 2017 fiscal year attended over 75% of the aggregate of all the meetings held during 2017. 
              With respect to nominating trustee candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee takes into consideration such factors as it deems appropriate. Among the qualifications considered in the selection of candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the following attributes and criteria of candidates: experience, including experience with investment companies and other organizations of comparable purpose, skills, expertise, diversity, including diversity of gender, race and national origin, personal and professional integrity, time availability in light of other commitments, conflicts of interest and such other relevant factors that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers appropriate in the context of the needs of the Board, including, when applicable, to enhance the ability of the Board or committees of the Board to fulfill their duties and/or to satisfy any independence or other applicable requirements imposed by law, rule, regulation or listing standard including, but not limited to, the 1940 Act and rules promulgated by the SEC. Each of the trustee nominees was approved by the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the entire Board. 
              The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates suggested by its members and other Board members, as well as the Company's management and shareholders. A shareholder who wishes to recommend a prospective nominee for the Board must provide notice to the Secretary of the Company in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws, which are described in greater detail under the heading "Submission of Shareholder Proposals." Nominees for trustee who are recommended by shareholders will be evaluated in the same manner as any other nominee for trustee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter is available on the Company's website at  www.fsinvestments.com. 
   Communications Between Shareholders and the Board  
              The Board welcomes communications from the Company's shareholders. Shareholders may send communications to the Board or to any particular trustee to the following address: c/o FS Energy and Power Fund, 201 Rouse Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19112. Shareholders should indicate clearly the trustee or trustees to whom the communication is being sent so that each communication may be forwarded directly to the appropriate trustee(s).     Information about Executive Officers Who Are Not Trustees  
              The following table sets forth certain information regarding the executive officers of the Company who are not trustees of the Company. Each executive officer holds their office until their successor is chosen and qualifies, or until their earlier resignation or removal.  23
   Code of Business Conduct and Ethics  
              The Company has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics (as amended and restated to date, the "Code of Business Conduct and Ethics") pursuant to Rule 17j-1 promulgated under the 1940 Act, which applies to, among others, its officers, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, as well as the members of the Board. The Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can be accessed via the Company's website at www.fsinvestments.com. In addition, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at www.sec.gov. Shareholders may also obtain a copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, after paying a duplication fee, by electronic request at the following e-mail address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SEC's Public Reference Section at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The Company intends to disclose any amendments to or waivers of required provisions of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on Form 8-K, as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
   Compensation Discussion and Analysis  
              The Company's executive officers do not receive any direct compensation from the Company. The Company does not currently have any employees and does not expect to have any employees. As an externally managed BDC, services necessary for the Company's business are provided by individuals who are employees of FS/EIG Advisor or its affiliates or by individuals who were contracted by FS/EIG Advisor, the Company or their respective affiliates to work on behalf of the Company. Each of the Company's executive officers is an employee of FS/EIG Advisor or its affiliates, and the day-to-day investment operations and administration of the Company's portfolio are managed by FS/EIG Advisor. In addition, the Company reimburses FS/EIG Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to the Company's administration and operations, including FS/EIG Advisor's allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments providing administrative services to the Company on behalf of FS/EIG Advisor in performing its obligations under the investment advisory and administrative services agreement between the Company and FS/EIG Advisor (the "FS/EIG Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement").     Trustee Compensation  
              The Company does not pay compensation to its trustees who also serve in an executive officer capacity for the Company or FS/EIG Advisor. 
              Trustees who do not also serve in an executive officer capacity for the Company or FS/EIG Advisor are entitled to receive annual cash retainer fees, fees for participating in in-person Board and Board committee meetings and annual fees for serving as a committee chairperson. These trustees are Messrs. Brown, Chandler, Goldstein, Pizzi, Vague and Williams. Mr. Goldstein also receives an annual retainer for his service as the lead Independent Trustee. 
              Amounts payable under the trustee fee arrangement are determined and paid quarterly in arrears as follows:

   Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions  
              The Company has procedures in place for the review, approval and monitoring of transactions involving the Company and certain persons related to the Company. For example, the Company's Code of  Business Conduct and Ethics generally prohibits any employee, officer or trustee from engaging in any transaction where there is a conflict between such individual's personal interest and the interests of the Company. Waivers to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for any executive officer or member of the Board must be approved by the Board and are publicly disclosed as required by applicable law and regulations. In addition, the Audit Committee is required to review and approve all transactions with related persons (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act). Prior to the occurrence of a liquidity event (which we define as (1) a listing of the Company's Common Shares on a national securities exchange, (2) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets either on a complete portfolio basis or individually followed by a liquidation or (3) a merger or another transaction approved by the Board in which the Company's shareholders likely will receive cash or shares of a publicly traded company), all future transactions with affiliates of the Company will be on terms no less favorable than could be obtained from an unaffiliated third party and must be approved by a majority of the Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees. 
   Compensation of the Investment Adviser and Dealer Manager  
              Historically, the Company received investment advisory and administrative services from FS Investment Advisor, LLC ("FS Advisor") pursuant to an investment advisory and administrative services agreement, dated as of August 10, 2012 (the "FSIA Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement"). The FSIA Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement was replaced by the FS/EIG Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement with FS/EIG Advisor, which is a newly-formed entity that is jointly owned by FS Advisor and EIG Global Energy Partners. FS Advisor previously engaged GSO Capital Partners, L.P. ("GSO") to act as the Company's investment sub-adviser pursuant to the investment sub-advisory agreement between FS Advisor and GSO, dated April 28, 2011 (the "GSO Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement"). GSO resigned as the Company's investment sub-adviser and terminated the GSO Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement effective April 9, 2018. 
              Pursuant to the FS/EIG Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement, FS/EIG Advisor is entitled to an annual base management fee based on the average weekly value of the Company's gross assets (equal to the total assets set forth on the Company's consolidated financial statements) and an incentive fee based on the Company's performance. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of the average weekly value of the Company's gross assets. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and is calculated based on the average weekly value of the Company's gross assets during the most recently completed calendar quarter. The incentive fee consists of two parts. The first part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the subordinated incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, equals 20.0% of the Company's "pre-incentive fee net investment income" for the immediately preceding quarter and is subject to a hurdle rate, expressed as a rate of return on adjusted capital, equal to 1.625% per quarter, or an annualized hurdle rate of 6.5%. As a result, FS/EIG Advisor will not earn this incentive fee for any quarter until the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.625%. For purposes of the subordinated incentive fee on income, "adjusted capital" means cumulative gross proceeds generated from sales of the Company's Common Shares (including proceeds from the Company's distribution reinvestment plan) reduced for distributions from non-liquidating dispositions of the Company's investments paid to shareholders and amounts paid for share repurchases pursuant to the Company's share repurchase program. Once the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, FS/EIG Advisor will be entitled to a "catch-up" fee equal to the amount of the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals 2.031%, or 8.125% annually, of adjusted capital. Thereafter, FS/EIG Advisor will be entitled to receive 20.0% of the Company's pre-incentive fee net investment income.                The incentive fee on capital gains payable under the FS/EIG Investment Advisory Agreement is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of such agreement). Such fee equals 20.0% of the Company's "incentive fee capital gains," which are the Company's realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception, calculated as of the end of the applicable period, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees on capital gains. The Company will accrue for the incentive fee on capital gains, which, if earned, will be paid annually. The Company will accrue the incentive fee on capital gains based on net realized and unrealized gains; however, the fee payable to FS/EIG Advisor will be based on realized gains and no such fee will be payable with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized. The terms of the incentive fee on capital gains were substantially similar under the FSIA Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement. 
              Effective April 9, 2018, FS/EIG Advisor agreed to waive incentive fees on income for a period of twelve months ending December 31, 2018. 
              Pursuant to the FS/EIG Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement, FS/EIG Advisor oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities and other administrative services. FS/EIG Advisor also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our shareholders and reports filed with the SEC. Pursuant to the FS/EIG Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement, the Company reimburses FS/EIG Advisor no less than monthly for expenses necessary to perform services related to the Company's administration and operations. The amount of this reimbursement is set at the lesser of (1) FS/EIG Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that the Company estimates it would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FS/EIG Advisor allocates the cost of such services to the Company based on factors such as assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics consistent with past practice (but solely to the extent such past practice is not inconsistent with the policies of FS/EIG Advisor). The Company does not reimburse FS/EIG Advisor for any services for which it receives a separate fee, or for rent, depreciation, utilities, capital equipment or other administrative items allocated to a controlling person of FS/EIG Advisor. 
              Historically, pursuant to the FSIA Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement, FS Advisor was entitled to an annual base management fee of 2.0% of the average weekly value of the Company's gross assets and an incentive fee based on the Company's performance. Pursuant to the GSO Sub-Advisory Agreement, GSO received 50% of all management and incentive fees payable to FS Advisor under the FSIA Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement with respect to each year. Effective January 1, 2018 FS Advisor contractually agreed to permanently waive 0.25% of its base management fee to which it was entitled under the FSIA Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement, so that the fee received equaled 1.75% of the average weekly value of the Company's gross assets. 
              The Company also reimbursed FS Advisor for expenses necessary to perform services related to the Company's administration and operations, including FS Advisor's allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments, the Company's sponsor and an affiliate of FS Advisor, providing administrative services to the Company on behalf of FS Advisor. The amount of this reimbursement for FS Advisor was set at the lesser of (1) FS Advisor's actual costs incurred in providing such services and (2) the amount that the Company estimated it would be required to pay alternative service providers for comparable services in the same geographic location. FS Advisor allocated the cost of such services to the Company based on factors such as assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics.                Also, under the FSIA Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement, the Company, either directly or through reimbursement to FS Advisor or its affiliates, was responsible for its organization and offering costs in an amount up to 1.5% of gross proceeds raised in the Company's continuous public offering. Organization and offering costs primarily included legal, accounting, printing and other expenses relating to the Company's continuous public offering, including costs associated with technology integration between the Company's systems and those of its selected broker-dealers, marketing expenses, salaries and direct expenses of FS Advisor's personnel, employees of its affiliates and others while engaged in registering and marketing the Common Shares, which included the development of marketing materials and presentations, training and educational meetings, and generally coordinating the marketing process for the Company. 
              Prior to satisfaction of the minimum offering requirement and for a period of time thereafter, FS Investments funded certain of the Company's organization and offering costs. Following this period, the Company has paid certain of its organization and offering costs directly and reimbursed FS Advisor for offering costs incurred by FS Advisor on the Company's behalf, including marketing expenses, salaries and other direct expenses of FS Advisor's personnel and employees of its affiliates while engaged in registering and marketing the Common Shares. Organization and offering costs funded directly by FS Investments were recorded by the Company as a contribution to capital. The offering costs were offset against capital in excess of par value on the consolidated financial statements and the organization costs were charged to expense as incurred by the Company. All other offering costs, including costs incurred directly by the Company, amounts reimbursed to FS Advisor for ongoing offering costs and any reimbursements paid to FS Investments for organization and offering costs previously funded, are recorded as a reduction of capital. Commencing January 1, 2016, offering costs incurred by the Company were deferred and amortized to expense over twelve months. Following the closing of the Company's continuous public offering to new investors in November 2016, all deferred offering costs were expensed. 
              During the year ended December 31, 2017, FS Investments did not fund any of the Company's organization and offering costs. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts remain reimbursable to FS Advisor and its affiliates under this arrangement. 
              The dealer manager for the Company's continuous public offering was FS Investment Solutions, LLC (formerly FS2 Capital Partners, LLC) ("FS Investment Solutions"), which is one of the Company's affiliates. Under the dealer manager agreement among the Company, FS Advisor and FS Investment Solutions (the "Dealer Manager Agreement"), FS Investment Solutions was entitled to receive sales commissions and dealer manager fees in connection with the sale of the Common Shares in the Company's continuous public offering, all or a portion of which were re-allowed to selected broker-dealers and financial representatives. The Dealer Manager Agreement terminated in connection with the closing of the Company's continuous public offering in November 2016. 
              The following table describes the fees and expenses accrued under the FS/EIG Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement, the FSIA Investment Advisory and Administrative Services Agreement and the dealer manager agreement during the six months ended June 30, 2018 and  2017 and the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollar amounts in the table below and the related notes are presented in thousands).  respectively, in administrative services expenses to FS Advisor during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.  
   Exemptive Relief  
              As a BDC, the Company is subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making its investments. For example, BDCs generally are not permitted to co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its affiliates in the absence of an exemptive order from the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may, simultaneously co-invest in transactions where price is the only negotiated term. In an order dated June 4, 2013 (the "Order"), the SEC granted exemptive relief permitting the Company, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions with certain affiliates of FS Advisor, including FS Investment Corporation, FS Investment Corporation II, FS Investment Corporation III, and FS Investment Corporation IV. Effective April 9, 2018 (the "JV Effective Date"), and in connection with the transition of advisory services to a joint advisory relationship with EIG, the Company's board of trustees has authorized and directed that the Company (i) withdraw from the Order, except with respect to any transaction in which the Company participated in reliance on the Order prior to the JV Effective Date, and (ii) rely on an exemptive relief order dated April 10, 2018, granted to certain other funds and accounts managed or previously managed by EIG or its affiliates which would permit the Company to participate in co-investment transactions with certain other EIG advised funds or accounts (the "EIG Order"). The Company believes that the ability to participate in co-investment transactions with other funds managed by EIG may permit it to allocate a higher percentage of the Company's portfolio to secured, directly negotiated investments that span the upstream, midstream, power/renewables, and infrastructure sectors. 
   Expense Reimbursement  
              Pursuant to the Expense Reimbursement Agreement, FS Investments agreed to reimburse the Company for expenses in an amount that is sufficient to ensure that no portion of the Company's distributions to shareholders will be paid from its offering proceeds or borrowings. However, because certain investments the Company may make, including preferred and common equity investments, may generate dividends and other distributions to the Company that are treated for tax purposes as a return of capital, a portion of the Company's distributions to shareholders may also be deemed to constitute a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent that the Company may use such dividends or other distribution proceeds to fund its distributions to shareholders. Under those circumstances, FS Investments will not reimburse the Company for the portion of such distributions to shareholders that represent a return of capital for tax purposes, as the purpose of the expense reimbursement arrangement is not to prevent tax-advantaged distributions to shareholders.                Under the Expense Reimbursement Agreement, FS Investments agreed to reimburse the Company quarterly for expenses in an amount equal to the difference between the Company's cumulative distributions paid to its shareholders in each quarter, less the sum of the Company's net investment company taxable income, net capital gains and dividends and other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent such amounts are not included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) in each quarter. 
              Pursuant to the Expense Reimbursement Agreement, the Company has a conditional obligation to reimburse FS Investments for any amounts funded by FS Investments under such agreement if (and only to the extent that), during any fiscal quarter occurring within three years of the date on which FS Investments funded such amount, the sum of the Company's net investment company taxable income, net capital gains and the amount of any dividends and other distributions paid to the Company on account of preferred and common equity investments in portfolio companies (to the extent not included in net investment company taxable income or net capital gains) exceeds the distributions paid by the Company to its shareholders; provided, however, that (i) the Company will only reimburse FS Investments for expense support payments made by FS Investments with respect to any calendar quarter beginning on or after July 1, 2013 to the extent that the payment of such reimbursement (together with any other reimbursement paid during such fiscal year) does not cause "other operating expenses" (as defined below) (on an annualized basis and net of any expense support payments received by the Company during such fiscal year) to exceed the lesser of (A) 1.75% of the Company's average net assets attributable to its common shares for the fiscal year-to-date period after taking such payments into account and (B) the percentage of the Company's average net assets attributable to its common shares represented by "other operating expenses" during the fiscal year in which such expense support payment from FS Investments was made (provided, however, that this clause (B) shall not apply to any reimbursement payment which relates to an expense support payment from FS Investments made during the same fiscal year) and (ii) the Company will not reimburse FS Investments for expense support payments made by FS Investments if the aggregate amount of distributions per share declared by the Company in such calendar quarter is less than the aggregate amount of distributions per share declared by the Company in the calendar quarter in which FS Investments made the expense support payment to which such reimbursement relates. The Company is not obligated to pay interest on the payments it receives from FS Investments. "Other operating expenses" means the Company's total "operating expenses" (as defined below), excluding base management fees, incentive fees, organization and offering expenses, financing fees and costs, interest expense, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. "Operating expenses" means all operating costs and expenses incurred, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for investment companies. 
              The Expense Reimbursement Agreement was terminated on the JV Effective Date. The Company's conditional obligation to reimburse FS Investments pursuant to the terms of the Expense Reimbursement Agreement survived the termination of the agreement. As of the JV Effective Date, the Company has entered into a new expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement with FS/EIG Advisor (the "FS/EIG Expense Reimbursement Agreement"), on substantially similar terms. There can be no assurance that the FS/EIG Expense Reimbursement Agreement will remain in effect or that FS/EIG Advisor will reimburse any portion of the Company's expenses in future quarters. FS/EIG Advisor may terminate the FS/EIG Expense Reimbursement Agreement at any time. 
              During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company did not accrue any expense reimbursements from FS Investments or FS/EIG Advisor. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company accrued $18,220 (expressed in thousands) for expense reimbursements that FS Investments agreed to offset against management fees and subordinated income incentive fees payable by the Company to FS Advisor. As of June 30, 2018, the Company had no reimbursements due from FS Investments or FS/EIG Advisor.                As discussed above, under the Expense Reimbursement Agreement, amounts reimbursed to the Company by FS Investments may become subject to repayment by the Company in the future. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company did not pay any amounts in expense recoupments to FS Investments. As of June 30, 2018, $28,104 (expressed in thousands) of reimbursements may become subject to repayment by the Company to FS Investments in the future. 
              The following table reflects the expense reimbursement payments from FS Investments to the Company as of June 30, 2018 that may become subject to repayment by the Company to FS Investments (expressed in thousands in the table below and the notes that follow):

   Potential Conflicts of Interest  
              The members of the senior management and investment teams of FS/EIG Advisor serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as the Company does, or of investment vehicles managed by the same personnel, including in similar or other capacities for the investment advisers to future investment vehicles affiliated with FS Investments or EIG Global Energy Partners. In serving in these multiple and other capacities, they may have obligations to other clients or investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which may not be in the Company's best interests or in the best interest of the Company's shareholders. The Company's investment objectives may overlap with the investment objectives of such investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles. For example, the Company relies on FS/EIG Advisor to manage its day-to-day activities and to implement its investment strategy. FS/EIG Advisor, FS Investments, EIG Global Energy Partners and certain of their affiliates are presently, and plan in the future to continue to be, involved with activities which are unrelated to the Company. As a result of these activities, FS/EIG Advisor, FS Investments, EIG Global Energy Partners, their employees and certain of their affiliates will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between the Company and other activities in which they are or may become involved, including the management of other investment vehicles. 
              FS/EIG Advisor's affiliates and its personnel are simultaneously providing investment advisory services to other affiliated entities. FS/EIG Advisor may determine that it is appropriate for the Company and one or more other investment accounts managed by FS/EIG Advisor's affiliates to participate in an investment opportunity. To the extent the Company is able to make co-investments with investment accounts managed by FS/EIG Advisor or its affiliates, these co-investment opportunities may give rise to conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest among the Company and the other participating accounts. In addition, conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest may also arise in determining which investment opportunities should be presented to the Company and other participating accounts. To  mitigate these conflicts, FS/EIG Advisor will seek to execute such transactions on a fair and equitable basis and in accordance with its allocation policies, taking into account various factors, which may include: the source of origination of the investment opportunity; investment objectives and strategies; tax considerations; risk, diversification or investment concentration parameters; characteristics of the security; size of available investment; available liquidity and liquidity requirements; regulatory restrictions; and/or such other factors as may be relevant to a particular transaction. As affiliates of FS Investments and EIG Global Energy Partners currently serve as the investment adviser to other entities and accounts, it is possible that some investment opportunities will be provided to such other entities and accounts rather than to the Company. 
   Required Vote  
              Each trustee shall be elected by a plurality of all the votes cast at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy, provided that a quorum is present. Plurality voting means that the trustee nominee with the most votes for a particular seat is elected for that seat. Because all of the trustee nominees are running unopposed, all eight trustee nominees are expected to be elected as trustees of the Company, as all nominees who receive votes in favor will be elected. Each share may be voted for as many individuals as there are trustee nominees and for whose election the share is entitled to be voted. Abstentions will not be included in determining the number of votes cast and, as a result, will have no effect on the Trustee Proposal. Common Shares represented by broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and thus have no effect on the Trustee Proposal. Shareholders may not cumulate their votes. 
    THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE   TRUSTEE NOMINEES.              PROPOSAL 2: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT   REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM         
              RSM US LLP, 518 Township Line Road, Suite 300, Blue Bell, Pennsylvania 19422, has been appointed by the Board to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. RSM US LLP acted as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 through 2017. The Company knows of no direct financial or material indirect financial interest of RSM US LLP in the Company. A representative of RSM US LLP will be available by telephone to answer questions during the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so. 
              Although action by the shareholders on this matter is not required, the Audit Committee and the Board believe it is appropriate to seek shareholder ratification of this selection in light of the role played by the independent registered public accounting firm in reporting on the Company's consolidated financial statements. If a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting and the appointment of RSM US LLP as independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 is not ratified by the shareholders, the adverse vote will be considered by the Audit Committee in determining whether to appoint RSM US LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the succeeding fiscal year. 
   Fees  
              Set forth in the table below are audit fees, audit related fees, tax fees and all other fees billed to the Company by RSM US LLP for professional services performed for the Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: 
   Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures  
              The Company's Audit Committee reviews, negotiates and approves in advance the scope of work, any related engagement letter and the fees to be charged by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for audit services and permitted non-audit services for the Company and for permitted non-audit services for FS/EIG Advisor and any affiliates thereof that provide services to the Company if such non-audit services have a direct impact on the operations or financial reporting of the Company. Any requests for audit, audit-related, tax and other services that have not received general pre-approval must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific pre-approval in accordance with its pre-approval policy, irrespective of the amount, and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally, pre-approval is considered at regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee. However, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve  services performed by RSM US LLP to management. All of the audit and non-audit services described above for which RSM US LLP invoiced the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. 
   Audit Committee Report  
              As part of its oversight of the Company's financial statements, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with both management and RSM US LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Company's consolidated financial statements filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Management advised the Audit Committee that all financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and reviewed significant accounting issues with the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also discussed with RSM US LLP the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 16, Communication with Audit Committees, as amended, and by the Auditing Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
              The Audit Committee has established a pre-approval policy that describes the permitted audit, audit-related, tax and other services to be provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Pursuant to the policy, the Audit Committee pre-approves the audit and non-audit services performed by RSM US LLP in order to assure that the provision of such service does not impair the firm's independence. 
              Any request for audit, audit-related, tax and other services that have not received general pre-approval must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific pre-approval in accordance with its pre-approval policy, irrespective of the amount of fees associated with such services, and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee. However, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by RSM US LLP to management. 
              The Audit Committee received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from RSM US LLP required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding RSM US LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with RSM US LLP its independence. The Audit Committee has reviewed the audit fees paid by the Company to RSM US LLP. It has also reviewed non-audit services and fees to assure compliance with the Company's and the Audit Committee's policies restricting RSM US LLP from performing services that might impair its independence. 
              Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 be included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee also recommended the appointment of RSM US LLP to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.

              The material in this Audit Committee report is not "soliciting material," is not deemed "filed" with the SEC, and is not to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the  Securities Act or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing. 
   Required Vote  
              The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy, provided a quorum is present, is required to ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Abstentions will not be included in determining the number of votes cast and, as a result, will not have any effect on the result of the vote with respect to the Accountant Proposal. Because brokers will have discretionary authority to vote for the ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm in the event that they do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the Common Shares, there will not be any broker non-votes with respect to the Accountant Proposal. 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" RATIFICATION OF THE  APPOINTMENT OF RSM US LLP AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM OF THE COMPANY FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING  DECEMBER 31, 2018.     SUBMISSION OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS         
              The Company's Second Amended and Restated Bylaws require the Company to hold an annual meeting of the shareholders for the election of trustees and the transaction of any business within the powers of the Company on a date and at a time set by the Board. In addition, the Company will hold special meetings as required or deemed desirable, or upon the request of holders of at least 10% of the Company's outstanding Common Shares entitled to vote. Any shareholder that wishes to submit a proposal for consideration at a subsequent meeting of the shareholders should mail the proposal promptly to the Secretary of the Company. Any proposal to be considered for submission to shareholders must comply with Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act and must be received by the Company in accordance with the Company's Second Amended and Restated Bylaws and any other applicable law, rule or regulation regarding trustee nominations. When submitting a nomination to the Company for consideration, a shareholder must provide certain information that would be required under applicable SEC rules, including the following minimum information for each trustee nominee: full name, age and address; class, series and number of Common Shares beneficially owned by the nominee, if any; the date such Common Shares were acquired and the investment intent of such acquisition; whether such shareholder believes the individual is an "interested person" of the Company, as defined in the 1940 Act; and all other information required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of trustees in an election contest or is otherwise required. 
              Pursuant to the Company's Second Amended and Restated Bylaws, for a trustee nomination or other business to be considered for the next annual meeting of shareholders, notice must be provided in writing and delivered to the Secretary of the Company at the Company's principal executive office before July 28, 2019, but not before June 28, 2019, which such dates are the 90th day and 120th day, respectively, prior to the first anniversary of the date of mailing of the notice for the 2018 meeting of shareholders. In the event that the date of mailing of the notice for the Company's 2019 annual meeting of shareholders is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the first anniversary of the date of mailing of the notice for 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, which is expected to mailed on or about October 26, 2018, a notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of mailing of the notice for the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders and not later than close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of mailing of the notice for the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of mailing of the notice for the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders is first made. The timely submission of a proposal does not guarantee its inclusion. 
              Any shareholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy for the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders must be received by the Company on or before June 28, 2019 (or if the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders is held more than 30 days before or after the first anniversary of the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, the Company must receive such proposal within a reasonable time prior to the Company beginning to print and distribute proxy materials for such meeting). Such proposals must also comply with the requirements as to form and substance established by the SEC if such proposals are to be included in the proxy statement and form of proxy. Any such proposal should be mailed to: FS Energy and Power Fund, 201 Rouse Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19112, Attention: Secretary.
