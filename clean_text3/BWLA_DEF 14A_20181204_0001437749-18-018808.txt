There is no cumulative voting. The advisory resolution on executive compensation, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" resolution, will be voted on by the Class A and B stockholders together and is non-binding on the Board of Directors. Although the vote is non-binding, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee will review the voting results in connection with their ongoing evaluation of the Company's compensation program. 
At the meeting of stockholders the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes thereat will constitute a quorum, permitting the conduct of business at the meeting. Abstentions will be included in the number of votes present at the meeting for purposes of a quorum but will not be counted as a vote for or against any matter submitted to the stockholders for a vote.
Shares on a broker's proxy lack discretionary authority to vote for any matter at the meeting and will not be considered as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the outcome of any vote, but will be considered present for quorum purposes.
ANNUAL REPORT
A copy of the annual report to shareholders for the fiscal year ending July 1, 2018, which has been furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission, is enclosed with this proxy statement.
PROPOSAL NO. 1
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The holders of the Class A Common Stock are entitled to elect two Directors of the Corporation and the holders of the Class B Common Stock are entitled to elect five Directors of the Corporation to hold office until the next Annual Meeting of the stockholders and until their successors shall have been elected and qualified. The Board of Directors recommends the election of the nominees listed below as Directors. Mr. Warren T. Braham, a director for 40 years, resigned in March 2018 due to health reasons. Mr. Braham was the Chairman of both the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. Mr. Arthur Bill has replaced him as Chairman of both committees. In June 2018, Ms. Nancy Hull, an independent director, was appointed as a member to the Audit and Compensation Committees. All of the nominees are presently Directors and all constituted the Board of Directors for the past year following the retirement of Warren T. Braham. In the event any of these nominees becomes unavailable for election, it is intended that the proxies will be voted for the election of such other persons as management shall designate. Management has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unavailable.
The following table also shows the beneficial ownership of shares of security ownership of management of the Corporation's Class A and Class B Common Stock as of October 16, 2018 by all directors, executive officers and all directors and executive officers as a group.

Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight
Mr. Goldberg has served as President and Chief Executive Officer since 1976. The Corporation's By-Laws do not require a separate position of Chairman, rather those responsibilities are vested in the office of president. The Board currently believes that Mr. Goldberg is uniquely qualified to serve as President and in the role of leader of the Board given his long history and experience with the Company, his significant ownership interest in the Company and the current size of the Company and the Board.
The Board, and the Audit Committee which is comprised solely of independent directors, have oversight responsibilities of the material operational risk of the Company. A basic part of risk management is not only understanding the risks of the Company and steps necessary to manage those risks, but understanding what level of risk is appropriate for the Company. The CEO and CFO both provide relevant information to the Audit Committee and Board on various types of identified material financial, business and legal risks and strategy for mitigation of those risks to which the Company may be subject. Currently the Board has determined that its leadership and risk oversight are appropriate for the Company.

The Corporation is required to describe in this proxy statement whether it has knowledge that any person required to file such a report may have failed to do so in a timely manner. In this regard, the Corporation believes all of its directors and officers have satisfied such filing requirements. The foregoing is based upon information provided to the Corporation by the persons required to make such filings and the Corporation's own review of such filings.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS
NYSE American Corporate Governance Provisions
Because approximately 53.6% of the total voting power of the outstanding Class A and Class B Common Stock of the Company is owned by Leslie H. Goldberg, President and a director of the Company, and his sister, Merle Fabian, a director of the Company, the Company is deemed to be a "controlled company" (i.e., more than 50% of the total voting power is held by an individual or group) under the rules of the NYSE American. The Exchange's listing rules provide that "controlled companies" are exempt from those exchange corporate governance provisions that would otherwise call for (i) a majority of the members of the Board of Directors to be independent, (ii) the process of making director nominations to be overseen by independent directors and (iii) executive compensation determinations to be overseen by independent directors. Of the Company's seven directors, Messrs. Sher and Bill and Ms. Hull are deemed to be "independent" directors under the rules of the NYSE American. None of the independent directors receive compensation from the Company other than directors' fees for service on the Board or its Committees.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors, Officers and Employees
The Company has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for directors, officers and employees in accordance with rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NYSE American. A copy is available online at www.bowlamericainc.com and will be provided to any stockholder upon written request to the Secretary of the Corporation, 6446 Edsall Road, Alexandria, VA 22312.
Policy Regarding Stockholder Communication With Directors
Those properly identified as stockholders desiring to communicate with a director, the independent directors as a group or the full Board may address such communication to the attention of the Secretary of the Corporation at the Company's executive offices, and such communication will be forwarded to the intended recipient or recipients.
Director Nomination Process
The Company's Board of Directors does not have a nominating committee or other committee that performs similar functions. The Company is exempt from the NYSE American provision calling for independent director oversight of director nominations in view of its status as a controlled company. All members of the Company's Board of Directors as a group participate in the consideration of director nominees. The Board of Directors has proposed in this Proxy Statement a slate of directors which was decided upon by the Board. Any person wishing to propose a substitute director to be considered by the Board for inclusion in the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement may do so in writing, for receipt prior to September 1, 2019 to the Board at the address of the Company's principal executive offices. The Board members individually make their judgment as to the nominees' ability to contribute to the survival and success of the Company. In selecting directors, the Board considers factors that are in the Company's best interest and those of our stockholders, including diversity of backgrounds, experiences and competencies that our Board of Directors desires to have represented. There will not be any difference between the manner in which the Board evaluates a nominee recommended by a stockholder and the manner in which the Board evaluates any other director nominee.
Board Committees and Meetings
The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee and Compensation Committee, each of which consists of Arthur H. Bill, Chairman, Allan L. Sher, and Nancy E. Hull. Each of Messrs. Sher, Bill, and Ms. Hull is an "independent" director within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NYSE American Exchange. The Board of Directors, which meets quarterly, met 4 times during the fiscal year ended July 1, 2018. Each director attended all of such meetings in person or via telephone. The Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, which occasionally meet in joint session, held 4 meetings and 2 meetings, respectively, during the fiscal year. All members attended all such meetings. The Company has a policy of encouraging directors to attend each Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All of the Company's directors attended the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on December 5, 2017. Independent members of the Board of Directors conduct meetings on a regular basis, including at least annually in executive session without the presence of non-independent directors and management.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has been established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The purpose of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company is to assist the Board in its oversight of the integrity of the Company's financial statements, the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the independent auditor's qualifications, independence and performance and the performance of the Company's internal audit function. The Audit Committee is composed entirely of independent directors as determined under the SEC, the NYSE American Exchange corporate governance standards and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to Audit Committee members.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee is Mr. Arthur Bill. The two other members are Mr. Allan Sher, and Ms. Nancy Hull. Each of the members is financially literate, independent and able to devote sufficient time to serving on the Audit Committee. The Board has determined that Mr. Sher is the audit committee financial expert as defined in SEC rules adopted pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
The Audit Committee has adopted an Audit Committee Charter. The charter is available at www.bowlamericainc.com and will be provided upon request to the Secretary of the Corporation, 6446 Edsall Road, Alexandria, VA 22312.
The Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee has the responsibility for negotiating the compensation of Leslie H. Goldberg, who is the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Corporation. The President is responsible for determining the compensation of the other executive officers and all other management employees.
The Chairman of the Compensation Committee is Mr. Arthur Bill and the two other members are Mr. Allan Sher, and Ms. Nancy Hull, all of whom are independent directors.
The Compensation Committee performs its duties by reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the President. The Compensation Committee then evaluates the performance of the President based on these goals and objectives. The Compensation Committee then uses such evaluations in making its compensation recommendation to the Company's Board.
The Board of Directors has not adopted a charter for the Compensation Committee.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATMENTS
The Audit Committee met with senior management and the independent auditors quarterly during fiscal 2018 to discuss the adequacy of disclosure controls and procedures, the adequacy of the Company's internal controls and the certifications made by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that are required by the SEC.
The Audit Committee: (1) reviewed and discussed with management Bowl America's audited financial statements for the year ended July 1, 2018, (2) discussed with the independent auditors the matters required by AU380 "Communication with Audit Committees", (3) received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1, "Independence Discussions with Audit Committees", as adopted by the Public Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3600T and Rule 3526, (4) considered whether the provision of non-audit services is compatible with maintaining the auditors' independence, and (5) discussed with the independent accountant the independent accountant's independence.
Based on the review and discussion, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements for the year ended July 1, 2018, be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for filing with the SEC.
The foregoing report is submitted by the members of the Audit Committee.

ADVISORY RESOLUTION ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
In accordance with Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and as a matter of good corporate governance, we are asking stockholders to approve the following advisory resolution:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Bowl America Incorporated (the "Company") approve, on an advisory basis, the fiscal 2018 compensation of the Company's named executive officers disclosed in the Executive Compensation Section, the Executive Officer Employment Agreements Section, the Disclosure Regarding Termination and Change in Control Provisions, the Summary Compensation Table and the related notes and narrative in the Proxy Statement for the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
This advisory resolution, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" resolution, is non-binding on the Board of Directors. Although non-binding, the Board and the Compensation Committee will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation program.
Our Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the approval of the advisory resolution on executive compensation.
AUDIT FEES AND AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL PRACTICES
MN Blum LLC was the independent auditor for the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements as of July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017. The Company's Audit Committee has engaged MN Blum LLC as the independent auditor for Bowl America Inc. as the Company's independent auditor for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.
AUDIT FEES - For professional services rendered for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements and reviews of quarterly financial statements included in the Company's Forms 10-Q during the fiscal years ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017, MN Blum LLC billed Bowl America $118,000 each year. These fees include consultations normally provided in relation to the annual audits and reviews of documents filed with the SEC.
AUDIT-RELATED FEES – No audit-related fees were billed by MN Blum LLC during the fiscal years ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017.
TAX FEES – For professional tax services rendered to Bowl America, MN Blum LLC billed $29,000 each year for the fiscal years ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017. Tax services generally include federal and state tax compliance.
ALL OTHER FEES – In addition to the fees described above, for each fiscal year ended July 1, 2018 and July 2, 2017 MN Blum LLC billed $5,000 for reviews required by non-regulatory bodies.
The Audit Committee pre-approved all of the services described above.
The Board of Directors and its Audit Committee have considered all of the professional services rendered by MN Blum LLC, and were of the opinion that these services had no effect on the independence of said accounting firm. The Audit Committee, prior to authorizing such firm to provide any non-audit services, determined that such services would have no effect on the independence of said accounting firm. A representative of MN Blum LLC is expected to attend the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement and to respond to appropriate questions.
AUDIT COMMITTEE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR PRE-APPROVAL OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR SERVICES – The following describes the Audit Committee's policies and procedures regarding pre-approval of the engagement of the Company's independent auditor to perform audit services as well as permissible non-audit services for the Company.
For audit services, the independent auditor will provide the Committee with an engagement letter during the first quarter of each fiscal year outlining the scope of the audit services proposed to be performed in connection with the audit of the fiscal year. If agreed to by the Committee, the engagement letter will be formally accepted by the Committee at an Audit Committee meeting held as soon as practicable following receipt of the engagement letter. The independent auditor will submit to the Committee for approval an audit services fee proposal after acceptance of the engagement letter.
For non-audit services, Company management may submit to the Committee for approval the list of non-audit services that it recommends the Committee engage the independent auditor to provide for the fiscal year. The list of services must be detailed as to the particular service and may not call for broad categorical approvals. Company management and the independent auditor will each confirm to the Committee that each non-audit service on the list is permissible under all applicable legal requirements. In addition to the list of planned non-audit services, a budget estimating non-audit service spending for the fiscal year may be provided. The Committee will consider for approval both the list of permissible non-audit services and the budget for such services. The Committee will be informed routinely as to the non-audit services actually provided by the independent auditor pursuant to this pre-approval process.
The independent auditor must ensure that all audit and non-audit services provided to the Company have been approved by the Committee. The Chief Financial Officer of the Company is responsible for tracking all independent auditor fees against the budget for such services and reports annually to the Audit Committee.
1987 EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN
The Board of Directors adopted the Bowl America Incorporated 1987 Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") on March 31, 1987, and secured a satisfactory ruling from the Internal Revenue Service. All employees of the Corporation and certain subsidiaries become participants on the last day of the fiscal year or December 31 following the date on which they have been employed for one year with at least l,000 hours of service. The Board of Directors of the Corporation has the discretion to declare each year a cash amount or a specified number of shares of Class A Common Stock that will be contributed to the ESOP. On June 26, 2018 the Board of Directors made a contribution of $113,000 including any expenses incurred by the ESOP which were paid by the Corporation for fiscal year 2018. Corporation contributions are allocated to employees who are participants on the last day of the fiscal year through a formula based upon the participant's compensation. Employee contributions to the ESOP are not permitted. The trustees of the ESOP, Richard Davis Sr., Director of Facilities for Bowl America and Albert Young, Assistant Controller of the Corporation have the exclusive authority to manage the trust in which ESOP contributions are deposited and are obligated to invest the cash portion of ESOP contributions primarily in the Corporation's Common Stock. The trustees are permitted to borrow money to purchase Common Stock for the trust.
As of the last day of the plan year, eligible participants are credited with their proportionate share of the trust's assets. A participant's interest vests and is nonforfeitable if while employed by the Corporation or participating subsidiaries he or she attains at least 65 years of age, becomes totally or permanently disabled or dies. Also, a participant's interest vests and is nonforfeitable to the extent and in the percentage set forth in a schedule in the ESOP. Under this schedule, a participant's interest is 100 percent vested after six years of service. Vested amounts are distributed upon attaining normal retirement age, retirement, disability, or death. If termination of service occurs prior to the occurrence of those events, payment may be made or deferred until the participant attains age 65. As determined by the participant, distributions are made in cash or Common Stock.
The Corporation may terminate or amend the ESOP but not in such a way as would adversely affect any participant's vested benefits. The trustees have the right to vote the Class A Common Stock in the trust subject to the direction of each participant with respect to the shares allocated to his or her account.
As of the end of fiscal 2018, there were 759 participants in the ESOP. No Executive Officer except Cheryl Dragoo currently participates in the ESOP.
PROFIT SHARING PLAN
The Board of Directors adopted a profit sharing plan for its employees which became effective on June 29, 1975, and which has been approved by the Internal Revenue Service. The following table shows the name of each person named in the Summary Compensation Table that participates in the profit sharing plan (Column A), the amount allocated to their accounts in trust from the contributions of the Corporation for the fiscal year ending July 1, 2018 under its employees' profit sharing plan in Column (B), from contributions since the inception of the plan in Column (C), and from other accruals under the plan in Column (D), which accruals consist of a share of forfeitures resulting from employees covered by the plan who leave the Corporation's employment and earnings on plan investments.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 A       B       C       D  
 Cheryl Dragoo       $2,667       $41,408       $394,083  
[END TABLE]
Directors as such do not participate in the Corporation's employee profit sharing plan. All employees, including officers of the Corporation, are eligible to commence participation under the Plan after completing a minimum of 1,000 hours continuous employment during the Corporation's fiscal year. Actual payment of accounts to participants or their beneficiaries is deferred until retirement, disability, or death. In the event of termination of employment, the vested portion, if any, is paid. Accounts become vested after two years of service according to a graduated scale until 100% is vested after six years of service. No estimate can be made of the annual benefits on the retirement of a particular person because the amount set aside each year depends on the earnings of the Corporation for such year. The amount of the contribution is within the discretion of the Corporation's Board of Directors and can only be paid from profits. The Board of Directors made a contribution of $113,000 including any expenses incurred by the plan paid by the Corporation for the fiscal year 2018. The contribution is made to a trust (Bowl America Incorporated Profit Sharing Trust). Contributions of the Corporation to the plan and forfeitures of terminated members are allocated in proportion to compensation paid by the Corporation. Employees exercise independent control over the investment of funds allocated in their accounts. Earnings or losses are posted to the accounts daily. Employees may change their investment choices at any time.
PROPOSALS OF SECURITY HOLDERS
Proposals of stockholders intended to be presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting, which presently is expected to be held in December 2019, must comply with Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act and be received by the Secretary of the Corporation, 6446 Edsall Road, Alexandria, Virginia 22312 no later than June 27, 2019, in order for them to be considered for inclusion in the 2019 Proxy Statement.
