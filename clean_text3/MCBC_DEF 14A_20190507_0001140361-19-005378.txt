Q.  Why am I receiving these materials?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  The Company's Board of Directors is providing these proxy materials to you in connection with its                              solicitation of proxies for use at the Macatawa Bank Corporation 2019 annual meeting of shareholders.

Your proxy, which you may use to vote on the                              proposals described in this proxy statement, is also enclosed.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  We began sending and delivering this proxy statement to our shareholders on approximately March                            21, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  What proposals will be voted on at the annual meeting?  
[END TABLE]

In addition, any other business that properly comes before the meeting will be considered and voted on at the               meeting.  As of the date of this proxy statement, we are not aware of any other matters to be considered and voted on at the meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  How does the Company's Board of Directors recommend that I vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  Your Board of Directors recommends that you vote, as follows:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  FOR election of all director nominees;

  (3)  ONE YEAR on Proposal 3;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  Who may vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  You may vote at the annual meeting if you were a shareholder of record of Macatawa common stock at the close of business on March 11, 2019.  Each shareholder is                            entitled to one vote per share of Macatawa common stock on each matter presented for a shareholder vote at the meeting.  As of March 11, 2019, there were 34,034,149 shares of Macatawa common stock outstanding.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  How do I vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  If you properly sign and return the enclosed proxy, the shares represented by that proxy will be voted at the annual meeting and at any adjournment of the meeting.                             If you specify a choice on the proxy, your shares will be voted as specified. If you do not specify a choice, your shares will be voted for election of all director nominees, for Proposal 2, "one year" on Proposal 3, and for                            Proposal 4.  If any other matter comes before the meeting, your shares will be voted in the discretion of the persons named as proxies on the proxy.  
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  How do I vote if I hold my shares in "street name"?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  If you hold your shares in                                "street name," which means that your shares are registered in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee (which we collectively refer to as your "broker"), your broker must vote your street name shares in the manner you                                direct if you provide your broker with proper and timely voting instructions.  Please use the voting forms and instructions provided by your broker or its agent.  These forms and instructions typically permit you to give                                voting instructions by telephone or Internet if you wish.  If you are a street name holder and want to change your vote, you must contact your broker.  Please note that you may not vote shares held in street name in person at                                the annual meeting unless you request and receive a valid proxy from your broker.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  Can I change my mind after I return my proxy?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  Yes.  You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the meeting by doing any of the following three things:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● by delivering written notice of revocation to Macatawa's Secretary, Jon W. Swets, at 10753 Macatawa Drive, Holland, Michigan 49424;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● by delivering a proxy bearing a later date than the proxy that you wish to revoke; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● by attending the meeting and voting in person.  
[END TABLE]
Merely attending the meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.  Your latest dated valid vote that we                 receive is the vote that we will count.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  Does my broker have discretionary authority to vote my shares?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  If you do not provide your broker with voting instructions, then your broker has discretionary authority to vote your shares on certain "routine" matters.  We                              expect that Proposal 4 will be considered a routine matter and your broker will have discretionary authority to vote your shares on that proposal.  Your broker will not have discretionary authority to vote your shares on                              election of directors, Proposal 2 and Proposal 3 as these are not considered routine matters.  It is important that you promptly provide your                                broker with voting instructions if you want your shares voted on election of directors, Proposal 2 and Proposal 3.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  What are broker non-votes?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  Generally, broker non-votes occur when shares held by a broker in street name for a beneficial owner are not voted with respect to a particular proposal because the broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and the broker lacks                                discretionary voting power to vote those shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  What is the quorum requirement for the annual meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  To conduct business at the annual meeting, a quorum of shareholders must be present.  The presence in person or by properly executed proxy of the holders of a                              majority of all issued and outstanding shares of Macatawa common stock entitled to vote at the meeting is necessary for a quorum.  To determine whether a quorum is present, we will include shares that are present or represented                              by proxy, including abstentions and shares represented by a broker non-vote on any matter.  
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  What vote is necessary to approve the proposals?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  Election of Directors.  A plurality of the shares voting is required to elect                          directors.  This means that, if there are more nominees than positions to be filled, the nominees who receive the most votes will be elected to the open director positions.  Broker non-votes and other shares that are not voted in                          person or by proxy will not be included in the vote count.  
[END TABLE]
Advisory Approval of Executive               Compensation.  Proposal 2 will be approved if a majority of the shares that are voted on the proposal at the meeting are voted in favor of the proposal.  Abstentions, broker non-votes and other shares that are not voted on Proposal 2             in person or by proxy will not be included in the vote count.
Advisory Vote on the Frequency               of Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation.  The choice (one year, two years, or three years) that receives the most votes voted on at the meeting will be approved.  Abstentions, broker non-votes and other shares that are not voted             on Proposal 3 in person or by proxy will not be included in the vote count.
Ratification of Appointment of               BDO USA, LLP as Independent Auditors.  Proposal 4 will be approved if a majority of the shares that are voted on the proposal at the meeting are voted in favor of the proposal.  Abstentions, broker non-votes and other shares that are             not voted on Proposal 4 in person or by proxy will not be included in the vote count.
Required Vote for Other               Matters.  We do not know of any other matters to be presented at the meeting.  Generally, any other proposal to be voted on at the meeting would be approved if a majority of the shares that are voted on the proposal at the meeting are             voted in favor of the proposal.  Abstentions, broker non-votes and other shares that are not voted on the proposal in person or by proxy would not be included in the vote count.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  May the annual meeting be adjourned?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  Yes. The shareholders present at the meeting, in person or by proxy, may, by a majority vote, adjourn the meeting despite the absence of a quorum.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, our Bylaws allow the Chairman of the Board to adjourn the meeting if a quorum is not present, if disorder arises or if             he determines that no further matters may properly come before the meeting.
If a quorum is not present at the meeting, or if the necessary votes to approve any of the proposals described in             this proxy statement have not been obtained, we expect to adjourn the meeting to solicit additional proxies.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy or voting instruction card?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  It means your shares are registered differently or are in more than one account. Please provide voting instructions for all proxies and voting instruction cards you                          receive.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  Where can I find the voting results of the annual meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  We will announce preliminary                            voting results at the annual meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that we will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days after the date of the annual meeting.

Use of Terms
In this proxy statement, "we," "us," "our," the "Company" and "Macatawa" refer to Macatawa Bank Corporation, the "Bank" refers to Macatawa Bank, and "you"         and "your" refer to each shareholder of Macatawa Bank Corporation. Table of Contents
Proposal 1
Election of Directors
The Governance Committee and the Board of Directors have nominated the following individuals for election as a director of Macatawa for a three-year term         expiring at the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders:
Charles A. Geenen
Robert L. Herr
Michael K. Le Roy
Biographical information concerning the nominees appears below under the heading "The Board of Directors."
The proposed nominees are willing to be elected and to serve as a director.  If any nominee becomes unable to serve or is otherwise unavailable for         election, which we do not anticipate, the incumbent Board of Directors may select a substitute nominee.  If a substitute nominee is selected, the shares represented by your proxy will be voted for the election of the substitute nominee.  If a         substitute is not selected, all proxies will be voted for the election of the remaining nominees.
Your Board of Directors and Governance Committee,which consists entirely of independent directors, recommend that you vote FOR election of         each nominee as a director. Table of Contents
Proposal 2
Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation
Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that the Company provide its shareholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding, advisory         vote on the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K in this proxy statement.
This proposal gives you as a shareholder the opportunity to approve or not approve the compensation of the named executive officers through the following         resolution:
"Resolved, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402         of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby approved."
The Company believes that our executive compensation programs appropriately align our named executive officers' incentives with shareholder interests and         are designed to attract and retain high quality, executive talent. We believe that our executive compensation policies are and have been conservative within the industry and in comparison with the compensation policies of competitors in the markets         that we serve.  We also believe that both the Company and shareholders benefit from responsive corporate governance policies and dialogue.
This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the named executive officers and the         philosophy and compensation programs described in this proxy statement.
The vote is advisory and not binding upon the Company, the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, and may not be construed as overruling a         decision by the Board or creating an additional fiduciary duty of the Board. However, the Board of Directors and Compensation Committee value the opinions of our shareholders and will take into account the outcome of the vote when making future         decisions regarding executive compensation.
The Company's current policy is to provide shareholders with an opportunity to approve the compensation of the named executive officers on an annual basis.  The next such vote will occur at the 2020 annual             meeting of shareholders.
Your Board of Directors and Compensation Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors, recommend that you vote FOR Proposal 2. Table of Contents
Proposal 3
Advisory Vote on the Frequency of Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Company to obtain, at least once every six years, a shareholder vote on the frequency of advisory approval of the         compensation of the named executive officers.
This proposal gives the Company's shareholders the opportunity to determine whether the frequency of advisory approval of the compensation of the named         executive officers will occur every one, two or three years.  Shareholders may also abstain from voting on this proposal.
The frequency – one year, two years or three years – that receives the greatest number of votes will be considered to have been approved by the         shareholders.  This vote is advisory and not binding upon the Company and its Board of Directors.  However, the Board of Directors and Compensation Committee value the opinions of the shareholders and will take into account the outcome of the vote         when considering the frequency of the advisory approval of the compensation of the named executive officers.
After careful consideration, the Board of Directors has decided to recommend that shareholders vote in favor of holding advisory approval of the         compensation of the named executive officers every year.  The Board supports an annual advisory approval because we believe that this will provide our shareholders with the most consistent and clear communication channel for shareholder concerns         about the compensation of the named executive officers.
Your Board of Directors and Compensation Committee,which consists entirely of independent directors,recommend that you vote ONE YEAR on Proposal 3. Table of Contents
Proposal 4
Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditors
The Audit Committee has appointed BDO USA, LLP as the Company's independent auditors to audit the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries         for the year ending December 31, 2019, and to perform such other appropriate audit services as may be approved by the Audit Committee.  The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee propose and recommend that shareholders ratify the appointment of         BDO USA, LLP to serve as the Company's independent auditors for the year ending December 31, 2019.
More information concerning the relationship of the Company with its independent auditors appears below under the headings "Audit Committee," "Independent         Auditors" and "Audit Committee Report."
If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of BDO USA, LLP, the Audit Committee will consider a change in auditors for the next year.
Your Board of Directors and Audit Committee,which consists entirely of independent directors,recommend that you vote FOR Proposal 4. Table of Contents
Board of Directors
General
The Board of Directors currently consists of 10 directors.  Following the annual meeting of shareholders, the Board of Directors will consist of 9         directors.  The Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with each class as nearly equal in number as possible.  Each class of directors serves a three-year term, with the term of one class expiring at the annual meeting in each successive         year.
Qualifications and Biographical Information
The Governance Committee has not established specific, minimum qualifications for director nominees.  The Governance Committee will consider candidates for         director who have the skills, experiences (whether in business or in other areas such as public service or academia), particular areas of expertise, and other characteristics to enable them to best contribute to the success of the Company.          Director nominees should possess the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity and values and must be committed to representing the long-term interests of shareholders.  Additionally, director nominees should have sufficient time to         effectively carry out their duties.
Biographical information concerning the directors and the nominees for election to the Board of Directors, and the specific experience, qualifications,         attributes and skills that led to the conclusion of the Governance Committee and the Board of Directors that the person should serve as a director, is presented below.  Except as otherwise indicated, each of these persons has had the same principal         position and employment for over five years.

Meetings of the Board of Directors
The Company's Board of Directors had twelve meetings in 2018.  During 2018, each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the         Board and Board committees on which he or she served.  The Company encourages members of its Board of Directors to attend the annual meeting of shareholders.  All of the directors serving at May 8, 2018 attended the Company's 2018 annual meeting         held on that date.
Meetings of Independent Directors
The Company's independent directors meet periodically in executive sessions without any management directors in attendance.  If the Board of Directors         convenes a special meeting, the independent directors may hold an executive session if the circumstances warrant.
Director Nominations
The Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and recommending qualified individuals to serve as members of the Company's Board of Directors.          The Governance Committee has not established any specific, minimum qualifications for director nominees.  The Governance Committee will consider candidates for director who have the skills, experiences (whether in business or in other areas such as         public service or academia), particular areas of expertise, and other characteristics to enable them to best contribute to the success of the Company.  Director nominees should possess the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity and         values and must be committed to representing the long-term interests of shareholders.  Additionally, director nominees should have sufficient time to effectively carry out their duties.  The Governance Committee considers candidates based on their         experience and expertise as well as demographics to appropriately reflect the diversity and makeup of our community and shareholders.  At least annually, the Governance Committee must assess the specific experience, qualifications, attributes,         skills and contributions of each director and nominee to determine whether each director and nominee should serve, or continue to serve, as a director in light of the Company's business and structure. Table of Contents
The Company's Articles of Incorporation contain certain procedural requirements applicable to shareholder nominations of directors.  Shareholders entitled         to vote in the election of directors may nominate a person to serve as a director if they provide written notice to the Company not later than sixty nor more than ninety days prior to the first anniversary date of the preceding year's annual         meeting, in the case of an annual meeting, and not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the date on which notice of the meeting was first mailed to shareholders, in the case of a special meeting.  The notice must include         (1) the name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination and of the person or persons nominated, (2) a representation that the shareholder is a current record holder of stock entitled to vote at the meeting and will continue         to hold those shares through the date of the meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice, (3) a description of all arrangements between the shareholder and each         nominee and any other person pursuant to which the nomination is to be made by the shareholder, (4) the information regarding each nominee as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed under Regulation 14A of the Securities         Exchange Act of 1934 had the nominee been nominated by the Board of Directors, and (5) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Company if elected.  Shareholders may propose nominees for consideration by submitting the required         information in writing to: Jon W. Swets, Secretary, Macatawa Bank Corporation, 10753 Macatawa Drive, Holland, MI 49424-3119.
The Governance Committee will consider every shareholder nomination of a director that complies with the procedural requirements of the Company's Articles         of Incorporation and report each such nomination and the Governance Committee's recommendation to the full Board of Directors.  The Governance Committee may also, in its discretion, consider shareholders' informal recommendation of possible         nominees.
The Board of Directors and Governance Committee do not currently use the services of any third party search firm to assist in the identification or         evaluation of board member candidates.  However, the Governance Committee has the authority to use such a firm in the future if it deems necessary or appropriate.
Leadership Structure
Currently, the Company's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are separate positions in recognition of the difference between the two roles.          The Chairman of the Board leads the Board of directors in adopting an overall strategic plan for the Company, sets the agenda for the meetings of the Board of Directors, presides over all meetings of the Board of Directors, and provides guidance to         the Chief Executive Officer.  The Chief Executive Officer implements the strategic plan for the Company as adopted by the Board of Directors and leads the Company, its management and its employees on a day-to-day basis.  Because of these         differences, the Company currently believes keeping the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer as separate positions is the appropriate leadership structure for the Company. Table of Contents
Oversight of Risk Management
The Company is exposed to a variety of risks and undertakes at least annually an enterprise risk management review to identify and evaluate these risks and         to develop plans to manage them effectively.  During 2018, the Bank's enterprise risk management responsibilities were managed by the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Credit Officer and the Chief Risk Officer.
The Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee under authority and responsibility delegated by the Board of Directors, play a key role in the oversight of         the Company's risk management.  To that end, the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee must periodically require and receive direct reports from the persons holding the following positions (which may be combined):

The Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Credit Officer and Chief Risk Officer meet with the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis to         discuss the risks facing Macatawa, and highlight any new risks that may have arisen since they last met. Table of Contents
The Company has appointed the Chief Risk Officer as the key individual within the Company responsible for independent oversight of the Risk Management         process, with direct functional and administrative reporting to the Audit Committee.

The Loan Review function reports functionally to the Audit Committee and administratively to the Chief Risk Officer.
Majority Voting
The Board believes that the Company and its shareholders are best served by having directors who enjoy the confidence of the Company's shareholders.  If         any director receives a greater number of votes "withheld" than votes "for" election in an uncontested election at an annual meeting of shareholders (a "Majority Withheld Vote"), then the Board will presume that such director does not have the full         confidence of the shareholders.  A director receiving a Majority Withheld Vote must promptly offer his or her resignation from the Board to the Governance Committee upon certification of the shareholder vote.  The resignation will be effective if         and when accepted by the Governance Committee.
The Governance Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors, will promptly consider the acceptance of the director's offer of resignation.          The director at issue will not participate in the consideration of or the vote on the offer of resignation.
The Governance Committee is expected to consider and vote upon acceptance or rejection of the offer of resignation in its sole discretion not later than         the day of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board, which is held more than one week after the annual meeting of shareholders.  The Governance Committee is expected to evaluate whether or not the Majority Withheld Vote represented a         failure of confidence in the director by the shareholders.  Examples of reasons why the Governance Committee may decline to accept a resignation include, but are not limited to, a conclusion that votes were withheld because of an identifiable cause         that has subsequently been adequately addressed or a belief that the Majority Withheld Vote is attributable to technical issues or deficiencies in the proxy solicitation process.
The Company will disclose the Governance Committee's decision regarding the director's offer of resignation (and the reasons for rejecting the resignation         offer, if applicable) in an appropriate filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Term Limits
The Company does not have predetermined term limits for directors.  The Governance Committee will evaluate each director's continued services on the Board         annually.  In connection with each nomination for re-election, each director will have an opportunity to confirm his or her desire to continue as a member of the Board. Table of Contents
Retirement
The Board of Directors believes that it is generally appropriate for directors to retire before the age of 70.  The Board of Directors recognizes, however,         that the wisdom, experience and contribution of a director aged 70 years or older could benefit the Board and the Governance Committee may, in its discretion, nominate a director for re-election after his or her 70th birthday.  In 2019,         the Governance Committee and the Board of Directors specifically considered that director Robert L. Herr would be greater than 70 years of age at the date of the annual meeting of shareholders to be held on May 7, 2019.  The Governance Committee         and the Board of Directors concluded that the wisdom, experience and contribution of Mr. Herr will continue to benefit the Board of Directors and determined that it was appropriate to nominate him for re-election.  As such, in Proposal 1, Mr. Herr         has been nominated for election to an additional three year term of service as director ending in 2022.
Change in Employment or Independence
Directors recognize that they have been chosen for nomination or appointment to the Board of Directors in part because of the knowledge and insight they         gain on a continuing basis from their active employment in their current positions and for the public respect they bring to the Company and its Board of Directors because of the positions they hold in the business community.  A director who         experiences a material change in his or her employment status must inform the Governance Committee as soon as practicable and is expected to promptly offer his or her resignation as a director to the Governance Committee.  The Governance Committee         will consider and vote upon acceptance or rejection of the director's offer in its sole discretion, excluding the affected director from consideration of and voting on acceptance of the resignation.
An independent director who ceases to be an independent director under Nasdaq Listing Rules for any reason must inform the Governance Committee as soon as         practicable and is expected to promptly offer his or her resignation as a director to the Governance Committee.  The Governance Committee will consider and vote upon acceptance or rejection of the director's offer in its sole discretion, excluding         the affected director from consideration of and voting on acceptance of the resignation.
Other Board Memberships
Each executive officer of the Company must notify the Governance Committee before serving as a member of the board of directors of any other business         organization.  The Governance Committee will review executive officers' membership on external boards of directors at least annually.  The Governance Committee may limit the directorships for any executive officer if it believes that they will         interfere with the executive officer's responsibilities to the Company.
Shareholder Communication with Directors
The Company provides a process for shareholders to send communications to the Board of Directors.  Such communications should be directed to Jon W. Swets,         Secretary, Macatawa Bank Corporation, 10753 Macatawa Drive, Holland, Michigan 49424.  The Secretary of the Company, or the Secretary's delegates, have discretion to adopt policies and procedures to implement and administer this communication         process.  Shareholder communications may be directed to the Board of Directors, a committee of the Board of Directors or to specific individual directors.  The Secretary has discretion to screen and not forward to directors, communications which         the Secretary determines in his or her discretion to be communications unrelated to the business or governance of the Company and its subsidiaries, commercial solicitations, offensive, obscene or otherwise inappropriate.  The Secretary must,         however, collect and organize all shareholder communications which are not forwarded, and such communications must be available to any director upon request. Table of Contents
External Communications
The Board believes that the Chairman of the Board and management of the Company should speak for the Company.  Individual Board members who are not the         Chairman of the Board or officers should not communicate with outside parties regarding corporate matters unless authorized by the Board, the Chairman of the Board or management.  If so authorized, Board members may communicate with various         constituencies that are involved with the Company, subject to applicable law and the Company's policies regarding the disclosure of information.
Code of Ethics
As part of its continuing efforts to improve corporate governance, in 2011 the Board of Directors adopted a new and comprehensive Code of Ethics.  The code         is intended to deter wrongdoing and to promote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in documents the Company files with, or submits to, the SEC and in all public communications made by the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Prompt internal reporting to designated persons of violations of the code.

The Code of Ethics is available upon request by writing to the Chief Financial Officer, Macatawa Bank Corporation, 10753 Macatawa Drive, Holland, Michigan         49424 and is also available on the Company's website, www.macatawabank.com, under the "Investor Relations/Company Overview/Governance Documents" section.
Problem Resolution Policy
The Company strongly encourages employees to raise possible ethical issues.  We maintain a problem resolution hotline to receive reports of ethical         concerns or incidents, including, without limitation, concerns about accounting, internal controls or auditing matters.  Users of the hotline may choose to remain anonymous.  We prohibit retaliatory action against any individual for raising         legitimate concerns or questions, or for reporting suspected violations.
Board Diversity
The Board believes that the Company and its shareholders are best served by having a Board of Directors that brings a diversity of education, experience,         skills, and perspective to Board meetings.  The Governance Committee and the Board of Directors will consider such diversity in identifying director nominees.  There are no specific or minimum qualifications or criteria for nomination for election         or appointment to the Board. Table of Contents

[END TABLE]
Audit Committee Approval Policies
The Audit Committee has direct authority and responsibility to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided to the Company by the         Company's independent auditors.  In accordance with this authority and responsibility, the Audit Committee pre-approved all services performed by the Company's independent auditors during 2018 and 2017.
All pre-approvals of audit and permissible non-audit services granted by the Audit Committee must be reasonably detailed as to the particular services to         be provided and must not result in the delegation of the Audit Committee's pre-approval responsibilities to management.  Pre-approvals of services granted by the Audit Committee must not use monetary limits as the only basis for pre-approval and         must not provide for broad categorical approvals.  Any pre-approval policies or practices adopted by the Audit Committee must be designed to ensure that the Audit Committee knows what particular services it is being asked to pre-approve so that it         can make a well-reasoned assessment of the impact of the service on the independent auditors' independence.
The Audit Committee may delegate to one or more designated members of the committee the authority to grant pre-approvals of permissible non-audit         services.  The decisions of any member to whom this authority is delegated must be reported to the full Audit Committee.
Non-audit services provided by the Company's independent auditors must not include any of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the Company;

Appointment of Independent Auditor
The Audit Committee has direct authority and responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of any accounting firm         engaged for the purpose of issuing an audit report and performing other audit, review or attestation services for the Company.  The Audit Committee is also directly responsible for the resolution of disagreements between management and the         independent auditors regarding financial reporting.  The independent auditors report directly to the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee must review the performance of the independent auditors of the Company at least annually.  The Audit Committee must also review the         independence, effectiveness and objectivity of the independent auditors of the Company at least annually.
The Audit Committee has direct authority and responsibility to oversee the independence of the independent auditors.  The Audit Committee must require         receipt of, and must review, a formal written statement of the independent auditors delineating all relationships between the independent auditor and the Company, consistent with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.  The         Audit Committee must discuss with the independent auditor the independent auditor's independence, including a discussion of any disclosed relationships or services that may impact the objectivity and independence of the independent auditor.  If the         Audit Committee is not satisfied with the independent auditors' assurances of independence, it must take or recommend to the full Board of Directors appropriate action to ensure the independence of the independent auditors.
The Audit Committee must discuss with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by applicable legal, regulatory, and stock exchange         listing rule requirements relating to the conduct of the audit and any qualifications in the independent auditors' audit opinion.
The Audit Committee has appointed BDO USA, LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31,         2019.  BDO USA, LLP also served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2018.  BDO USA, LLP began serving as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended         December 31, 2010.  Representatives of BDO USA, LLP are expected to be present at the annual meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions from         shareholders.

Audit Committee Report
The following is the report of the Audit Committee with respect to the Company's audited financial statements as of and for the year         ended December 31, 2018. The information contained in this report shall not be deemed "soliciting material" or otherwise considered "filed" with the SEC, and such information shall not be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the         Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates such information by reference in such filing.
The Audit Committee has reviewed, and discussed with management and the independent auditors, the Company's audited financial statements as of and for the         year ended December 31, 2018, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, and the independent auditors' attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  The         Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 1301.   The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the         letter from the independent auditors required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent auditors' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent auditors the         independent auditors' independence.  This included consideration of the compatibility of non-audit services with the auditors' independence.
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be         included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Management is responsible for the Company's financial reporting process, including its systems of internal control, and for the preparation of financial         statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The Company's independent auditors are responsible for auditing those financial statements.  Our responsibility is to monitor and review these processes. It is not our duty or         our responsibility to conduct auditing or accounting reviews or procedures, and therefore our discussions with management and the independent auditors do not assure that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted         accounting principles.  We have relied, without independent verification, on management's representation that the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and on the representations of         the independent auditors included in their report on the Company's financial statements.

Executive Compensation
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
This section discusses material elements of the Company's compensation of the named executive officers and other matters relevant to the Company's         compensation program.
Overview. The Compensation Committee (the "Committee")         assists the board of directors in discharging its responsibilities relating to executive compensation and in fulfilling its responsibilities relating to Macatawa's compensation and benefit programs and policies. The Committee has the authority and         responsibility to, among other things: determine and oversee the Company's executive compensation philosophy, structure, policies and programs; assess whether the Company's compensation structure establishes appropriate incentives for officers and         employees; administer or make recommendations to the Board of Directors with respect to compensation and benefit plans; approve stock incentive awards under the Company's stock incentive plans; and recommend to the Board of Directors for approval         the base salary and long-term incentive compensation award opportunities of the executive officers. The Committee currently consists of six directors, all of whom are independent under Nasdaq Listing Rules. The Committee receives recommendations         from Macatawa's Chief Executive Officer regarding the compensation of executive and senior management (other than the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer).
Comparative Analysis. In 2018, the Company engaged         McLagan, AON Hewitt, a compensation consultant, to provide a market analysis of the Company's compensation practices. This analysis covered base salary, annual incentives, total cash compensation, long-term incentives, and total compensation for         approximately 159 positions (approximately 370 individuals) including positions comparable to those of the 5 named executive officers. The analysis included a comparison of Macatawa's compensation programs against financial service companies that         are similar to the Company in size and scope of operations as reported in the McLagan Financial Services Compensation Survey.  This consultant was not selected or engaged by the Compensation Committee and was not engaged to and did not provide         advice or recommendations to the Compensation Committee and, although the Compensation Committee had access to the data in the study and considered that data in its compensation decisions, this consultant was not engaged for the purpose of         developing or providing an analysis for the Compensation Committee.  McLagan did not provide any other services to Macatawa in 2018.  Because of the objective nature and broader purpose of this survey, the Compensation Committee does not consider         any risk of conflict of interest to be a material consideration.
In 2018, the Company considered this information to help inform its decision-making process to establish total compensation levels that it believes are         competitive and in line with the market.
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives.  Macatawa's         philosophy is to maximize long-term shareholder return consistent with its commitments to maintain the safety and soundness of the institution and provide the highest possible level of service at a fair price to the customers and communities that         it serves. To do this, the Committee believes the Company must provide competitive salaries and appropriate incentives to achieve long-term shareholder return.  The Company's executive compensation policies are designed to achieve four primary         objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· provide incentives for achievement of long-term shareholder return;  
· align the interests of management with shareholders to encourage continuing increases in shareholder value;  
· attract and retain well-qualified executives who will lead the Company and inspire superior performance; and  
· provide incentives for achievement of corporate goals and individual performance.  
[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents
The Committee's goal is to effectively balance salaries with compensation that is performance-based commensurate with an executive officer's individual         management responsibilities and contribution to corporate objectives. The portion of total compensation that is based on corporate performance and long-term shareholder return increases as an executive officer's responsibilities increase.
The Committee has considered the potential risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices for all employees and does not believe the         risks from those compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Committee believes that the Company's total compensation program drives the appropriate behaviors in management, is         competitive in the marketplace and fairly distributes the earnings of the Company to the shareholders and to the employees.
The Company currently provides its shareholders with the opportunity to cast an annual advisory vote to approve executive compensation (a "Say-on-Pay         proposal"). At the Company's annual meeting of shareholders held in May 2018, a substantial majority of the votes cast on the Say-on-Pay proposal at that meeting were voted to approve the Company's executive compensation for 2017. The Committee         believes this affirms shareholders' support of the Company's approach to executive compensation. In light of the voting results, the Company did not materially change its approach in 2018. The Committee will continue to consider the outcome of         advisory votes on the Company's Say-on-Pay proposals when making future compensation decisions for the named executive officers.
Elements of Compensation
Macatawa's executive compensation program has consisted primarily of the following elements: (i) base salary and benefits; (ii) awards of longer-term         equity-based incentives in the form of restricted stock beginning in 2012; and (iii) participation in the Company's retirement plans. All executive and senior management of Macatawa and the Bank are eligible to participate in the same executive         compensation plans that are available to the Chief Executive Office. Each component of compensation is intended to accomplish one or more of the compensation objectives discussed above.
Base Salary and Benefits. To attract and retain officers         with exceptional abilities and talent, annual base salaries are set to provide competitive levels of compensation. The Committee determines base salaries by considering a variety of factors, including individual and corporate performance and         achievements, the strategic value of the position and current compensation practices of other peer group bank companies. While the Committee considers all of these factors, it ultimately determines annual base salaries in its judgment, based on         what it considers to be reasonable and appropriate for the Company.
Longer-Term Equity-Based Incentives. A portion of         compensation is also linked to individual and corporate performance through restricted stock compensation awards. Other forms of equity-based compensation may be awarded by the Committee. Awards under Macatawa's equity-based compensation plan are         designed to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· more closely align the executive officer with shareholder interests;  
· reward executive officers for individual and corporate performance and for building shareholder value; and  
· provide executive officers the opportunity to build ownership in the Company.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee believes that stock ownership by management is beneficial to shareholders. The Committee administers all aspects of equity based compensation         and also has authority to determine the individuals to whom and the terms upon which equity-based compensation awards are granted. Table of Contents
In 2012, the Company implemented a market-competitive formula approach for awarding equity-based compensation. For each named executive officer, the         Committee established a target for equity-based compensation based on a percentage of base salary. For 2018, the target percentage of base salary for each named executive officer was as follows: Mr. Haan – 20%, Mr. Hankinson - 18%, Mr. Swets - 18%,         Mr. Hoeksema – 18%, Ms. Walcott - 13%.
The Committee considers each named executive officer's position and its attendant duties, responsibilities and authority when setting the target equity         compensation value. The Company calculates the number of longer-term equity-based incentive awards granted utilizing the fair value of the awards as of the date of grant in accordance with the same standard applied for financial accounting         purposes.
Ultimately, the Committee retains discretion to award equity-based compensation at levels it determines in its judgment based on a number of factors,         including individual and corporate performance.
In 2018, the Committee granted 25,288 restricted shares to the named executive officers. The restricted shares vest equally over three years.  Shares will         vest if the executive officer is fully employed with the Company at the time of vesting.  In 2018, the Company granted restricted stock awards to its named executive officers in numbers of shares chosen so the grant date market value of those         shares would approximate the grant date market value of restricted stock awards granted to the same officers in 2017.
Retirement Plans. Macatawa has a 401(k) savings plan with         a safe harbor match that covers all employees. The Committee believes that Macatawa's retirement plans encourage long-term commitment by the Company's officers and assist Macatawa in attracting and retaining talented executives. The Company makes         matching contributions equal to 100% of the first 3% of employee contributions and 50% of the employee contributions in excess of 3%, up to 5%.
Discretionary Bonuses. The Committee may award         discretionary bonuses to executive officers on a case-by-case basis to reward the individual for the Company's overall performance, taking into consideration individual performance.  No discretionary bonuses were approved for the named executive         officers in 2017 or 2018.
Change in Control Agreements.  During 2015, the Committee and the Board of Directors approved and Macatawa entered into Change in Control Agreements with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Haan, and Chief Financial         Officer, Mr. Swets.  On July 21, 2016, the Company entered into Amended and Restated Change in Control Agreements with Mr. Haan and Mr. Swets.  The only change in these agreements was to clarify them by capping the combined amount of cash bonus         paid and grant date fair value of restricted stock awarded to be included in the formula for any year used for the purpose of computing the severance pay benefit payable to the individual to an amount not exceeding 75% of base salary for that         year.  On February 1, 2017, the Committee and the Board of Directors approved and Macatawa entered into a Change in Control Agreement with its Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Hankinson.  The terms of these agreements are discussed in detail under the         heading "Retirement, Termination or Change in Control Payments" below.  The Change in Control Agreements are "double trigger" agreements, which provide for specified payments and benefits in the event that a change in control of Macatawa occurs and         the individual officer's employment is terminated in connection with the change in control.  The Committee and the Board of Directors believe that change in control agreements for its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief         Operating Officer are appropriate because if the Board of Directors determines in the future to pursue a strategy which will result in a change in control of the corporation, these three officers would be most likely to have their employment         adversely affected by a change in control and would be essential to an effective and successful conclusion of a change in control transaction.  The double trigger format was selected because it was considered to be the format most consistent with         corporate and shareholder interests. Table of Contents
Compensation Recovery Policy.  On July 21, 2016, the Committee recommended and the Board of Directors adopted a compensation recovery policy.  This policy, commonly called a "clawback policy", requires that in the         event that the Corporation is required to prepare an accounting restatement of its financial statement due to material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirement, the Board of Directors will require reimbursement or forfeiture of any         excess incentive compensation that was granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part on the attainment of a financial reporting measure during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the corporation was required         to prepare an accounting restatement.  The Company did not grant any form of compensation that was earned or vested based on attainment of specific financial reporting measures in 2017 or 2018.  A copy of the compensation recovery policy is         available in the "Investor Relations/Company Overview/Governance Documents" section of our website, www.macatawabank.com.

Median to Principal Executive Officer Compensation "Pay Ratio"
Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires disclosure of the ratio of the Company's principal executive officer's total annual compensation to the         Company's "median employee" total annual compensation, also known as "pay ratio".  For 2018, our "median employee" was determined by taking the roster of all persons employed by the Company or its subsidiaries, whether as full-time, part-time,         seasonal, or temporary employees, as of December 31, 2018, excluding the principal executive officer, and using annual compensation amounts, identifying the individual at the midpoint of the roster.  Annual compensation for this purpose included         base compensation, cash bonus, stock awards, equity compensation, term insurance premiums and 401(k) employer contributions.  Based on this analysis, total median employee compensation amounted to $43,555 for 2018.  Compared to our principal         executive officer total annual compensation of $556,854 for 2018 disclosed above, the pay ratio was 12.8 to 1 for 2018.

Retirement, Termination or Change in Control Payments
The Company sponsors a 401(k) savings plan which covers substantially all employees. Employees may elect to contribute to the plan up to the maximum         percentage of compensation and dollar amount subject to statutory limitations.  The Company makes matching contributions equal to 100% of the first 3% of employee contributions and 50% of the employee contributions in excess of 3%, up to 5%.
Named executive officers may participate in the Company's 401(k) savings plan, which will provide payment following retirement dependent on contributions         by the officer and the Company during their term as an employee. Named executive officers are not eligible for any other Company benefits following resignation, retirement, termination of employment or change in control.
Upon a change of control (as defined in the Macatawa Bank Corporation Stock Incentive Plan of 2015) of the Company, or upon termination of employment         because of death or disability, all unvested restricted stock awards would fully vest and all restrictions would immediately cease.  Assuming a change of control of the Company occurred on December 31, 2018, the number of shares of restricted stock         that would have vested and the value that would have been realized by each named executive officer upon such vesting is reported in the columns entitled "Number of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested" and "Market Value of Shares or Units         That Have Not Vested" in the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" table above, and is here incorporated by reference.
On June 22, 2015, the Company entered into Change in Control Agreements with two of the Company's executive officers, its Chief Executive Officer, Ronald         L. Haan and its Chief Financial Officer, Jon W. Swets (each, an "Executive").  These agreements were amended and restated effective July 21, 2016.  On February 1, 2017, the Company entered into a similar Change in Control Agreement with another         executive officer, Craig A. Hankinson, who was appointed to the newly created position of Chief Operating Officer.  Pursuant to the Change in Control Agreements, the Executive will receive severance benefits if, within six months before or         twenty-four months after a change in control of the Company, the Executive is terminated by the Company without cause or terminates employment for good reason.  Upon the occurrence of this event, Mr. Haan would be entitled to a lump sum cash         payment equal to 2.0 times his average annual compensation, and Mr. Hankinson and Mr. Swets would be entitled to a lump sum cash payment equal to 1.5 times their average compensation.  For this purpose, average compensation is equal to the three         year average of annual base salary, cash bonuses, if any, and the fair market value of restricted stock awards averaged over the last three completed calendar years.  The combined amount of any cash bonus paid and grant date fair value of         restricted stock awarded to be included in the formula for any year for the purpose of computing average compensation is limited to an amount not exceeding 75% of base salary for that year.  If the Company implements a cash incentive bonus plan,         the Executive would also receive a prorated cash bonus for the year of termination based on target performance for the year in which the termination occurs. Each Change in Control Agreement includes a Section 280G cap that limits payments under the         agreement as necessary to avoid tax penalties under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.  If a change in control had occurred and the employment of Mr. Haan, Mr. Hankinson and Mr. Swets had been terminated effective December 31, 2018, Mr.         Haan would have been entitled to a single lump sum payment of $1,037,547, Mr. Hankinson would have been entitled to a single lump sum payment of $482,016 and Mr. Swets would have been entitled to a single lump sum payment of $438,583.
Receipt of the Executive's severance benefits is conditioned on obtaining a release and resignation from all of the Executive's positions with the Company         and Macatawa Bank. Additionally, each Change in Control Agreement includes non-competition provisions prohibiting employment with a competitor for a period of twenty-four months for Mr. Haan, eighteen months for Mr. Hankinson and six months for Mr.         Swets. The Change in Control Agreements also prohibit solicitation of the Company's customers and employees for a period of twenty-four months for Mr. Haan and eighteen months for Mr. Hankinson and Mr. Swets.

Transactions with             Related Persons
Directors, officers, principal shareholders and their associates and family members were customers of, and had transactions (including loans and loan         commitments) with, the Bank in the ordinary course of business during 2018. All such loans and commitments were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing         at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the Bank and did not involve more than a normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. Similar transactions may be expected to take place in the ordinary         course of business in the future. None of these loan relationships presently in effect are in default as of the date of this proxy statement.
The Audit Committee Charter requires the Audit Committee to review and approve all transactions between the Company and related persons which are required         to be reported under Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K, Item 404.
Section 16(a)             Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires Macatawa's directors and officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of the         outstanding shares of Macatawa common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of shares of common stock with the SEC.  Directors, officers and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish         Macatawa with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file with the SEC.  Based solely on our review of the copies of such reports received by us, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no reports on Form 5 were required         for those persons for 2018, we believe that all required reports were filed by such persons on a timely basis during the last fiscal year.
