 Consent.   You may vote your shares by completing and submitting a consent card.  
   Stockholders of Record. If you hold your shares in your own name as a holder of record, you can vote your common stock by completing the enclosed consent card and returning it signed and dated in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. Your shares will be voted in accordance with your consent in your completed and returned consent card.  
   Beneficial Owners. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record, you will receive instructions from the holder of record on how to vote your shares. You must follow the instructions of your broker or other nominee in order for your shares to be voted.  
 Quorum.   A majority of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock consenting and entitled to consent constitutes a quorum. For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for transacting business by consent, abstentions and "broker non-votes" (proxies from brokers or other nominees indicating that they have not received instructions from the beneficial owner(s) on a particular proposal(s) with respect to which the brokers or nominees do not have discretionary voting authority) will be treated as shares that are present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.  
 Routine Proposals;  Broker Non-Votes.   Your broker or nominee will have discretionary authority to vote your shares with respect to "routine" proposals, but not with respect to "non-routine" proposals. The Proposal is a non-routine proposal and may not be voted upon by your broker or nominee if you do not submit voting instructions.  
 Routine Proposals;  Broker Non-Votes.   Your broker or nominee will have discretionary authority to vote your shares with respect to "routine" proposals, but not with respect to "non-routine" proposals.

 Vote Required; Treatment of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes.   The Proposal must receive an affirmative vote of a majority of shares issued and outstanding in order to be approved. Throughout this Consent Solicitation Statement, we use "vote" and "voting" interchangeably with "consent" and "consenting" (and similar).   Abstentions are included in the number of shares present or represented and entitled to vote on the Proposal. Broker "non-votes" are not considered entitled to vote for the particular matter and have the effect of reducing the number of affirmative votes required to achieve a majority for such matter by reducing the total number of shares from which the majority is calculated. Broker "non-votes" only apply to non-routine proposals. The Proposal is a non-routine proposal.

PROPOSAL 1: INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED SHARES
Background of the Authorized Share Increase Proposal
Our Board has determined that it is advisable and in our and our stockholders' best interests to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 500,000,000 shares, par value $0.001 per share. Accordingly, stockholders are asked to approve an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effectuate such increase.
The Board strongly believes that the increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock is necessary to provide us with sufficient number of authorized shares of Common Stock available for purposes of (i) meeting our contractual commitments to investors should any outstanding convertible securities of the Company be converted into shares of our Common Stock; (ii) meeting our contractual obligations to investors that may exercise their outstanding warrants and to issue shares of Common Stock underlying these warrants to these investors; (iii) meeting our commitment to directors and officers and employees in connection with issuance of shares underlying their warrants and options; (iv) issuing common stock to attract employees and consultants or for strategic transactions or other purposes; and (v) raising additional capital.
Accordingly, the Board has unanimously approved a resolution proposing such amendment to our certificate of incorporation and directed that it be submitted for approval in this Consent Solicitation Statement.
The text of the form of the proposed amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effect the Authorized Share Increase Authorization, which assumes the approval of this Proposal 1, is attached hereto as Annex A.
Of the 100,000,000 shares of common stock currently authorized, 66,179,709 shares of common stock were outstanding as of December 3, 2018, in addition to the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● 7,237,500 shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options at a weighted average exercise price of $0.40 per share; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● 25,045,517 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants at a weighted average exercise price of $0.53 per share.  
[END TABLE]
Reason for the Proposed Increase in Number of Authorized Shares of Common Stock
Our Board believes it is desirable and in the best interests of the Company to have a sufficient number of authorized shares of Common Stock available for purposes of (i) meeting our contractual commitments to investors should any outstanding convertible securities of the Company be converted into shares of our Common Stock; (ii) meeting our contractual obligations to investors that may exercise their outstanding warrants and to issue shares of Common Stock underlying these warrants to these investors; (iii) meeting our commitment to directors and officers and employees in connection with issuance of shares underlying their warrants and options; (iv) issuing common stock to attract employees and consultants or for strategic transactions or other purposes; and (v) raising additional capital.
Principal Effects of Increase in Number of Authorized Shares of Common Stock
If stockholders approve this Proposal 1, the additional authorized common stock will have rights identical to the currently outstanding shares of our common stock. The proposed amendment will not affect the par value of the common stock, which will remain at $0.001 per share. Approval of this Proposal 1 and issuance of the additional authorized shares of common stock would not affect the rights of the holders of currently outstanding shares of our common stock, except for effects incidental to increasing the number of shares of our common stock outstanding, such as dilution of any earnings per share and voting rights of current holders of common stock.
The additional shares of common stock authorized by the approval of this Proposal 1 could be issued by our Board without further vote of our stockholders except as may be required in particular cases by our Certificate of Incorporation, the DGCL or other applicable law, regulatory agencies or OTCQB rules. Stockholders do not have preemptive rights to subscribe to additional securities that we may issue, which means that current stockholders do not have a prior right thereunder to purchase any new issue of common stock, or securities that are convertible into common stock, in order to maintain their proportionate ownership interests in the Company.
Our stockholders are not entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to the proposed amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock and we will not independently provide the stockholders with any such right if the increase is implemented.
The proposed amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock could, under certain circumstances, have an anti-takeover effect. The additional shares of common stock that would become available for issuance if this Proposal 1 is approved could also be used by us to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or to delay or prevent changes in control or our management. For example, without further stockholder approval, the Board could adopt a "poison pill" which would, under certain circumstances related to an acquisition of our securities not approved by the Board, give certain holders the right to acquire additional shares of common stock at a low price, or the Board could strategically sell shares of common stock in a private transaction to purchasers who would oppose a takeover or favor the current Board.
Although this proposal to increase the authorized capital and common stock has been prompted by business and financial considerations and not by the threat of any hostile takeover attempt (nor is the Board currently aware of any such attempts directed at us), nevertheless, stockholders should be aware that approval of this Proposal 1 could facilitate future efforts by us to deter or prevent changes in control, including transactions in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.
Required Consent and Recommendation of the Board of Directors
The affirmative vote of the holders of shares of common stock representing a majority of the common stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date will be required for approval of the Authorized Share Increase Authorization. Abstentions will be counted for the purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote AGAINST the proposal. A failure to vote by not returning a signed consent card will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE PROPOSAL.
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
Proposals of shareholders intended to be presented at our next annual meeting of shareholders, including the election of directors of the Company, must be received by us in a reasonable amount of time prior to when we begin to print and send our proxy materials for such meeting. These proposals must comply with the requirements as to form and substance established by the SEC for such proposals in order to be included in the proxy statement. If the shareholder fails to give notice in reasonable time prior to when we begin to print and send our proxy materials for such meeting, then the persons named as proxies in the proxies solicited by our Board for our next annual meeting may exercise discretionary voting power regarding any such proposal.
ANNUAL REPORTS
We shall provide a copy of our Form 10-K Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and our Quarterly Reports for the three fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2018, without charge, to each person to whom a Consent Solicitation Statement is delivered, upon written or oral request of such person delivered to us at Accelerize Inc., 20411 SW Birch Street, Suite 250, Newport Beach, California, 92660, Attention: General Counsel, or by telephone at (310) 314-8804. Copies may also be obtained without charge through the SEC's web-site at http://www.sec.gov. We intend to file our Form 10-K Annual Report for fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 on or before March 31, 2019.
"HOUSEHOLDING" OF PROXY MATERIALS
Some banks, brokers and other nominee record holders may employ the practice of "householding" proxy statements and annual reports. This means that only one copy of this Consent Solicitation Statement may have been sent to multiple stockholders residing at the same household. If you would like to obtain an additional copy of this Consent Solicitation Statement, please contact us at Accelerize Inc., 20411 SW Birch Street, Suite 250, Newport Beach, California, 92660, Attention: General Counsel, or by telephone at (310) 314-8804. If you want to receive separate copies of our proxy statements and annual reports in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy for your household, you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee record holder.
WHERE YOU CAN FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
We are required to comply with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act. For further information about us, you may refer to our Annual Report and our Quarterly Reports. You can review these filings at the public reference facility maintained by the SEC at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549. These filings are also available electronically on the World Wide Web at http://www.sec.gov.
In accordance with Rule 14a-3(e)(1) under the Exchange Act, one proxy statement will be delivered to two or more stockholders who share an address, unless we have received contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders. We will deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of the proxy statement to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the proxy statement was delivered. Requests for additional copies of the proxy statement, and requests that in the future separate proxy statements be sent to stockholders who share an address, should be directed to Accelerize Inc., 20411 SW Birch Street, Suite 250, Newport Beach, California, 92660, Attention: General Counsel. In addition, stockholders who share a single address but receive multiple copies of the proxy statement may request that in the future they receive a single copy by contacting us at the address set forth in the prior sentence.
