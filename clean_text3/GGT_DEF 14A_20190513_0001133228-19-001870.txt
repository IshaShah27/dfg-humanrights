If the proxy is properly executed and returned in time to be voted at the Meeting, the shares represented thereby will be voted "FOR" the election of the nominees as Directors as described in this Proxy Statement, unless instructions to the contrary are marked thereon, and at the discretion of the proxy holders as to the transaction of any other business that may properly come before the Meeting. Any stockholder who has submitted a proxy has the right to revoke it at any time prior to its exercise either by attending the Meeting and voting his or her shares in person, or by submitting a letter of revocation or a later dated proxy to the Fund at the above address prior to the date of the Meeting.
A "quorum" is required in order to transact business at the Meeting. A quorum of stockholders is constituted by the presence in person or by proxy of stockholders of the Fund entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting. Whether or not a quorum is present, the chairperson of the Meeting may adjourn the Meeting indefinitely, or from time to time, to a date not more than 120 days after the original record date, without notice other than announcement at the Meeting. Absent the establishment of a subsequent record date and the giving of notice to the holders of record thereon, the adjourned meeting must take place not more than 120 days after the original record date. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the Meeting as originally notified. The Fund may postpone or cancel a meeting of shareholders, and if it does the Fund will make a public announcement of such postponement or cancellation prior to the meeting. The postponed meeting may not be held more than 120 days after the initial record date.
The close of business on March 21, 2019, has been fixed as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting and all adjournments or postponements thereof. The Fund has two classes of stock outstanding: common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Common Stock"), and preferred stock consisting of (i) 6.00% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Series B Preferred"), (ii) Series C Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Series C Preferred"), and (iii) 5.125% Series E Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Series E Preferred"), each having a par value of $0.001 per share (together, "Preferred Stock"). The holders of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock are each entitled to one vote on each matter to properly come before the Meeting for each full share held. On the record date, there were 24,617,865 shares of Common Stock, 791,014 shares of Series B Preferred, 10 shares of Series C Preferred, and 2,000,000 shares of Series E Preferred, outstanding.

SUMMARY OF VOTING RIGHTS ON PROXY PROPOSALS PROPOSAL: TO ELECT THREE (3) DIRECTORS OF THE FUND
Nominees for the Board of Directors
The Board currently consists of nine Directors, seven of whom are not "interested persons" of the Fund (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")). The Fund divides the Board into three classes, each class having a term of three years. Each year, the term of office of one class will expire. Mario J. Gabelli, Anthony J. Colavita, and Christopher J. Marangi have each been nominated by the Board for election to serve for a three year term to expire at the Fund's 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Messrs. Zizza, Gabelli, Conn, and Pustorino have served as Directors of the Fund since the April 6, 1994 organizational meeting of the Fund. Mr. Fahrenkopf became a Director of the Fund on August 18, 1999; Dr. Roeder became a Director of the Fund on November 17, 1999; Mr. Colavita became a Director of the Fund on August 15, 2001; Mr. Nakamura became a Director of the Fund on August 15, 2012; and Mr. Marangi became a Director of the Fund on March 21, 2013. All of the Directors of the Fund are also directors or trustees of other investment companies for which Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser") or its affiliates serve as investment adviser with the exception of Mr. Marangi, who only serves as a Director of this Fund. The classes of Directors are indicated below:

Under the Fund's Charter and the 1940 Act, holders of the Fund's outstanding Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, are entitled to elect two Directors, and holders of the Fund's outstanding Common Stock and Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, are entitled to elect the remaining Directors. The holders of the Fund's outstanding Preferred Stock would be entitled to elect the minimum number of additional Directors that would represent a majority of the Directors in the event that dividends on the Fund's Preferred Stock become in arrears for two full years and until all arrearages are eliminated. No dividend arrearages exist as of the date of this Proxy Statement. Messrs. Colavita and Conn are currently the Directors elected solely by the holders of the Fund's Preferred Stock. Mr. Conn's term as a Director is scheduled to expire at the Fund's 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Therefore, he is not standing for election at this meeting. A quorum of the Preferred Shareholders must be present in person or by proxy at the Meeting in order for the proposal to elect Mr. Colavita to be considered.
Unless instructions are provided to the contrary, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy to vote the proxy "FOR" the election of the nominees named above. Each nominee has indicated that he has consented to serve as a Director if elected at the Meeting. If, however, a designated nominee declines or otherwise becomes unavailable for election, the proxy confers discretionary power on the persons named therein to vote in favor of a substitute nominee or nominees. Each nominee is qualified to serve as a Director under the Fund's governing documents. Information about Directors and Officers
Set forth in the table below are the existing Directors, including those Directors who are not considered to be "interested persons," as defined in the 1940 Act (the "Independent Directors"), three of whom are nominated for re-election to the Board of the Fund, and officers of the Fund, including information relating to their respective positions held with the Fund, a brief statement of their principal occupations, and, in the case of the Directors, their other directorships during the past five years (excluding other funds managed by the Adviser), if any.

 The Board believes that each Director's experience, qualifications, attributes or skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of other Directors lead to the conclusion that each Director should serve in such capacity. Among the attributes or skills common to all Directors are their ability to review critically and to evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with the other Directors, the Adviser, the sub-administrator, other service providers, counsel, and the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, and to exercise effective and independent business judgment in the performance of their duties as Directors. Each Director's ability to perform his duties effectively has been attained in large part through the Director's business, consulting, or public service positions and through experience from service as a member of the Board and one or more of the other funds in the Fund Complex, public companies, non-profit entities, or other organizations as set forth above and below.

Directors â Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities
Overall responsibility for general oversight of the Fund rests with the Board. The Board has appointed Mr. Conn as the Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director presides over executive sessions of the Directors and also serves between meetings of the Board as a liaison with service providers, officers, counsel, and other Directors on a wide variety of matters including scheduling agenda items for Board meetings. Designation as such does not impose on the Lead Independent Director any obligations or standards greater than or different from other Directors. The Board has established a Nominating Committee and an Audit Committee to assist the Board in the oversight of the management and affairs of the Fund. The Board also has an ad hoc Proxy Voting Committee that exercises beneficial ownership responsibilities on behalf of the Fund in selected situations. From time to time, the Board establishes additional committees or informal working groups, such as an ad hoc Pricing Committee related to securities offerings by the Fund, to address specific matters or assigns one of its members to work with directors or trustees of other funds in the Fund Complex on special committees or working groups that address complex-wide matters, such as the multi-fund ad hoc Compensation Committee relating to the compensation of the Chief Compliance Officer for all the funds in the Fund Complex and a separate multi-fund ad hoc Compensation Committee relating to the compensation of certain other officers of the closed-end funds in the Fund Complex.
All of the Fund's Directors, other than Messrs. Mario J. Gabelli and Christopher J. Marangi, are Independent Directors and the Board believes it is able to provide effective oversight of the Fund's service providers. In addition to providing feedback and direction during Board meetings, the Independent Directors meet regularly in executive session and chair all committees of the Board.
The Fund's operations entail a variety of risks, including investment, administration, valuation, and a range of compliance matters. Although the Adviser, the sub-administrator, and the officers of the Fund are responsible for managing these risks on a day to day basis within the framework of their established risk management functions, the Board also addresses risk management of the Fund through its meetings and those of the committees and working groups. As part of its general oversight, the Board reviews with the Adviser at Board meetings the levels and types of risks, including options risk being undertaken by the Fund, and the Audit Committee discusses the Fund's risk management and controls with the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by the Fund. The Board reviews valuation policies and procedures and the valuations of specific illiquid securities. The Board also receives periodic reports from the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer regarding compliance matters relating to the Fund and its major service providers, including results of the implementation and testing of the Fund's and such providers' compliance programs. The Board's oversight function is facilitated by management reporting processes designed to provide visibility to the Board regarding the identification, assessment and management of critical risks, and the controls and policies and procedures used to mitigate those risks. The Board reviews its role in supervising the Fund's risk management from time to time and may make changes at its discretion at any time.
The Board has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate for the Fund because it enables the Board to exercise informed and independent judgment over matters under its purview, allocates responsibility among committees in a manner that fosters effective oversight, and allows the Board to devote appropriate resources to specific issues in a flexible manner as they arise. The Board periodically reviews its leadership structure as well as its overall structure, composition, and functioning, and may make changes at its discretion at any time.

 The Fund pays each Independent Director an annual retainer of $6,000 plus $500 for each Board meeting attended and each Independent Director is reimbursed by the Fund for any out of pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings. All Board committee members receive $1,000 per meeting attended, the Audit Committee Chairman receives an annual fee of $3,000, the Nominating Committee Chairman, and the Lead Independent Director each receive an annual fee of $2,000. A Director may receive a single meeting fee, allocated among the participating funds, for participation in certain meetings on behalf of multiple funds. The aggregate remuneration (excluding out of pocket expenses) paid by the Fund to such Directors during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, amounted to $70,773. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Directors of the Fund met four times, all of which were regular quarterly Board meetings. Each Director then serving in such capacity attended at least 75% of the Board meetings and of any committee of which he is a member.
The Audit Committee and Audit Committee Report
The role of the Fund's Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its oversight of (i) the quality and integrity of the Fund's financial statement reporting process and the independent audit and reviews thereof; (ii) the Fund's accounting and financial reporting policies and practices, its internal controls, and, as appropriate, the internal controls of certain of its service providers; (iii) the Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; and (iv) the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, independence, and performance. The Audit Committee also is required to prepare an audit committee report pursuant to the rules of the SEC for inclusion in the Fund's annual proxy statement. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter (the "Audit Charter") that was most recently reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on February 20, 2019. The Audit Charter is available in the Closed-End Funds â Corporate Governance section on the Fund's website at www.gabelli.com.
Pursuant to the Audit Charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for conferring with the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, reviewing annual financial statements, approving the selection of the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, and overseeing the Fund's internal controls. The Audit Charter also contains provisions relating to the pre-approval by the Audit Committee of audit and non-audit services to be provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers") to the Fund and to the Adviser and certain of its affiliates. The Audit Committee advises the full Board with respect to accounting, auditing, and financial matters affecting the Fund. As set forth in the Audit Charter, management is responsible for maintaining appropriate systems for accounting and internal control, and the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for planning and carrying out proper audits and reviews. The independent registered public accounting firm is ultimately accountable to the Board of Directors and to the Audit Committee, as representatives of stockholders. The independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund reports directly to the Audit Committee.
In performing its oversight function, at a meeting held on February 19, 2019, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management of the Fund and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the audited financial statements of the Fund as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and the conduct of the audit of such financial statements.
In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers the accounting principles applied by the Fund and such other matters brought to the attention of the Audit Committee by PricewaterhouseCoopers as required by Auditing Standard No. 16, as amended (AICPAAU-C Section 260), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"). The Audit Committee also received from PricewaterhouseCoopers the written disclosures and statements required by the SEC's independence rules, delineating relationships between PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Fund, and discussed the impact that any such relationships might have on the objectivity and independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm.
As set forth above, and as more fully set forth in the Charter, the Audit Committee has significant duties and powers in its oversight role with respect to the Fund's financial reporting procedures, internal control systems, and the independent audit process. The members of the Audit Committee are not, and do not represent themselves to be, professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not employed by the Fund for accounting, financial management, or internal control purposes. Moreover, the Audit Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it or representations made by management or the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and/or financial reporting principles and policies, or internal controls and procedures, designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not provide assurance that the audit of the Fund's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (United States).
Based on its consideration of the audited financial statements and the discussions referred to above with management and PricewaterhouseCoopers, and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of the Audit Committee set forth in the Audit Charter and those discussed above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Fund's Board of Directors that the Fund's audited financial statements be included in the Fund's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Submitted by the Audit Committee of the Fund's Board of Directors
Anthony R. Pustorino, Chairman
Werner J. Roeder, M.D.
Salvatore J. Zizza
February 19, 2019
The Audit Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee is composed of three of the Fund's Independent Directors, namely Messrs. Pustorino (Chairman), Roeder, and Zizza. Each member of the Audit Committee has been determined by the Board of Directors to be financially literate, and independent as independence is defined in the listing standards of the NYSE. Mr. Pustorino has been designated as the Fund's audit committee financial expert, as defined in Items 407 (d)(5)(ii) and (iii) of Regulation S-K.
Nominating Committee
The Board of Directors has a Nominating Committee composed of three Independent Directors, Messrs. Nakamura (Chairman), Colavita, and Zizza, all of whom are independent as independence as determined under guidelines of the NYSE. The Nominating Committee met one time during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying and recommending qualified candidates to the Board in the event that a position is vacated or created. The Nominating Committee will consider recommendations by stockholders if a vacancy were to exist. In considering candidates submitted by stockholders, the Nominating Committee will take into consideration the needs of the Board, the qualifications of the candidate, and the interests of stockholders. The Nominating Committee may also take into consideration the number of shares held by the recommending stockholder and the length of time that such shares have been held. To recommend a candidate for consideration by the Nominating Committee, a stockholder must submit the recommendation in writing and must include the following information: The stockholder recommendation and information described above must be sent to the Fund's Secretary, c/o Gabelli Funds, LLC, One Corporate Center, Rye, NY 10580-1422, and must be received by the Secretary no less than 120 days, and no more than 150 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for the preceding year's annual meeting or, if the meeting has moved by more than thirty days from the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual meeting, no less than ten days following the date on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made.
The Nominating Committee believes that the minimum qualifications for serving as a Director of the Fund are that the individual demonstrate, by significant accomplishment in his or her field, an ability to make a meaningful contribution to the Board of Directors' oversight of the business and affairs of the Fund and have an impeccable record and reputation for honest and ethical conduct in both his or her professional and personal activities. In addition, the Nominating Committee examines a candidate's specific experiences and skills, time availability in light of other commitments, potential conflicts of interest, and independence from management and the Fund.
The Nominating Committee also considers the overall composition of the Board, bearing in mind the benefits that may be derived from having members who have a variety of experiences, qualifications, attributes or skills useful in overseeing a publicly traded, highly regulated entity such as the Fund. The Fund believes a nominee for Director should be at least twenty-one years of age and not older than such maximum age, if any, as the Directors may determine, and shall not be under legal disability. The Directors have not determined a maximum age. The Nominating Committee does not have a formal policy regarding the consideration of diversity in identifying trustee candidates. For a discussion of experiences, qualifications, attributes, or skills supporting the appropriateness of each Director's service on the Fund's Board, see the biographical information of the Directors above in the section entitled "Information about Directors and Officers."
The Fund's Nominating Committee adopted a charter on May 12, 2004, and amended the charter on November 17, 2004. The charter is available in the Closed-End Funds â Corporate Governance section on the Fund's website at www.gabelli.com.
Other Board Related Matters
The Board of Directors has established the following procedures in order to facilitate communications among the Board and the stockholders of the Fund and other interested parties.
Receipt of Communications
Stockholders and other interested parties may contact the Board or any member of the Board by mail or electronically. To communicate with the Board or any member of the Board, correspondence should be addressed to the Board or the Board member(s) with whom you wish to communicate by either name or title.

Forwarding the Communications
All communications received will be opened by the office of the General Counsel of the Adviser for the sole purpose of determining whether the contents represent a message to one or more Directors. The office of the General Counsel will forward promptly to the addressee(s) any contents that relate to the Fund and that are not in the nature of advertising, promotions of a product or service, or patently offensive or otherwise objectionable material. In the case of communications to the Board of Directors or any committee or group of members of the Board, the General Counsel's office will make sufficient copies of the contents to send to each Director who is a member of the group or committee to which the envelope or e-mail is addressed.
The Fund does not expect Directors or nominees for election as Director to attend the Meeting. No Director or nominee for election as Director attended the Fund's annual meeting of stockholders held on May 14, 2018. The following table sets forth certain information regarding the compensation of the Directors by the Fund and officers, if any, who were compensated by the Fund rather than the Adviser for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

Required Vote
The election of each of the listed nominees for Director of the Fund requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the applicable class or classes of shares of the Fund present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting, provided a quorum is present.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, INCLUDING THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH APPLICABLE NOMINEE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10017, has been selected to serve as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. PricewaterhouseCoopers acted as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Fund knows of no direct financial or material indirect financial interest of PricewaterhouseCoopers in the Fund. A representative of PricewaterhouseCoopers will not be present at the Meeting, but will be available by telephone and will have an opportunity to make a statement, if asked, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Set forth in the table below are audit fees and non-audit related fees billed to the Fund by PricewaterhouseCoopers for professional services received during and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively.
The Fund's Audit Charter requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to the Fund, and all non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to the Fund's Adviser and service providers controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Fund's Adviser ("affiliates") that provide ongoing services to the Fund (a "Covered Services Provider"), if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. The Audit Committee may delegate its responsibility to pre-approve any such audit and permissible non-audit services to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, and the Chairman must report his decision(s) to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting after the Chairman's pre-approval of such services. The Audit Committee may also establish detailed pre-approval policies and procedures for pre-approval of such services in accordance with applicable laws, including the delegation of some or all of the Audit Committee's pre-approval responsibilities to other persons (other than the Adviser or the Fund's officers). Pre-approval by the Audit Committee of any permissible non-audit services is not required so long as: (i) the aggregate amount of all such permissible non-audit services provided to the Fund, the Adviser, and any Covered Services Provider constitutes not more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid by the Fund to its independent registered public accounting firm during the year in which the permissible non-audit services are provided; (ii) the permissible non-audit services were not recognized by the Fund at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services; and (iii) such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and approved by the Audit Committee or the Chairman prior to the completion of the audit. All of the audit, audit related, and tax services described above for which PricewaterhouseCoopers billed the Fund fees for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. All other fees for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 reflected in the table above represent services provided in review of the registration statement.
For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, PricewaterhouseCoopers has represented to the Fund that it did not provide any non-audit services (or bill any fees for such services) to the Adviser or any Covered Services Provider.
The Audit Committee was not required to consider whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the Adviser or Covered Service Providers that were not pre-approved was compatible with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers' independence.
The Investment Adviser and Administrator
Gabelli Funds, LLC is the Fund's Adviser and Administrator and its business address is One Corporate Center, Rye, New York 10580-1422. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act and Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, require the Fund's executive officers and Directors, executive officers and directors of the Adviser, certain other affiliated persons of the Adviser, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Fund's securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE and to furnish the Fund with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on the Fund's review of the copies of such forms it received, if any, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Fund believes that during the year such persons complied with all such applicable filing requirements.
Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions
For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for transacting business related to the Proposal at the Meeting, abstentions, if any, will be treated as shares that are present. Accordingly, for purposes of counting votes, shares represented by abstentions will have the same effect as votes against the Proposal, for which the required vote is a majority of all the votes present for each nominee. Since banks and brokers will have discretionary authority to vote shares in the absence of voting instructions from stockholders with respect to the Proposal, there will be no broker "non-votes" (that is, proxies from brokers or nominees indicating that such persons have not received instructions from the beneficial owner or other persons entitled to vote shares on a particular matter with respect to which the brokers or nominees do not have discretionary voting power).
The affirmative vote of a majority of votes present for each nominee at the Meeting, in person or by proxy, at which a quorum is present, is necessary for the election of a Director. Abstentions will have the same effect as votes against as to the election of each Director-nominee, although they will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.
Stockholders of the Fund will be informed of the voting results of the Meeting in the Fund's Semiannual Report for the six months ending June 30, 2019.
"Householding"
Please note that only one document (i.e., an annual or semiannual report or set of proxy soliciting materials) may be delivered to two or more stockholders of the Fund who share an address, unless the Fund has received instructions to the contrary. To request a separate copy of a document, or for instructions regarding how to request a separate copy of these documents or regarding how to request a single copy if multiple copies of these documents are received, stockholders should contact the Fund at the address and phone number set forth above.
OTHER MATTERS TO COME BEFORE THE MEETING
The Directors of the Fund do not intend to present any other business at the Meeting, nor are they aware that any stockholder intends to do so. If, however, any other matters are properly brought before the Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy will vote thereon in accordance with their discretion.
STOCKHOLDER NOMINATIONS AND PROPOSALS
All proposals by stockholders of the Fund that are intended to be presented at the Fund's next Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2020 (the "2020 Annual Meeting") must be received by the Fund for consideration for inclusion in the Fund's 2020 proxy statement and proxy relating to that meeting no later than December 5, 2019. Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act ("Rule 14a-8"), specifies a number of procedural and eligibility requirements to be satisfied by a stockholder submitting a proposal for inclusion in the Fund's proxy materials pursuant to this Rule. Any stockholder contemplating submissions of such a proposal is referred to Rule 14a-8. The Fund's By-Laws require stockholders that wish to nominate Directors or make proposals to be voted on at an Annual Meeting of the Fund's Stockholders (and which are not proposed to be included in the Fund's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act) to provide timely notice of the nomination or proposal in writing. To be considered timely for the 2020 Annual Meeting, any such notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Fund at the address set forth on the first page of this proxy statement no earlier than 9:00 a.m. Eastern time on November 5, 2019, and no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on December 5, 2019; provided, however, that if the 2020 Annual Meeting is to be held on a date that is earlier than April 13, 2020, or later than June 12, 2020, such notice must be received by the Fund no later than 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the tenth day following the date on which public announcement of the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting was first made. Any such notice by a stockholder shall set forth the information required by the Fund's By-Laws with respect to each nomination or matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the 2020 Annual Meeting.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT PROXIES BE RETURNED PROMPTLY.
STOCKHOLDERS MAY PROVIDE THEIR VOTE BY TELEPHONE OR THE INTERNET BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS ACCOMPANYING THE PROXY CARD, VOTING INSTRUCTION FORM OR SET FORTH IN THE NOTICE OF INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS.
