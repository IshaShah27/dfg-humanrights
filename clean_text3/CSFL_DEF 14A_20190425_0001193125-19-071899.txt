PROXY STATEMENT 
FOR 
ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 
OF 
CENTERSTATE BANK CORPORATION 
TO BE HELD ON 
APRIL 25, 2019 
MEETING INFORMATION 
This Proxy Statement is being furnished to the shareholders of CenterState Bank Corporation ("we," "our," "us," "Company," or "CenterState,") in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board of Directors for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. This Proxy Statement is dated March 14, 2019, and it and the accompanying notice and form of proxy are first being mailed to our shareholders on or about March 14, 2019. 
When is the Annual Meeting of Shareholders? 
The Annual Meeting of Shareholders ("Annual Meeting") is being held on April 25, 2019, at 10:00 a.m. 
Where will the Annual Meeting be held? 
The Annual Meeting will be held at the Winter Haven Chamber of Commerce, 2nd Floor Auditorium, 401 Avenue B NW, Winter Haven, Florida 33881 
What matters will be voted on at the Annual Meeting? 
The following proposals will be considered at the meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  Election of directors: To elect directors to serve for a one-year term until the 2019  annual meeting of shareholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation: To vote on an advisory resolution on the compensation of the Company's  named executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  Ratification of Appointment of Accountants: To ratify the appointment of Crowe LLP as the Company's independent registered  public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  Other Business: To transact such other business as may properly come before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement of  the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors currently is not aware of any other business to be considered at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy will vote the shares represented by the proxies in their discretion on such matters as recommended by a majority of the Board. 
Who can vote at the Annual Meeting? 
You can vote at the Annual Meeting if you are a holder of shares of Company Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock") at the close of business on February 28, 2019("Record Date"). As of the Record Date, 95,850,741 shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. We have approximately 2,143 registered shareholders of record, as reported by our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as of the Record Date.  How many votes can I cast? 
You are entitled to one vote for each share held as of the Record Date on each nominee for election and each other matter presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. 
How do I vote? 
If you own shares of Common Stock in your own name, you are an "owner of record." This means that you may use the enclosed proxy card(s) to tell the persons named as proxies how to vote your shares of Common Stock. An owner of record has four voting options: 
Internet. You can vote over the Internet by accessing the website shown on your proxy card and following the instructions on the website. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day. Have your proxy card in hand when you access the web site and follow the instructions to vote. 
Telephone. You can vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number shown on your proxy card. Telephone voting is available 24 hours a day. 
Mail. You can vote by mail by completing, signing, dating and mailing your proxy card(s) in the postage-paid envelope included with this document. 
In Person. You may attend the Annual Meeting and cast your vote in person. The Board recommends you vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting. 
If you hold your shares of Common Stock in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by the broker or bank. You may not vote shares held in "street name" by returning a proxy card directly to the Company or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting unless you provide a "legal proxy," which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other nominee. Further, brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares of Common Stock on behalf of their customers may not give a proxy to the Company to vote those shares with respect to any of the proposals, other than the proposal to ratify the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, without specific instructions from their customers, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting power on these matters. 
Directing the voting of your shares of Common Stock will not affect your right to vote in person if you decide to attend the Annual Meeting. 
If the appropriate enclosed form of proxy is properly executed and returned to the Company in time to be voted at the Annual Meeting, the shares represented thereby will be voted in accordance with the instructions marked on the proxy. Executed but unmarked proxies will be voted "FOR" the director nominees proposed by the Board who are presented in this Proxy Statement; "FOR" the advisory proposal on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers; and "FOR" the ratification of the selection of Crowe LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for year ending December 31, 2019. Only shares affirmatively voted for the approval of the proposals to be considered at the Annual Meeting or properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be counted as favorable votes for the proposals. 
How do I change or revoke my proxy? 
You may revoke your proxy at any time after you give it, and before it is voted, in one of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by notifying the Company's Secretary that you are revoking your proxy by written notice that bears a date later than the date of the proxy and  that the Company receives prior to the Annual Meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by signing another proxy card bearing a later date and mailing it so that the Company receives it prior to the Annual Meeting;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by voting again using the telephone or Internet voting procedures; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person, although attendance at the Annual Meeting alone will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.   
[END TABLE]
The address to send any revocation communications is CenterState Bank Corporation, 1101 First Street South, Winter Haven, FL 33880, Attention: Beth S. DeSimone, Secretary. 
If your broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares in "street name," you will need to contact your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your voting instructions. 
How many votes are required to approve each of the proposals? 
The director nominees will be elected by a majority of the votes cast for each nominee, which means that the director will be elected if the number of votes cast in favor of each nominee exceeds the number of votes cast against the nominee. In the event of a contested election, the required vote for director nominees would revert to a plurality of the votes presented in person or by proxy. The majority voting standard sets forth procedures to be followed by the board in the event a director is not elected, including an offer by the director not elected to tender his or her resignation to the Board, and the Nominating Committee recommending to the board whether to accept the resignation or take other action. Board action on the recommendation is required within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results, with a public disclosure of the reasons for such action. In the event any nominee is unable to serve (which is not anticipated), the persons designated as proxies will cast votes for the remaining nominees and for such other persons as they may select, or the size of the Board will be reduced. 
The advisory proposal on the compensation of the Company's executive officers, and the ratification of the selection of Crowe LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 will be approved if the number of votes cast in favor of each proposal exceeds the number of votes cast against the proposal. 
How are abstentions and broker non-votes counted? 
In the case of proposals 1, 2, 3 and 4, abstentions and broker non-votes, as well as the failure to return a signed proxy card assuming a quorum is present, are not treated as votes cast on any proposal; therefore, they will not affect the outcome of any proposal voted on at the Annual Meeting. 
A broker non-vote occurs when a broker does not vote on a particular matter because the broker does not have discretionary authority on that matter and has not received instructions from the owner for the shares. Under Nasdaq rules, your broker or bank does not have discretionary authority to vote your shares of Common Stock on any of the proposals other than the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm proposal. To avoid a broker non-vote, you must provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee by following the instructions provided to you. 
What constitutes a "quorum" for the Annual Meeting? 
A "quorum" is the presence at the meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. Abstentions and broker nonvotes will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum.  Who pays for the Annual Meeting and the solicitation of proxies? 
The Company will pay the costs of the Annual Meeting and the solicitation of proxies. Solicitation of proxies may be made in person or by mail or telephone by directors, officers and regular employees of the Company without receiving additional compensation. The Company may also request banking institutions, brokerage firms, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward solicitation material to the beneficial owners of Common Stock held of record by such person, and the Company will reimburse such forwarding expenses. 
How do I access the Company's proxy materials? 
We use the Notice and Access rule adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") to provide access to our proxy materials to certain shareholders over the Internet instead of mailing a printed copy of the proxy materials to each shareholder. As a result, on or about March 14, 2019, we are mailing to most shareholders only a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") that tells them how to access and review the information contained in the proxy materials over the Internet and how to vote their proxies by telephone or over the Internet. If you received only this Notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail unless you request the materials by following the instructions for requesting printed copies included in the Notice. 
When are proposals for the 2019 Annual Meeting due? 
Any proposal that a shareholder may intend to present at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must be received in writing by the Secretary of the Company, at its principal executive office, located at 1101 First Street South, Winter Haven, FL 33880, no later than 120 calendar days before the release date of the previous year's annual meeting proxy statement or November 14, 2019. If the proposal complies with all of the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, the proposal will be considered for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy relating to such meeting. 
The Nominating Committee will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders, provided the recommendation is in writing and delivered to our President and CEO at our principal executive office not later than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the date on which we first mailed our proxy materials to shareholders for the preceding year's annual meeting of shareholders or November 14, 2019. The nomination and notification must contain the nominee's name, address, principal occupation, total number of shares owned, consent to serve as a director, and all information relating to the nominee and the nominating shareholder as would be required to be disclosed in the solicitation of proxies for the election of such nominee as a director pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's proxy rules. The Nominating Committee does not intend to alter the manner in which it evaluates candidates, including the minimum criteria set forth above, based on whether the candidate was recommended by a shareholder or not.  2018 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION OVERVIEW

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
General 
The Annual Meeting is being held to elect directors to serve a one-year term of office expiring at the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and until the director's successor is duly elected and qualified. Accordingly, the terms of each member of the Board expire at the Annual Meeting. The individuals nominated for election as directors at the Annual Meeting will serve for a one-year term expiring at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2020. 
The bylaws of CenterState provide that the number of directors can be increased or decreased at any time by action of the Board of Directors, but no action to decrease the number of directors shall have the effect of shortening the terms of any current director, Currently, the Board has set the number of directors at 16, with the option to increase or decrease the number at any time. 
In connection with the merger of NCOM with and into CenterState, CenterState has agreed to take all actions necessary to expand the number of board members by three (from 16 to 19), and appoint three of the directors of NCOM immediately before the effective time of the merger to the board who shall be mutually agreeable to CenterState and NCOM. It is currently anticipated that the identity of these board members will be John H. Holcomb, III, the current Vice Chair of the NCOM board, Richard Murray, IV, the current Chair and CEO of NCOM, and G. Ruffner Page, Jr., the President of McWane, Inc, a leading manufacturer of pipes, valves, fire hydrants and fittings for the water industry, and the current lead independent board member of NCOM. Further information about these individuals are set forth starting on page 12. 
All shares represented by valid proxies received pursuant to this solicitation and not revoked before they are exercised will be voted in the manner specified in those proxies. If no specification is made, the proxies will be voted for the election of the nominees listed below. As noted above under "Meeting Information," directors in uncontested elections such as this one are elected by a majority of the votes cast for each nominee, which means that the director will be elected if the number of votes cast in favor of each nominee exceeds the number of votes cast against the nominee.  Directors 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" ELECTION OF THE NOMINEES LISTED BELOW. 
The table below lists each current director, and the current standing committee membership of each director. Each director serving on one of the Company's standing committees has been determined to be independent within the rules set forth by Nasdaq. None of the management directors serves as a voting member of the Audit, Risk, Compensation or Nominating Committees.

Director Independence 
CenterState's common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Nasdaq requires that a majority of CenterState's directors be "independent," as defined by the Nasdaq rules. In determining director independence, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including the Nasdaq rules. The Board considers the issue not only from the standpoint of a director, but also from that of persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation. The Board of Directors has determined that 12 of our non-management directors are independent under the Nasdaq guidelines. As members of management, Messrs. Pinner, Corbett and Thompson are not considered independent and as the former Chief Executive Officer of HCBF, Mr. Brown will not be considered independent until 2020. 
Corporate Governance 
The Company's Board and executive management work together to oversee the Company's activities to ensure our culture is communicated and we abide by applicable law and high ethical standards. We have adopted a Code of Ethics, which is available on our website at www.centerstatebanks.com under Investor Relations/Governance Documents, and encourage our employees to take initiative and be responsible for their actions. The importance of maintaining our culture and communicating our core values to our stakeholders, including our employees and mentoring and training our employees as we grow is such that in 2018 we established a Board Culture Committee, designed to tap the expertise and leadership experience of two Board members who are expert in employee engagement, training and brand development in developing a service oriented culture, committed to employee diversity, recruitment, training and motivation. We also have adopted a formal corporate governance policy, a copy of which is available on our website at www.centerstatebanks.com.  Board Leadership Structure and the Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Company has separated the roles of Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Chairman of the Board, with Mr. Pinner serving as the Executive Chairman and Mr. Corbett serving as the President and Chief Executive Officer. However, the Board maintains flexibility with respect to combining or separating the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes such flexibility permits CenterState to select the most qualified candidate for the position of Chairman, including a member of management, if the Board believes he or she will provide the most effective leadership for the Company. As Executive Chairman, Mr. Pinner's duties include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

The Board believes that its leadership structure reinforces its risk oversight. CenterState has been, and continues to be, a strong advocate of Board independence and has put into place measures to maintain independent director oversight of management. For example, 12 of the 16 CenterState director nominees are independent under Nasdaq guidelines, and the Board's major committees, including the Audit, Risk, Compensation, and Nominating Committees, are comprised solely of independent directors. CenterState's non-management directors meet in executive session periodically without management in attendance. This means that oversight of critical matters such as the integrity of CenterState's financial statements, and oversight of the Company's primary risks (including credit, liquidity, pricing, operational, cyber, legal and reputational risks), executive compensation (including compensation of the executive officers), the selection of directors and the evaluation of the Board and key Committees is entrusted to independent directors.  Management is responsible for day-to-day risk management of the Company, while the Board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of that risk management. The Board on an annual basis approves the Company's risk appetite statement, which documents the Company's tolerance for risk in twelve key risk categories. All of the Board members receive monthly written reports which include month to date and year to date financial metrics as well as credit metrics. The financial data is compared to the annual budget which is approved by the Board on an annual basis. Further, at the close of each Board of Directors meeting, the directors have an opportunity to convene an executive session, in private, without any management present. 
We have five standing board committees: Risk, Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Culture. All members of the Risk, Audit, Compensation and Nominating Committees are considered independent, as defined by applicable rules and regulations. Each of our standing committees is governed by a charter. All of the charters for our standing committees are located at www.centerstatebanks.com under Investor Relations/Governance Documents. 
The Risk Committee, oversees the primary key business risks which may impact the Company's operations and results. The Risk Committee monitors the Company's performance to ensure alignment with the tolerance levels articulated in the risk appetite statement. The Risk Committee also oversees the risk management policies, procedures, strategies and systems established by management to identify, measure, mitigate, monitor and report major risks, including emerging risks, as well as stress testing and capital planning and management. The categories of enterprise risk overseen by the Risk Committee include capital risk, credit risk, earnings risk, liquidity risk, market risk, price risk, operational risk, compliance risk, corporate governance (legal) risk, cyber risk, reputational risk, and risks associated with the Bank's correspondent division and mortgage division. 
The Audit Committee oversees the integrity of the Company's financial reporting processes, including matters relating to internal controls over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also has oversight responsibilities for compliance with law and regulatory requirements, as well as the internal audit function and the independent auditors. The Audit Committee also reviews any significant findings in internal audit reports and management's response to such reports, including any significant instance where employees have not adhered to law or the Company's policies, procedures or internal controls. The Audit Committee meets with management, internal audit personnel and the Company's independent auditors each quarter to review the earnings press release and Form 10-Q. The Audit Committee asks questions of management as well as the auditors. Each quarter, the Audit Committee has the opportunity to meet with the independent auditors privately, without management present. 
The Compensation Committee is assisted by an independent compensation consultant hired by the Committee, which provides advice on the Company's compensation program and the risks associated with such program. The Compensation Committee meets with the consultant, with management present and without management present, and based on the reports of the consultant and reports by the Chief Risk Officer relating to risk's review of the Company's compensation program and various incentive plans, has determined that the Company's compensation incentive programs do not encourage excessive or unnecessary risks that are reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on the Company or could threaten the value of the institution. For further information, please see "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Role of the Compensation Committee." 
Our Nominating Committee has the exclusive right to recommend candidates for election as directors to the Board. We do not have a formal board diversity policy. Board candidates are considered based upon various criteria, such as the needs of the board, the directors' broad-based business and professional skills and experience, their business and social perspective, diversity, concern for the long-term interests of the shareholders, and personal integrity and judgment. In addition, candidates must be aware of the director's vital part in our good corporate citizenship and corporate image, have time available for meetings and consultation on Company matters, and be willing to assume broad, fiduciary responsibility. Qualified candidates for membership   on the Board will be considered without regard to race, color, religion, sex, ancestry, national origin or disability. The Nominating Committee will review the qualifications and backgrounds of the directors, as well as the overall composition of the Board, and recommend to the full Board the slate of directors to be nominated for election at the annual meeting of shareholders. 
Our Culture Committee oversees the overall "tone at the top" of the Company focusing on instilling our guiding core values into our leaders and employees, and developing a culture focused on enhancing engagement with all stakeholders, and in identifying, training and mentoring diverse leaders throughout the organization, including the board of directors. The Culture Committee reflects the emphasis the Company places on communication of its core values to all stakeholders, and the desire to attract, inspire and reward high quality employees. 
Our Board has instituted an annual formal Board and Committee evaluation process, overseen by the Nominating Committee. Our lead independent director also informally speaks with Board members for input regarding Board and Committee practices. This process is informing Board and Committee composition and succession planning based on the current and anticipated needs of the business. 
Our Board also has adopted a formal process by which shareholders may communicate with the Board. Shareholders who wish to communicate with the Board may do so by sending written communications addressed to our Board of Directors at 1101 First Street South, Winter Haven, FL 33880, Attention: Secretary. All communications will be compiled by the Secretary and submitted to the members of the Board.

While we do not have a policy requiring directors to attend the Annual Meeting, all Board members attended last year's Annual Meeting and all Board nominees are expected to be present at our 2019 Annual Meeting. The table below summarizes the number of board meetings and principal committee meetings held during 2018 and the attendance record of each of our directors. The Nominating Committee met twice in 2017 – January and December – with the December meeting addressing, among other things, the nomination of the directors for 2018 and therefore did not meet in 2018.

PROPOSAL TWO 
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
In accordance with the requirements of Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the related rules of the SEC, we are including in these proxy materials a separate resolution subject to shareholder vote to approve, in a non-binding vote, an advisory resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, or NEOs, as disclosed in this proxy statement. 
Our executive compensation philosophy and programs are designed to foster a performance-oriented culture that aligns our executive officers' interests with those of our shareholders. For 2018, the principal compensation components for our executive officers were: base salary, annual bonus, and equity-based incentive compensation. Please read the section entitled "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS" for additional information about our executive compensation programs, including information about the 2018 compensation of our NEOs. 
We are asking our shareholders to indicate their support for the compensation arrangements with our NEOs as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our shareholders the opportunity to express their views on our NEOs' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we are asking our shareholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution to be presented at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the SEC's compensation rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and narrative discussion." 
This "say-on-pay" vote is advisory, and therefore is not binding on us, the Compensation Committee or our Board of Directors. The shareholder vote does not create or imply any change to the fiduciary duties of our Board of Directors, create or imply any additional fiduciary duties for our Board of Directors, and will not be construed to restrict or limit the ability of shareholders to make proposals for inclusion in proxy materials related to our executive compensation. Our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our shareholders, and to the extent there is any significant vote against the named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, we will consider our shareholders' concerns and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are appropriate to address those concerns. 
The board of directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the resolution above, relating to the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Summary of Key 2018 Compensation Decisions 
During 2018, the Compensation Committee continued its objective of focusing our executives on long-term Company performance and long-term shareholder value creation, rather than short-term results. The incentives earned by our NEOs were based on adjusted ROA and adjusted EPS, in large part because of several items, including merger expenses. As noted, for purposes of this Proxy Statement, our Named Executive Officers, or NEOs are Messrs. Pinner, Corbett, Young, and Thompson and Ms. Idell.  Compensation highlights include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long Term Incentive Program: During 2018, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of its compensation consulting firm, continued to  implement the Company's Long Term Incentive ("LTI") plan. The 2018 LTI plan has two components: a performance-based component with two performance metrics, and a time-based component, each comprising 50% of the total award.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 50% Performance Vested Shares: The first component is an award of Performance Share Units ("PSUs") which will cliff vest on  January 1, 2022 based on two performance metrics. Fifty percent of the award will be based on relative total shareholder return ("TSR") and fifty percent will be based on absolute earnings per share ("EPS") growth. The  measurement period is January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021. Vesting of the PSUs is contingent on the level of certain future credit metrics.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 50% Time Vested Shares: Time vested restricted stock units ("RSUs") were awarded to each named executive officer and will vest at a  rate of one-third on January 1, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mandatory Holding Period: The PSUs and the RSUs are subject to a two year, post-vesting holding period before awards are settled into shares and  the executive can transfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of the vested shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Chief Executive Officer Compensation  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Salary: Mr. Corbett's annual base salary was increased from $600,000 to $750,000 effective July 1, 2018. The Compensation  Committee made this adjustment based on its review of recommendations from its independent compensation consultant, to appropriately reflect market compensation levels consistent with the Company's peers, as well as the Company performance  during 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Incentive: For 2018, Mr. Corbett was awarded an annual incentive equal to $843,750 of which 100% was paid in cash during the first  quarter of 2019. The award was determined based on the achievement of 2018 net operating ROA as compared to target levels previously determined and set by the Compensation Committee, which are described in further detail below under "Pay Mix  – Annual Incentives."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• LTI: Mr. Corbett also received a grant under the 2018 LTI plan which consisted of:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 14,346 PSUs with a fair value equal to approximately $336,000 on date of grant that will cliff vest on January 1, 2022. The PSUs will be based on  both relative TSR and absolute EPS growth as described on page 27.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 12,328 RSUs with a fair value equal to approximately $328,000 on date of grant that vest at a rate of one third each on January 1, 2020, 2021 and  2022. There is an additional two year holding period after the vesting date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other Named Executive Officer ("NEO") Compensation  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Salary: Messrs. Pinner, Young and Thompson and Ms. Idell each received an annual base salary increase effective July 1, 2018.  Mr. Pinner's annual salary increased from $400,000 to $450,000. Mr. Young's annual salary increased from $400,000 to $475,000. Mr. Thompson's salary increased from $320,000 to $375,000; and Ms. Idell's salary  increased from $320,000 to $360,000. As with CEO Corbett, the Compensation Committee made these adjustments, based on its review of recommendations from its independent compensation consultant, to   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     appropriately reflect the market compensation levels consistent with the Company's peers and the Company's performance during 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Incentive: For 2018, Messrs. Pinner, Young, and Thompson, and Ms. Idell were awarded an annual incentive equal to $675,000,  $427,500, $281,250 and $270,000, respectively. Of these total awards, 100% was paid in cash during the first quarter of 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• LTI: The other NEOs, except for Mr. Pinner, also received an LTI grant based on the LTI plan described above. The award for each executive  was based on competitive market practice.

How We Determine Executive Pay 
Role of Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee's authority and responsibilities are to, among other duties: (1) evaluate the performance and determine the compensation of our CEO; (2) review and approve the compensation of our NEOs based on recommendations of our CEO; (3) approve aggregate bonus payments for our Company; (4) review, evaluate and either approve or submit to the full Board of Directors for approval any other material aspect of compensation from a Company perspective that arises during the course of a given fiscal year; and (5) review and assess the compensation of our non-employee directors. In addition, the Compensation Committee reviews with the senior risk officer the incentive compensation arrangements (collectively the "incentive plans") of the NEOs, employee groups and individual employees and take all reasonable efforts to ensure that incentive plans are balanced with respect to risk to the Company and our subsidiary bank and, specifically, do not encourage the NEOs, any employee or employee group to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of CenterState. 
The Compensation Committee is composed of five members, each of whom is an independent director under NASDAQ rules. The members are Messrs. Greene (Chairman), Ciferri, Oakley, Pou and Snively. Each year, at the first board of directors' meeting following the annual shareholders' meeting, the Board appoints committee members to serve on the appointed committee for a period of one year (i.e. until the first board meeting following next year's annual shareholders' meeting). The Executive Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer, generally attend the Committee meetings and help facilitate the process. However, neither has a vote and they are not present during executive sessions. 
The Compensation Committee has adopted a Charter ("Compensation Committee Charter") which was approved by the Company's Board of Directors. A copy of the Compensation Committee Charter is included on the Company's website at www.centerstatebanks.com under Investor Relations / Governance Documents. The Charter describes the Committee's purpose, membership requirements, authority and responsibilities. The Committee meets as often as necessary to carry out its responsibilities. Meetings can be called by any member of the Committee. During 2018, the Committee held five meetings. 
The Compensation Committee generally has the authority to form and delegate its authority to subcommittees when it deems appropriate under the circumstances. The Compensation Committee also generally has the authority to delegate such authority to the Chairman, CEO or other appropriate officers to administer, amend and interrupt employee incentive plans (other than in respect of their own compensation). 
Role of Executives 
Our CEO works closely with the Compensation Committee in establishing executive compensation and overall bonus and incentive payments. The CEO evaluates the performance of the other senior executives, and, based on these performance evaluations, market compensation surveys, and other data, he will then make   recommendations to the Compensation Committee and share with its members the basis for his recommendations. The Compensation Committee, at its discretion, may accept, approve, reject or modify the CEO's recommendation. The CEO also presents incentive compensation payment recommendations for the Compensation Committee's consideration. The Compensation Committee evaluates the CEO's performance and determines his compensation without the CEO present. The Compensation Committee may invite other officers of the Company or other visitors to its meetings to receive recommendations on compensation matters. 
Use of Compensation Consultants 
We engaged the compensation consulting firm of McLagan, an Aon Hewitt company, during 2018 to advise and assist the Compensation Committee on all its various responsibilities.    McLagan assisted the Company with compensation needs during the course of 2018. McLagan reports to the Compensation Committee and the Compensation Committee has full authority to manage any and all projects that McLagan performs for the Company. 
McLagan was instructed by the Compensation Committee to provide the following services in 2018:

• Assist the Company in its preparation of compensation disclosures as required under the SEC's rules with respect to this proxy statement.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Revise the Company's compensation peer group of publicly-traded financial institutions so that it is comparable to the Company in asset size and  in respect of its other features (presented later in this analysis).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Review the competitiveness of the compensation elements currently offered by the Company to its top executives, including base salary, annual incentive  or bonus, long-term incentives (stock options, performance share units and restricted stock), all other compensation, and changes in retirement benefits as compared to that of the customized peer group.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide recommendations and observations regarding the potential alignment of the Company's executive compensation practices with the  Company's overall business strategy and culture relative to the market as defined by the peer group, including reviewing the performance based programs with respect to the cash incentive plan and make recommendations for the 2019 fiscal year  plans.  
[END TABLE]

In 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed its relationship with McLagan and Aon Hewitt. The Compensation Committee considered all relevant factors, including those set forth in Rule 10C-1(b)(4)(i) through (vi) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Compensation Committee determined that McLagan and Aon Hewitt's work does not raise a conflict of interest. McLagan has had regular discussions with the Compensation Committee during 2018 and the Compensation Committee approved all services provided by McLagan to the Company during 2018 under the purview of the Compensation Committee.  The Company's Incentive Compensation Guidelines ("Guidelines) include a partial deferral of annual incentive compensation awards for a period of two years and make the potential payments contingent on the level of certain future credit metrics. For 2018, the Compensation Committee reaffirmed the use of the existing Guidelines, incorporated the use of restricted stock grants as the deferred portion of annual incentive compensation awards, and modified the goals for 2019, based on recommendations from McLagan. The Compensation Committee reviewed the CD&A with management and reviewed, discussed and analyzed each incentive compensation plan, including the 2019 goals, with the Company's senior risk officer and McLagan, as well as senior management. 
Compensation Benchmarking 
The Compensation Committee takes into account a number of factors when determining pay levels for the NEOs. The Compensation Committee evaluates both quantitative factors of how the Company is performing, how the local markets in which we operate are performing in the current economic environment, and market based compensation information as well as qualitative factors such as how the individual NEO is performing, internal pay equity, unusual or extraordinary events, and other information. Specifically related to compensation, the Compensation Committee benchmarks the Company's compensation to that of the peer group companies. We believe, however, that a benchmark should be just that—a point of reference for measurement—but not the sole factor for our executives' compensation. Further, given the limitations associated with comparative pay information for setting individual executive compensation the Compensation Committee may elect to not use the comparative compensation information at all in the course of making compensation decisions. 
Because the Company increased its assets by over $6.5 billion during 2018 through acquisitions, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of its compensation consultant, used two peer groups in 2018. The first peer group, presented below, was established in November 2017 and was used to set annual incentive targets in early 2018. This first peer group was based upon the following criteria: publicly traded banks with assets from $4 billion to $22 billion; located in AL, AR, FL, GA, KY, LA, MS, NC, SC, TN, VA, or WV; a ROAE of greater than 0%, and a commercial loan portfolio as a percent of the total portfolio greater than 45%:r. In the table below "LTM" denotes values as of the last twelve months and "NPA" denotes non-performing assets which is equal to non-accrual loans, accruing loans past due greater than 90 days and repossessed real estate ("OREO").

Say-on-Pay Vote 
As required by applicable law, we held an advisory vote on the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers (the "Say-on-Pay" vote) at our 2018 annual shareholders meeting. The results were that 94.2% of the shares voted on our Say on Pay proposal voted in favor of it. The Compensation Committee considered this positive result as an affirmation of its compensation related policies and decisions. 
Compensation Components 
Our compensation plan for the NEOs includes base salary, cash and restricted stock awards based on short-term annual incentives, long-term incentives, employment agreements, split dollar agreements and deferred compensation arrangements. This section describes each component's design and intent. 
Pay Mix 
Base Salary. We strive to pay competitive base salaries to attract and retain our executives. We primarily use the proxy peer group supplemented by published industry surveys as our guide to determine various salary ranges. Based on consultations with, and recommendations from, the Compensation Committee's compensation consulting firm, the Compensation Committee made the following base salary adjustments effective July 1, 2018 to primarily appropriately reflect the market compensation levels consistent with the   Company's peers, as well as to reflect length of service, experience, leadership and performance of the executive during the review period, and the overall relative results of the Company.

Annual Incentives. For the year 2018, our NEOs were eligible to receive annual bonus awards determined by formulas that are correlated to earnings, in terms of an adjusted return on average assets ("ROA"). Adjusted ROA1 is defined as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") consolidated net income after the adjustments listed below ("Adjusted Net Income") 1 divided by total average consolidated assets. Adjusted Net Income1 is defined as net income excluding the following items, net of income tax: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  a.  gains/losses on sale of securities included in the Company's available for sale portfolio;  
  b.  bargain purchase gains;

Note 1:  Cash portion of the 2018 award paid to NEOs during the first quarter of 2019.  
[END TABLE]
As described earlier, our incentive compensation plans are guidelines. Once the amounts are calculated based on the formula guidelines, they must be approved by the Compensation Committee before payment is made. The Compensation Committee, at its discretion, has the authority and responsibility to approve, reject, or amend the proposed payment, as calculated by formula guidelines. The Compensation Committee did not exercise its discretion to change the proposed payment of annual bonuses in 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
 As described above, 100% of our NEOs 2018 incentive compensation awards were paid in cash during the first quarter of 2019. 
Events that would preclude the payment of an annual incentive award are: (1) regulatory action that prevents the Company or its subsidiary bank from paying any dividends or any other restrictive measure as decided by the Compensation Committee; and (2) failure to maintain well-capitalized status with regard to Tier 1 risk based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios. 
Clawbacks: New bonus and incentive payments to our NEOs, as well as certain other senior officers, are subject to claw back provisions such that the NEO will return to the Company any bonus or incentive compensation paid to him or her by the Company if such bonus or incentive compensation payment is paid based on materially inaccurate financial statements or any other materially inaccurate performance metric criteria. 
Long-Term Incentive ("LTI") Plan. During 2018, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of its compensation consulting firm, implemented the 2018 LTI plan. Key highlights of the plan are outlined in the following table with a more detailed description below.

[END TABLE]
Performance Share Units. The first component is half of the total award and consists of PSUs which will cliff vest on January 1, 2022 based on two metrics. Fifty percent of this award component (or 25% of the total award) will be based on the Company's TSR over the vesting period relative to the Company's peer group and the remaining fifty percent (or 25% of the total award) will be based on the Company's absolute EPS growth over the same vesting period. To the extent any PSUs are vested on January 1, 2022, there is a two-year holding period before the PSUs are settled and common shares are issued. TSR is defined as a company's total shareholder return, calculated based on the stock price appreciation during the Performance Period plus the value of dividends paid on such stock during the Performance Period, which will be deemed to have been reinvested in the underlying company's stock. EPS growth is defined as the Company's three year absolute compound EPS growth. The Performance Period commenced on January 1, 2019 and will end on December 31, 2021. 
Depending on the Company's TSR relative to the peer group each NEO may earn between 0% and 150% of the target award corresponding to the Company's attainment of the performance level as set forth in the table below on the last day of the Performance Period. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Maximum     75th TSR percentile       150%

[END TABLE]
Depending on the Company's three year absolute compound EPS growth rate each NEO may earn between 0% and 150% of a target award corresponding to the Company's attainment of certain EPS growth rates during the performance period.  The actual number of PSUs earned and vested for each NEO will be based on the actual performance level achieved at or between each performance level and will be interpolated on a straight line basis for pro-rata achievement of the performance goal as summarized in the table below.

(1) Assumes fair value of each PSU is equal to $23.42 at the grant date of September 12, 2018. 
A condition of vesting any earned PSUs is that the NEO has remained in continuous employment with the Company or an Affiliate from the grant date through the PSU vesting date, except if the NEOs continuous service terminates during the Performance Period as a result of his death or disability, in which case the NEO will vest on such date in a pro rata portion. In addition, if there is a change in control during the Performance Period, the number of PSUs that will vest will be the greater of (a) the number of PSUs that would have vested (if any) if the Performance Period ended on the date of the change in control on a pro rata basis, or (b) the number of PSUs that would have vested assuming the Company's achievement of the Target Performance Level adjusted on a pro rata basis. However, if the Company's TSR at the end of the Performance Period is negative, then the maximum number of PSUs that can vest is the Target Award, regardless of how the Company's TSR compares to the peer group at the end of the Performance Period. 
Restricted Share Units. The second component is half of the total award and consists of RSUs which vests as follows based on continued employment: one third on January 1, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Once vested, there is a two- year holding period before the awards are settled into shares. The table below describes the number of RSUs granted and issued to each NEO during 2018.

(1) Once vested, there is an additional two-year holding period before the awards are settled into shares. 
(2) Assumes the fair value of each RSU is equal to $26.60 at date of grant of September 12, 2018. 
If the NEO's employment is terminated within 12 months following a Change in Control (a) without Cause or (b) by NEO for Good Reason (as these terms are defined in their employment agreements), then all unvested units will immediately vest and be considered vested shares. If the NEO retires because of reaching the age of 65 or reaching the age of 55 plus ten years of service, and agrees to sign a non-compete for a two year period from date of retirement then all unvested PSUs and RSUs will immediately vest and will be paid after the holding period; otherwise such shares will vest pro-rata as of the date of retirement, to be paid after the applicable performance and holding period. 
Positives of Holding Period. Both components of the LTI award are subject to a two-year mandatory holding period after vesting of the units before the awards are settled into shares. Requiring the executives to hold shares beyond the vesting period has several key positives, including increased long-term focus of executives, a mechanism for any potential future compensation claw back, and accounting savings associated with the illiquidity of the shares.  For 2018, salary and bonus comprised the following percentage of total compensation for each of our named executives as listed below.

Pinner and Thompson and Ms. Idell) the cost to purchase and  maintain disability insurance coverage providing a monthly disability benefit to age 65 not to exceed the lesser of (x) 60% of base salary or (y) $25,000. The amount reimbursed by the Company will be grossed up to compensate the NEO for related  Federal and State income taxes imposed on the NEO as a result of the reimbursement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentive Bonus Plans. The NEO is entitled to participate in the incentive bonus plans applicable to his employment position and in accordance  with policies and procedures established from time to time.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Severance. If the NEO voluntarily terminates employment with good reason or is involuntarily terminated without cause, subject to execution of a  release, he or she will be entitled to a lump sum cash payment equal to (i) for Messrs. Corbett and Young, one times the highest annual compensation as reported on the NEO's Form W-2 over the three-year  period immediately preceding the year in which notice of employment termination is given, (ii) for Mr. Pinner, the balance of his salary through the end of the term of his employment agreement, (iii) for Mr. Thompson, one times  his base salary, and (iv) for Ms. Idell, one times the sum of her base  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     salary and highest annual bonus earned during the prior three years, in each case pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. In addition, the NEOs would be entitled to continued health and dental  benefits for a period of time after termination.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change in Control. If a change in control occurs during the term of the Agreement, Messrs. Corbett and Young will each be entitled to a lump sum  cash payment (which will be paid regardless of whether the executive's employment terminates) equal to three times his highest annual W-2 compensation in the three years preceding the change in control.  The other NEOs are entitled to the following payments if there is a change in control and their employment is terminated without cause or they resign for good reason within 12 months after the change in control: (i) for Mr. Pinner and  Thompson and Ms. Idell, the NEO is terminated without cause within 12 months of the change in control, the NEO will be entitled to a cash payment equal to two and one half times (three times in the case of the sum of his/her salary and his/her  highest annual bonus in the prior three years and (ii) for Mr. Thompson, two times his base salary. In addition, for Messrs. Corbett and Young, if the payment (together with any other payments or benefits owed to the executive) result in  any excise tax on the NEO under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, then the Company is required to make an additional payment equal to the excise tax payable by the NEO plus an amount necessary to provide the excise tax  payment net of all income, payroll and excise taxes that would otherwise be incurred by the NEO.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Non-Compete and Non-Solicitation. The NEOs are prohibited from  competing with or soliciting business relationships or soliciting Company employees for a period of one year subsequent to termination (two years in the case of Ms. Idell), except following a change in control.  
[END TABLE]
See the discussion entitled "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" under "Executive Compensation" which provides the amount of compensation each NEO would receive under various termination events based upon the employment agreements. 
Split Dollar Agreements. Each of our named executives, except for Mr. Thompson and Ms. Idell, has a Split Dollar Agreement, whereby we purchased single premium life insurance on the executive. If the executive dies while still employed with us, his beneficiary is entitled to a benefit equal to 50% of the Net Death Proceeds (as defined in the Agreement). If death occurred at December 31, 2018, the amount each NEO's beneficiary would be entitled to receive is $264,722, $336,872, and $240,106 in the case of Messrs. Corbett, Pinner, and Young, respectively. If death occurs after separation from service, and if, pursuant to the Split-Dollar Agreement, the executive has a Vested Insurance Benefit (as defined in the Agreement) at the date of death, the executive's beneficiary is entitled to a benefit equal to 10% of the Net Death Proceeds. In addition to Split Dollar Agreements, we also have certain term life insurance arrangements between the Company and the executive in addition to the normal group life insurance coverage on all employees, also known as bank-owned life insurance or BOLI. At December 31, 2018, the additional amount of these term life insurance arrangements were $212,141, $100,399, $150,000, $193,430 and $100,000 in the case of Mr. Corbett, Mr. Pinner, Ms. Idell, Mr. Young and Mr. Thompson, respectively. We believe this is another way of helping to retain our executives. The form of the Split Dollar Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Form 8-K dated January 11, 2006. 
Deferred Compensation Agreements. Our NEOs, except Mr. Thompson and Ms. Idell, have Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans ("SERP") with the Company. The plans are nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements that are designed to provide supplemental retirement income benefits to participants. Upon termination of employment on or after normal retirement at age 65, the participant will receive a monthly retirement income benefit equal to a fixed dollar amount in the case of Mr. Pinner, and equal to a percentage of Final Pay in the case of Messrs. Corbett and Young. Final Pay is defined as the executive's highest annualized base salary for the five years prior to separation from service. The percentage of Final Pay is 35%. Mr. Pinner's annual benefit is $150,000. See the discussion entitled "Pension Benefits" which provides a description and the   potential amount of retirement benefits each NEO would receive under various termination events based upon the SERP agreements. The agreements include one year non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions, except following a change in control. 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
During 2018, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code prohibited CenterState from claiming a deduction on its federal income tax return for compensation in excess of $1 million paid for a given fiscal year to certain of our senior executives, including our NEOs. Prior to the 2017 tax reform, the $1 million compensation deduction limitation did not apply to "performance-based compensation." The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed the exception for "performance-based compensation" awarded pursuant to compensation agreements entered into after November 2, 2017, but permitted the deduction under Section 162(m) for compensation awards and agreements entered prior to November 2, 2017. 
CenterState does not have a policy that requires all compensation to its named executive officers in a fiscal year to be tax deductible. While the Compensation Committee considers the net cost and value to CenterState of maintaining the deductibility of all compensation, it also desires the flexibility to reward named executive officers and other key employees in a manner that enhances CenterState's ability to attract and retain individuals as well as to create longer term value for shareholders. The Compensation Committee reserves the right to pay nondeductible compensation if it is in the best interests of the Company and consistent with the Company's business needs. 
Compensation Risk Management 
The Company's Compensation Committee reviewed a risk assessment of all incentive plans (defined broadly as cash plans, equity plans, employment agreements and executive benefits plans) in place during fiscal year 2018 that apply throughout the Company. The assessment of the incentive plans was performed by the Company's senior risk officer and entailed discussions of each plan's design and operation. The assessment followed the parameters of the Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies finalized in 2010 that apply to all banking organizations. Major categories included compensation program administration, overall compensation structure, general incentive plan design and payout curves, performance metrics, equity compensation, and termination provisions. 
The purpose of this review was to determine whether the risks related to the design and operation of these plans, if present, are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company or if they are balanced with respect to risk to the Company and the Bank and, specifically, do not encourage the NEOs, senior executives, any employee or employee group to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the Company or the Bank or the safety and soundness of the Bank. We believe that our compensation policies and practices do not encourage excessive risk-taking and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The various factors which support this conclusion include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The oversight of the incentive plans by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Management and risk oversight and monitoring of key plans and programs, including periodically reviewing incentive compensation philosophy, setting  appropriate financial and operating goals based on appropriate incentives, approving target level payouts, and actual payouts based on actual performance during the year;

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vesting requirements, and further stock holding and award deferral requirements which encourage a long-term perspective among participants;

• A preference for performance measures which result in payments only upon achievement of ultimate financial results, which include credit quality  metrics;

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Tailored incentive arrangements that account for differences between employees, particularly senior executives, managers and line employees and among  different employee groups (i.e.. retail, correspondent, mortgage, commercial bank);

 Outstanding Equity Awards at December 31, 2018 
The table below identifies each equity award granted to the NEOs that remains outstanding at December 31, 2018. In September 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded PSUs and RSUs pursuant to the 2018 LTI plan to employees which were granted under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan ("2018 Plan"). Under our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan ("2013 Plan"), our Compensation Committee and/or Board of Directors awarded incentive stock option grants ("ISOs") and Restricted Stock Awards ("RSAs") to employees at their discretion. Options issued pursuant to our 2013 Plan are issued at an exercise price equal to the market value as of the grant date. The closing price of our common stock on the grant date, as reported by Nasdaq, is used to determine market value. Each stock option award granted has a ten year term and vests 10% each year for the first eight years and 20% during the ninth year. Stock option awards granted pursuant to our earlier 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (which was replaced by the 2013 Plan) also have ten year terms, with various vesting periods generally ranging from three to ten years. Unexercised stock options terminate upon the termination of employment, except for death, disability, change of control, or normal retirement. Unvested restricted stock awards terminate upon termination of employment, except for death, disability or change of control. We do not have any pre-determined dates, schedules, procedures or policies for granting equity based compensation awards. Grants are awarded at the discretion of our Compensation Committee and/or Board of Directors.

 PENSION BENEFITS 
The Company has entered into Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans ("SERP") with certain of its executive officers. The plans are nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements that are designed to provide supplemental retirement income benefits to participants. Upon termination of employment on or after normal retirement at age 65, the participant will receive a monthly retirement income benefit equal to a fixed dollar amount in the case of Mr. Pinner, and equal to a percentage of Final Pay in the case of Messrs. Corbett and Young. Final Pay is defined as the executive's highest annualized base salary for the five years prior to separation from service and the percentage of Final Pay is 35%. 
Summary of Mr. Pinner's SERP agreement: 
On December 30, 2008, the Company entered into a SERP agreement with Mr. Pinner. Pursuant to the terms of the SERP, upon normal retirement date, defined as December 15, 2013, Mr. Pinner will be entitled to an annual benefit of $150,000. The Company will distribute the annual benefit to Mr. Pinner in 12 consecutive monthly payments for a period of fifteen years commencing within thirty days subsequent to his defined normal retirement date. Mr. Pinner is vested 100% in the current accrual balance, which is $1,062,984 at December 31, 2018. Mr. Pinner commenced receiving these monthly payments in January 2014. If a change of control occurs the Company will cease future monthly payments and make a lump sum cash payment to Mr. Pinner equal to the present value of all remaining payments previously entitled to him. 
Summary of SERP agreements with Messrs. Corbett and Young: 
On July 13, 2010, the Company entered into SERP agreements with Messrs. Corbett and Young. Pursuant to the terms of the SERP agreements, upon normal retirement date, defined as age 65, Messrs. Corbett and Young will be entitled to 35% of their Final Pay. Final Pay is defined as the executive's highest annualized base salary for the five years prior to separation from service. Based on the assumptions summarized below, the expected annual benefits Messrs. Corbett and Young could be entitled to receive starting at age 65 is approximately $651,724 and $670,390, respectively. The annual benefit payments will be paid for the life of the executive with an 18 year minimum payment. The expected annual benefit payment that they are expected to receive at age 65 will increase by 3.25% each year thereafter. 
Assumptions used to arrive at estimated annual benefits at age 65 include using an annual discount rate of 6% and projecting the estimated Final Pay by using annual average projected salary increases of 6.25%. 
Early Retirement: An executive can elect early retirement at age 55 or older if the executive has at least 10 years of service. Upon early retirement, the annual benefit will be reduced based on the accrual balance as of the month end prior to separation from service. 
Early Voluntary Termination: If early voluntary termination occurs, the benefit payable is the accrual balance determined as of the end of the month preceding separation from service subject to vesting. At December 31, 2018, the executive is 80% vested in his accrual balance with respect to early voluntary termination and will become 100% vested in his accrual balance on December 31, 2019. 
Early Involuntary Termination: If early involuntary termination occurs the benefit is 100% of the accrual balance determined as of the end of the month preceding separation from service plus the projected accruals for the next 60 months following separation from service for the first five years of the plan. Beginning with the sixth plan year the benefit amount will equal the projected accrual balance as of the end of the tenth plan year. During the eleventh plan year and beyond, the benefit amount will equal the accrual balance as of the end of the month preceding separation from service. 
Disability Benefit: If the executive becomes disabled prior to normal retirement, the benefit is 100% of the Accrual Balance determined as of the end of the month preceding such disability. 
Change in Control Benefit: If a change in control occurs prior to normal retirement age, the benefit will be the present value determined as of the date of the change in control, using a 6% discount rate, of the present value,   also using a 6% discount rate, of the eighteen year stream of payments of the projected benefit at normal retirement age. 
Based on assumptions discussed above, the table below summarizes the annual projected normal retirement benefit at commencement for our named executives.

 PROPOSAL THREE 
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has appointed Crowe LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. Crowe LLP has audited our consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2018 and has served in that capacity since fiscal year ending December 31, 2006. While we are not required to do so, we are submitting the appointment of Crowe LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 for ratification in order to ascertain the views of our shareholders on this appointment. If the appointment is not ratified, the Audit Committee may reconsider its selection. Even if the appointment of Crowe LLP is ratified by the shareholders, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, appoint a new independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines such a change would be in the best interests of the Company. We anticipate that a representative of Crowe LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if the representative desires to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders. 
The board of directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Crowe LLP to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.

Services Provided by Crowe LLP 
All services rendered by Crowe LLP in 2018 and 2017 were permissible under applicable laws and regulations, and were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. Pursuant to SEC rules, the fees paid to Crowe for services are disclosed in the table above under the categories listed below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1)  Audit Fees – These are fees for professional services performed for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of financial  statements included in our 10-Q filings, and services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. The increase in base audit fee of 8.5% is reflective of the  growth of the Company from acquisitions, additional lines of business, and increase in the cost of living.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2)  Audit-Related Fees – These are fees for assurance and related services performed that are reasonably related to the performance of the  audit or review of our financial statements. These fees were for services performed related to audit and SEC related requirements pursuant to several acquisitions, our 2017 common stock offering, increases in audit scope related to several business  expansions, including mortgage lending and derivatives, and other related services all of which were approved by the Audit Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3)  Tax Fees – These are fees for professional services performed by Crowe with respect to tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. Crowe  LLP has not been engaged to prepare the  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4)  All Other Fees – These are fees for other permissible work that may be performed by Crowe LLP that do not meet the above category  descriptions.  
[END TABLE]
These services are actively monitored (both as to spending level and work content) by our Audit Committee to maintain the appropriate objectivity and independence in the core work of Crowe, the auditors of our consolidated financial statements. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
Our Board of Directors has an Audit Committee which during 2018 consisted of Directors Nunez, Greene, and Richey, each of whom is an independent director pursuant to the independence standards of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and as defined under the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Mr. Nunez is the chairman of the Audit Committee and has been designated a "financial expert" pursuant to the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The board of directors has deemed Mr. Nunez to meet the criteria for a "financial expert" as defined by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which basically is limited to those who have prepared or audited comparable company financial statements. 
The Audit Committee held 10 meetings during 2018. The Audit Committee of the Board is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight over our financial reporting. The Audit Committee is governed by a written charter adopted and approved by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has implemented a Pre-Approval Policy for Audit and Non-Audit Services to insure that all audit and permitted non-audit services provided to the Company are appropriate. Specifically, the Audit Committee pre-approves the use of an independent accountant for all audit and non-audit services. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members when expedition of services is necessary. The Audit Committee charter and the Company's Pre-Approval Policy for Audit and Non-Audit Services are included in the Company's website at www.centerstatebanks.com. 
This year, the Audit Committee reviewed the Audit Committee Charter and, after appropriate review and discussion, determined that the Audit Committee had fulfilled its responsibilities under the Audit Committee Charter. The Audit Committee also considered and concluded that the independent auditor's provision of non-audit services in 2018 was compatible with applicable independence standards. 
The Audit Committee annually considers whether to retain the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Crowe LLP has been the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 2006. The lead audit partner and other key engagement partners are rotated at least every five years. The current lead audit partner has served in this capacity since 2014 and is scheduled to rotate off as the lead audit partner after the 2018 audit. We have already interviewed the incoming lead partner, who is currently serving as one of the non-lead engagement partners, and are satisfied with the appointment. The Audit Committee, with the assistance of the Company's Internal Audit Department, regularly surveys key operating personnel as to the performance of the independent registered public accounting firm and the other out-sourced internal audit providers. The Audit Committee also reviews and signs all of the audit and non-audit engagement letters, actively negotiates the fees for all audit and non-audit services and preapproves all non-audit services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm.     
In deciding whether to retain Crowe LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee considered, among other factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The professional qualifications of Crowe LLP and that of the lead audit partner and other key engagement members;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Historical and recent performance on the Company's audits, including the extent and quality of communications with the Audit Committee, and Crowe  LLP's commitment and ability to deliver appropriate audit services;  
[END TABLE]

• Crowe LLP's understanding of the Company's business, operations, accounting policies and practices;  
[END TABLE]

• Appropriateness of the audit fees;

• Independence and the processes used by the independent registered public accounting firm to maintain its independence;

• Tenure as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Issues raised by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) in its reports on the Firm's audit quality and Crowe LLP's responses  thereto.  
[END TABLE]
As a result of this evaluation, the Audit Committee recommends the appointment of Crowe LLP as the Company' auditors for 2019. 
Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of our financial statements and its overall financial reporting process and, with the assistance of our internal auditors, for maintaining appropriate internal controls and procedures that provide for compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board that our financial statements be included in our annual report. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit Committee discussed with our independent auditors, those matters required to be communicated to the Audit Committee under applicable PCAOB and U.S. Auditing Standards. These communications and discussions are intended to assist the Audit Committee in overseeing the financial reporting and disclosure process. The Audit Committee also discussed the auditor's independence with the auditors and received a letter from the auditors regarding independence as required by applicable standards concerning independence. Finally, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with our management and the auditors, our audited financial statements as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2018. 
Based on the discussions with the auditors concerning the audit, the independence discussions, and the financial statement review, and additional matters deemed relevant and appropriate by the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to our Board that our Annual Report on Form 10-K include the audited financial statements. 
PAY RATIO 
We are providing the following information to comply with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
We have estimated that our pay ratio for 2018 is 50.8 to 1, calculated pursuant to SEC rules by dividing our CEO's annual total compensation set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 ($2,518,374) by $49,577, which represents the median of the annual total compensation of our employees (other than our CEO) for 2018. We identified our median employee as of December 31, 2018, using our entire workforce of approximately 1,443 full time, part-time and temporary employees (excluding employees acquired due to   mergers in calendar year 2018). Regular earnings, commissions and cash bonus were used to determine the median employee for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. We then calculated the median employee's annual total compensation based on the proxy rules for determining the annual total compensation of our NEOs in order to determine the pay ratio. 
SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and make various assumptions that may differ from other companies' methodologies and/or assumptions. As a result, the pay ratio reported by the Company may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies. 
CERTAIN RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Our subsidiary bank has outstanding loans to certain of our directors, executive officers, their associates and members of the immediate families of such directors and executive officers. These loans were made in the ordinary course of business, were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the banks and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a written policy with respect to related person transactions. For the purpose of the policy, a "related person transaction" is a transaction in which we participate and in which any related person has a direct or indirect interest, other than (i) transactions available to all employees or customers generally, (ii) loans made by our subsidiary bank in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including rates and collateral as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the lending bank, and not involving more than a normal risk of collectability or presenting other unfavorable features; (iii) deposit relationships by a banking subsidiary of the Company in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons, or (iv) director fees. 
Under the policy, any related person transaction may be consummated or may continue only if (i) our Audit Committee approves or ratifies such transaction and if the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm's length dealings with an unrelated third person, (ii) the transaction is approved by the disinterested members of our Board of Directors, or (iii) the transaction involves compensation that has been approved by our Compensation Committee. 
A copy of this policy is included on our website at www.centerstatebanks.com. All related person transactions in 2018 required to be reported in this Proxy Statement were approved by either the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors of our subsidiary bank.

(a)  Information relating to beneficial ownership of CenterState common stock by directors is based upon information furnished by each person using  "beneficial ownership" concepts set forth in rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Under such rules, a person is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if  that person has or shares "voting power," which includes the power to vote or direct the voting of such security, or "investment power," which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A  person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days from February 28, 2019. Under such rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner  of the same securities, and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which he or she may disclaim any beneficial interest.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of CenterState common stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of such securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

OTHER MATTERS 
Our management does not know of any matters to be brought before the Annual Meeting other than those described in this Proxy Statement. If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxies in the enclosed form of proxy and acting thereunder will vote on such matters in accordance with the recommendation of our Board of Directors. 
Upon the written request of any person whose proxy is solicited by this proxy statement, we will furnish to such person without charge (other than for exhibits) a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K   for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, including financial statements and schedules thereto, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Written requests may be made to CenterState Bank Corporation, 1101 First Street South, Winter Haven, FL 33880, Attention: Corporate Secretary. 
Explanation of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
Company compensation as reflected in this proxy statement is awarded based on financial information determined by methods other than Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), including adjusted net income, adjusted EPS and adjusted ROA which we refer to as Non-GAAP financial measures. Management and the Compensation Committee used these Non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company's performance in evaluating compensation during 2018. In addition, this proxy statement contains other Non-GAAP financial measures including ROTCE, adjusted ROTCE, efficiency ratio, TBVPS and adjusted TBVPS. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company's performance as it believes these Non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information and a clearer understanding of the Company's performance trends, and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. The limitations associated with Non-GAAP financial measures are the risk that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items comprising these Non-GAAP financial measures for compensation purposes and that different companies might calculate these Non-GAAP financial measures differently. The table below provides reconciliations between GAAP and these Non-GAAP financial measures. These disclosures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP. All amounts in the table below are in thousands except per share data.
