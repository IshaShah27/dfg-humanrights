A:  In the election of directors, the three nominees receiving the          highest number of affirmative votes will be elected.  You may withhold votes from any or all nominees.   The proposal for the ratification of the appointment of WithumSmith+Brown,          PC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 requires the affirmative "FOR"          votes of a majority of the votes cast on this proposal. Abstentions will not affect the outcome of the vote on this proposal.   If you hold shares beneficially in street name and do not provide          your broker with voting instructions, your shares may constitute "broker non-votes."  Generally, broker non-votes          occur on a matter when a broker is not permitted to vote on that matter without instructions from the beneficial owner and instructions          are not given.

Transactions with Related Persons, Promoters and Certain Control Persons
Certain "related party" transactions involving related persons (excluding executive officer compensation which is determined by the Compensation Committee) are presented to, reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee. Related persons include the Company's directors and executive officers, immediate family members of the directors and executive officers, and security holders who beneficially own five percent or more of our common stock and their respective family members. The transactions subject to such review are those transactions in which the Company was or is to be a participant and the amount involved equals or exceeds $120,000. If the related party involved in a related party transaction is a director of the Company that would normally review such a transaction or a family member of such a director, then that director will not participate in the relevant discussion and review.
Information considered in evaluating such transactions may include: the nature of the related person's interest in the transaction; the material terms of the transaction; whether the terms of the transaction are fair to the Company and on the same basis as would apply if the transaction did not involve a related party; whether there are business reasons for the Company to enter into the transaction; whether the transaction would impair the independence of an outside director; and whether the transaction would present an improper conflict of interests for any director or executive officer of the Company, taking into account the size of the transaction, the overall financial position of the director, executive officer or related party, the direct or indirect nature of the director's, executive officer's or related party's interest in the transaction and the ongoing nature of any proposed relationship; and any other factors the Audit Committee deems relevant.  
The following is a description of the transactions we have engaged in during the year ended December 31, 2017 and through the date hereof, with our directors, director nominees and officers and beneficial owners of more than five percent of our voting securities and their affiliates:
On December 17, 2015, we issued an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of $575,000 to Gan Ren, the son of Ren Ren, a current director and our largest stockholder. The note bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum and matures one year from the date of issuance. On December 17, 2016 the note and accrued interest of $46,000 was automatically converted into 225,864 shares of common stock at $2.75 per share.
On December 17, 2015, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with RENS Technology, Inc., an entity which is controlled by Ren Ren, a current director and our largest stockholder (the "Purchaser"). Pursuant to terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser agreed to invest $20.25 million in the Company in exchange for (i) an aggregate of 3,537,037 shares of common stock and (ii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 884,259 shares of common stock (the "Financing"). In connection with the Financing, the Board agreed to issue Mr. Ren 18,182 shares of common stock following the closing of the Financing for his services to the Company as a member of the Board.
On March 3, 2016, we completed the first tranche of the Financing pursuant to which the Purchaser acquired 1,500,000 shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase 375,000 shares of the Company's common stock for $5.25 million.
On August 19, 2016, the Purchaser notified the Company that it did not intend to fulfill its obligation to fund the second tranche of the Financing, notwithstanding its confirmation to the Company in June 2016 that the Purchaser would provide such funding in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement.
In October 2016, the Company received a purchase order from RENS Agriculture to purchase $118 of our product. We received a 50% deposit in November 2016 in order to manufacture the product. The goods were shipped in January 2017 and received in China in March 2017. We have not received payment for the order to date and the balance of $59 was written off as bad debt in 2017.
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons.
Our Board of Directors has established an audit committee consisting of independent directors. This committee, among other duties, is charged to review, and if appropriate, ratify all agreements and transactions which had been entered into with related parties, as well as review and ratify all future related party transactions.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to report their initial beneficial ownership and any subsequent changes in that beneficial ownership of our securities to the SEC. Based solely on a review of the copies of the reports furnished to us, we believe that all such reports for the year ended December 31, 2017 were filed on a timely basis.
Vote Required
The three nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected to the Board.  You may withhold votes from any or all nominees.
Recommendation of the Board
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" the election of the nominees to the Board to serve until the 2021 Annual Meeting and until their successors are duly elected and qualify. 
PROPOSAL NO. 2: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board has appointed WithumSmith+Brown, PC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018.  Although this appointment does not require ratification, the Board has directed that the appointment of WithumSmith+Brown, PC be submitted to stockholders for ratification due to the significance of their appointment to us.  If stockholders do not ratify the appointment of WithumSmith+Brown, PC, the Board will consider the appointment of another independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Representatives of WithumSmith+Brown, PC are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, where they will be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if they desire, to make a statement.
Change in Auditors 
EisnerAmper, LLP ("EisnerAmper") served as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015.  On May 19, 2016, the audit committee and our board of directors dismissed EisnerAmper, effective immediately. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, EisnerAmper's audit reports on our financial statements did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the subsequent period through the date of their resignation, (i) there were no disagreements between us and EisnerAmper on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to EisnerAmper's satisfaction, would have caused EisnerAmper to make reference in connection with EisnerAmper's opinion to the subject matter of the disagreement; and (ii) there were no "reportable events" as the term is described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. 
Fees Billed by our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm During 2016 and 2017 
 For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, WithumSmith+Brown, PC, served as our principal accountant.
Audit Fees. Audit fees consist of fees for professional services rendered for the annual audits of our financial statements, quarterly reviews of financial statements and services that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. Audit fees billed by WithumSmith+ Brown, PC for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were approximately $108,000 and $84,000, respectively.
Audit-Related Fees. Audit-related services consist of fees for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under "Audit Fees." These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. There were no fees billed for audit-related services rendered during the last two fiscal years.
Tax Fees. Tax services consist of fees for the preparation of federal and state tax returns. Tax fees paid by WithumSmith+Brown, PC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $10,750 and $9,500, respectively.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter is required to ratify the appointment of WithumSmith+Brown, PC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Abstentions will not affect the outcome of the vote on the proposal. 
Recommendation of the Board 
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of WithumSmith+Brown, PC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. 
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights.
The following table sets forth information known to us regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of October 19, 2018 by:
Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them. As of October 19, 2018, there were 7,473,723 shares of our common stock outstanding.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board Meetings
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Board held twelve formal meetings and otherwise acted by unanimous written consent. We have no written policy regarding director attendance at annual meetings of stockholders. Our last annual meeting of stockholders was held on December 28, 2017 and five of our directors attended such meeting.
Director Independence
The Board evaluates the independence of each nominee for election as a director in accordance with the Nasdaq listing rules (the "Nasdaq Listing Rules"). Pursuant to these rules, a majority of our Board must be "independent directors" within the meaning of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and all directors who sit on our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee must also be independent directors.
The Nasdaq definition of "independence" includes a series of objective tests, such as the director or director nominee is not, and was not during the last three years, our employee and has not received certain payments from, or engaged in various types of business dealings with, us. In addition, as further required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Board has made a subjective determination as to each independent director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with such individual's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director. In making these determinations, the Board reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors with regard to each director's business and personal activities as they may relate to us and our management.
As a result, the Board has affirmatively determined that other than Mr. Ren and Mr. Mannello, none of our directors or director nominees has a material relationship with the Company. The Board has also affirmatively determined that all members of our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee are independent directors. 
Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert
In April 2014, we established a separately-designated standing Audit Committee in accordance with Section 3(a) (58) (A) of the Exchange Act and the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The Audit Committee is comprised of Victor Mandel (chair), Dr. Louis J. Aronne and Chris Pechock, all of who are independent directors. Our Board has determined that Mr. Mandel qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined by the rules of the SEC, based on his education, experience and background. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Audit Committee held four formal meetings.
The Audit Committee:
Compensation Committee 
In April 2014, we established a separately-designated standing Compensation Committee in accordance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The Compensation Committee is comprised of Christopher Pechock (chair) and Dr. Louis J. Aronne, all of whom are independent directors. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Compensation Committee held two formal meetings.
The Compensation Committee:
Director Nominations 
Our Board of Directors does not maintain a separate nominating committee. Functions customarily performed by a nominating committee are performed by the independent members of our Board. In evaluating and determining whether to nominate a candidate for a position on the Board, the independent members of our Board utilize a variety of methods and considers criteria such as high professional ethics and values, experience on the policy-making level in business or scientific/medical research experience relevant to our product candidates and a commitment to enhancing stockholder value. Candidates may be brought to the attention of the independent members of the Board by current Board members, stockholders, officers or other persons. The independent members of the Board will review all candidates in the same manner regardless of the source of the recommendation.
We have no formal policy regarding diversity of our Board of Directors. The independent members of our Board may therefore consider a broad range of factors relating to the qualifications and background of nominees, which may include diversity, which is not only limited to race, gender or national origin. The priority of the independent members of our Board in selecting members of the Board of Directors is identifying persons who will further the interests of our stockholders through his or her established record of professional accomplishment, the ability to contribute positively to the collaborative culture among Board members and professional and personal experiences and expertise relevant to our growth strategy.
The independent members of the Board also consider stockholder recommendations for director nominees that are properly received in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. In order to validly nominate a candidate for election or reelection as a director, stockholders must give timely notice of such nomination in writing to our Corporate Secretary and include, as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected).
Board Leadership Structure
Dr. Robert J. Hariri serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Mr. Ren serves as our Global Chairman. Mr. Mannello currently serves as our principal executive officer. The Board of Directors has chosen to separate the principal executive officer and chairman positions because it believes that (i) independent oversight of management is an important component of an effective board of directors and (ii) this structure benefits the interests of all stockholders. If the Board of Directors convenes for a special meeting, the non-management directors will meet in executive session if circumstances warrant. Given the composition of the Board of Directors with a strong slate of independent directors, the Board of Directors does not believe that it is necessary to formally designate a lead independent director at this time, although it may consider appointing a lead independent director if circumstances change. We believe that the structure described above is the best structure to lead us in the achievement of our goals and objectives and establishes an effective balance between management leadership and appropriate oversight by independent directors. 
Board Role in Risk Oversight
Senior management is responsible for assessing and managing our various exposures to risk on a day-to-day basis, including the creation of appropriate risk management programs and policies. The Board is responsible for overseeing management in the execution of its responsibilities and for assessing our approach to risk management. In addition, an overall review of risk is inherent in the Board's consideration of our long-term strategies and in the transactions and other matters presented to the Board, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestitures, and financial matters.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a corporate Code of Ethics. The text of our Code of Ethics, which applies to our employees, officers and directors, is posted in the "Corporate Governance" section of our website, http://www.myosrens.com. A copy of our Code of Ethics is also available in print, free of charge, upon written request to 45 Horsehill Road, Suite 106, Cedar Knolls, New Jersey 07927 Attention: Joseph Mannello.
Stockholder Communications with the Board
Stockholders who wish to do so may communicate directly with the Board or specified individual directors by writing to:
Board of Directors (or name of individual director)
MYOS RENS Technology Inc.
45 Horsehill Road, Suite 106
Cedar Knolls, New Jersey 07927
We will forward all communications from security holders and interested parties to the full Board, to non-management directors, to an individual director that is most closely related to the subject matter of the communication, except for the following types of communications: (i) communications that advocate that we engage in illegal activity; (ii) communications that, under community standards, contain offensive or abusive content; (iii) communications that have no relevance to our business or operations; and (iv) mass mailings, solicitations and advertisements.  The Corporate Secretary will determine when a communication is not to be forwarded.  Our acceptance and forwarding of communications to directors does not imply that directors owe or assume any fiduciary duties to persons submitting the communications. 
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Prior to the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 with management and WithumSmith+Brown, PC, our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2017. In its discussion, management has represented to the Audit Committee that our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
The Audit Committee has discussed with our independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") in Rule 3200T.
The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from our former independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the former independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has considered and discussed with WithumSmith+Brown, PC, such firm's independence.
Based on the Audit Committee's review of the audited financial statements and the various discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
Respectfully submitted,
Victor Mandel

PROXY SOLICITATION
The solicitation of proxies is made on behalf of the Board and we will bear the cost of soliciting proxies.  The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock, Island Stock Transfer, as a part of its regular services and for no additional compensation other than reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, has been engaged to assist in the proxy solicitation.  Proxies may be solicited through the mail and through telephonic or telegraphic communications to, or by meetings with, stockholders or their representatives by our directors, officers and other employees who will receive no additional compensation therefor. We may also retain a proxy solicitation firm to assist us in obtaining proxies by mail, facsimile or email from record and beneficial holders of shares for the Annual Meeting. If we retain a proxy solicitation firm, we expect to pay such firm reasonable and customary compensation for its services, including out-of-pocket expenses.
We request persons such as brokers, nominees and fiduciaries holding stock in their names for others, or holding stock for others who have the right to give voting instructions, to forward proxy material to their principals and to request authority for the execution of the proxy.  We will reimburse such persons for their reasonable expenses.
ANNUAL REPORT
The Annual Report is being sent with this Proxy Statement to each stockholder and is available at the Investor Relations portion of our website as well as on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.  The Annual Report contains our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.  The Annual Report, however, is not to be regarded as part of the proxy soliciting material.
DELIVERY OF PROXY MATERIALS TO HOUSEHOLDS
Only one copy of this Proxy Statement and one copy of our Annual Report are being delivered to multiple registered stockholders who share an address unless we have received contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders. A separate form of proxy and a separate notice of the Annual Meeting are being included for each account at the shared address. Registered stockholders who share an address and would like to receive a separate copy of our Annual Report and/or a separate copy of this Proxy Statement, or have questions regarding the householding process, may contact the Company's transfer agent: Island Stock Transfer, by calling (727) 289-0010, or by forwarding a written request addressed to Island Stock Transfer, 15500 Roosevelt Boulevard, Suite 301, Clearwater, Florida 33760.
