10868 189th Street, Council Bluffs, IA PROXY STATEMENT
FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF MEMBERS
TO BE HELD FEBRUARY 15, 2019
INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING, VOTING AND PROXIES
Date, Time and Place of Meeting
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, LLC, an Iowa limited liability company (the "Company," "SIRE," "we," or "us"),             of proxies to be voted at the Annual Meeting of Members to be held on February 15, 2019, or any adjournment or postponement thereof (the "2019 Annual Meeting").  A copy of our annual report to members on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 ("Fiscal 2018"), which includes our financial statements for Fiscal 2018 (the "Annual Report"), has been made available to our members beginning on December 14, 2018.  Beginning on or about December 17, 2018, we made this Proxy Statement available to our members.
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR
THE MEMBERS' MEETING TO BE HELD ON FEBRUARY 15, 2019
Our Proxy Statement and Annual Report are also available online at www.sireethanol.com
Internet Availability of Proxy Materials
Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's "notice and access" rules, we have elected to use the Internet as our primary           means of furnishing proxy materials to our members. Consequently, most members will not receive paper copies of our proxy materials. We instead sent our members a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Internet Availability Notice") containing instructions on how to access this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report via the Internet. The Internet Availability Notice also included           instructions on how to receive a paper copy of your proxy materials, if you so choose. If you received your annual meeting materials by mail, your proxy materials, including your proxy card, were enclosed. We believe that this process expedites           members' receipt of proxy materials, lowers the costs of our 2019 Annual Meeting and helps to conserve natural resources.
This Proxy Statement, the Notice of the 2019 Annual Meeting, proxy card and our Annual Report may be requested by calling (877)         776-5999, emailing proxies@sireethanol.com or accessing www.sireethanol.com and clicking on the "Investor Relations" tab. Proxy Solicitation
The Company will bear the expense of this solicitation of proxies, including the preparation, assembly, printing and mailing of the           Internet Availability Notice, this Proxy Statement, the proxy card and any additional solicitation material that the Company may provide to members. Copies of the proxy materials and any other solicitation materials will be provided to brokerage           firms, banks, fiduciaries, trustees, custodians or other nominees holding units in their names that are beneficially owned by others so that they may forward the solicitation material to such beneficial owners. We will reimburse such brokerage           firms, banks, fiduciaries, trustees, custodians or other nominees for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with forwarding the proxy materials and any other solicitation materials.  The original solicitation of           proxies by mail may be supplemented by solicitation by telephone and other means by directors, officers and employees of the Company. No additional compensation will be paid to these individuals for any such services.   The Company has not           employed any third party to solicit proxies for the 2019 Annual Meeting.
Purposes of the Annual Meeting
The purposes of the 2019 Annual Meeting are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (1)   Elect one Series A Director to serve until the 2023 Annual Meeting of Members or until his successor shall be elected and qualified;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (2)   Conduct an advisory vote on executive compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (3)   Transact such other business as may properly come before the meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof.  
[END TABLE]
Board Voting Recommendations
Our Board unanimously recommends that the holders of our Series A Units (the "Series A Members") vote FOR the election of the Series A Director nominee named under the section         entitled "Proposal 1 – Election of Series A Director, Series A Director Nominee" and that all members vote FOR the proposal regarding the advisory vote on executive compensation under the section entitled "Proposal 2 – Advisory Vote to Approve Executive           Compensation."
Record Date and Outstanding Units
The record date for holders of units entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the 2019 Annual Meeting is the close of business on December         17, 2018 (the "Record Date").  As of the Record Date, we had 8,993 Series A Units, 3,334 Series B Units and 1,000 Series C Units outstanding and entitled to vote at the         2019 Annual Meeting.
Proxy Voting
With respect to voting on each of the proposals, members are entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each unit, regardless of         class or series, held in the member's name at the close of business on the Record Date (though only Series A Members may vote for the election of the Series A Director).   By signing and returning the proxy card according to the instructions provided, you are enabling the individuals named on the proxy card, known as "proxies," to vote your units at the 2019 Annual Meeting in the manner you         indicate. The proxies will vote your units in accordance with your instructions indicated on the proxy card you submit.  If you submit a proxy card, but do not indicate your voting instructions, your units will be voted by the proxies as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● FOR the election of the Series A Director nominee listed in this Proxy Statement                      (for Series A Members); and  
● FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of our executive compensation (for all                      members).  
[END TABLE]
As to any other business as may properly come before the 2019 Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, your units will         be voted (for all members) at the discretion of the proxies in a manner that they consider being in the best interests of the Company.
Voting by Mail
As noted above, by signing and returning the proxy card according             to the instructions provided, you are enabling the individuals named on the proxy card, known as "proxies," to vote your units at the 2019 Annual Meeting in the manner you indicate.  We encourage you to sign and return the proxy card even if you plan to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting.  In this way your units will be voted even if you are unable to attend the meeting.  If you attend the 2019 Annual Meeting in February, you may nevertheless revoke your proxy and vote in person even though you previously mailed the proxy card. Voting in Person at the Meeting
If you plan to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting and vote in person, we will provide you with a ballot at the meeting.  If your units are         registered directly in your name, you are considered the member of record and you have the right to vote in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  If your units are held in the name of your brokerage firm, bank, fiduciary, trustee, custodian or other         nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of the units not the member of record.  In that case, if you wish to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting, you will need to bring with you to the meeting a legal proxy from your brokerage firm, bank,         fiduciary, trustee, custodian or other nominee authorizing you to vote these units. If you attend the 2019 Annual Meeting in February, you may nevertheless revoke           your proxy and vote in person even though you previously mailed the proxy card.
Revocability of Proxies
A member who has submitted a proxy card may revoke             the proxy prior to its exercise at the 2019 Annual Meeting either by giving written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company or by providing a duly executed proxy card bearing a later date. Attendance in person at the 2019 Annual             Meeting does not itself revoke a proxy; however, any member who attends the 2019 Annual Meeting may revoke a previously submitted proxy by voting in person.  If you are the beneficial owner of your units and not the member of record, you will             need to contact your brokerage firm, bank, fiduciary, trustee, custodian or other nominee to revoke any prior voting instructions.
Quorum
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the units outstanding and entitled to vote         at the 2019 Annual Meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum.  Because the proxy card states how the units will be voted in the absence of instructions by the member, executed proxy cards bearing no instructions by the member will be counted as         present for quorum purposes and for the purpose of voting on each proposal presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
Treatment of Abstentions and Withhold Authority Votes
Abstentions and proxies or ballots marked to "withhold authority" will be               counted for purposes of determining (i) the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business and (ii) the total number of units present in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting with respect to each proposal.
Pursuant to Section 6.16 of our Fourth Amended and Restated Operating Agreement dated March 21, 2014 (the "Operating Agreement"), the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting interests represented at a meeting and entitled to vote on the matter constitutes the act of the members unless a greater or         lesser proportion or amount is required under our Operating Agreement.  As a result, proxies or ballots which are marked to "abstain" or "withhold authority" will be counted for purposes of voting for each proposal and will count as a vote against         each proposal.
Vote Required
Approval of Proposal 1, the election of the Series A Director, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the Series A         Units present in person or represented by proxy at a meeting at which a quorum is present.
Approval of Proposal 2, the advisory vote to approve executive compensation, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of         the units (which includes Series A Units, Series B Units and Series C Units) represented in person or by proxy at a meeting at which a quorum is present.
As noted above, abstentions or ballots or proxies noted "withhold authority" will have the legal effect of a vote against         Proposal 1 and Proposal 2.
Voting Results
We will announce the preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the 2019 Annual Meeting. The final voting results will be         tallied and published in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") within four business days following the         2019 Annual Meeting.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules of the SEC require our directors, certain officers and beneficial owners of more than         10% of our outstanding units to file reports of their ownership and changes in ownership of our units with the SEC. Company employees or advisors generally prepare these reports on behalf of our executive officers on the basis of information         obtained from them and review the forms submitted to us by our non-employee directors and beneficial owners of more than 10% of the units.  Based on such information, we believe that all reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be         filed by our directors, officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of the units during or with respect to Fiscal Year 2018 were filed on time.
PROPOSAL 1
ELECTION OF SERIES A DIRECTOR
One Series A Director is to be elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  The Series A Director nominee elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting         will serve until the 2023 Annual Meeting of Members or until his successor shall be elected and qualified. The proxies named in the proxy card intend to vote FOR         the election of the Series A Director nominee named below who will serve until the 2023 Annual Meeting of Members or until his successor shall be elected and qualified, unless instructions otherwise are properly indicated by the Series A Member on         a member's proxy card.  If the nominee shall become unavailable for any reason, the proxies named in the proxy card are expected to consult with our Board in voting the units represented by them at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  Our Board has no reason         to doubt the availability of the nominee and no reason to believe the nominee will be unable or unwilling to serve the entire term for which election is sought.
The name of the Series A Director nominee, along with certain information concerning such nominee is set forth below under the section         entitled "Series A Director Nominee."
Series A Director Nominee
The Series A Director nominee to be elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting to serve a four-year term is Michael K. Guttau, age 72.  Mr.         Guttau has been a Series A Director since 2007 and is the Chair of our Board's Audit Committee and a member of our Board's Nominating Committee and Risk Management Committee.
Mr. Guttau has more than 30 years of experience as a rural banker.  He has held various positions with Treynor State Bank, where he         currently serves as Chairman of the Board.  Mr. Guttau serves as a director of the Iowa Bankers Association where he has been serving as Chairman since 2014.  Mr. Guttau also serves as a director of the Iowa Bankers Mortgage Corporation, Iowa         Student Loan Liquidity Corp., Iowa Business Development Finance Corp. and Iowa See Capital Liquidation Corp.  Mr. Guttau previously served as a board member of a number of banking organizations, including the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks in         Washington, D.C., where he served as Chairman from 2008 to 2009, the Iowa Division of Banking, where he served as Superintendent of Banking from 1995 to 1999, and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines where he has served as Chairman from 2008 to         2012 and Vice Chairman from 2004 to 2007.  He has also served as President of the Southwest Iowa Bank Administration Institute and he served as the Chairman of the ABA Community Bankers from 1991 to 1992.
Mr. Guttau meets the "independent director" standards applicable to companies listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market (though our units are         not listed on any exchange or quotation system).  Mr. Guttau does not serve as a director of any other company having a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or subject to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, nor does         he serve as a director of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act").  Mr. Guttau's address is         10868 189th Street, Council Bluffs, Iowa 51503.
Additional information regarding our Board and our Series A, Series B and Series C Directors is set forth below under the sections         entitled "Board of Directors and Corporate Governance."
Vote Required
Series A Members may not vote for more than the one Series A Director nominee above.  To be elected a Series A Director, the nominee         must receive the favorable vote of the majority of Series A Units entitled to vote and represented in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  Because the affirmative vote of a           majority of units entitled to vote on the matter and represented in person or by proxy is required to approve Proposal 1, proxies or ballots marked to "withhold authority"           will be have the legal effect of a vote against this proposal.
OUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT THE SERIES A MEMBERS VOTE "FOR"         THE ELECTION OF MICHAEL K. GUTTAU AS A SERIES A DIRECTOR FOR A FOUR-YEAR TERM.
PROPOSAL 2
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing our members with the opportunity to approve, on a non-binding advisory         basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.
As described more fully in the "Executive           Compensation" section of this Proxy Statement, our compensation policies are designed to align our executives' compensation with both our business objectives and the interests of our members. We also seek to provide compensation policies         that attract, motivate and retain key executives who are critical to our success. A significant portion of the compensation we provide to our executives is directly related to our financial performance and member value. We urge our members to read the "Executive           Compensation" section of this Proxy Statement for a more thorough discussion of our compensation philosophy, including the design and objectives of our elements of compensation. We also recommend that our members review the application of         our compensation philosophy and the elements of compensation provided to each Named Executive Officer as reflected in the discussion and tables included in the "Executive               Compensation" section of this Proxy Statement.
We believe that our compensation policies and procedures are reasonable based on the size and complexity of our Company and its         operations, that our executive compensation policies are designed appropriately to incentivize the achievement of financial goals that have benefited our Company and that such policies and procedures are functioning as intended to produce long-term         value for our members. Accordingly, we are asking our members to approve the overall application of our compensation policies to our Named Executive Officers through this advisory vote. The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any         specific element of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our Named Executive Officers and the policies and procedures described in this Proxy Statement.
For the reasons stated above, our Board recommends that members vote FOR the following advisory resolution at our 2019 Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Proxy         Statement for our 2019 Annual Meeting pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the compensation tables and related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED."
Advisory Vote
As this is an advisory vote, the outcome of the vote is not binding on us with respect to future executive compensation decisions,         including those relating to our Named Executive Officers, or otherwise. However, the Corporate Governance/Compensation Committee and our Board value the input of the Company's members and therefore expect to take into account the outcome of this         member advisory vote when considering future executive compensation decisions.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of a majority of the units represented at the 2019           Annual Meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter is required for the approval of the proposal.  Because a majority of units entitled to vote on the matter and represented in person or by proxy is required to approve           Proposal 2, abstentions will have the legal effect of a vote against this proposal.
OUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT THE MEMBERS VOTE "FOR"         THE ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board Leadership Structure
We are managed by a Chief Executive Officer who is separate from the Chairman of the Board.  During all of Fiscal 2018, Brian T. Cahill         served as our Chief Executive Officer and Karol D. King served as our Chairman of the Board. Mr. Cahill ceased serving as our Chief Executive Officer on October 21, 2018 and effective October 22, 2018, Michael D. Jerke commenced serving as our         Chief Executive Officer.
We have determined that the current separation of the two roles allows our Chief Executive Officer to manage our day-to-day operations         while allowing our Chairman to focus on leading our Board in its duty to act in the best interest of the Company and its members.  We believe this leadership structure allows our Board to best focus on its oversight role and provide us a         perspective that is independent from that of our management.  Our Operating Agreement provides that our Board will appoint someone other than the Chairman of the Board as our President; however, our Board reserves the right to determine the         appropriate leadership structure from time to time. Board Role in Risk Oversight
Although management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks to the Company, our Board provides broad oversight         of the Company's risk management programs. In this oversight role, our Board is responsible for satisfying itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by the Company's management are functioning and that the systems and         processes in place will bring to its attention the material risks facing the Company in order for our Board to effectively oversee the management of these risks. A fundamental part of risk management is not only understanding the risks a company         faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for the Company. The involvement of our full Board in the risk oversight process allows our Board to assess management's         appetite for risk and also to determine what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for the Company. Our Board  regularly includes agenda items at its meetings relating to its risk oversight role and meets with various members of management on a         range of topics, including corporate governance and regulatory obligations, operations and significant transactions, business continuity planning, succession planning, risk management, insurance, network security and cybersecurity threats, pending         and threatened litigation and significant commercial disputes.
While our Board provides broad oversight of the           Company's risk management processes, various committees of the Board oversee risk management in their respective areas and regularly report on their activities to our entire Board.   Principally, the Risk Management Committee assists our         Board in identifying and quantifying methods of mitigating or eliminating risk, primarily those relating to commodity prices.  In addition, the Audit Committee focuses on           assessing and mitigating financial risk, including internal controls, and receives an annual risk assessment report from the Company's independent auditors.  The Corporate Governance/Compensation Committee also strives to create compensation           incentives that encourage a level of risk-taking behavior consistent with the Company's business strategy.
We believe the division of risk management responsibilities described above is an effective approach for addressing the risks         facing the Company and that our Board leadership structure provides appropriate checks and balances against undue risk taking.
Directors
Our Series A Directors are nominated by our Board, following consideration and recommendation by our Board's Nominating Committee, and         then elected by our Series A Members.  The two Series B Directors and the Series C Director are appointed by Bunge North America, Inc. ("Bunge") and ICM, Inc. ("ICM"), respectively, in accordance with the terms of our Operating Agreement.

The Code of Ethics is available in the "Investor Relations" section of our website at www.sireethanol.com.         We will disclose amendments to, or waivers of, certain provisions of our Code of Ethics relating to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, controller or persons performing similar functions on our website promptly following         the adoption of any such amendment or waiver.
Board Committees
Our Board has standing Audit, Nominating, Corporate Governance/Compensation and Risk Management Committees.
Audit Committee
We have a separately-designated standing Audit Committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act, which         operates under a written charter (the "Audit Committee Charter").  A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is available on our website at www.sireethanol.com in the         "Investor Relations" section. The current members of the Audit Committee are Michael K. Guttau (Chair), Theodore V. Bauer and Karol D. King each of whom served on the committee for all of Fiscal 2018.  All of the members of the Audit Committee meet         the "independent director" standards applicable to companies listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market (though our units are not listed on any exchange or quotation system).  Our Board has determined that Mr. Guttau is an "audit committee financial         expert" as that term is defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. Among other things, the Audit Committee has the authority to appoint and supervise our independent registered public accounting firm and         is primarily responsible for approving the services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm and for reviewing and evaluating our accounting principles and system of internal accounting controls.
Nominating Committee
The Nominating Committee operates under a written charter (the "Nominating                 Committee Charter"), which is available on our website at www.sireethanol.com  in the "Investor Relations" section.  The Nominating Committee Charter provides that the Nominating Committee will (i) identify individuals         qualified to become Board members for election by our Series A Members, (ii) recommend to our Board persons to fill Board vacancies or to stand for election by members, (iii) recommend to our Board nominees for each Board committee, including a         financial expert to serve on the Audit Committee and (iv) oversee all aspects of the transfer of units including compliance with the Company's Unit Transfer Policy.  The current members of the Nominating Committee are Hubert M. Houser (Chair),         Theodore V. Bauer, Michael K. Guttau and Karol D. King each of whom served on the committee for all of Fiscal 2018.  All of the directors serving on the Nominating Committee meet the "independent director" standards applicable to companies listed         on the NASDAQ Capital Market (though our units are not listed on any exchange or quotation system).
The Nominating Committee believes that having directors with relevant experience in business and industry, government, finance and other         areas is beneficial to our Board as a whole.  Directors with such backgrounds provide a useful perspective on significant risks and competitive advantages and an understanding of the challenges the Company faces.  The Nominating Committee does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all directors or prospective nominees.
With respect to nominating existing directors, the Nominating Committee reviews relevant information available to it, including the         latest Board evaluations for such persons, if any, and assesses their continued ability and willingness to serve as a director.  The Nominating Committee also assesses such persons' contributions in light of the mix of skills and experience the         Nominating Committee deems appropriate for our Board.  With respect to nominations of new directors, the Nominating Committee will conduct a thorough search to identify candidates based upon criteria the Nominating Committee deems appropriate and         considering the mix of skills and experience necessary to complement existing Board members.  Prospective nominees are not discriminated against on the basis of age, gender, race,           religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or any other basis proscribed by law.  The Nominating Committee then reviews selected candidates and makes a recommendation to our Board.  The Nominating Committee         may seek input from other Board members or senior management in identifying candidates.
The Nominating Committee Charter provides that the Nominating Committee will consider director candidates recommended by members the         same way it evaluates other individuals for nomination as a new director, provided that member nominations for directors must be made in accordance with our Operating Agreement (see the section below entitled "Member Proposals for the 2019 Annual Meeting – Series A Director Nominations").  We did not receive any member nominations for director for the 2019 Annual Meeting.
Corporate Governance/Compensation Committee
The Corporate Governance/Compensation Committee operates under a written charter (the "Governance/ Compensation Committee Charter") which is available on our website at www.sireethanol.com in the "Investor Relations" section. The Governance/Compensation Committee Charter provides that the         Corporate Governance/Compensation Committee will annually review and approve our compensation programs for our directors, officers and managers, review and evaluate the Board and committee structure and the Company's corporate governance practices         and policies, review and evaluate the Company's incentive and equity plans and other employee benefit programs and lead the Board in its annual review of the Board's         performance.  The Corporate Governance/Compensation Committee's membership currently consists of Messrs. Bauer (Chair), King and Klootwyk. Messrs. Bauer and King meet the "independent director" standards applicable to companies listed on the NASDAQ         Capital Market (though our units are not listed on any exchange or quotation system).   As discussed above, Mr. Klootwyk is considered an interested director.
Risk Management Committee
The Risk Management Committee operates under a written charter (the "Risk                 Management Committee Charter") which is available on our website at www.sireethanol.com in the "Investor Relations" section.  The Risk Management Committee makes recommendations to our Board relating to methods of effectively         managing the Company's physical assets, contractual commitments, seeking market opportunities and adding value to the Company's operating facility.  The Risk Management Committee also assists our Board in identifying and quantifying methods of         mitigating or eliminating risk, including those relating to commodity prices.  The current members of the Risk Management Committee are Messrs. Caplice (Chair), Bulloch, Guttau and Houser. Prior to the resignation of Mr. Gibson on March 31, 2018,         the Risk Management Committee membership consisted of Messrs. Gibson (Chair), Bulloch, Guttau and Houser. The Risk Management Committee Charter provides that our Board may appoint members of management and consultants to serve on the Risk         Management Committee as either voting or non-voting members.  Brian T. Cahill, our former President and CEO served on the Risk Management Committee as a voting member for all of Fiscal 2018 and until on October 21, 2018.  Mr. Jerke, our current         President and CEO, currently serves on the Risk Management Committee as a voting member and has served on the committee since his appointment on October 22, 2018.

In addition, the Audit Committee held 4 meetings, the Corporate Governance/Compensation         Committee held 4 meetings, the Risk Management Committee held 12 meetings and the Nominating Committee held 3 meetings.  No incumbent director attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of the Board meetings and committee meetings held on which an         incumbent director served during Fiscal 2018 except Mr. Caplice. The Company's policy is to encourage, but not require, Board members to attend annual member meetings. All but two of our Board members attended the 2018 annual meeting of members.

Our director compensation policy (the "Director Compensation Policy").

As Chairman of the Board, Mr. King oversaw the Company's search for a new Chief Executive Officer.

 Compensation of Executive Officers
Pursuant to the Governance/Compensation Charter, the Corporate Governance/Compensation Committee approves the compensation terms for our         executive officers and all adjustments to the compensation terms. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 ("Fiscal 2010"), the Corporate Governance/Compensation         Committee engaged an independent compensation consultant (the "Consultant") to evaluate the compensation of our executive officers in relation to other executive officers         in comparable positions in the industry.  During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 ("Fiscal 2015"), the Corporate Governance/Compensation Committee received input         from the Consultant with respect to expanding awards under the Company's long term equity incentive compensation plan (discussed below) to a broader group of employees.
Additionally, during Fiscal 2010, the Corporate Governance/Compensation Committee met with the Consultant to develop a company-wide         compensation philosophy based on comparable market data and the establishment of a management evaluation process.  Our compensation philosophy provides that the compensation of our senior executives is designed to achieve the following objectives:         (i) align the interests of the executive officers and our unit holders; (ii) attract, retain and motivate high caliber executive officers; and (iii) pay for performance by linking a significant amount of executive compensation to individual         contribution to selected metrics of our business plan.  The following are the main elements of compensation for our executive officers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Base Salary: A portion of annual cash compensation                    is paid as base salary to provide a level of security and stability.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Annual Cash Incentive: A significant portion of the                    annual cash compensation paid to our executive officers is tied to a cash bonus plan in which all employees of the Company participate.  The plan provides for the payment of cash bonuses based on the achievement of performance goals and                    individual contributions.   Awards were available for Fiscal 2018 and were paid to employees in November 2018 (Fiscal 2019).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Long-Term Incentive Compensation:  Our Board of Directors adopted an                    Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") in June 2010 to allow officers or employees of the Company to share in our value through the issuance, from time to time, of                    Equity Participation Units ("Equity Participation Units") and/or Unit Appreciation Rights ("Unit                                Appreciation Rights").  Each award is granted pursuant to an individual award agreement, which sets forth the number of Equity Participation Units or Unit Appreciation Rights granted, the book value of our Series A Units as                    of the grant date for purposes of valuing each Equity Participation Unit or Unit Appreciation Right, the fiscal year for which the Equity Participation Unit or Unit Appreciation Right is granted, and any In-Service Payment Date (as                    defined in the Plan).  The Corporate Governance/Compensation Committee is responsible for designing, reviewing and overseeing the administration of the Plan and all awards are recommended by the Corporate Governance/Compensation Committee                    and then approved by our Board.  During Fiscal 2015, the Corporate Governance/Compensation Committee received input from the Consultant with respect to expanding awards under the Plan to additional employees.

● Retirement and Welfare Benefits:  We sponsor both a standard 401(k) and                    Roth 401(k) plan. A new hire is eligible to participate in these plans beginning on their start date. While eligible employees are given an option to enroll, those who do not choose either "yes" or "no" are automatically enrolled in the                    standard 401(k) plan at 3% withholding.  Under the program, we match the first 3%, and ½ of the next 2%, of the employee's contributions.  Each participant picks his or her own investment strategy—either the planned grouping of                    investments or individually selected investments.  We have implemented a basic benefits plan for all full time employees, including medical, dental, life insurance, disability and long-term care coverage.

Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the expiration of the Transition Period                      and the termination of Mr. Cahill's employment with the Company will constitute a separation from service upon retirement event that will result in the vesting of all of Mr. Cahill's unvested Equity Participation Units and trigger the                      Company's payout obligations. Additional information regarding the payout obligations of the Company for Mr. Cahill's Equity Participation Units is set forth below in footnote 3 to the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal 2018 Year-End" table.

3  Under the terms of the Plan, the expiration of the Transition Period will constitute a separation from service upon retirement which will cause all of Mr. Cahill's unvested                      Equity Participation Units to automatically vest as of December 15, 2018 and trigger the Company's payout obligations.   In accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Company will make annual payouts to Mr. Cahill over a period of five                      years with the first annual payment to be made on or after January 1, 2020.  The market value for the Equity Participation Units to be used to determine the aggregate amount of the Company's payment obligation will be based on the book                      value of the Company's units as of September 30, 2019.  In the event of a change in control (as defined under the Plan) of the Company prior to the full payment of the Company's payment obligations to Mr. Cahill, the Company's payment                      obligations will accelerate.

Pre-approval is generally provided for up to one year and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is generally subject         to a specific budget.

The Audit Committee may also pre-approve particular services on a case-by-case basis.
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Members should be aware that             under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the following report issued by the Audit Committee relating to certain of its activities during Fiscal 2018 is not considered "filed" with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the             Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is not incorporated by reference in any past or future filing by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Securities Act of 1933, unless specifically referenced.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018         with management and discussed other matters related to the audit with the independent auditor.  Management represented to the Audit Committee that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in         the United States of America.  The Audit Committee met with the independent auditor, with and without management present, and discussed with the independent auditor matters required to be discussed by the Public Accounting Standards Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 16 (Communication with Audit Committees), as may be amended, modified or supplemented.  Additionally, the Audit Committee received the         written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditor required to be delivered to it under the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding communications concerning independence and discussed with management and the independent auditor         the independence of the independent auditor from management and the Company and considered whether the independent auditor maintained its independence during the year ended September 30, 2018.
Based upon the Audit Committee's discussions with management and the independent auditor, and the Audit Committee's review of         representations of management and the report of the independent auditor to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended that our Board include the audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended         September 30, 2018.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Bunge
On November 1, 2006, in consideration of its agreement to invest $20,004,000 in the Company, Bunge purchased the only issued and         outstanding Series B Units under an arrangement whereby: (i) we would enter into various agreements with Bunge or its affiliates discussed below for management, marketing and other services, and (ii) Bunge has the right to elect a number of Series         B Directors which are proportionate to the number of Series B Units owned by Bunge, as compared to all units.    Bunge currently has the right to appoint two (2) Series B Directors.   Jason D. Klootwyk and Brett A. Caplice are the current Series B         Directors appointed by Bunge. Under our Operating Agreement we may not, without Bunge's approval (i) issue additional Series B Units, (ii) create any additional         series of units with rights which are superior to the Series B Units, (iii) modify our Operating Agreement to adversely impact the rights of Series B Unit holders, (iv) change the Company's status from one which is managed by managers, or vice         versa, (v) repurchase or redeem any Series B Units, (vi) take any action which would cause a bankruptcy, or (vii) approve a transfer of units allowing the transferee to hold more than 17% of the Company's units or to a transferee which is a direct         competitor of Bunge.  In addition, our Operating Agreement also grants Bunge as a Series B Member the right to purchase its pro-rata share of any securities we issue.
On December 5, 2014, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Ethanol Purchase Agreement (the "Ethanol Agreement") with Bunge.  Under the Ethanol Agreement, the Company has agreed to sell Bunge all of the ethanol produced by the Company, and Bunge has agreed to purchase the same.  The Company         will pay Bunge a percentage fee for ethanol sold by Bunge, subject to a minimum and maximum annual fee.  The initial term of the Ethanol Agreement expires on December 31, 2019, however it will automatically renew for one five-year term unless Bunge         provides the Company with notice of election to terminate. The Company incurred ethanol marketing expenses of $1.5 million during both Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 under the Ethanol Agreement.
On December 5, 2014, the Company and Bunge entered into an Amended and Restated Distiller's Grain Purchase Agreement (the "DG Purchase Agreement").  Under the DG Purchase Agreement, Bunge purchases all distillers grains produced by the Company and receives a fee based on the net sale price of         distillers grains, subject to a minimum and maximum amount. The initial term of the DG Purchase Agreement expires on December 31, 2019 and will automatically renew for one         additional five-year term unless Bunge provides notice of election to the Company to terminate. The Company incurred distiller's grains marketing expenses of $1.2 million and $1.1 million during Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively.
The Company and Bunge also entered into an Amended and Restated Grain Feedstock Agency Agreement on December 5, 2014 (the "Agency Agreement").  The Agency Agreement provides that Bunge will procure corn for the Company and that the Company will pay Bunge a per bushel fee, subject to a         minimum and maximum annual fee.  The initial term of the Agency Agreement expires on December 31, 2019 and will automatically renew for one additional five-year term unless Bunge provides the Company with notice of election to terminate.  Expenses         for corn procurement were $0.7 million during both Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017.
Starting with the 2015 crop year, the Company began using corn containing Syngenta Seeds, Inc.'s proprietary Enogen®         technology ("Enogen Corn") for a portion of its ethanol production needs.  The Company contracts directly with growers to produce Enogen Corn for sale to the         Company.  Concurrent with the Agency Agreement, the Company and Bunge entered into a Services Agreement regarding corn purchases (the "Services Agreement").          Under this Services Agreement, the Company originates all Enogen Corn contracts for its facility and Bunge assists the Company with certain administrative matters related to Enogen Corn, including facilitating delivery to the facility.  The Company         pays Bunge a per bushel service fee.  The initial term of the Services Agreement expires on December 31, 2019 and will automatically renew for one additional five-year term unless Bunge provides the Company with notice of election to terminate.         Expenses under the Services Agreement are included as part of the Agency Agreement described above.
On June 26, 2009, the Company has executed a Railcar Agreement with Bunge for the lease of 325 ethanol cars and 300 hopper         cars which are used for the delivery and marketing of ethanol and distillers grains. In November 2016, we reduced the number of leased ethanol cars to 323 and in both November 2013 and January 2015 we reduced the number of hopper cars by one for a         total of 298 leased hopper cars.  Under the Railcar Agreement, the Company leases railcars for terms lasting 120 months and continuing on a month-to-month basis thereafter.  The Railcar Agreement will terminate upon the expiration of all railcar         leases.  From time to time, we sublease cars back to Bunge when the cars are not in use in our operations.  Expenses under this agreement were $4.0 for both Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, net of subleases and accretion, respectively.  In November         2016, the Company entered into a sublease for 96 hoppers with Bunge that is set to expire on March 24, 2019.  The Company has subleased another 92 hopper cars to unrelated third parties, which sublease expires March 25, 2019.  In June 2018, one of         the third party customers entered into an assignment agreement for their 52 hopper cars with the Company and Bunge which will be phased in over the fourth quarter, and the start of the first quarter in our fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.          SIRE received an up front assignment payment, and the net result will be financially neutral, and the number of side-leased railcars by SIRE remains the same.  The Company continues to work with Bunge to determine the need for ethanol and hopper         cars in light of current market conditions, and the expected conditions in future years.  The Company believes we will be able to fully utilize our fleet of hopper cars in the future, to allow us to cost-effectively ship distillers grains to         distant markets, primarily the export markets. ICM
On November 1, 2006, in consideration of its agreement to invest $6,000,000 in the Company, ICM became the sole Series C Member.  As         part of ICM's agreement to invest in Series C Units, our Operating Agreement provides that we will not, without ICM's approval: (i) issue additional Series C Units, (ii) create any additional series of units with rights senior to the Series C         Units, (iii) modify our Operating Agreement to adversely impact the rights of Series C Unit holders, or (iv) repurchase or redeem any Series C Units.  Additionally, ICM, as the sole Series C Unit owner, is afforded the right to elect one Series C         Director to our Board so long as ICM remains a Series C Member.  Andrew J. Bulloch is the current Series C Director appointed by ICM.
In connection with the payoff of certain subordinated debt owed by the           Company to ICM, the Company entered into the SIRE ICM Unit Agreement dated December 17, 2014 (the "Unit Agreement").  Under the Unit Agreement, the Company has agreed to grant ICM the right to sell to the Company its 1,000 Series C and 18 Series A Membership Units (the "ICM                 Units") commencing on January 1, 2017 at the greater of $10,897 per unit or the fair market value (as defined in the agreement) on the date of exercise (the "put right"). The Company reduced expense in Fiscal 2017 by $400 thousand, and in Fiscal 2018 reduced         expense by $300 thousand in conjunction with this put right under the Unit Agreement.

In October 2012, our Board adopted a Related Party Policy which formalized into a written policy certain practices and procedures         historically followed by our Board relating to the approval of any transaction, arrangement or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relations, including indebtedness or guarantees of indebtedness, with related parties.  Related persons         include our directors or executive officers and their respective immediate family members and 5% beneficial owners of our units. Pursuant to the terms of the policy, the Corporate           Governance/Compensation Committee must review the material facts of any related party transaction and approve such transaction.
The Company complied with the informal practices and procedures relating to the approval of related party transactions reflected in the         Related Party Policy in connection with the approval of each of the related party transactions discussed in the section above entitled "Certain Relationships and           Related Transactions."
MEMBER PROPOSALS AND DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS
FOR THE 2020 ANNUAL MEETING
Member Proposals to be Considered for Inclusion in the Company's 2020 Proxy Statement
Under the rules of the SEC, including Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, any member proposal to be considered by the Company for inclusion         in the proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Members, which we presently plan to hold in January or February 2020, must be received by the Secretary of the Company, 10868 189th Street, Council Bluffs, Iowa 51503, no later than one-hundred         and twenty (120) days prior to the date we mailed the proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting.  Accordingly, we determined that members must submit proposals related to the 2020 Annual Meeting of Members to the Company by August 19,         2019.  Proposals submitted later than August 19, 2019 will be considered untimely and will not be included in the Company's proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Members.
In addition, all proposals will need to comply with Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which lists the requirements for         inclusion of member proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials. The Corporate Governance/Compensation Committee will review proposals submitted by members for inclusion at our next annual meeting of members and will make recommendations to our         Board on an appropriate response to such proposals.
Requirements for Member Proposals to be Brought Before the 2020 Annual Meeting of Members
Pursuant to Rule 14a-4(c) under the Exchange Act, if the Company does not receive advance notice of a member proposal to be brought         before its next annual meeting of members in accordance with the requirements of its Operating Agreement or other governing documents, the proxies solicited by the Company may confer discretionary voting authority to vote proxies on the member         proposal without any discussion of the matter in the proxy statement.
Section 6.11 of our Operating Agreement provides that written notice of a member proposal that a member intends to present at the next         annual meeting, but does not intend to have included in the proxy statement and form of proxy related to such meeting, must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of the Company not less than ninety (90)         calendar days nor greater than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the immediately preceding year's annual meeting of members. Members must therefore submit notice of any member proposals for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Members to the Company between October 18,         2019 and November 17, 2019.  Any member proposals during this advance notice window which comply with the requirements of the Operating Agreement, including Section 6.11, shall constitute business that may properly be brought before the 2020 Annual         Meeting of Members.
As to each matter the member proposes to bring before the 2020 Annual Meeting of Members, the member's notice must set forth: (i) a         brief description of the business desired to be brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting of Members and the reasons for conducting such business at such annual meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the Company's books, of the member         proposing such business and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (iii) the class and number of units of the Company which are owned beneficially and of record by the member and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose         behalf the proposal is made, (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings among such member and any other person(s) (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such member and any material interest of         such member in such business, (v) whether either such member or beneficial owner intends to deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of units of the Company entitled to vote and required to approve the         proposal, and (vi) a representation that such member intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the annual meeting.  Our Operating Agreement also provides that the presiding officer at an annual         meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought before the annual meeting and, if he should so determine, such business shall not be transacted.
A copy of our Operating Agreement will be furnished to members without charge upon written request to the Secretary of the Company.
Special Meetings of Members
In addition, in the event a member wishes to propose any other matter for consideration at a meeting of the members, under our Operating         Agreement, members representing an aggregate of not less than thirty percent (30%) of all of the units may demand that our Board call a special meeting of members.
Series A Director Nominations
Pursuant to Section 5.3(e) of our Operating Agreement, Series A Members entitled to vote in the election of directors generally may         nominate one or more persons for election as directors at a meeting only if the member complies with the advance notice provisions and other requirements set forth in Section 5.3(e) of our Operating Agreement.
Section 5.3(e) of our Operating Agreement provides that Series A Members must notify the Secretary of the Company of Series A director         nominees in writing not less than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the one year anniversary of the date on which we first mailed our proxy materials for the prior year's annual meeting.  Accordingly, we determined that Series A Members must         submit written notice to the Company of nominations for Series A Directors for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Members by August 19, 2019.
Each notice shall set forth:  (i) the name and address of the member who intends to make the nomination; (ii) a representation that the         member is a holder of record of Series A Units entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person specified in the notice; (iii) the name, age, address and principal         occupation/employment of each nominee; (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the member and each nominee and any other person(s) pursuant to which such nominations are to be made; (v) such other information regarding each         nominee as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the SEC; (vi) the consent of each nominee to serve as a Series A Director if so elected; and (vii) a nominating petition signed and dated by the         holders of at least five percent (5%) of the then outstanding Series A Units and clearly setting forth the proposed nominee as a candidate for the Series A Director's seat to be filled.  The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such         other information as may reasonably be required by the Company to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a Series A Director.
A copy of our Operating Agreement will be furnished to members without charge upon written request to the Secretary of the Company. MEMBER COMMUNICATIONS
Any member wishing to communicate with any of our directors regarding matters related to the Company may provide correspondence to the         respective director in care of the Secretary, Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, LLC, 10868 189th Street, Council Bluffs, IA 51503.  The Chairman of         the Corporate Governance/Compensation Committee will review and determine the appropriate response to questions from the members, including whether to forward communications to individual directors.  The Independent Directors review and approve the         member communication process periodically to ensure effective communication with members.
OTHER BUSINESS
Our Board knows of no other business to be presented for action at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  If any matters do come before the 2019         Annual Meeting on which action can properly be taken, it is intended that the proxies shall vote in accordance with the judgment of the person(s) exercising the authority conferred by the proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
