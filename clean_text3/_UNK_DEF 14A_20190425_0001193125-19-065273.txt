JOINT ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
To Be Held On April 25, 2019 
INTRODUCTION 
This Combined Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Boards of Directors (the "Boards") of the above listed entities, each a Maryland corporation (each a "Fund", and collectively, the "Funds"), to be exercised at the Joint Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Funds, to be held at the offices of the Funds, 280 Park Avenue, 10th Floor, New York, New York 10017, on April 25, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, and at any postponements or adjournments thereof (collectively, the "Meeting"). In order to attend the Meeting in person, stockholders must bring valid photo identification and, if you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, a "legal proxy." The solicitation will be by mail and the cost (including printing and mailing this Combined Proxy Statement, Notice of Meeting and Proxy Card, as well as any necessary supplementary solicitation) will be borne by each Fund pursuant to the terms of its investment management agreement. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, each Fund's officers or representatives of the Funds' investment manager may solicit proxies by telephone. The Notice of Meeting, Combined Proxy Statement and Proxy Card are being mailed to stockholders on or about March 6, 2019. 
In accordance with each Fund's bylaws, the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of record of a majority of the shares of each Fund issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Meeting shall constitute a quorum for such Fund at the Meeting. If, however, a quorum shall not be present or represented at the Meeting or if fewer shares are present in person or by proxy than is the minimum required to take action with respect to any proposal presented at the Meeting, the chairman of the Meeting or   the holders of a majority of the shares of each Fund present in person or by proxy (or a majority of votes cast if a quorum is present) shall have the power to adjourn the Meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the Meeting, until the requisite number of shares entitled to vote at the Meeting shall be present, to a date not more than 120 days after the record date. At any adjourned Meeting, if the relevant quorum is subsequently constituted, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the Meeting as originally called. For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for transacting business at the Meeting, abstentions and broker "non-votes" (that is, proxies from brokers or nominees indicating that they have not received instructions from the beneficial owner or other persons entitled to vote shares on a particular matter with respect to which the brokers or nominees do not have discretionary voting power), if any, will be treated as shares that are present but which have not been voted. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will count towards the presence of a quorum but otherwise will have no effect on obtaining the requisite approval of the proposal.
Although each Fund is a separate investment company that holds an annual meeting of stockholders, the Funds' Proxy Statements have been combined into this Combined Proxy Statement to reduce expenses to the Funds of soliciting proxies for the Meeting. 
The Boards have fixed the close of business on February 15, 2019 as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting. The outstanding voting shares of each Fund as of the close of business on February 15, 2019 consisted of:

 MIE      26,793,340.000   
[END TABLE]
Each share is entitled to one vote and each fractional share is entitled to a proportional fractional share vote. All properly executed proxies received prior to the Meeting will be exercised at the Meeting in accordance with the instructions marked thereon or as otherwise provided therein and in the discretion of the proxy holder on any other matter that is properly brought before the Meeting, or any postponement or adjournment thereof. Accordingly, unless instructions to the contrary are marked, proxies will be voted FOR the election of each of the Directors. Any stockholder may revoke his or her proxy at any time prior to exercise thereof by giving written notice to the Secretary of the Fund(s) at its offices at 280 Park Avenue, New York, New York   10017, or by authorizing another proxy of a later date or by personally casting his or her vote at the Meeting. Stockholders can vote only on matters affecting the Fund(s) in which they hold shares. Because the proposals in the Notice of Joint Annual Meeting of Stockholders are separate for each Fund, it is essential that stockholders who own shares in multiple Funds complete, date, sign and return (or authorize their proxy by telephone or internet in respect of) each Proxy Card they receive. 
The most recent annual report of each Fund, including financial statements, has been previously mailed to that Fund's stockholders. If you have not received a report for any of the Funds in which you own shares or would like to receive an additional copy free of charge, please contact Dana DeVivo, Secretary of the Funds, at 280 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017, (800) 330-7348, and it will be sent promptly by first-class mail. 
PROPOSAL ONE 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
For each Fund, at the Meeting, three Directors are nominated to be elected to serve for their respective terms and until their successors are duly elected and qualify. The nominees for Director are Joseph M. Harvey, Gerald J. Maginnis, and Daphne L. Richards to hold office for terms to expire at the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualify. It is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy to vote in favor of each of the nominees. At the Meeting, the holders of each Fund's common stock will have equal voting rights (i.e., one vote per share), and will vote as a single class on the election of Ms. Richards and Messrs. Harvey and Maginnis. Ms. Richards and Messrs. Harvey and Maginnis currently serve as Directors of each of the twenty funds within the group of funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), that are managed by Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. (the "Cohen & Steers Fund Complex"). 
Each Fund's stockholders initially elected their Board to staggered terms at the respective Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 LDP      April 25, 2013   
 MIE      April 24, 2014   
[END TABLE]
 Accordingly, the term of office of only a single class of Directors for each Fund will expire at the Meeting. As a result of this system, only those Directors in any one class may be changed in any one year, and it would require two years or more to change a majority of a Fund's Board. This system of electing Directors, which may be regarded as an "anti-takeover" provision, may have the effect of maintaining the continuity of management and, thus, make it more difficult for each Fund's stockholders to change a majority of the Directors. 
Each of the nominees has consented to serving as a Director. The Board of each Fund knows of no reason why a nominee would be unable to serve, but in the event of such unavailability, the proxies received will be voted FOR such substitute nominee as the Board may recommend. 
Directors of the Funds, together with information as to their positions with the Funds, principal occupations and other board memberships and affiliations for at least the past five years, are shown below.

[END TABLE]
The Boards believe that the significance of each Director's experience, qualifications, attributes or skills is an individual matter (meaning that experience that is important for one Director may not have the same value for another) and that these factors are best evaluated at the board level, with no single Director, or particular factor, being indicative of board effectiveness. However, the Boards believe that each Director needs to have the ability to critically review, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, and to interact effectively with Fund management, service providers and counsel, in order to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of his or her duties; the Boards believe that each of their members satisfies this standard. Experience relevant to having this ability may be achieved through a Director's educational background; business, professional training or practice (e.g., accountancy or law), public service or academic positions; experience from service as a board member (including the Boards of the Funds) or as an executive of investment funds, public companies or significant private or not-for-profit entities or other organizations; and/or other life experiences. The charter for each Board's Nominating Committee contains certain other specific requirements and factors considered by the Committee in identifying and selecting Director candidates (please see below). 
To assist them in evaluating matters under federal and state law, the Directors are counseled by their own independent legal counsel, who participates in Board meetings and interacts with the Advisor, and also may benefit from information provided by the Funds' and the Advisor's counsel; both Board and Fund counsel have significant experience advising funds and fund board members. Each Board and its committees have the power to engage other experts as appropriate. Each Board evaluates its performance on an annual basis.  Board Composition and Leadership Structure. The Act requires that at least 40% of a Fund's Directors be Independent Directors and, as such, not affiliated with the Advisor. To rely on certain exemptive rules under the Act, a majority of a Fund's Directors must be Independent Directors, and for certain important matters, such as the approval of investment advisory agreements or certain transactions with affiliates, the Act or the rules thereunder require the approval of a majority of the Independent Directors. Currently, over 75% of each Fund's Directors are Independent Directors. The Chairman of each of the Boards is an interested person of the Funds, and the Independent Directors have designated a lead Independent Director who chairs meetings or executive sessions of the Independent Directors, reviews and comments on Board meeting agendas, represents the views of the Independent Directors to management and facilitates communication among the Independent Directors and their counsel. Each Board has determined that its leadership structure, in which the Independent Directors have designated a lead Independent Director to function as described above, is appropriate in light of the services that the Advisor and its affiliates provide and potential conflicts of interest that could arise from these relationships. 
During the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, each Board met the number of times indicated in the table below:

The Funds do not have policies with regard to the Directors' attendance at annual meetings and none of the Directors attended any Fund's 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. Each Fund maintains five standing Board Committees: the Audit Committee, the Nominating Committee, the Contract Review Committee, the Governance Committee and the Dividend Committee (each, a "Committee" and collectively, the "Committees"). The Directors serving on each Committee are Independent Directors, and otherwise satisfy the applicable standards for independence of a committee member of an investment company issuer under the federal securities laws and under applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. The members of the Audit Committee of each Fund are Messrs. Clark, Grossman and Maginnis. The members of the Nominating Committee and the Contract Review Committee of each Fund are Mses. Magpiong and Richards and Messrs. Clark, Grossman, Junkans,   Maginnis and Ward. The members of the Governance Committee of each Fund are Mses. Magpiong and Richards and Messrs. Junkans and Ward. The members of the Dividend Committee of each Fund are Ms. Magpiong and Messrs. Clark, Junkans and Maginnis. 
The Audit Committee of each Fund met five times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, (or, in the case of MIE, its fiscal year ended November 30, 2018). Mr. Maginnis was elected to serve as Audit Committee Chair effective January 1, 2019. Each Audit Committee operates pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Board. A current copy of the Audit Committee charter is available on the Advisor's website at www.cohenandsteers.com/assets/content/uploads/AuditCommitteeCharter.pdf. The general purposes of each Audit Committee are to oversee the Fund's accounting and financial reporting and processes and audits of the Fund's financial statements; the integrity of the Fund's financial statements; the Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements that relate to the Fund's accounting and financial reporting processes and financial statement audits; and the qualifications, independence and performance of the independent registered public accounting firm(s) engaged by the Fund and the performance of the Fund's independent audit function, if any. 
The Nominating Committee of each Fund met one time during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (or, in the case of MIE, its fiscal year ended November 30, 2018) and operates pursuant to a written charter adopted by the applicable Board. A current copy of the Nominating Committee charter is available on the Advisor's website at https://www.cohenandsteers.com/assets/content/uploads/Nominating_Committee_Charter_Fds.pdf. The main functions of each Nominating Committee are to (i) identify individuals qualified to become Directors in the event that a position is vacated or created, (ii) select the Director nominees for the next annual meeting of stockholders and (iii) set any necessary standards or qualifications for service on the applicable Board. Each Nominating Committee requires that Director candidates have a college degree or equivalent business experience. Each Nominating Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering Director candidates, including (but not limited to): (i) availability and commitment of a candidate to attend meetings and perform his or her responsibilities on the Board, (ii) an assessment of the candidate's ability to critically review, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, and to interact effectively with Fund management, service providers and counsel, in order to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties, (iii) educational background, (iv) business, professional training or practice (e.g., accountancy or law), public service or academic positions, (v) an assessment of the candidate's character and integrity, (vi) experience from service as a board member (including the Board of the Funds) or as an executive of investment funds, public companies or significant private or not-for-profit entities or other organizations, (vii) whether or not the candidate has any relationships that might impair his or her independence, such as any business, financial or family relationships with Cohen & Steers, Fund service providers or their affiliates and (viii) overall interplay of a candidate's experience, skill and knowledge   with that of other Nominating Committee members. In addition, although the Nominating Committee does not have a formal policy with regard to consideration of diversity in identifying Director candidates, the Nominating Committee may consider whether a potential candidate's qualities and attributes, including gender, race or national origin, would provide beneficial diversity of skills, experience or perspective to the Board's membership and collective attributes. Such considerations will vary based on the Board's existing membership and other factors, such as the strength of a potential nominee's overall qualifications relative to diversity considerations. The Nominating Committee may, but is not required to, retain a third party search firm at the Fund's expense to identify potential candidates. The Nominating Committee will consider Director candidates recommended by stockholders, provided that any such stockholder recommendation is submitted in writing to the Fund, to the attention of the Secretary, at the address of the principal executive offices of the Fund and further provided that such recommendation includes all other information specified in the Nominating Committee charter and complies with the procedures set forth in Appendix A thereto. 
The Contract Review Committee of each Fund met two times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (or, in the case of MIE, its fiscal year ended November 30, 2018), and each Contract Review Committee operates pursuant to a written charter adopted by the applicable Board. The main functions of each Contract Review Committee are to make recommendations to the Board after reviewing advisory and other contracts that the Fund has with the Advisor and to select third parties to provide evaluative reports and other information to the Board regarding the services provided by the Advisor. 
The Governance Committee of each Fund met five times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (or, in the case of MIE, its fiscal year ended November 30, 2018) and operates pursuant to a written charter adopted by the applicable Board. The main function of each Governance Committee is to assist the Board in the oversight of appropriate and effective governance of the Fund. The Governance Committee oversees, among other things, the structure and composition of the Board Committees, the size of the Board and the compensation of Independent Directors for service on the Board and any Board Committee and the process for securing insurance coverage for the Board. 
The Dividend Committee of each Fund met two times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (or, in the case of MIE, its fiscal year ended November 30, 2018). The main function of each Dividend Committee is to assist the applicable Board in the oversight of the Funds' process for determining distributions and to exercise the power to declare distributions delegated to it by the Board. 
Board's Oversight Role in Management. The Board's role in management of each Fund is oversight. As is the case with virtually all investment companies (as distinguished from operating companies), service providers to the Funds, primarily the Advisor and its affiliates, have responsibility for the day-to-day management of the   Funds, which includes responsibility for risk management (including management of investment performance and investment risk, valuation risk, issuer and counterparty credit risk, compliance risk and operational risk). As part of its oversight, each Board, acting at its scheduled meetings, or the lead Independent Director, acting between Board meetings, regularly interacts with and receives reports from senior personnel of service providers, including the Funds' and the Advisor's Chief Compliance Officer and portfolio management personnel. Each Board's Audit Committee meets during its scheduled meetings, and between meetings the Audit Committee chair maintains contact, with the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm and the Funds' Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer. Each Board also receives periodic presentations from senior personnel of the Advisor or its affiliates regarding risk management generally, as well as periodic presentations regarding specific operational, compliance or investment areas such as business continuity, anti-money laundering, personal trading, valuation, credit, investment research and securities lending. Each Board also receives reports from counsel to the Funds' and the Advisor and the Boards' own independent legal counsel regarding regulatory compliance and governance matters. Each Board's oversight role does not make the Board a guarantor of the Fund's investments or activities.

Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee of each Cohen & Steers Fund (a "Fund" together, the "Funds") has met with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm, to discuss the scope of the audit engagement, review the Funds' financial statements, and discuss the statements and audit results with management. Each Audit Committee discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), received the written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by PCAOB Rule 3526 and discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. Based on these reviews and discussions, each Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements of each Fund be included in that Fund's annual report to stockholders for the last fiscal year for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

 Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance. Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and Section 30(h) of the Act, as applied to the Funds, require certain of the Funds' Directors, officers, the Advisor, affiliates of the Advisor, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a class of the Funds' outstanding securities to file reports of ownership of the Funds' securities and changes in such ownership with the SEC. Those persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish the relevant Fund(s) with copies of all filings. To each Fund's knowledge, all of its Directors and officers, the Advisor and its affiliates and certain holders of more than 10% of the applicable Fund's common stock complied with all filing requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and Section 30(h) of the Act during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (or in the case of MIE, its fiscal year ended November 30, 2018). However, a Form 5 was filed on February 13, 2019 to reflect Adam Derechin's ownership in RQI. This filing was made to correct an administrative error in a prior filing. 
Each Fund's Board of Directors, including the Independent Directors, unanimously recommends that the stockholders of its Fund vote "FOR" the election of each nominee to serve as a Director of the Fund. 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018 for MIE and December 31, 2018 for all other Funds, each Fund's Audit Committee selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit the accounts of the applicable Fund. Their selection was ratified and approved by the vote, cast in person, of a majority of the Directors of the applicable Fund, including a majority of the Independent Directors, each of whom are "independent" as defined in the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. On December 4, 2018, the Audit Committee of MIE selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the applicable Fund's registered public account firm ("auditor") for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2019. On March 19, 2019, the Audit Committee of each Fund, other than MIE, will meet to consider the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the applicable Fund's auditor for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. This Combined Proxy Statement will be updated if the Audit Committee of each Fund, other than MIE, does not select PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the applicable Fund's auditor for the year ending December 31, 2019. Each Audit Committee meets at least twice a year with representatives of the applicable Funds' auditor to discuss the scope of the auditor's engagement and to review the financial statements of the applicable Funds and the results of its examination thereof. The auditor will not be at the Meeting but will be available to participate by telephone if needed.  Fees Paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
Aggregate fees billed to the Funds for the last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were as follows:

Tax fees were billed in connection with tax compliance services, including the preparation and review of federal and state tax returns and the computation of corporate income and franchise tax amounts. 
MIE is structured as a C Corporation and, through November 30, 2016, had a wholly owned subsidiary. Due to MIE's structure and its MLP investments, the audit and tax fees are typically higher than the audit and tax fees for our other closed-end funds. MIE's tax fees are billed in connection with tax compliance services, including the preparation and review of both federal and state tax returns and the computation of corporate income and franchise tax amounts. 
Aggregate fees billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the last two fiscal years for non-audit services provided to the Advisor and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Advisor that provides ongoing services to the Funds (collectively, with the Advisor, "Service Affiliates"), where the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Funds and which were pre-approved by the Audit Committees, were as follows:

 Audit-Related Fees    $ 0      $ 0   
 Tax Fees    $ 161,540      $ 160,980   
 All Other Fees    $ 0      $ 0   
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committees are required to pre-approve audit and non-audit services performed for the Funds by their auditor. The Audit Committees also are required to pre-approve non-audit services performed by the Funds' auditor for any Service Affiliate if the engagement for services relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of a Fund.  The Audit Committees may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of their members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated shall report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committees at their next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committees may not delegate their responsibility to pre-approve services to be performed by the Funds' principal auditor to the Advisor. 
None of the services described above were approved by the Audit Committees pursuant to paragraphs (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X. 
The aggregate fees billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for non-audit services rendered to the Funds and for non-audit services rendered to Service Affiliates for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were:

MIE's non-audit fees are billed in connection with tax compliance services, including the preparation and review of tax returns and the computation of corporate income and franchise tax amounts. 
The Audit Committees considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to Service Affiliates that were not required to be pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X was compatible with maintaining the independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
