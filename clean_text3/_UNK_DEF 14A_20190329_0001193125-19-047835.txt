JOINT PROXY STATEMENT 
For the Annual Meetings of Shareholders each to be held on March 29, 2019 
This Joint Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by each Fund's Board of Directors (each, a "Board," and collectively, the "Boards," with members of each Board being referred to as "Directors") to be voted at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of each Fund (each, a "Meeting," and collectively, the "Meetings") to be held at the offices of Aberdeen Standard Investments Inc. ("ASI" formerly Aberdeen Asset Management Inc.) located at 1735 Market Street, 32nd Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103, on Friday, March 29, 2019 and at any adjournments or postponements thereof. A Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and a proxy card (the "Proxy") accompany this Joint Proxy Statement. This Joint Proxy Statement is first being mailed to shareholders on or about February 15, 2019. 
All properly executed proxies received prior to a Meeting will be voted at the Meeting, or at any adjournments thereof, in accordance with the instructions marked on the Proxy. Unless instructions to the contrary are marked on the Proxy, Proxies received will be voted "FOR" each Proposal (as defined below). The persons named as proxy holders on the Proxy will vote in their discretion on any other matters that may properly come before each Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. Any Proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its exercise by submitting a properly executed, subsequently dated Proxy, giving written notice to Megan Kennedy, Secretary of the Fund(s), 1735 Market Street, 32nd Floor, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, or by attending the Meeting and voting in person. Shareholders may authorize proxy voting by using the enclosed Proxy along with the enclosed envelope with pre-paid postage. Shareholders may also authorize proxy voting by telephone or through the internet by following the instructions contained on their Proxy. Shareholders do not have dissenter's rights of appraisal in connection with any of the matters to be voted on by the shareholders at each Meeting. 
The presence at each Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the shareholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting on any matter shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at a Meeting, withheld votes and broker 'non-votes' (that is, proxies from brokers or nominees indicating that such persons have not received instructions from the beneficial owner or other persons entitled to vote shares on a particular Proposal with respect to which the brokers or nominees do not have discretionary power) will be treated as shares that are present at the Meeting. 
With regard to the Proposal for FAX and FCO, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is necessary for the election of a common share Director, provided that, for each Fund, if the number of nominees for Director, as determined by the Secretary of the Fund, exceeds the number of Directors to be elected, the common share Directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such   meeting and entitled to vote on the election of Directors. With regard to the Proposal for IAF, the vote of a plurality of all the votes cast at a meeting at which a quorum is present is necessary for the election of a common share Director. For purposes of the election of Directors for FAX and FCO, withheld votes and broker 'non-votes' will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote. For purposes of the election of Directors for IAF, withheld votes will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote, but broker 'non-votes' will be voted "FOR" the Proposal. 
Each Board has adopted certain corporate governance guidelines for each Fund which include (i) a resignation policy which generally provides that (notwithstanding the plurality voting standard for IAF) an Independent Director, in an uncontested election, who does not receive a majority of votes "FOR" his or her election at a meeting of shareholders shall be deemed to have tendered his or her resignation, subject to a Board's acceptance or rejection of such resignation, which Board determination will be disclosed publicly to Fund shareholders; (ii) a policy requiring that after an Independent Director has served on the Board for three consecutive terms of three years following the later of (a) engagement of the existing investment manager of the Fund or (b) the Independent Director's election to the Board, the Independent Director will be put forth for consideration by shareholders annually; and (iii) a policy whereby newly appointed directors will be submitted for consideration at the next regular shareholder meeting. With respect to clause (ii) above, Independent Directors currently serving on the Boards will be submitted to stockholders for consideration of continuation as a director on an annual basis beginning at the first annual meeting following the end of each such Board member's three-year term in office after the end of such Independent Director's current term. 
If a quorum is not present in person or by proxy at the time a Meeting is called to order, the chairman of the Meeting may adjourn the Meeting. For FAX or FCO, if a quorum is present but there are not sufficient votes to approve the Proposal, the chairman of the Meeting or the shareholders entitled to vote at such Meeting present in person, by a majority of the votes validly cast, may adjourn the Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies on that Proposal. 
We will admit to an Annual Meeting (1) all shareholders of record on February 6, 2019 (the "Record Date"), (2) persons holding proof of beneficial ownership at the Record Date, such as a letter or account statement from the person's broker, (3) persons who have been granted proxies, and (4) such other persons that we, in our sole discretion, may elect to admit. To gain admittance, if you are a shareholder of record or a proxy holder of a shareholder of record, you must bring a form of personal identification to the Meeting, where your name will be verified against our shareholder list. If a broker or other nominee holds your shares and you plan to attend the Meeting, you should bring a recent brokerage statement showing your ownership of the shares, as well as a form of personal identification. If you are a beneficial owner and plan to vote at the Meeting, you should also bring a proxy card from your broker. 
Each Board has fixed the close of business on February 6, 2019 as the Record Date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, each Meeting and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. Shareholders on the Record Date for each Fund will be entitled to one vote for each share held for their respective Meeting. As of the Record Date, the following number of shares of each Fund were issued and outstanding: 
FAX had outstanding 248,980,612 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $25.00 per share. 
FCO had outstanding 8,724,789 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. 
IAF had outstanding 22,742,326 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share.  Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Shareholder Meetings to Be Held on Friday, March 29, 2019 at 1735 Market Street, 32nd Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103. The Proxy Materials and each Fund's most recent annual report are available on the Internet at http://www.aberdeenstandard.com/en-us/cefinvestorcenter. Each Fund will furnish, without charge, a copy of its annual report for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, and any more recent reports, to any Fund shareholder upon request. To request a copy, please write to the Funds c/o Aberdeen Standard Investments Inc., 1735 Market Street, 32nd Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103, or call 1-800-522-5465. You may also call for information on how to obtain directions to be able to attend a Meeting and vote in person. 
The Proposal: Election of Common Share Directors 
Each Fund's bylaws provide that the Fund's Board be elected by holders of the Fund's common stock divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, each of which will serve for three years, with one class being elected each year. Each year the term of office of one class expires. Directors who are deemed "interested persons" (as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")), of each Fund, the Funds' investment manager, Aberdeen Standard Investments (Asia) Limited (formerly known as Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited) (the "Investment Manager" or "ASIAL"), the Funds' investment adviser, Aberdeen Standard Investments Australia Limited (formerly known as Aberdeen Asset Management Limited) (the "Investment Adviser" or "ASI Aus") or, in the case of FAX and FCO, the investment sub-adviser, Aberdeen Asset Managers Limited (the "Sub-Adviser" or "AAML"), are referred to in this Joint Proxy Statement as "Interested Directors." Directors who are not interested persons, as described above, are referred to in this Joint Proxy Statement as "Independent Directors." 
Each Board, including the Independent Directors, upon the recommendation of each Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which is composed entirely of Independent Directors, has nominated the following individuals for election as common share Directors to its Board as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Aberdeen Asia-Pacific Income Fund, Inc.     Neville J. Miles (Class I Director, 3-year term ending 2022)

It is the intention of the persons named on the enclosed proxy card(s) to vote "FOR" the election of the persons indicated above to serve as common share Directors.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIRECTORS 
Each Board believes that each Director's experience, qualifications, attributes and skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of the other Directors lead to the conclusion that the Directors possess the requisite experience, qualifications, attributes and skills to serve on their respective Board. Each Board believes that the Directors' ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them; to interact effectively with ASIAL, ASI Aus and AAML, as applicable, other service providers, counsel and independent auditors; and to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties, support this conclusion. Each Board has also considered the contributions that each Director can make to the respective Board on which he serves and to the Fund(s). A Director's ability to perform his duties effectively may have been attained through the Director's executive, business, consulting, and/or legal positions; experience from service as a Director of the Fund(s) and other funds/portfolios in the Aberdeen complex, other investment funds, public companies, or non-profit entities or other organizations; educational background or professional training or practice; and/or other life experiences. In this regard, the following specific experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills apply as to each Director in addition to the information set forth in the table above: Mr. Gilbert, Co-Chief Executive Officer   and director roles within the Aberdeen complex, board experience with other public companies and investment trusts; Mr. Young, investment management experience in director and executive roles within the Aberdeen complex and director experience with other investment management companies; Mr. Malone, legal background and public service leadership experience, board experience with other public and private companies, and executive and business consulting experience; Mr. Miles, financial services, investment management and executive experience and board experience with various Australian public and private companies; Mr. Potter, financial services, investment management and merchant banking experience, executive and consulting experience, and board experience with public companies and non-profit organizations; Mr. Sacks, accounting background (chartered accountant in Canada and South Africa), treasury experience in banking organizations, investment management and executive experience; and Mr. Sell, director and executive experience at an investment banking and trading firm and board experience with another closed-end fund outside of the Aberdeen complex. 
Each Board believes that the significance of each Director's experience, qualifications, attributes or skills is an individual matter (meaning that experience important for one Director may not have the same value for another) and that these factors are best evaluated at the Board level, with no single Director, or particular factor, being indicative of Board effectiveness. In its periodic self-assessment of the effectiveness of the Board, each Board considers the complementary individual skills and experience of the individual Directors in the broader context of the Board's overall composition so that the Board, as a body, possesses the appropriate (and appropriately diverse) skills and experience to oversee the business of the Fund. References to the qualifications, attributes and skills of Directors are presented pursuant to disclosure requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), do not constitute holding out a Board or any Director as having any special expertise or experience, and shall not impose any greater responsibility or liability on any such person or on a Board by reason thereof.

(1)  This information has been furnished by each Director as of October 31, 2018. "Beneficial ownership" is determined in  accordance with Rule 16a-1(a)(2) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act").

(2)  "Family of Investment Companies" means those registered investment companies that are advised by the Investment Manager or an  affiliate and that hold themselves out to investors as related companies for purposes of investment and investor services.  
[END TABLE]
 As of October 31, 2018, each Fund's Directors and officers, in the aggregate, owned less than 1% of that Fund's outstanding equity securities. As of October 31, 2018, none of the Independent Directors or their immediate family members owned any shares of the Investment Manager, Investment Adviser or Sub-Adviser or of any person (other than a registered investment company) directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Investment Manager, Investment Adviser or Sub-Adviser. 
Mr. Pittard and Ms. Melia serve as executive officers of the Funds. As of October 31, 2018, Mr. Pittard and Ms. Melia did not own shares of the Funds' common stock. 
BOARD AND COMMITTEE STRUCTURE 
The Board of Directors of FAX is currently composed of five Independent Directors and one Interested Director, Martin J. Gilbert. The Board of Directors of FCO is currently composed of five Independent Directors and one Interested Director, Martin J. Gilbert. The Board of Directors of IAF is currently composed of five Independent Directors and one Interested Director, Hugh Young. Each Fund's bylaws provide that the Board of Directors to be elected by holders of a Fund's common stock shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, each of which will serve for three years, with one class being elected each year. FAX's Articles Supplementary for the Preferred Shares provide for the election of two Directors by holders of the Fund's preferred stock. 
The Boards of FAX and FCO have each appointed Mr. Malone, an Independent Director, as Chairman. The Board of IAF has appointed Mr. Miles, an Independent Director, as Chairman. The Chairman presides at meetings of the Directors, participates in the preparation of the agenda for meetings of the Board, and acts as a liaison between the Directors and management between Board meetings. Except for any duties specified herein, the designation of the Chairman does not impose on such Director any duties, obligations or liability that is greater than the duties, obligations or liability imposed on such person as a member of the Board, generally. 
Each Board holds regular quarterly meetings each year to consider and address matters involving the respective Fund. Each Board also may hold special meetings to address matters arising between regular meetings. The Independent Directors also meet outside the presence of management in executive session at least quarterly and have engaged separate, independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight responsibilities. 
Each Board has established a committee structure that includes an Audit and Valuation Committee, a Contract Review Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, a Cost Review Committee and a Leverage Committee (FAX and FCO only) (each discussed in more detail below) to assist each Board in the oversight and direction of the business affairs of the respective Fund, and from time to time may establish informal ad hoc committees or working groups to review and address the practices of the respective Fund with respect to specific matters. The Committee system facilitates the timely and efficient consideration of matters by the Directors, and facilitates effective oversight of compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and of each Fund's activities and associated risks. The standing Committees currently conduct an annual review of their charters, which includes a review of their responsibilities and operations. Each Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and each Board as a whole also conduct an annual self-assessment of the performance of the Board, including consideration of the effectiveness of the Board's Committee structure. Each Committee is comprised entirely of Independent Directors. Each Committee member is also "independent" within the meaning of the NYSE MKT listing standards. Each Board reviews its structure regularly and believes that its leadership structure, including having a super-majority of Independent Directors, coupled with an Independent Director as Chairman, is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise informed and independent judgment over the matters under its purview and it allocates areas of responsibility among the Committees and the full Board in a manner that enhances efficient and effective oversight.  Audit and Valuation Committee 
Each Fund's Audit and Valuation Committee, established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), is responsible for the selection and engagement of the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm (subject to ratification by the Fund's Independent Directors), pre-approves and reviews both the audit and non–audit work of the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, and reviews compliance of the Fund with regulations of the SEC and the Internal Revenue Service, and other related matters. The members of each Fund's Audit and Valuation Committee are Messrs. P. Gerald Malone, Neville J. Miles, Peter D. Sacks and Moritz Sell. 
Each Board has adopted an Audit and Valuation Committee Charter for its Audit and Valuation Committee, the current copy of which is available on each Fund's website at http://aberdeenfax.com, http://aberdeenfco.com and http://aberdeeniaf.com. 
Each Audit and Valuation Committee oversees the activities of its Fund's Pricing Committee and performs the responsibilities assigned to the Audit and Valuation Committee in the Fund's Valuation and Liquidity Procedures, such as overseeing the implementation of the Valuation and Liquidity Procedures. Each Board has delegated to its Audit and Valuation Committee the responsibility of determining the fair value of its Fund's securities or other assets in situations set forth in the Valuation and Liquidity Procedures. 
Contract Review Committee 
Each Contract Review Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors with respect to entering into, reviewing or amending the Fund's management agreement, advisory agreement, sub-advisory agreement (if applicable), administration agreement, investor relations services agreement and other agreements. The members of each Fund's Contract Review Committee are Messrs. P. Gerald Malone, Neville J. Miles, William J. Potter, Peter D. Sacks and Moritz Sell (IAF only). 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee; Consideration of Potential Director Nominees 
Each Fund's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends nominations for membership on the Board and reviews and evaluates the effectiveness of the Board in its role in governing the Fund and overseeing the management of the Fund. It evaluates candidates' qualifications for Board membership and, with respect to nominees for positions as Independent Directors, their independence from the Fund's Investment Manager, Investment Adviser and Sub-Adviser, as appropriate, and other principal service providers. Each Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee generally meets twice annually to identify and evaluate nominees for director and makes its recommendations to its respective Board at the time of each Board's December meeting. Each Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also periodically reviews director compensation and will recommend any appropriate changes to the Boards as a group. Each Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also reviews and may make recommendations to its respective Board relating to the effectiveness of the Board in carrying out its responsibilities in governing the Fund and overseeing the management of the Fund. Each Board has adopted a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, a copy of which is on each Fund's website at http://aberdeenfax.com, http://aberdeenfco.com and http://aberdeeniaf.com. The members of each Fund's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are Messrs. P. Gerald Malone, Neville J. Miles, William J. Potter and Moritz Sell. 
Each Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering prospective director candidates, including (but not limited to): (i) availability (including availability to attend to Board   business on short notice) and commitment of a candidate to attend meetings and perform his or her responsibilities on the Board; (ii) relevant industry and related experience; (iii) educational background; (iv) reputation; (v) financial expertise; (vi) the candidate's ability, judgment and expertise; (vii) overall diversity of the Board's composition; and (viii) commitment to the representation of the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Each Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers the effect of any relationships beyond those delineated in the 1940 Act that might impair independence, such as business, financial or family relationships with the Investment Manager, Investment Adviser or Sub-Adviser or their affiliates, as appropriate. Each Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider potential director candidates, if any, recommended by its Fund shareholders provided that the proposed candidates: (i) satisfy any minimum qualifications of the Fund for its directors, and (ii) are not "interested persons" of the Fund, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act; and (iii) are "independent" as defined in the listing standards of any exchange on which the Fund's shares are listed. 
While the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees have not adopted a particular definition of diversity or a particular policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying candidates, when considering a candidate's and a Board's diversity, the Committees generally consider the manner in which each candidate's leadership, independence, interpersonal skills, financial acumen, integrity and professional ethics, educational and professional background, prior director or executive experience, industry knowledge, business judgment and specific experiences or expertise would complement or benefit the Board and, as a whole, contribute to the ability of the Board to oversee the Fund. Each Committee may also consider other factors or attributes as they may determine appropriate in their judgment. Each Committee believes that the significance of each candidate's background, experience, qualifications, attributes or skills must be considered in the context of the Board as a whole. 
Each Fund's bylaws contain provisions regarding minimum qualifications for directors. These include a requirement that, to qualify as a nominee for a directorship, each candidate, at the time of nomination, other than persons who were directors at the time of the adoption of the minimum qualifications, must possess at least the following specific minimum qualifications: (i) a nominee shall have at least five years' experience in any of investment management, economics, public accounting or Australian business; (ii) a nominee shall have a college undergraduate or graduate degree in economics, finance, business administration, accounting or engineering, or a professional degree in law, engineering, or medicine, from an accredited university or college in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada or New Zealand, or the equivalent degree from an equivalent institution of higher learning in another country; and (iii) a nominee shall not have violated any provision of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, or comparable laws of another country. 
Each Fund's bylaws also contain advance notice provisions and general procedures with respect to the submission of proposals, including the nomination of directors. Shareholders who intend to propose potential director candidates must substantiate compliance with these requirements. Notice of shareholder proposals must be provided to the Fund's Secretary not earlier than the 150th day and not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's proxy statement. Any shareholder may obtain a copy of the Funds' bylaws by calling the Investor Relations department of Aberdeen Standard Investments Inc., the Funds' investor relations services provider, toll-free at 1-800-522-5465, or by sending an e-mail to Aberdeen Standard Investments Inc. at InvestorRelations@aberdeenstandard.com. 
Cost Review Committee 
Each Cost Review Committee reviews on an ongoing basis the fees and expenses incurred by the Fund, to ensure that such expenses are commensurate with the services provided. The members of each Fund's Cost Review Committee are Messrs. Neville J. Miles, William J. Potter, Peter D. Sacks and Moritz Sell (IAF).  Leverage Committee 
The Leverage Committee monitors the Fund's leverage and reviews leverage options for the Fund. The members of the FAX and FCO's Leverage Committee are Messrs. P. Gerald Malone, William J. Potter and Peter D. Sacks. 
Board Oversight of Risk Management 
The Funds are subject to a number of risks, including, among others, investment, compliance, operational and valuation risks. Risk oversight forms part of each Board's general oversight of the respective Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and Committee activities. Each Board has adopted, and periodically reviews, policies and procedures designed to address these risks. Different processes, procedures and controls are employed with respect to different types of risks. Day-to-day risk management functions are subsumed within the responsibilities of ASIAL, who carries out each Fund's investment management and business affairs, and also by ASI Aus and AAML, as applicable, and other service providers in connection with the services they provide to the Funds. Each of ASIAL, ASI Aus and AAML, as applicable, and other service providers have their own, independent interest in risk management, and their policies and methods of risk management will depend on their functions and business models. As part of its regular oversight of each Fund, the respective Board, directly and/or through a Committee, interacts with and reviews reports from, among others, ASIAL, ASI Aus and AAML, as applicable, and each Fund's other service providers (including the Funds' transfer agent), the Funds' Chief Compliance Officer, and the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm, legal counsel to the Funds, as appropriate, relating to the operations of the Funds. The Boards also require ASIAL to report to the Boards on other matters relating to risk management on a regular and as-needed basis. The Boards recognize that it may not be possible to identify all of the risks that may affect the Funds or to develop processes and controls to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects. Each Board may, at any time and in its discretion, change the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. 
Board and Committee Meetings in Fiscal 2018 
During the Funds' fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, the Boards of FAX, FCO and IAF each held four regular meetings, the Audit and Valuation Committee of FAX, FCO and IAF each held three meetings; the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of FAX, FCO and IAF each held two meetings; the Contract Review Committee of FAX, FCO and IAF each held one meeting; the Cost Review Committee of FAX, FCO and IAF each held one meeting; the Leverage Committee of FAX and FCO each held four meetings. During such period, each incumbent Director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and of Committees of the Board on which he served. 
Communications with the Board of Directors 
Shareholders who wish to communicate with Board members with respect to matters relating to the Funds may address their written correspondence to the Boards as a whole or to individual Board members c/o Aberdeen Standard Investments Inc., the Funds' investor relations service provider, at 1735 Market Street, 32nd Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19103, or via e-mail to the Director(s) c/o Aberdeen Standard Investments Inc. at InvestorRelations@aberdeenstandard.com. 
Director Attendance at Annual Meetings of Shareholders 
Generally, in the event that any of the Funds' Directors are geographically close to the site of an annual meeting of shareholders at the time of such meeting, one or more of such Directors may attend the meeting. However, since a majority of the Funds' Directors reside outside of the United States, the Funds recognize that it would be impractical for most Directors to attend such meetings and would create a significant expense for the Funds to require the Directors to attend such meetings. In light of the fact that the residences of most Directors are substantial distances from the location of the annual meetings of shareholders and that, historically, few shareholders have attended the annual meetings in person, the Funds have not established a policy with respect to Director attendance at annual meetings of shareholders.  REPORTS OF THE AUDIT AND VALUATION COMMITTEES; INFORMATION REGARDING THE FUNDS' INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Each Audit and Valuation Committee has selected, and each Fund's Independent Directors have ratified the selection of, KPMG LLP ("KPMG"), 1601 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit the financial statements of the Funds for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2019. Representatives from KPMG are not expected to be present at the Meetings to make a statement or respond to questions from shareholders. However, such representatives are expected to be available by telephone to respond to questions raised by shareholders, if any, during the Meetings. 
Each Audit and Valuation Committee has received from KPMG the written disclosures and the letter required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding KPMG's communications with the Audit and Valuation Committee concerning independence, and have discussed with KPMG its independence. Each Audit and Valuation Committee has also reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with Fund management and KPMG, and discussed certain matters with KPMG addressed by Statements on Auditing Standards Nos. 61 and 90. Based on the foregoing, each Audit and Valuation Committee recommended to its Board that the Fund's audited financial statements be included in the respective Fund's Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. 
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by KPMG during the Funds' two most recent fiscal years: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees    $ 82,723      $ 73.080      $ 55,000      $ 81,500      $ 72,000      $ 57,000

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The Tax Fees are for the completion of the Funds' federal and state tax returns.  
[END TABLE]
For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, KPMG billed $745,960 for aggregate non-audit fees for services to the Investment Manager, Investment Adviser and Sub-Adviser of FAX, FCO and IAF. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, KPMG billed $796,703 for aggregate non-audit fees for services to the Investment Manager, Investment Adviser and Sub-Adviser of FAX and FCO and billed $788,203 for aggregate non-audit fees for services to the Investment Manager and Investment Adviser of IAF. 
All of the services described in the table above were pre-approved by the relevant Audit and Valuation Committee. 
Each Audit and Valuation Committee has adopted an Audit and Valuation Committee Charter that provides that the Audit and Valuation Committee shall annually select, retain or terminate, and recommend to the Audit and Valuation Committee members of the Board and ratified by the entire Board, who are not "interested persons" (as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended), of the Fund for their ratification, the selection, retention or termination, the Fund's independent auditor and, in connection therewith, evaluate the terms of the engagement (including compensation of the auditor) and the qualifications and independence of the independent auditor, including whether the independent auditor provides any consulting, auditing or tax services to the Investment Manager, Investment Adviser or Sub-Adviser, if applicable, and receive the independent auditor's specific representations as to its independence, delineating all relationships between the independent auditor and the Fund, consistent with the Independent Standards Board ("ISB") Standard No. 1. Each Audit and Valuation Committee Charter also provides that the Committee shall review in   advance, and consider approval of, any and all proposals by Fund management or the Investment Manager that the Fund, Investment Manager or their affiliated persons, employ the independent auditor to render "permissible non-audit services" to the Fund and to consider whether such services are consistent with the independent auditor's independence. 
Each Audit and Valuation Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the Investment Manager, Investment Adviser, or Sub-Adviser, if applicable, and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with these entities that provides ongoing services to the relevant Fund that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence and has concluded that it is independent.

The following table sets forth information regarding compensation of Directors by each Fund and by the Fund Complex of which the Funds are a part for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act and Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act, as applied to the Funds, require the Funds' officers, Directors, the Investment Manager and Investment Adviser, affiliates of the Investment Manager or Investment Adviser, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of a Fund's outstanding securities ("Reporting Persons") to electronically file reports of ownership of that Fund's securities and changes in such ownership with the SEC and the NYSE MKT. Such persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Fund with copies of all such filings. 
Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it and written representations from certain Reporting Persons that no year-end reports were required for those persons, and except as provided in the following sentence, each Fund believes that during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, its Reporting Persons complied with all applicable filing requirements in a timely manner.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
Expenses. The expense of preparation, printing and mailing of the enclosed proxy card and accompanying Notice and Joint Proxy Statement will be borne proportionately by each Fund. Each Fund will reimburse banks, brokers and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding proxy solicitation material to the beneficial owners of the shares of that Fund.

Such solicitation may be conducted by, among others, officers, Directors and employees of the Funds, the Investment Manager, the Investment Adviser, the Sub-Adviser (in the case of FAX and FCO) or the Funds' Administrator.
