Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders  Proxy Statement  Your vote is important  Please vote by using the Internet, the telephone or by signing, dating and returning a proxy card 
Jack Hardin has served as 
Chair since 2017 and as a non-executive director of our company since 2014. 
Q&A with Chair of Our Board 
How has the Company weathered recent market volatility? 
During 2018, our common stock dividend remained constant despite volatile market conditions. We also issued an additional 16.1 million shares of our common stock in a public offering resulting in gross proceeds of over $250 million in February of this year. 
How does the Board approach director recruitment? 
The Board remains committed to ensuring that it is composed of a highly capable group of directors who are well-equipped to oversee the success of the company and effectively represent the interests of our stockholders. In 2017, we added three new members to the Board, Carolyn Handlon, Dennis Lockhart, and Colin Meadows. The addition of these directors has provided the Board with new qualifications and perspectives and has also increased our diversity. We encourage you to review the qualifications, skills and experience that we have identified as important attributes for directors of our company and how they match up to each of our directors. 
Each year the Board, with the assistance of an external advisor specializing in corporate governance, conducts an evaluation of the performance of our Board and each of its committees. Directors participate in one-on-one confidential interviews with the advisor and the Board as a group receives in-person feedback from the advisor based on those interviews. This information assists the Board in assessing how it can continue to improve its performance. 
What does it mean to be externally managed? 
We pay a fee to our external manager to manage your company; we have no direct employees. Our manager, in turn, manages and determines compensation of its employees, including our executive officers. Our manager does, however, consult with your Board in an annual discussion of the philosophy, process, and structure of compensation. Accordingly, your board has the opportunity to understand the important elements of the compensation philosophy and structure of its executives and satisfy ourselves that they are not inconsistent with stockholder interests. 
In addition, each year the Board's independent directors engage in a review of the management agreement with our manager in the context of a review of peer company management fees. The Board is focused on ensuring that the management fee remains appropriate and in-line with market practices. 
How do I communicate with the Board? 
As we conduct the activities of the Board, a key priority is ensuring robust engagement with you, the owners of the Company. Please continue to share your thoughts with us on any topic as we value your input, investment and support. The Board has established a process to facilitate communication by stockholders with the Board. Communications can be addressed to the Board of Directors in care of the Office of the Secretary, Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc., 1555 Peachtree Street NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30309 or by e-mail to company.secretary@ invescomortgagecapital.com.

Proxy Statement 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. ("Board" or "Board of Directors") for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on Friday, May 3, 2019, at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Please review the entire Proxy Statement and the company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K before voting. In this Proxy Statement, except where the context suggests otherwise, the terms "company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including IAS Operating Partnership LP, which we refer to as "our operating partnership"; "our manager" refers to Invesco Advisers, Inc., our external manager; "Invesco" refers to Invesco Ltd., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the indirect parent company of our manager. 
Election of Directors 
General 
Our Board of Directors currently has seven directors, each of whom is serving a term of office that continues until the Annual Meeting in 2019, or until such director's successor has been duly elected and qualified, or such director is removed from office or such director's office is otherwise earlier vacated. 
The Board has nominated John S. Day, Carolyn B. Handlon, Edward J. Hardin, James R. Lientz, Jr., 
Dennis P. Lockhart, Gregory G. McGreevey and Colin D. Meadows for election as directors of the company for a term ending at the 2020 Annual Meeting. Further information regarding the nominees is shown on the following pages. Each nominee has indicated to the company that the nominee would serve if elected. We do not anticipate that any of our director nominees would be unable to stand for election, but if that were to happen, the Board may reduce the size of the Board, designate a substitute or leave a vacancy unfilled. If a substitute is designated, proxies voting on the original director candidate will be cast for the substituted candidate. 
Under our Bylaws, at any meeting held for the purpose of electing directors at which a quorum is present, each director nominee receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast with respect to such nominee at the meeting will be elected as a director. If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected and no successor has been elected at the meeting, the director is required under our Bylaws to submit his or her resignation as a director. Our Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee would then make a recommendation to the full Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation. If the resignation is not accepted by the Board, the director will continue to serve until the next annual meeting or until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If the director's resignation is accepted by the Board, then the Board, in its sole discretion, may fill the vacancy or decrease the size of the Board. However, if the number of nominees exceeds the number of positions available for the election of directors, the directors so elected shall be those nominees who have received the greatest number of affirmative votes so long as such nominee also received at least an affirmative majority of the total votes cast in person or by proxy. 
Recommendation of the board 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION TO THE BOARD OF EACH OF THE DIRECTOR NOMINEES. 
This proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast at the Annual Meeting.

[END TABLE]
 The Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee will consider candidates recommended for nomination to the Board by stockholders of the company. Stockholders may nominate candidates for election to the Board under Maryland law and our Bylaws. Our Bylaws provide that, with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, nominations of individuals for election to our Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by stockholders may be made only (1) pursuant to our notice of the meeting, (2) by or at the direction of our Board of Directors or (3) by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record both at the time of giving the notice required by our Bylaws and at the time of the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice provisions set forth in our Bylaws. The manner in which the committee evaluates candidates recommended by stockholders is generally the same as any other candidate. However, the committee will also seek and consider information concerning any relationship between a stockholder recommending a candidate and the candidate to determine if the candidate can represent the interests of all of the stockholders. The committee will not evaluate a candidate recommended by a stockholder unless the stockholder's proposal provides that the potential candidate has indicated a willingness to serve as a director, to comply with the expectations and requirements for Board service as publicly disclosed by the company and to provide all of the information necessary to conduct an evaluation. For further information regarding deadlines for stockholder proposals, please see the section of this proxy statement below entitled Important Additional Information – Stockholder Proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting.

In that regard, the Board does not receive certain items which are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of the Board. 
In addition, our manager maintains the Invesco Mortgage Capital Compliance Reporting Line for employees of the manager or its affiliates or individuals outside the company to report complaints or concerns on an anonymous and confidential basis regarding questionable accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and possible violations of the company's Code of Conduct or law. Further information about the Compliance Reporting Line is available on the company's website. 
Persons may submit any complaint regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors by sending a written communication appropriately addressed to: 
Audit Committee 
Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. 
1555 Peachtree Street N.E. 
Atlanta, Georgia 30309 
Attn: Office of the Secretary  The Board has adopted Corporate Governance  Guidelines. 
The Board is elected by stockholders to oversee our management team and to seek to assure that the long-term interests of the stockholders are being served. 
The company has chosen to separate the chief executive officer and Board chairperson positions. 
Our Board has established a Code of Conduct. 
Corporate Governance 
Corporate governance guidelines 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines ("Guidelines") which are available in the corporate governance section of the company's website at www. invescomortgagecapital.com (the "company's website"). The Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth the practices the Board follows with respect to, among other matters, the composition of the Board, director responsibilities, Board committees, director access to officers and independent advisors, director compensation and the performance evaluation of the Board. 
Board leadership structure 
As described in the Guidelines, the company's business is conducted day-to-day by its officers and its external manager, under the direction of the chief executive officer and the oversight of the Board, to enhance the long-term value of the company for its stockholders. The Board is elected by the stockholders to oversee the officers of the company and our external manager and to seek to assure that the long-term interests of the stockholders are being served. In light of these differences in the fundamental roles of the Board and management, the company has chosen to separate the chief executive officer and Board chairperson positions. The Board believes separation of these roles: (i) allows the Board to more effectively monitor and evaluate objectively the performance of the chief executive officer, such that the chief executive officer is more likely to be held accountable for his performance, (ii) allows the non-executive chairperson to control the Board's agenda and information flow, and (iii) creates an atmosphere in which other directors are more likely to challenge the chief executive officer and other members of our senior management team. For these reasons, the company believes that this board leadership structure is currently the most appropriate structure for the company. Nevertheless, the Board may reassess the appropriateness of the existing structure at any time, including following changes in Board composition, in management, or in the character of the company's business and operations. 
Code of conduct 
Our Board of Directors has established a code of ethics that applies to our officers, directors and independent contractors and to our manager's officers, directors and personnel when such individuals are acting for or on our behalf (the "code of conduct"). Among other matters, our code of conduct is designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal  and professional relationships;  
∎  full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in our SEC reports and other public communications;   
∎  compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;  
∎  prompt internal reporting of violations of the code to appropriate persons identified in the code; and   
∎  accountability for adherence to the code.  
[END TABLE]
Any waiver of the code of conduct for our executive officers or directors may be made only by our Board of Directors or one of our Board committees. The code of conduct is posted on the company's website. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement regarding any amendment to, or a waiver of, a provision of the code of conduct by posting such information on the company's website.  Board's role in risk oversight 
We believe that risk oversight responsibility rests with the full Board of Directors. Therefore, the Board has principal responsibility for oversight of the company's risk management processes and for understanding the overall risk profile of the company. Though Board committees routinely address specific risks and risk processes within their purview, the Board has not delegated primary risk oversight responsibility to a committee. 
The company has in place an enterprise risk management committee consisting of executive and senior management. The committee meets regularly and maintains dialogue with the Board of Directors regarding the top risks of the company and mitigating actions to address them. By receiving regular reports, the Board maintains a practical understanding of the risk philosophy and risk appetite of the company. 
In addition, since the company is externally managed by our manager, we rely upon the operational and investment risk oversight functions of our manager and its Invesco affiliates. Our manager's risk management framework provides the basis for consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up, down and across our manager and the company. Our manager's Global Performance and Risk Committee assesses core investment risks, while our manager's Corporate Risk Management Committee assesses strategic, operational and all other business risks. A network of business unit, specific and geographic risk management committees, under the guidance and standards of the Corporate Risk Management Committee, maintains an ongoing risk assessment, management and monitoring process that provides a bottom-up perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our manager's business. 
Through this regular and consistent risk communication, the Board has reasonable assurance that all material risks of the company are being addressed and that the company is propagating a risk-aware culture in which effective risk management is built into the fabric of the business.

 As a part of its review, the committee periodically engages FTI Consulting, Inc. as a third-party consultant to report on comparable non-executive director compensation practices and levels. The cost of services for work performed for the committee by FTI Consulting related to non-executive director  compensation for 2018 amounted to $27,744. The company, on management's recommendation, retained FTI Consulting to provide certain accounting services for the company in 2018. The costs of such services for 2018 amounted to approximately  $615,782. Neither the committee nor the Board expressly approved the accounting services. After taking into consideration the NYSE's independence standards, the committee determined that the compensation consultant is independent because  (i) the compensation consulting team works exclusively for the committee and not for our management; (ii) the compensation consulting practice group does not work with or report to the accounting services practice group, and (iii) the  compensation consulting team did not perform any other services on behalf of the company. No executive officer of the company is involved in recommending or determining non-executive director compensation  levels. See Director Compensation below for a more detailed discussion of compensation paid to the company's non-executive directors during 2018.

 Our management agreement We are externally managed by  Invesco Advisers, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Invesco Ltd., pursuant to a management agreement, which provides that our manager is responsible for managing our affairs. As highlighted below, we have no employees, including our executive  officers. Our executive officers are employees of our manager (or one of its affiliates) and such individuals are engaged in additional capacities for our manager (or one of its affiliates). Our executive officers do not receive compensation from  us, nor do we reimburse our manager for any of their compensation. Instead, our manager and its affiliates use the proceeds from the management fee, in part, to pay compensation to its officers and personnel, including our executive officers. No  specific portion of the management fee is allocated to the compensation of our executive officers because these individuals manage or are associated with multiple Invesco products, and research and investment strategies employed may impact a number  of products for which these individuals are responsible. As such, compensation for our executive officers reflects performance across all the products managed by them, and decisions are based on the principles and factors described below in  Overview of our manager's compensation program and philosophy. While each of these principles and factors is considered by our manager in making compensation decisions, our manager does not attempt to rank or assign relative  weight to any factor but rather applies its judgment in considering them in their entirety.

 However, for context of our executive officers' compensation in relation to our management fee, we provide an estimate of aggregate  compensation of our executive officers that may reasonably be associated with the approximate total average assets of the company for 2018 compared to total average assets of products the executive officers managed or were associated with for 2018.  Applying such methodology to compensation of our executive officers for 2018, the total compensation of the named executive officers reasonably associated with their management of the company is $2.8 million, which represents 7.1% of the  management fee paid by the company to the manager in 2018.

We have an executive officer stock ownership policy to align the interests of our executive officers with our stockholders. 
We believe the structure of the management fee does not create an incentive for excessive or unnecessary risk-taking by our management team and reduces the risk of conflicts of interest with our manager. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 For 2018, our executive officers' compensation, in the aggregate, was apportioned 22% to fixed compensation and 78% to variable or  incentive compensation.   
 For 2018, our executive officers' compensation, in the aggregate, was apportioned 22% to fixed compensation and 78% to variable or  incentive compensation.   
[END TABLE]
Executive officer stock ownership policy 
In order to encourage the alignment of interests between our executive officers and our stockholders, we maintain an Executive Officer Stock Ownership Policy. The policy requires that, within five years of the date of such executive officer's first appointment: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  the chief executive officer (CEO) achieve an ownership level of at least 60,000 shares;   
∎  the president, chief investment officer, and chief operating officer achieve an ownership level of at least 35,000  shares; and  
∎  the chief financial officer (CFO) achieve an ownership level of at least 7,000 shares.  
[END TABLE]
Our CEO and CFO have achieved their respective ownership level requirements, and we expect our other executive officers will attain their respective ownership requirements within the time period prescribed by the policy. 
Insider trading policy 
We maintain an insider trading policy, which prohibits short selling, dealing in publicly-traded options, pledging, hedging or monetization transactions in our securities. 
Certain risks related to our management fee 
Because our management fee is calculated as a percent of stockholders' equity, subject to specified adjustments, we believe the structure of the management fee does not create an incentive for management to take excessive or unnecessary risks and reduces the risk of conflicts of interests with our manager. Stockholders' equity as the basis for the calculation does not result in leveraged pay-out curves, steep pay-out cliffs or set unreasonable goals and thresholds, each of which can promote excessive and unnecessary risks. In addition, the management fee may not be increased or revised without the approval of our independent directors.  Consideration of prior advisory vote 
Our Compensation Committee noted the significant support received in the 2018 advisory vote on executive compensation (approximately 98% of votes cast), and therefore it has determined that no changes were advisable based on the outcome of that vote. 
Compensation Committee report 
The Compensation Committee of the company has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and, based on such review and discussions, the committee recommended to the board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement. 
Respectfully submitted by the Compensation Committee: 
Carolyn B. Handlon (chairperson) 
John S. Day

Dennis P. Lockhart 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
During 2018, the following directors served as members of the Compensation Committee: Mr. Day, Ms. Handlon, Mr. Hardin, Mr. Lientz and Mr. Lockhart. No member of the Compensation Committee was an officer or employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries during 2018, and no member of the Compensation Committee was formerly an officer of the company or any of its subsidiaries or was a party to any disclosable related person transaction involving the company. During 2018, none of the executive officers of the company served on the board of directors or on the Compensation Committee of any other entity that has or had executive officers that served as a member of the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee of the company.  Our manager provides the day-to-day management of our operations pursuant to a management agreement between us and our manager. 
We grant shares of our common stock to each non-executive director and grant equity awards to personnel of our manager who are not executive officers. 
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
Relationship to our external manager 
In 2009 we entered into a management agreement with our manager pursuant to which our manager provides the day-to-day management of our operations. The management agreement requires our manager to manage our business affairs in conformity with the policies and the investment guidelines that are approved and monitored by our Board of Directors. Our manager is entitled to receive from us a management fee. The management fee is equal to 1.50% of the company's stockholders' equity per annum, subject to specified adjustments, which is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears. We are also obligated to reimburse certain operating expenses related to the company incurred by our manager, including directors and officers insurance, accounting services, auditing and tax services, filing fees and miscellaneous general and administrative costs. The management agreement renews for one-year terms unless terminated by either us or our manager. Our manager is entitled to receive a termination fee from us, under certain circumstances. 
Our executive officers are employees of Invesco. As a result, the terms of the management agreement between us and our manager were negotiated between related parties, and the terms, including fees and other amounts payable, may not be as favorable to us as if they had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. Each year, in connection with the annual renewal of the management agreement, our Audit Committee reviews the management fee in the context of a review of peer company management fees. Our management fee structure, 1.50% of stockholders' equity subject to specified adjustments, is the same as a large majority of the externally managed mortgage REITs we consider to be our peers. With respect to 2018, management fees paid or payable to our manager were approximately $40.7 million, and we reimbursed our manager approximately $6.7 million for operating expenses. 
Grants of equity compensation to our manager, its personnel and its affiliates 
We adopted the Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. 2009 Equity Incentive Plan to provide incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified directors, officers, advisors, consultants and other personnel, including our manager and its affiliates and personnel of our manager. The Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. 2009 Equity Incentive Plan provides for grants of stock options, restricted stock, phantom shares, dividend equivalent rights and other equity-based awards. 
We grant shares of our common stock to each non-executive director as part of such director's compensation. In addition, we grant equity awards to personnel of our manager who are not our executive officers. We do not intend to grant equity-based awards to our executive officers. 
Upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board adopted the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan as amended and restated on February. 14, 2019, subject to stockholder approval, as the plan will terminate on June 30, 2019 under its current terms. The Board recommends that stockholders approve the Equity Plan to permit the Company's continued use of equity-based compensation awards. The material terms of the Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. 2009 Equity Incentive Plan as amended and restated are described in Proposal 3 of this Proxy Statement.  Management is required to present for the approval or ratification of the Audit Committee all material information regarding an actual or potential related person transaction. 
Related Person Transaction Policy 
The Board of Directors has adopted written Policies and Procedures with Respect to Related Person Transactions to address the review, approval, disapproval or ratification of related person transactions. "Related persons" include the company's executive officers, directors, director nominees, holders of more than five percent (5%) of the company's voting securities, immediate family members of the foregoing persons, and any entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed, is a partner or is in a similar position, or in which such person has a 5% or greater ownership interest. A "related person transaction" means a transaction or series of transactions in which the company participates, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a related person has a direct or indirect interest (with certain exceptions permitted by SEC rules). 
Management is required to present for the approval or ratification of the Audit Committee all material information regarding an actual or potential related person transaction. The policy requires that, after reviewing such information, the disinterested members of the Audit Committee will approve or disapprove the transaction. Approval will be given only if the Audit Committee determines that such transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, the best interests of the company and its stockholders. The policy further requires that in the event management becomes aware of a related person transaction that has not been previously approved or ratified, it must be submitted to the Audit Committee promptly. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires certain officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of the company's common stock to file reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. The reporting officers, directors and 10% stockholders are also required by SEC rules to furnish the company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based solely on its review of copies of such reports, the company believes that all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its directors, officers and 10% stockholders were complied with during fiscal year 2018, with one exception. Mr. Phegley received shares through dividend reinvestment programs that in the aggregate exceeded the small transaction amount exempt from filing in October 2018. These shares were not reported until February 2019 on his Form 5.  Security Ownership of Principal Stockholders 
The following table sets forth the common stock beneficially owned as of March 4, 2019 by each stockholder known to us to beneficially own more than five percent of the company's outstanding common stock.

Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
General 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") enables our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the SEC rules. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. 
We are externally managed by our manager pursuant to a management agreement, which provides that our manager is responsible for managing our affairs. We have no employees, including our executive officers. Our executive officers, all of whom are employees of our manager (or one of its affiliates) and engaged in additional capacities for our manager (or one of its affiliates), do not receive compensation from us. Instead, we pay our manager a management fee, and our manager and its affiliates use the proceeds from the management fee, in part, to pay compensation to its officers and personnel, including our executive officers. No specific portion of the management fee is allocated to the compensation of our executive officers. Our manager makes all decisions relating to the compensation of our executive officers based on such factors as our manager may determine are appropriate. We did not pay, and do not intend to pay, any cash compensation to our executive officers, nor did we make any grants of plan-based awards, stock options or stock grants of any kind to any person who was then an executive officer for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. We do not provide our executive officers with pension benefits, perquisites or other personal benefits. We do not have any employment agreements with any persons and have no arrangements to make cash payments to our executive officers upon their termination from service as our officers or a change in control of the company. 
Notwithstanding that we do not pay our executive officers compensation, we are required by the SEC to seek an advisory vote from our stockholders to approve the compensation of our executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we will ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's compensation disclosure rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and related narrative discussion." 
The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the company, our Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee. Our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our stockholders' concerns and evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 98% of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory proposal to approve our named executive officers' compensation. Under the Board's current policy, stockholders are given an opportunity annually to cast an advisory vote on this topic.  Recommendation of the board 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE RULES OF THE SEC. This proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast at the Annual Meeting.

Approval of the Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. 2009 Equity Incentive Plan as Amended and Restated 
General 
We are asking our stockholders to approve the 2009 Equity Incentive Plan as amended and restated (the "Equity Plan"), which will make 200,000 shares of the company common stock available for issuance to employees, directors and other eligible participants of the company or its affiliates. The Equity Plan was originally approved in 2009 and authorized one million shares. The original plan is scheduled to terminate on June 30, 2019. 
Based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee , the Board adopted the Equity Plan on February 14, 2019, subject to stockholder approval. The Board recommends that stockholders approve the Equity Plan to permit the company's continued use of equity-based compensation awards. The material terms of the Equity Plan are described below. 
Why should you vote FOR approval of the Equity Plan? 
Under NYSE rules, listed companies such as the Company are generally not permitted to grant shares of common stock as compensation except under a plan that is approved by stockholders. The Board recommends a vote FOR the approval of the Equity Plan because it will continue to allow us to achieve important business objectives in ways that are consistent with stockholder interests. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  Equity compensation facilitates alignment with stockholder interests.   
[END TABLE]
Consistent with industry practice and accepted good governance, our manager's compensation philosophy reflects the belief that equity compensation is a critical means of aligning the interests of employees with those of our stockholders. Historically, all equity awards have been made in the form of fully vested shares to our non-executive directors and time-based equity awards to certain employees of our manager who have significant company-related job responsibilities. We believe that this is the best and simplest way to align the interests of our non-executive directors and manager-employees with the interests of our stockholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  Equity compensation is an important tool to recruit and retain talent. Our competitors in the industry routinely  use equity awards to compensate employees, and our managers employees who have significant company-related job responsibilities place a high value on equity compensation. Our equity awards are an important component of our managers  compensation program.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎  The Equity Plan has key features that serve stockholder interests. The Equity Plan includes best practices with  respect to governance and administration of equity compensation programs described in more detail below in Key Features of the Equity Plan.  
∎  Use of full-value awards. Our equity compensation program favors the use of full-value  awards for our non-executive directors and certain Invesco employees (as opposed to appreciation awards, such as stock options). This can mitigate the potential dilutive effect of equity  compensation, because the same value can be delivered in the form of a stock award using fewer shares than would be needed if delivered in the form of a stock option. Although the Equity Plan provides for stock options and stock appreciation rights,  the company has never granted stock options or stock appreciation rights, and it does not intend to do so in the foreseeable future. See Key Data below for information on our overhang and run rate.

   Impact on dilution     
As noted above, the Equity Plan will authorize the issuance of up to 200,000 shares, a reduction from the 761,746 shares currently available under the Equity Plan, which represents approximately 0.16% of our outstanding  common shares as of March 4, 2019. The Board believes that the potential dilution resulting from these additional shares is reasonable and that the issuance of these additional shares will provide an appropriate incentive for employees to  increase the value of the company for stockholders. Based on historical grant levels and the company's current stock price, the company anticipates that the shares available for grant under the Equity Plan will be sufficient to provide  projected equity incentives until our 2023 Annual General Meeting.

 Types of awards. The Equity Plan authorizes awards in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options, SARs and other stock-based awards. 
∎ Restricted stock. Awards of restricted stock are actual shares of common stock that are issued to a participant, but that are subject to forfeiture if the participant does not remain employed by the company for a certain period of time, certain performance conditions are not met, or both circumstances are not met. Except for these restrictions and any others imposed by the committee, the participant will generally have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the restricted stock, including the right to vote the restricted stock and the right to receive dividends and other distributions paid or made with respect to the restricted stock. 
∎Restricted stock units. An award of restricted stock units represents a contractual obligation of the company to deliver a number of shares, an amount in cash or a combination of shares and cash equal to the specified number of shares subject to the award. Restricted stock units are subject to forfeiture if the participant does not remain employed by the company for a certain period of time, certain performance conditions are not met, or both circumstances are not met. The committee may also provide that dividend equivalents will be paid with respect to restricted stock units. 
∎ Other stock-based awards. The Equity Plan provides for the award of company shares and other awards that are valued by reference to our shares. Other stock-based awards may only be granted in lieu of compensation that would otherwise be payable to the participant. Non-executive director awards are considered a form of other stock-based awards. Each year, the committee establishes the form and value of such stock-based awards for non-executive directors for the upcoming year. Such awards are subject to the non-executive director stock ownership policy. 
∎ Stock options and SARs. A stock option is an award that gives the participant the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a specified number of company shares at a specified price for a stated period of time. Stock options may be granted in the form of incentive stock options, which are intended to qualify for favorable treatment for the recipient under U.S. federal tax law, or as non-qualified stock options, which do not qualify for this favorable tax treatment. SARs represent the right to receive an amount in cash, shares or both equal to the fair market value of the shares subject to the award on the date of exercise minus the exercise price of the award. 
As noted above, the Equity Plan provides for stock options and SARs even though the company has never granted stock options or SARs. If stock options or SARs are granted under the Equity Plan, they will be subject to the following limitations: 
∎ No discounted stock options or SARs  All stock options and SARs must have an exercise price that is not less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. 
∎ No reloads  The grant of a stock option will not be conditioned on the delivery of shares to the company in payment of an exercise price or satisfaction of a withholding or other payment obligation (i.e., a reload option). 
∎ No repricing  Repricing of stock options or SARs is not permitted without stockholder approval. 
∎ Term  The term of a stock option or SAR cannot exceed 10 years. 
∎ No liberal share recycling  Share recycling for stock options and SARs is prohibited. 
∎ Minimum vesting requirements  The Equity Plan provides a minimum vesting period of one year for stock options and SARs.

A Participant will generally be treated as having terminated employment with the Company,  Participating Company, and any Affiliates as of a certain date if the Participant and the Company, Participating Company, or Affiliate that employs the Participant reasonably anticipate that the Participant will perform no further services for the  Company, Participating Company, or any Affiliate after such date or that the level of bona fide services that the Participant will perform after such date (whether as an employee or an independent contractor) will permanently decrease to no more  than 20 percent of the average level of bona fide services performed (whether as an employee or an independent contractor) over the immediately preceding 36-month period (or the full period of services if  the Participant has been providing services for fewer than 36 months); provided, however, that the employment relationship is treated as continuing while the Participant is on military leave, sick leave or other bona fide leave of absence if the  period of leave does not exceed six months or, if longer, so long as the Participant retains the right to reemployment with the Company, Participating Company, or any Affiliate.   
    "Termination of Service" means the termination of the Participant's employment or consultancy with, or performance of  services (including as a director) for, the Company, a Participating Company, and any Affiliates or, in the case of a director, when a director no longer holds office as a director of the Company. For Participants employed outside the United States,  the date on which such Participant incurs a Termination of Service shall be the earlier of (i) the last day of the Participant's active service with the Company, a Participating Company, and any Affiliates or (ii) the last day on  which the Participant is considered an employee of the Company, a Participating Company, and any Affiliates, as determined in each case without including any required advance notice period and irrespective of the status of the termination under  local labor or employment laws. Temporary absences from employment because of illness, vacation or leave of absence and transfers among the Company, a Participating Company, and any Affiliates shall not be considered Terminations of Service. With  respect to any Award that constitutes a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, "Termination of Service" shall mean a "separation from service" as defined under  Section 409A of the Code to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code to avoid the imposition of any tax or interest or the inclusion of any amount in income thereunder.

The Committee may require each person purchasing or receiving  Shares pursuant to an Award to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that such person is acquiring the Shares without a view to the distribution thereof. The certificates or book entry for such Shares may include any legend or  appropriate notation that the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer, and the Committee may take such other steps as it deems necessary or desirable to restrict the transfer of Shares issuable under the Plan to comply  with applicable law or Applicable Exchange rules. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or agreements made pursuant thereto, the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver Shares under the Plan unless such issuance or delivery  complies with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the requirements of any Applicable Exchange or similar entity and the Company has obtained any consent, approval or permit from any federal, state or foreign governmental authority  that the Committee determines to be necessary or advisable. 
 (b) Additional Compensation Arrangements. Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the  Company, Participating Company, or any Affiliate from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements for its employees. 
 (c)  No Contract of Employment. Neither the Plan nor any Award Agreement shall constitute  a contract of employment, and neither the adoption of the

[BEGIN TABLE]
 Plan nor the granting of any Award shall confer upon any employee any right to continued employment. Neither the Plan nor any  Award Agreement shall interfere in any way with the right of the Company, a Participating Company, or any Affiliate to terminate the employment of any employee at any time. 
 (d) Required Taxes; No Tax Gross Ups. No later than the date as of which an amount first  becomes includible in the gross income of a Participant for federal, state, local or foreign income or employment or other tax purposes with respect to any Award under the Plan, such Participant shall pay to the Company, or make arrangements  satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment of, any federal, state, local or foreign taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to such amount. Unless otherwise determined by the Company, withholding obligations may be  settled with Shares, including Shares that are part of the Award that gives rise to the withholding requirement, having a Fair Market Value on the date of withholding equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld for tax purposes, all in  accordance with such procedures as the Committee establishes. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company, Participating Company, and any Affiliates shall, to the extent  permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment otherwise due to such Participant. The Committee may establish such procedures as it deems appropriate, including making irrevocable elections, for the settlement of  withholding obligations with Shares. Regardless of any arrangements made by the Company, Participating Company, any Affiliate or the Committee with respect to the withholding or other payment of any federal, state, local or foreign taxes of any  kind, the liability for all such taxes legally due from a Participant remains the responsibility of the Participant. By accepting an Award, a Participant consents to the methods of tax withholding established by the Committee or otherwise made or  arranged by the Company. 
 (e) Limitation on Dividend Reinvestment and Dividend Equivalents. Reinvestment of dividends in  additional Restricted Stock at the time of any dividend payment, and the payment of Shares with respect to dividends to Participants holding Awards of Restricted Stock Units, shall only be permissible if sufficient Shares are available under  Section 6 for such reinvestment or payment (taking into account then outstanding Awards). In the event that sufficient Shares are not available for such reinvestment or payment, such reinvestment or payment shall be made in the form of a grant  of Restricted Stock Units equal in number to the Shares that would have been obtained by such payment or reinvestment, the terms of which Restricted Stock Units shall provide for settlement in cash and for dividend equivalent reinvestment in further  Restricted Stock Units on the terms contemplated by this Section 16(e). 
 (f) Rights of a Beneficiary. Any amounts payable and any rights exercisable under an Award  after a Participants death shall be paid to and exercised by the Participants Beneficiary, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, Applicable Exchange rule or the terms of an applicable Award Agreement. 
 (g) Affiliate Employees. In the case of a forfeiture or cancellation of an Award to an employee  of any Affiliate, all Shares underlying such Awards shall revert to the Company. 
 (h) Governing Law and Interpretation. The Plan and all Awards made and actions taken thereunder  shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without reference to principles of conflict of laws. The captions of the Plan are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force or  effect. 
 (i)  Non-Transferability. Awards under the Plan  cannot be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, except as provided in Section 6(e). 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (j)  Foreign Employees and Foreign Law Considerations. The Committee may grant Awards  to Eligible Individuals who are foreign nationals, who are employed outside the United States or who are not compensated from a payroll maintained in the United States, or who are otherwise subject to (or could cause the Company to be subject to)  tax, legal or regulatory provisions of countries or jurisdictions outside the United States, on such terms and conditions different from those specified in the Plan as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable to foster and  promote achievement of the purposes of the Plan. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, Awards to Participants who are employed and/or otherwise subject to the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States shall be subject to such  terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish and set forth in an applicable Award Agreement, including any addendum thereto. 
 (k)   Use of English Language. The Plan, each Award Agreement, and all other  documents, notices and legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant to an Award shall be written in English, unless otherwise determined by the Committee. If a Participant receives an Award Agreement, a copy of the Plan or any other  documents related to an Award translated into a language other than English, and if the meaning of the translated version is different from the English version, the English version shall control. 
 (l)  Recovery of Amounts Paid. All Awards granted under the Plan shall be subject to  any policy established by the Committee under which the Company may recover from current and former Participants any amounts paid or Shares issued under an Award and any proceeds therefrom. The Committee may apply such policy to Awards granted  before the policy is adopted to the extent required by applicable law or Applicable Exchange rule or as otherwise provided by such policy. 
 (m)  Notices. A notice or other communication to the Committee shall be valid only if  given in the form and to the location specified by the Committee.
