BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
Our Board has been directed by a Non-Executive Chairman of the Board since 2003. The Board believes that having its own leadership separate from our Chief Executive Officer provides the Board with an effective way to ensure that they are fully informed and have the opportunity to fully debate all important issues in order to fulfill its oversight responsibilities and hold management accountable for the performance of the Trust. This also allows our Chief Executive Officer to focus his time on running our day-to-day business. Our Non-Executive Chairman presides at all meetings of the Board and helps to set the agendas for Board meetings.  INDEPENDENCE OF TRUSTEES 
The Board reviews on an ongoing basis all relationships between us and each Trustee to determine whether each Trustee is independent or otherwise has any relationship to the Trust that could adversely affect the Trustee's ability to exercise independent judgment. This review also determines whether each Trustee satisfies the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines include a standard that a Trustee's position as a director, officer or owner of a company with which we do business does not constitute a material relationship so long as payments made by that company do not account for more than five percent (5%) of our gross revenues or more than ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues of that company. 
The Board, on recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, considered all relevant facts and circumstances and determined that all Trustees other than Mr. Ordan and Mr. Wood are independent for purposes of Board and committee service under the standards of the NYSE, our Corporate Governance Guidelines and applicable law. In making the independence determination, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board considered the following:

[END TABLE]
BOARD MEETINGS 
The Board of Trustees holds regularly scheduled in-person meetings and if needed, will also act through telephonic meetings, action by written consent and other communications with management. During 2018, the Board of Trustees held five meetings, four of which were in-person meetings. The non-management, independent Trustees held an executive session at each of those four in-person meetings. Mr. Vassalluzzo, the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board, presided over all Board meetings as well as all executive sessions of the non-management, independent Trustees. The Non-Executive Chairman of the Board is expected to preside over all future Board meetings and executive sessions of non-management, independent Trustees. 
Each of the Trustees attended 100% of the meetings of the Board as well as 100% of all committee meetings, including committees on which the Trustee did not serve during 2018. It is the Trust's policy for all Trustees to attend our annual meeting of shareholders absent exceptional cause. All Trustees attended our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  BOARD COMMITTEES 
The Board has three standing committees – the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each committee operates under a written charter which is available in the Investors section of our website at www.federalrealty.com. Each committee member meets the independence, experience and, with respect to the Audit Committee, the financial literacy requirements, of the NYSE, the SEC and our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Information about each of these committees is included in the chart below:

RISK MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT 
The Board is responsible for overseeing enterprise level risk of the Trust and does so directly and through its committees. As part of carrying out its risk oversight responsibilities, the entire Board regularly receives updates from management on the continued viability of our business plan, market conditions, capital position, and our business results and specifically reviews potential business risks from time to time. The Board reviews that information together with our quarterly and annual financial statements and operating results and short and long-term business prospects to assess the risks that we may encounter and to establish appropriate direction to avoid or minimize the potential impact of the identified risks. Some of the details that are discussed as part of the Board's review of potential risks facing us include, without limitation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the impact of market conditions on our business;  
• operational risks such as the ability of our tenants to be successful and the ability to grow the company through  increasing rents and redeveloping our properties;  
• liquidity and credit risks, including our ability to access capital to run and grow our business and our overall cost of  capital and the impact on our profitability;  
• investment risks from acquisitions and our development and redevelopment projects;  
• regulatory risks that may impact our profitability;  
• risks relating to our status as a real estate investment trust;  
• environmental related risks;  
• cybersecurity risks; and  
• general risks inherent in the real estate industry.  
[END TABLE]
 COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT 
In February 2019, our Compensation Committee reviewed our compensation policies and practices for all of our employees to determine whether any of such policies or programs created any risk that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Trust. Based on that review, the Committee does not believe that our compensation programs encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking. Specifically, the incentive compensation of 95% of our employees is based solely on corporate performance objectives. For the approximately 5% of our employees who earn all or a portion of their compensation by completing leasing transactions or closing acquisitions, they cannot complete any deals without first obtaining approvals from either the Board and/or one or more members of senior management whose incentive compensation is tied to corporate performance.

All communications should identify the party to whom it is being sent, and any communication which indicates it is for the Board of Trustees or fails to identify a particular Trustee will be deemed to be a communication intended for the Trust's Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. The Trust's Secretary will promptly forward to the appropriate Trustee all communications she receives for the Board or any individual Trustee which relate to the Trust's business, operations, financial condition, management, employees or similar matters. The Trust's Secretary will not forward to any Trustee any advertising, solicitation or similar materials. 
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Review and Approval of Related Party Transactions 
Our Code of Business Conduct requires that our Trustees and all of our employees deal with the Trust on an arms-length basis in any related party transaction. All transactions between us and any of our Trustees, our named executive officers or other vice presidents, or entity in which any of them has an ownership interest must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee. Audit Committee approval is not required for us to enter into a lease with an entity in which any of our Trustees is a director, employee or owner so long as the lease is entered into in the ordinary course of business and is negotiated at arms-length and on market terms. 
Related Party Transactions 
Mr. Thompson, one of our Trustees, serves as the President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Thompson Hospitality Corporation ("THC"). THC leases from us two restaurant locations. Those leases were negotiated at arms' length, reflecting market conditions at the time they were negotiated, and are scheduled to expire on June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2027. In addition, in 2018 THC acquired an ownership interest in two additional restaurant tenants. Both of these restaurant leases were negotiated at arms' length prior to their acquisition by THC and are scheduled to expire on November 30, 2020 and October 31, 2027, subject to a tenant extension option. In the aggregate, we received approximately $1.1 million in rent and other related charges in 2018, anticipate receiving approximately $1.5 million in rent and other charges in each of 2019 and 2020 and then less than $1.0 million annually in rent and other charges through the remaining terms of these leases. 
The Board reviewed these relationships with Mr. Thompson and determined that Mr. Thompson met in 2018 and currently meets all independence requirements for his service as a Trustee as described in the "Independence of Trustees" section above. 
None of our named executive officers had or has any indebtedness to the Trust or any relationship with the Trust other than as an employee and shareholder. Employment and change-in-control arrangements between the Trust and the named executive officers are described in the "Potential Payments on Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control" section below.

PROPOSAL 1 – ELECTION OF TRUSTEES 
Our Board of Trustees currently has eight Trustees, all of whom have been nominated to stand for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting.

You are entitled to cast one vote per Share for each of the eight named individuals. Proxies may not be voted for more than eight individuals.

QUALIFICATIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF TRUSTEES 
In determining who should stand for election as a Trustee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee tries to ensure that the Board is composed of individuals whose backgrounds, skills and experiences, when taken together, will provide the Board with the range of skills and expertise to be able to effectively guide and oversee our strategy, operations and management. At a minimum, candidates should have the ability to exercise judgment in fulfilling his/her responsibilities, a professional background that would enable him/her to understand our business, public company, real estate, retail and/or other financial experience and a history of honesty, integrity and fair dealing with third parties. The skills and experience of the Trustees in areas we consider critical to our business are described in detail in the biographies above and summarized below:

In considering nominees to stand for election at the Annual Meeting, the Board and the Committee evaluate each person's background, qualifications and attributes to serve as a Trustee based on the criteria described above and for incumbent Trustees, their years of experience working together on the Board and the deep knowledge of the Trust they have developed as a result of such service on the Board. This is especially important in our company where real estate decisions and strategy often take years to develop and require a full understanding of history in setting strategies and making decisions. The Board and the committee also consider each incumbent Trustee's contributions to the effectiveness of the Board and its committees based on the in-depth individual trustee assessments completed each year for each Board member by each other Board member. 
To identify, recruit and evaluate qualified candidates for the Board, the Board first looks to individuals known to current Board members through business and other relationships. If the Board is not able to identify qualified candidates in that way, the services of a professional search firm would be used. Mr. Ordan was identified by Board members from his extensive, recent experience leading public companies, including real estate companies, as well as his retailing experience and familiarity with the Trust and current Board members. Until July 2018, Mr. Ordan served as Chief Executive Officer of QCP Properties, Inc., a real estate investment trust focused on post-acute/skilled nursing and memory care/assisted living properties. Our chief executive officer, Mr. Wood served on the board of QCP Properties and on its compensation committee at the same time. As a result of Mr. Wood's service on the QCP Properties compensation committee, Mr. Ordan will not satisfy the requirements to be considered an independent trustee under the NYSE listing standards until August 2021. The Committee and the Board considered this fact and determined that the perspectives Mr. Ordan would bring to the table as a trustee would be very valuable today and outweighed any concerns with his not satisfying the independence requirements of the NYSE until August 2021.

In addition to the annual retainer described above, Mr. Vassalluzzo receives administrative support for both Trust business and personal use from our regional office in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania. There were no additional fees paid or services provided to any Trustee for service on any of the Board committees or for attendance at any Board or committee meetings other than those described above.  The levels of Trustee compensation have remain unchanged since 2017. These levels were set after reviewing board compensation being paid to more than 28 public real estate investment trusts at that time and were determined to be reasonable market compensation based on that information. Total compensation awarded to Trustees for service in 2018 was as follows:

[END TABLE]
Donald C. Wood, Information for Mr. Wood is provided above in "Proposal 1 – Election of Trustees." 
Daniel Guglielmone, Executive Vice President – Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Trust (since August 2016) with responsibility for overseeing the Trust's capital markets, financial reporting, investor relations, corporate communications and East Coast acquisitions; Senior Vice President-Acquisitions & Capital Markets of Vornado Realty Trust (2003 – 2016); Director of the real estate and lodging group in investment banking of Salomon Smith Barney / Citigroup (1993 – 2003) and the retail division of Douglas Elliman Commercial Real Estate (1989 – 1992). 
Dawn M. Becker, Executive Vice President – General Counsel and Secretary (since April 2002) with responsibility for overseeing various of the Trust's corporate functions including the Trust's Legal, Human Resources and Information Technology Departments; and prior to that time, various officer positions with the Trust, including Executive Vice President – Managing Director Mixed Use Operations (2015 – 2016), Executive Vice President – Chief Operating Officer (2010 – 2015) and Vice President–Real Estate and Finance Counsel (2000 – 2002).  PROPOSAL 2 – ADVISORY VOTE ON THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
You are being asked to approve on an advisory basis the compensation of our NEOs as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A"), the Summary Compensation Table, the supplemental tables and the disclosure narratives that follow. This is an opportunity to express your opinion regarding the decisions made by the Compensation Committee on the compensation of our NEOs for 2018; however, it will not affect any compensation already paid or awarded for 2018 and will not be binding on the Compensation Committee, the Board or the Trust. The Board and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our shareholders and will review the results of this vote and take those results into consideration in addressing future compensation policies and decisions. 
As described in more detail below, our compensation packages include base salaries, annual cash incentive compensation, long-term equity incentives and other market appropriate benefits and perquisites. We believe our compensation programs and policies have generally been effective in retaining and motivating our NEOs to achieve superior results for our shareholders but continue to reevaluate those programs in light of changing market conditions. A few highlights of our compensation programs are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A significant portion of our NEOs' compensation is directly linked to our performance and the creation of long-term  shareholder value through long-term incentive awards. The value of these awards is only recognized over a 6-year period that includes a 3-year performance period, an  award date, plus a minimum 3-year vesting period after the award date.  
• The compensation of our NEOs is strongly tied to our performance and to the performance of the individual. The annual  incentive compensation is only paid if we achieve our annual FFO (see definition below in Compensation Discussion and Analysis) per share objective, as confirmed by our Compensation Committee, and long-term incentives are earned on the basis of our  absolute and relative total shareholder returns as well as our return on invested capital.  
• We have an appropriate balance of pay between short-term and long-term objectives.  
• Our NEOs are incentivized to act in the best long-term interests of the Trust through stock ownership guidelines.   
• We have no perquisites for our NEOs that are not widely available to other employees other than as described in the  CD&A and the "Potential Payments on Termination of Employment and Change-in Control" section below.  
[END TABLE]
The affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, is required to approve this proposal. An "abstention" or "broker non-vote" will have no effect on the outcome of the vote for this proposal.

The text of the resolution if Proposal 2 is passed is: 
RESOLVED, that the shareholders of the Trust hereby approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our NEOs as described in the CD&A, the Summary Compensation Table, the supplemental tables and the narrative disclosures accompanying these materials as required by Item 402 of Regulation S-K.  COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the Trust's compensation programs and compensation decisions for our NEOs for 2018. 
2018 Performance Highlights 
The Trust's business plan of delivering long-term sustainable growth through investment in high quality, retail based properties located primarily in major coastal US markets delivered record levels of performance in 2018 including record levels of total revenue, operating income and funds from operations ("FFO")1 per diluted share. These results were achieved in the face of a changing retail landscape and without impacting the prospects for future growth as the Trust approved moving forward with five new development projects that are expected to result in additional investment of nearly $680 million in the next few years and begin adding to the Trust's bottom line in 2021 and beyond. 
The sustained long-term growth in these and other financial metrics reflects the Trust's disciplined approach to investing in and operating its assets and provided the foundation for 2018 to have marked the 51st consecutive year that the Trust increased its dividend to common shareholders, a milestone achieved by only 23 other US public companies and by no other real estate investment trust. 
The ability to achieve these results in the face of a changing consumer and evolving retail real estate landscape was only possible because of the creation and execution of the long-term business plan developed by our Board of Trustees and management team focused on generating increasing streams of cash flow and the creation of long-term value for our shareholders during all kinds of economic cycles. Some of the key components of that business plan include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Income diversification among retail tenants so that no one retailer accounts for more than approximately 3% of our  income in any given year  
• Income diversification through investment in residential and office uses in  mixed-use environments that benefit from a strong retail base  
• Investing and reinvesting in those locations where demand for retail exceeds supply  
• Investing in those retailers who are able to adapt to changing trends to give themselves the best chance for long-term  success, not those retailers whose business models remain unchanged  
• Managing the balance sheet for the long-term including raising capital opportunistically when market conditions are  favorable despite short-term dilution  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
1   FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of a real estate company's operating performance. We follow the  definition of FFO provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") which is included on Appendix A along with a reconciliation of net income to FFO available for common shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
 Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability 
The consideration of environmental and social issues in all aspects of our business from developing and operating our properties to the well-being of our employees is a key part of creating long-term value for our shareholders. The success of our properties and our business is inextricably tied to our properties being embraced by the local community as reflecting the values of that community and on our employees having an environment in which they can thrive personally and professionally. Some of our notable achievements in 2018 include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pike & Rose achieved LEED for Neighborhood Development v2009 Stage 3 Gold certifications – one of only 10  projects to receive such a designation in the United States and one of only 18 projects worldwide. LEED ND designation was developed to inspire and help create better, more sustainable, well connected neighborhoods and to look beyond the scale of  buildings and consider the entire community  
• Recognized as a Green Star leader (4 stars) by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (3rd consecutive year), ranking first among peer companies in Health and Wellness  
• Named to the 2018 Green Lease Leaders Gold Level by the Institute for Market Transformation and U.S. Department of  Energy's Better Building Alliance for high performance leasing practices that drive shared energy savings and sustainability benefits in buildings  
• Opened the largest roof top urban farm in the Mid-Atlantic area producing  approximately 20,000 pounds of produce per year, much of which is sold to residents of the building and neighboring restaurants at the property  
• Received the Alliance for Workplace Excellence Seal of Approval awards for Overall excellence (11th consecutive year), Health and Wellness (11th consecutive year) and Eco Leadership (8th  consecutive year)  
• Lowered the environmental impact of our properties by achieving year over year reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of  11.5% (equivalent to removing 601 cars form the road), electrical usage of 11.4% (enough to power 643 homes for one year) and water consumption of 3% (enough to fill 9 Olympic size swimming pools)  
• Invested approximately $30 million in 24 solar voltaic operating systems that today produce enough solar  electricity to power nearly 1,300 homes annually and avoid nearly 22 million pounds of CO2 emissions  
[END TABLE]
2018 Compensation Highlights 
Some specific decisions and results impacting 2018 compensation for our NEOs include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No base pay increase for any of our NEOs  
• No change in the target compensation levels for any of our NEO's performance based compensation   
• Payout under our annual bonus plan of 125% of target  
• Payout under our long-term incentive plan at 100% of target based on plan results achieving 90% of target payout and the  Compensation Committee exercising the discretion provided under the plan to increase the payout for each of our NEOs to 100%  
• Payment of a supplemental cash bonus to Ms. Becker and Mr. Guglielmone in the amount of $50,000 each   
[END TABLE]
The basic design and performance hurdles under our compensation plans for our NEOs has remained essentially unchanged for 15 years and have been effective during most of that time in tying our NEO compensation to company performance and the creation of shareholder value. However, in three of the past five years, the compensation to our NEOs under our current compensation plans has been flat to declining despite the following notable achievements during that five year period from 2014 through 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Average top-line revenue growth of 7.5% per year  
• Average net income per diluted share growth of 5.3% per year  
• Average FFO per diluted share growth of 7.2% per year, with 2018 being the 9th consecutive year of year over year FFO per diluted share growth, the only public shopping center real estate investment trust to achieve that result  
• Average dividend increases to our common shareholders of 5.5% per year, including the notable accomplishment of being  the only public real estate company to increase common dividends every year for more than 50 years  
• Stabilized more than $950 million in new capital investment that is generating more than $65 million of real estate  value for the Trust after capital  
• Beginning new projects with total projected investment in excess of $1.5 billion that are projected to generate more  than $95 million of real estate value after capital over the next 5-7 years  
[END TABLE]
Despite continuing to deliver record levels of operating results while also investing smartly in ways that promote the long-term future cash flow growth that serves as the foundation of the Trust's business plan, our CEO's compensation for 2018   was essentially flat to 2017 and down 19% and 23% from 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also saw during 2018 two of the Trust's most senior employees, each of whom had been with the company for more than 18 years, accept positions with another public shopping center REIT and receive pay packages with significantly higher overall compensation and significantly higher fixed portions of compensation than they had at the Trust. Given the evidenced increased competition for the Trust's talent as well as overall NEO compensation levels that have been flat to declining despite exceptional company performance, the Board and the Compensation Committee have determined the need to evaluate our compensation programs during 2019 to determine whether they remain effective in retaining and rewarding our NEOs and others throughout the Trust or whether new programs or modifications are needed. To bridge the time until a review of the compensation programs can be completed and to reward our NEOs for delivering yet another year of record results in 2018, the Committee has elected to exercise its discretion permitted under the LTIAP to increase the awards for each of our NEO's to target levels (an increase of approximately 11% for Mr. Wood and Ms. Becker and of 18% for Mr. Guglielmone for total additional awards of $695,000) and to award Ms. Becker and Mr. Guglielmone a supplemental cash bonus of $50,000 each. 
2018 Compensation and Compensation Components 
We provide our NEOs with three primary components of compensation, each of which serves a unique purpose in compensating and rewarding our NEOs and creates alignment between our NEOs and our shareholders. Those primary compensation elements include base salary, annual cash bonus and long-term equity incentives.

              Provides value to attract and retain talented executives 
[END TABLE]
We also provide various health and welfare related benefits to our NEOs that are the same as provided to all of our employees. These benefits are competitive with those offered by companies with whom we compete for talent and provide another tool that allows us to attract and retain talented executives.  Annual Compensation 
Annual compensation for our NEOs is paid in both cash and restricted stock with a significant portion at risk and contingent on achieving either annual or longer term performance goals. The total potential compensation for our named executive officers is established based on the scope of his/her individual responsibilities and contributions to our performance taking into account competitive market compensation paid for similar positions. Our Compensation Committee determines appropriate levels of total compensation for our NEOs by applying their individual understanding, experiences and judgments in the national marketplace of senior level real estate positions and related industry pay in both public and private companies that may compete for our executives while also considering the relative importance of various positions at the Trust given our business plan and organization compared with the business plans of our major competitors. The Compensation Committee also consults compensation surveys prepared for the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT Surveys") to confirm its assessment of appropriate market compensation for our NEOs, reviewing the information reported for each position by the 121 real estate investment trusts ("REITs") that participated in the latest survey as well as by the approximately 25 retail focused REITs that participated in that survey. An individual compensation package is then created for each NEO using a combination of base salary, annual cash bonus and long-term equity incentives to provide the appropriate level of potential total annual compensation and the right balance of fixed versus at-risk compensation. For our CEO, approximately 88% of his total compensation earned for 2018 was "at-risk" and earned based on the level of attainment of our performance goals. Approximately 70% of the total compensation earned for 2018 by our NEOs other than the CEO was at risk. 
Base salary is the only fixed component of the compensation paid to our NEOs annually. Because base salaries are just one component of total pay, we do not target base salaries to any specific level but do confirm that the base salaries for our NEOs are within market parameters using the NAREIT Survey and market knowledge. All base salary decisions for our NEOs are made at the first Compensation Committee meeting of the year and take effect on January 1 of that year. In 2018, none of our NEOs received an increase in base salary.  At Risk Compensation 
A significant portion of the compensation of our NEOs is provided under our Annual Bonus Plan and Long-Term Incentive Award Plan both of which are "at risk" forms of compensation where the amount ultimately earned and paid is dependent on whether the company achieves short-term and longer-term performance objectives set by the Compensation Committee. The performance metrics and target pay for each of these plans is set forth below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Annual Bonus (annual  cash incentive)                     75% Payout:    $6.06 FFO/share

         3 Year Absolute TSR (annualized) (accounts  for 25% of the total award)         Threshold:    8% annualized return 
[END TABLE]
Annual Bonus Plan 
The Annual Bonus Plan is an annual cash incentive program with payment under the plan contingent on the Trust's achieving FFO per diluted share within a range set by the Compensation Committee for that year. The Compensation Committee sets that range to reflect acceptable to exceptional performance in light of our business objectives for the year after a thorough review and discussion of our budget and investor expectations for the year. The Compensation Committee believes that FFO per diluted share is the appropriate measure to use for an annual program because it reflects the impacts of operational decisions, capital allocation decisions and balance sheet management for that year. Target bonus payouts for our NEOs are set as a percentage of the NEO's base salary with the target at 150% of base salary for our CEO and at 75% of base salary for our other NEOs. Our NEOs can earn between 75% to 125% of their annual bonus target depending on where actual FFO per diluted share for the year falls within the range set by the Compensation Committee. The bonus targets for our NEOs as a percentage of base salary were not changed in 2018. The Compensation Committee then determines the final payout to each NEO after evaluating his/her individual performance. The 2018 Annual Bonus calculation for each of our NEOs is set forth below.

       Guglielmone = $356,250              Guglielmone = $445,313 
[END TABLE]
In 2018, we reported FFO per diluted share of $6.23 which resulted in the bonus pool being funded at 125% of target. Based on their individual contributions to the Trust in 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded each of our NEOs the full annual bonus for which he/she was eligible. 
The Annual Bonus plan for our NEOs is the same bonus plan that covers 95% of our employees. Approximately, 30% of our employees who participant in the Annual Bonus plan, including our NEOs, have the option to receive up to 25% of the final   bonus payout in the form of Shares that vest equally over three years with accelerated vesting on death, disability, change in control and termination without cause. In consideration of the extended payment period for this portion of the bonus already earned, the employee receives Shares valued at 120% of the portion of the Annual Bonus he/she elected to receive in Shares. For 2018, Mr. Wood and Ms. Becker each elected to receive 25% of the bonus in Shares and Mr. Guglielmone elected to receive all of his annual bonus in cash. The cash portion of the 2018 annual bonuses is reflected in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column in the Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement. The portion of the Annual Bonus paid in Shares will be included in the "Stock Awards" column in the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table in next year's proxy statement. 
Long-Term Incentive Award Program 
The largest portion of compensation for our NEOs comes from our equity based Long-Term Incentive Award Program. This program aligns the interests of our NEOs with shareholders by incentivizing our NEOs to identify and accomplish longer-term business objectives that generate value through stock price appreciation and dividend growth over a minimum 6-year time horizon comprised of a 3-year performance period followed by a minimum of a 3-year vesting period for shares and a 5-year vesting period for options. 
Awards under this program are made in the form of restricted shares with time based vesting over a three year period; however, each NEO can elect to take up to 50% of his/her award in the form of options which vest over five years. The Compensation Committee believes that allowing NEOs to choose to receive a portion of his/her award in the form of options provides value to the NEO that outweighs any diminution in retention value from the granting of options in lieu of Shares. Each of our NEOs chose to receive the full value of his/her 2018 LTIAP award in Shares. Dividends are paid on all Shares issued under the LTIAP. 
The amount of LTIAP awards is determined based on how well the Trust performs on three performance metrics: 
(a)        Total shareholder return relative to the Bloomberg REIT Shopping Center index ("BBRESHOP"). Performance on this metric accounts for 50% of the total LTIAP award. The relative shareholder return metric reflects how well we have performed for our shareholders as compared to other companies facing the same general market dynamics. The Compensation Committee determined that the BBRESHOP is the best index to use given that it is an industry index made up of primarily companies that own and operate open are shopping centers whose businesses are most closely aligned with ours. Total shareholder return takes into account both stock price appreciation and dividends assuming all dividends are reinvested. 
(b)        Absolute total shareholder return. Performance on this metric accounts for 25% of the total LTIAP award and reflects whether we have actually created value and delivered acceptable returns to our shareholders over the 3-year performance period. Total shareholder return takes into account both stock price appreciation and dividends assuming all dividends are reinvested. 
(c)        Return on invested capital. Performance on this metric accounts for 25% of the total LTIAP award. Return on invested capital reflects how effectively we have allocated our shareholders' capital during that time and incentivizes our executives to make sound, long-term investment decisions that will generate strong future returns to our shareholders. 
The target levels of payout for each of our NEOs in 2018 remained unchanged from prior years with Mr. Wood's target award at $5 million and the target awards for Mr. Guglielmone and Ms. Becker at $900,000 and $600,000, respectively. For Mr. Wood and Ms. Becker, achieving performance at the threshold level of performance entitles him/her to an award equal to 50% of target while performance at stretch entitles him/her to an award at 150% of target. For Mr. Guglielmone, those levels of performance entitle him to an award equal to 67% of target for threshold level performance and 133% of target for stretch level performance. Payout levels are interpolated for results falling between threshold, target and stretch. 
The performance hurdles to be achieved in order for our NEOs to earn compensation under this program based on relative and absolute total return to shareholders have been unchanged since the program was put into place in 2003. The return on invested capital hurdle levels are reset each year to adjust for the impact of acquisitions and other investments made during the previous year.  The levels of performance and target payout percentages for the LTIAP awards for each of our NEOs and the performance actually achieved on each metric for the three year period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 are set forth in the chart below: 
LTIAP Performance Period 2016-2018 Relative Total Return (50%) Percentile 100th 80th 60th 40th Below 40th Payout as% of Target 150% 100% 50% 0% CEO/GC 133% 100% 67% 0% CFO Actual 62nd Absolute Total Return (25%) Return 12% 10% 8% Below 8% Payout as% of Target 150% 100% 50% 0% CEO/GC 133% 100% 67% 0% CFO Actual < 0% Return on Invested Capital (25%) Return 8.00% 7.75% 7.50% Below 7.50% Payout as% of Target 150% 100% 50% 0% CEO/GC 133% 100% 67% 0% CFO Actual 8.09% 
Based on the results achieved, the LTIAP awards for Mr. Wood (CEO) and Ms. Becker (GC) would be paid at 90% of target and the award for Mr. Guglielmone (CFO) would be paid at 85% of his target award. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to increase or decrease the award for each executive by up to 20% to in order to account for personal performance and, as described above, elected to exercise the discretion granted under the program to increase the awards for each of our NEOs to a payout at 100% of target. The Committee last exercised its discretion in 2016 when it reduced Mr. Wood's award. The number of Shares actually awarded to each of our NEOs under the LTIAP is determined by dividing the amount of the award by the closing price of our stock on the NYSE on the date the awards are made. There is no amount included for 2018 in the Summary Compensation Table or Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table in this proxy statement for LTIAP awards earned for the 2016-2018 performance period. The LTIAP awards reflected for 2018 in the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table for our named executive officers in this proxy statement relate to awards made in February 2018 for the 3-year performance period ending December 31, 2017. 
2018 Total Compensation: 
The following chart sets out the compensation earned by each of our named executive officers for 2018 based on company and individual performance for the 1 and 3-year periods ending December 31, 2018:

[END TABLE]
 The amounts set forth above for the annual performance bonus and performance based, long-term equity program differ from the amounts shown for 2018 in the Summary Compensation Table because the chart above reflects the amount earned for the year while the Summary Compensation Table reflects these amounts in the year in which they are paid regardless of the time period during which those amounts were earned. We believe the chart above is helpful because it allows the actual compensation earned for 2018 to be understood in the context of the Trust's financial and other performance for the performance periods ending in 2018. 
Other Benefits 
We provide other health and welfare benefits to our NEOs on the same basis as we provide those benefits to all employees. In addition to those benefits, we provide to Mr. Wood, his spouse and his dependents continuation of health coverage after Mr. Wood's termination upon death, disability, retirement, change in control or otherwise (other than a termination with cause or resignation). This coverage will continue as to Mr. Wood and his spouse until their death, or with respect to his spouse until divorce, if earlier, and coverage continues for three of Mr. Wood's children until each reaches age twenty-five and as to one of the children, until her death. We are required to provide coverage of at least the same level as provided to Mr. Wood and his family at the time of his termination and such coverage will be secondary to certain other coverages that may be available to Mr.  Wood and his family. This agreement has been in place and remained unchanged since 2008. 
Other Compensation Considerations 
Equity Ownership: Each of our NEOs is required to maintain a level of ownership of equity in the company equal to a multiple of the sum of his or her base salary and annual bonus. The required multiples for our named executive officers are 3 times for Mr. Wood and 2.5 times for each of Mr. Guglielmone and Ms. Becker. Each of our NEOs was in compliance with the equity ownership requirement as of December 31, 2018. 
Risk Assessment: As described in the "Risk Management Oversight" section, we have concluded that our compensation programs do not encourage excessive or unnecessary risk taking. During 2018, we adopted a clawback policy allowing the Trust to recoup compensation paid to our NEOs on the basis of incorrect financial statements where that NEO engaged in fraud or grossly negligent misconduct. 
Timing of Equity Grants: Equity awards to our employees under our Annual Bonus Plan and LTIAP described above are made at the Compensation Committee's meeting that occurs in February of each calendar year. Based on our meeting schedule the past several years, these awards are made before we release financial results for the prior fiscal year. We have no policy that times the granting of equity awards relative to the release of material non-public information. Equity awards to new hires are generally made on the first day on which the employee starts work and equity awards to employees who are promoted generally are made on the day on which the promotion has been fully approved. All of our options are awarded at the closing price of our Shares on the NYSE on the date the award is made. The Compensation Committee has never re-priced options, granted options with an exercise price that is less than the closing price on the NYSE on the date of the grant, or granted options which are priced on a date other than the grant date. Equity awards for Vice Presidents and above for the 3-year performance period ending on December 31, 2018 were made at the Compensation Committee's meeting on February 5, 2019 based on the closing price of our Shares on the NYSE on that date. 
Termination and Change-in-Control Arrangements: We have agreements in place with each of our named executive officers providing for various payments and benefits to be made to them if there is a change in control or their employment with us is terminated for certain reasons. The circumstances in which payments may be made and the potential amounts of those payments are described in more detail in the "Potential Payments on Termination of Employment and Change-in-Control" section below. We believe that the payments provided for in these agreements are reasonable and appropriate as part of the total compensation packages available for our named executive officers. 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation in Excess of $1.0 Million: For tax years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally prohibited any publicly held corporation from taking a federal income tax deduction for compensation in excess of $1 million in any taxable year paid to an executive officer who is named in the Summary Compensation Table. An exception was made for qualified performance-based compensation, among other things. Although the Compensation Committee considered the impact of Section 162(m) in structuring compensation programs, the Committee's primary focus was on creating programs that addressed the needs and objectives of the company regardless of the impact of Section 162(m). As a result, the Compensation Committee made awards and structured programs that were non-deductible under Section 162(m).  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 modified Section 162(m) to, among other things, modify who is subject to the $1 million deduction limit and to eliminate the exception for performance based pay from the $1 million deduction limit starting with tax years ending after December 31, 2017. We do not anticipate these changes to Section 162(m) to have a material impact on us. We do not anticipate anyone other than our three NEOs being subject to the $1 million deduction limit and we anticipate our taxable income to only increase modestly on an annual basis as a result of the loss of the performance based compensation deduction. To maintain our status as a real estate investment trust, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders in the form of dividends. The modest increase in taxable income resulting from the change in Section 162(m) will be taken into account as our Board determines the amount of dividend to be paid to our shareholders in tax years ending after December 31, 2017.

 NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION TABLE 
We maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that is open to participation by 39 members of our management team, including our NEOs. Each participant can elect to defer up to 100% of his or her base salary and cash payment under our Annual Bonus Plan with deferral elections made in December of each year for amounts to be earned in the following year. A number of widely available investment options are made available to each plan participant who then decides how to allocate amounts deferred among those investment options. The amount earned by plan participants on their deferrals is calculated by our third party plan administrator as if the amounts deferred had actually been invested in the investment options selected by each participant. We do not make any contributions to the deferred compensation plan for any individual nor do we guaranty any rate of return on amounts deferred. Amounts deferred into the plan, including amounts earned on the deferrals, are generally payable to the participant shortly after he or she retires or is otherwise no longer employed by us; however, there are a few other alternatives where amounts may be paid to a participant sooner. The amounts deferred by Ms. Becker and Mr. Wood into the plan in 2018, the earnings on plan investments in 2018 and aggregate withdrawals and distributions made in 2018 are described below. Mr. Guglielmone does not participate in our deferred compensation plan.

 AUDIT INFORMATION 
[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL 3 – NON-BINDING RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Shareholders are being asked to ratify in a non-binding vote the selection of Grant Thornton, LLP ("GT") as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Although shareholder ratification of GT is not required by our governance documents, the Board is submitting the selection of GT to shareholders to solicit shareholder views on our selection of GT as our independent registered public accounting firm. GT has served in this role since 2002 and the Board believes it is in the best interests of the Trust and our shareholders for GT to continue in this role. If the selection of GT is not ratified, the Audit Committee may (but will not be required to) reconsider whether to retain GT. Even if the selection of GT is ratified, the Audit Committee may change the appointment of GT at any time if it determines such a change would be in the best interests of the Trust and our shareholders. 
A representative of GT will be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to answer appropriate questions from shareholders. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, is required to approve this proposal. An "abstention" or "broker non-vote" will have no effect on the outcome of the vote for this proposal. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The following Report of the Audit Committee does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other Trust filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except to the extent the Trust specifically incorporates this Report by reference therein. 
The Audit Committee is made up entirely of trustees who meet all independence requirements under the SEC and NYSE and have the requisite financial competence to serve on the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee meets at least quarterly and operates pursuant to a written charter that is reviewed at least every three years. That charter can be accessed under the Investors section of our website at www.federalrealty.com. In 2018, the Audit Committee met four times and each meeting included an executive session with the Trust's independent registered public accounting firm and no members of management present. 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, retention and oversight of GT, the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit the Trust's financial statements, and also oversees management, including its internal audit firm, in their performance of its financial functions. Specifically, management is responsible for the financial reporting process, including the system of internal controls, for the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and for reporting on internal control over financial reporting. Management uses Pricewaterhouse Coopers, LLC ("PwC") to provide its internal audit function, including oversight of the ongoing testing of the effectiveness of our internal controls. GT is responsible for auditing the consolidated financial statements of the Trust and expressing an opinion on the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. 
During 2018, as part of its oversight function, the Audit Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Ø    Reviewed and discussed with management and GT, individually and collectively, all annual and quarterly financial  statements and operating results prior to their issuance;  
  Ø    Discussed with GT matters required to be discussed pursuant to applicable audit standards, including the reasonableness  of judgments and the clarity and completeness of financial disclosures;  
  Ø    Reviewed and discussed with GT and PwC, individually and collectively, the ongoing assessment and testing of the  Trust's systems of internal controls and procedures;  
  Ø    Discussed with GT matters relating to GT's independence from the Trust and received written confirmation from GT  that GT is not aware of any relationships that, in their professional judgment may impair their independence; and  
  Ø    Monitored the non-audit services provided by GT to ensure that performance of  such services did not adversely impact GT's independence.  
[END TABLE]
Based on the Audit Committee's reviews and discussions with GT, PwC and management, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Trustees that the Board approve the inclusion of our audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. 
Submitted by the Audit Committee:

As required by its charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving in advance all audit and permissible non-audit services to be provided by GT to the Trust. The Audit Committee approves such services only after concluding that the provision of these services would not affect the independence of GT. The Audit Committee approved all audit services provided by GT in 2018 and has pre-approved GT providing the following permissible non-audit services in 2019 up to specified maximum amounts that are consistent with prior years: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Ø    Issuance of comfort letters and consent for capital markets transactions  
  Ø    Tax planning and other consultation for purposes of structuring investment or financing opportunities as well as  consultation associated with financial reporting matters

Annual Meeting and Voting 
You are receiving these materials because you owned our Shares as of March 14, 2019, the record date established by our Board of Trustees for our Annual Meeting. Everyone who owned our Shares as of this date, whether directly as a registered shareholder or indirectly through a broker or other nominee, is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. We had 74,607,212 Shares outstanding on March 14, 2019. A majority of the Shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting must be present in person or by proxy for us to proceed with the Annual Meeting. 
If you own your Shares directly with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer and Trust, LLC, you are a registered shareholder and can vote either in person at the Annual Meeting or by proxy without attending the Annual Meeting through one of the following methods: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Visit www.voteproxy.com. You will need the control number on your Notice of Internet Availability, proxy card or voting  instruction form. Votes must be submitted by 11:59 pm EDT on April 30, 2019 to be counted for the meeting.     Call 1-800-Proxies (1-800-776-9437). You will need the control number on your Notice of Internet Availability, proxy card or voting instruction form. Votes must be submitted by 11:59 pm  EDT on April 30, 2019 to be counted for the meeting.    You can vote my marking, signing and dating your proxy card. 
[END TABLE]
For those of you holding your Shares indirectly in an account at a bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or nominee, you are a beneficial owner of Shares held in "street name". You will receive all proxy materials directly from your bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or nominee and you must either direct them as to how to vote your Shares or obtain from them a proxy to vote at the Annual Meeting. Please refer to the notice of internet availability of proxy materials or the voter instruction form used by your bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or nominee for specific instructions on methods of voting. If you fail to give your bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or nominee specific instructions on how to vote your Shares with respect to Items 1 and 2, your vote will NOT be counted for those matters. It is important for every shareholder's vote to be counted on these matters so we encourage you to provide your bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or nominee with voting instructions. If you fail to give your bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or nominee specific instructions on how to vote your Shares on Item 3, your bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or nominee will generally be able to vote on Item 3 as he, she or it determines. 
If you do not vote your Shares, your Shares will not be counted and we may not be able to hold the Annual Meeting. We encourage you to vote by proxy using one of the methods described above even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person so that we will know as soon as possible whether enough votes will be present. 
Shareholders can access this Proxy Statement, our Annual Report and our other filings with the SEC on the Investors page of our website at www.federalrealty.com. A copy of our Annual Report, including the financial statements and financial statement schedules ("Form 10-K") is being provided to shareholders along with this Proxy Statement. The Form 10-K includes certain exhibits, which we will provide to you only upon request addressed to Investor Relations at 1626 East Jefferson Street, Rockville, Maryland 20852. The request must be accompanied by payment of a fee to cover our reasonable expenses for copying and mailing the Form 10-K. 
In the future, if you wish to receive paper copies of our proxy materials, without charge, and are a registered shareholder, you may do so by written request addressed to American Stock Transfer and Trust, LLC. For those of you holding Shares indirectly in "street name", you must write your bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or nominee, to obtain paper copies. Any election you make on how to receive your proxy materials will remain in effect for all future annual meetings until you revoke it. 
The SEC's rules permit us to deliver a single Notice or single set of Annual Meeting materials to one address shared by two or more of our shareholders unless we have received contrary instructions from shareholders. This procedure, referred to as "householding", reduces the volume of duplicate information shareholders receive and can result in significant savings on   mailing and printing costs. To take advantage of this opportunity, only one Notice, Proxy Statement and Annual Report is being delivered to multiple shareholders who share a single address, unless any shareholder residing at that address gave contrary instructions. If any shareholder sharing an address with another shareholder wants to receive a separate copy of this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report or wishes to receive a separate proxy statement and annual report in the future, or receives multiple copies of the proxy statement and Annual Report and wishes to receive a single copy, the shareholder should provide such instructions by calling our Investor Relations Department at (800) 937-5449, by writing to Investor Relations at 1626 East Jefferson Street, Rockville, Maryland 20852, or by sending an e-mail to Investor Relations at IR@federalrealty.com. 
Questions regarding the Notice or voting should be directed to our Investor Relations Department at (800) 937-5449 or by email at IR@federalrealty.com. 
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES, SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS AND OTHER MATTERS 
The Board of Trustees is soliciting your proxy to vote on matters that will be presented at our Annual Meeting and the cost of this solicitation of proxies will be borne by us. We may solicit proxies through the mail, Internet, in person and by telephone or facsimile, and may request brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward soliciting materials to the beneficial owners of Shares and reimburse them for their reasonable expenses. We may also hire a proxy solicitation firm at a standard industry compensation rate. The Trustees know of no other business to be presented at the Annual Meeting. If other matters properly come before the meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote on them in their discretion. 
Proposals of shareholders intended to be presented at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, including nominations for persons for election to the Board of Trustees, must be received by us no later than November 23, 2019 to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to such meeting. 
You are urged to vote either by telephone (1-800-PROXIES or 1-800-776-9437) or on the Internet (www.voteproxy.com) by following the instructions on your Notice. For those of you who have elected email delivery, please follow the instructions for voting provided in the email.

     APPENDIX A – FUNDS FROM  OPERATIONS 
     APPENDIX A – FUNDS FROM  OPERATIONS 
[END TABLE]
The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines FFO as follows: net income, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate. We compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, and we have historically reported our FFO available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities. We consider FFO available for common shareholders a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as implied by the historical cost convention of GAAP and the recording of depreciation. We use FFO primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other REITs. 
The reconciliation of net income to FFO available for common shareholders is as follows:
