Voting Information and Board Voting Recommendation
In accordance with Minnesota law, directors are elected by a plurality of votes cast. The seven nominees receiving the highest number of votes will be elected. If any nominee is unable to serve as a director, the Board may act to reduce the number of directors or the persons named in the proxies may vote for the election of such substitute nominee as the Board may propose. It is intended that proxies will be voted for such nominees in the latter circumstance. The proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than seven.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" EACH NOMINEE LISTED.
Other Information Regarding the Board
Meetings and Independence. The Board met five times during fiscal year 2018. All of the current directors attended at least 75% of the number of Board meetings and meetings of Board committees on which he or she served that were held during fiscal year 2018. Our policy is that all directors should attend the Annual Meeting and all of the directors who were serving at the time of the prior annual meeting of shareholders, which was held in February 2018, did so.
Independence determinations concerning the Board are made by the Governance and Nominating Committee and, with regard to related party transactions, by the Audit Committee. The Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board has determined that Messrs. Anderson, Johnson, Martinez, Schrock and Yu and Ms. Steinel are independent, as defined by the applicable rules for companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Dr. Graves is not independent due to his service as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In making the independence determination with respect to related party transactions during fiscal year 2018, the Audit Committee considered the following, with regard to Mr. Anderson that the Company sold less than $20,000 in goods and services to Modine Manufacturing Company; Mr. Martinez that the Company sold less than $5,000 in goods and services to AAR Corp; and Mr. Schrock that the Company sold less than $5,000 in goods and services to the Atkore International Group, Inc., sold less than $275,000 in goods and services to The University of St. Thomas School of Engineering, purchased less than $275,000 in goods and services from Plexus Corporation, and sold less than $5,000,000 in goods and services to Plexus Corporation. The Audit Committee determined that the aggregate dollar amounts of the transactions are below the threshold for the Nasdaq Stock Market independence rules and/or that the transactions do not present a real, potential or perceived conflict between the Company's interests and the direct or indirect interests of Messrs. Anderson, Martinez and Schrock, as applicable.
Board Committees. Each of our three standing committees operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. These charters are available to shareholders on our website at www.mts.com (select "Investor Relations" and click on "Corporate Governance").
The Audit Committee of the Board, composed of Mr. Johnson (Chair), Ms. Steinel and Messrs. Anderson, and Martinez, held seven meetings during fiscal year 2018. All members of the Audit Committee during fiscal year 2018 satisfied the Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards for Audit Committee membership. The Board determined that Ms. Steinel and Messrs. Anderson, Johnson and Martinez are each an "audit committee financial expert" under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Among other duties, the Audit Committee:
A report of the Audit Committee is contained in this proxy statement.
The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of the Board, composed of Mr. Schrock (Chair) and Messrs. Johnson and Martinez, held five meetings during fiscal year 2018. All members of the Compensation Committee are independent directors as defined by the rules applicable to companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and are "non-employee directors" as that term is defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Among other duties, the Compensation Committee:
A report of the Compensation Committee is contained in this proxy statement.
The Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board, composed of Ms. Steinel (Chair) and Messrs. Schrock and Yu, held four meetings in fiscal year 2017. All members are independent directors as defined by the rules applicable to companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Among other duties, the Governance and Nominating Committee:
Director Nomination Process. In identifying prospective director candidates, the Governance and Nominating Committee (for purposes of this Director Nomination Process sub-section, the "Committee") considers recommendations from shareholders and recommendations from business and professional sources, including executive search firms.
In evaluating director candidates, the Committee believes that all members of the Board should have personal and professional integrity, an absence of conflicts of interest and an ability to understand and respect the advisory and proactive oversight responsibility of the Board. In addition, all non-employee members of the Board should meet independence requirements, comply with director orientation and education guidelines, commit sufficient time to attend Board and committee meetings and fully perform the duties of a director.
In addition to these threshold criteria, the Committee also considers the contributions a candidate is expected to make to the collective functioning of the Board. The Committee seeks directors who will contribute to the Board in areas such as strategy and policy development, technology and engineering, human capital development, financial expertise, international business development and best practices, industrial business value creation, acquisition expertise and public company chief executive officer perspective.
Candidates are expected to effectively perform the role of a director by demonstrating broad perspectives and an inquiring mind, being well prepared for and actively participating in Board and committee meetings, contributing expertise to the Board and committees, listening well, expressing views candidly, applying experience and expertise, being respectful of others and appropriately representing the shareholders.
While it does not have a specific written policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, the Committee believes the Board should reflect a variety of opinions, perspectives, personal and professional experiences and backgrounds. The goal is to have a balanced and diverse Board, with members whose skills, backgrounds and experiences will enhance the quality of the Board's deliberations and decisions and cover the spectrum of areas that impact the Company's business. Each member of the Board should contribute to the overall Board composition, with the goal of creating a diverse Board that works collaboratively to guide the success of the Company and represent shareholder interests.
The Committee's policy is to consider qualified candidates for positions on the Board who are recommended in writing by shareholders. Shareholders wishing to recommend candidates for Board membership rather than directly nominating an individual should submit the written recommendations to our Secretary at least 90 days prior to the date corresponding to the date of the previous year's annual meeting of shareholders, with the submitting shareholder's name, address and pertinent information about the proposed nominee. See "Other Information – Shareholder Proposals" for additional information regarding the submission of candidates for Board membership in the event of a change in the annual meeting date from the previous year.
A shareholder intending to nominate an individual as a director at an annual meeting of shareholders, rather than recommend the individual to the Committee for consideration as a nominee, must comply with the advance notice requirements set forth in our Bylaws. Our Bylaws provide that any shareholder entitled to vote generally in the election of directors may nominate one or more persons for election as directors provided that such shareholder has provided written notice of such intention to our Secretary. Such notice must be given not fewer than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the date corresponding to the date of the previous year's annual meeting of shareholders, except in certain circumstances, and must contain certain required information about the nominee.
Shareholders wishing to recommend for nomination or nominate a director should contact the Company's Secretary for a copy of the relevant procedure and the criteria considered by the Committee when evaluating potential new directors or the continued service of existing directors.
Board Leadership Structure. Our Board leadership structure currently includes a non-executive Chairman of the Board and a separate Chief Executive Officer. The Board has not adopted a policy of separateness and will periodically re-evaluate its leadership structure.
The primary role of our Chief Executive Officer is to manage the business affairs of the Company and the primary role of our Chairman is to preside over all Board activities and ensure the effectiveness of the Board in all aspects of its areas of responsibility. This role includes working with the Chief Executive Officer to set the Board agenda; ensuring that clear, accurate and timely information is provided to the Board; managing Board meetings to allow time for discussion of complex or difficult issues; and promoting active participation by all Board members. The Chairman may also assist the Chief Executive Officer in managing the Company's relationships with investors and other external stakeholders.
The Board has determined that the separation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles is appropriate for the Company at this time because it enables the Chief Executive Officer to focus more closely on the day-to-day operations of the Company. The Board also values the involvement of Mr. Anderson as a leader and, through his service as Chairman, benefits more directly from his extensive industry and executive experience than it would if he did not hold such position.
Board Role in Risk Management Oversight. Management is responsible for designing and implementing the Company's day-to-day risk management processes, controls and oversight. The Board, as a whole and through its committees, has broad responsibility for the oversight of risk management. The Board has the responsibility to satisfy itself that risk management processes and controls are adequate and functioning as designed and that Company business is conducted in compliance with proper governance procedures and applicable laws and regulations. The Board views risk in the context of major strategic and operational decisions relative to the anticipated benefits. The Board recognizes that it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk because purposeful and appropriate risk taking is essential for the Company to be competitive and to achieve its performance goals.
The Board believes the Company has good internal processes, controls and resources to identify, manage and mitigate risk, including a robust code of conduct and the compliance oversight role held by the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. As a critical part of its risk management oversight role, the Board encourages full, open and ongoing communication with management. The Board regularly engages in discussions with management on strategic, operational and governance matters to ensure that processes and controls are in place so risks are identified, managed and mitigated in a timely fashion.
The Board implements its risk management oversight function both as a whole and through committees. Much of the work is delegated to various committees, which meet regularly and report back to the full Board. All committees have significant roles in carrying out the risk management oversight function. The chair of each committee provides a committee report at each Board meeting that enables the Board to fulfill its risk management oversight responsibilities. Since risk management oversight is an ongoing process and inherent in the Company's strategic and operational decisions, the Board also discusses risk in relation to specific proposed actions.
Each committee is comprised entirely of independent directors and is responsible for overseeing risks associated with its respective area of responsibility.

The Compensation Committee:
The Governance and Nominating Committee:
A separate discussion regarding the risk considerations in our compensation programs, including the processes that have been put in place by the Compensation Committee and management to identify, manage and mitigate potential risks in compensation, can be found on page 22 of this proxy statement.
Communications with the Board. The Board provides a process for shareholders to communicate with its members. The manner in which shareholders may send communications to the Board is set forth on our website at www.mts.com (select "Investor Relations" and click on "Corporate Governance").
Board Evaluation. The Governance and Nominating Committee leads the Board in an annual evaluation of its performance as a board of directors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board annually evaluate its performance to determine whether the Board, its committees and its individual members are functioning effectively.
Code of Conduct. We adhere to a code of ethics, known as the "MTS Code of Conduct." It applies to our directors, officers, employees and contractors. The MTS Code of Conduct sets forth guidelines for ensuring that all personnel act in accordance with the highest standards of integrity. The MTS Code of Conduct, as well as any waivers from and amendments to it, are posted on our website at www.mts.com (select "Investor Relations" and click on "Corporate Governance").
Non-Employee Director Compensation
The table below reflects the cash compensation for annual service during fiscal year 2018 to our non-employee directors:
Upon election or re-election to the Board at each of our annual meetings of shareholders, the directors receive an annual grant of restricted stock units under our 2017 Stock Incentive Plan with the number of shares equal to the amounts set forth in the table below. The annual restricted stock unit award will vest on the one year anniversary of the date of grant.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name   Fiscal                                           Year 2018 Award                                           Amount     Calculation

[END TABLE]
If a non-employee director is appointed to the Board prior to the annual meeting of shareholders, the non-employee director may receive a pro-rated restricted stock unit award depending upon, among other factors, the length of time until the next annual meeting of shareholders. If a non-employee director resigns, retires or otherwise terminates his or her service as a director, a pro-rata portion of any restricted stock units held by such director shall vest prior to the date that the restrictions would otherwise vest.
Non-employee directors are also reimbursed for travel expenses to Board meetings.
Non-employee directors are also eligible to participate in the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and may elect to defer up to 100% of the director's fees we pay in cash and to defer the settlement of up to 100% of the restricted stock unit awards that they are eligible to receive. At the time of the deferral election, participants must select a distribution date and form of distribution. The plan provides for the crediting of dividend equivalents on such deferred settlement restricted stock units and for the crediting of interest on cash amounts (deferred director fees and dividend equivalents amounts) that are credited to a participant's deferred account. The interest rate utilized is approved by the Compensation Committee in November of each year for the following calendar year. Historically, the ten-year government treasury note rate as of the first business day of the calendar year has been used. The interest rate for calendar year 2018 was 2.46%. For fiscal year 2018, Ms. Straub elected to defer 100% of her director's fees and settlement of 100% of her restricted stock unit grant and associated dividend equivalents paid on such grant, and each of Mr. Johnson and Ms. Steinel elected to defer settlement of 100% of his or her respective restricted stock unit grant and associated dividend equivalents paid on such grant. Earnings on the deferred compensation accounts (dividend equivalents and interest credits) do not represent above-market or preferential earnings.
The table below shows cash compensation earned by non-employee directors for fiscal year 2018 and either paid in cash or deferred at the election of the director as described above. The table also shows the dollar amounts recognized by us for financial statement reporting purposes during fiscal year 2018 for restricted stock unit awards granted for service during fiscal year 2018.

PROPOSAL 2
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OFINDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
THIS SECTION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTIONWITH THE "AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT" BELOW.
KPMG LLP ("KPMG"), an independent registered public accounting firm, has been our independent registered public accounting firm since May 31, 2002. The Audit Committee has selected KPMG to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm and to serve as auditors for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2019. Shareholder ratification of the appointment is requested. Consistent with our Audit Committee Charter and the requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market, the ratification of the appointment of independent auditors by the shareholders will in no manner impinge upon or detract from the authority and power of the Audit Committee to appoint, retain, oversee and, if necessary, disengage the independent auditors. In the event the appointment of KPMG is not ratified by the shareholders, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment.
Representatives of KPMG are expected to be present at the virtual Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Fees and Services
The following table presents aggregate fees for professional services rendered by KPMG in fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017 for the audit of our annual financial statements and for other services.
The amounts in the table include out-of-pocket expenses incurred by KPMG. The Audit Committee pre-approved all non-audit services described in the table. The Audit Committee has determined that the provision of the services identified in the table is compatible with maintaining the independence of KPMG.
Pre-Approval Policy
The Audit Committee's current practice on pre-approval of services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm is to require pre-approval of all audit services and permissible non-audit services. The Audit Committee reviews each non-audit service to be provided and assesses the impact of the service on the firm's independence. In addition, the Audit Committee has delegated authority to grant certain pre-approvals to the Audit Committee Chair. Pre-approvals granted by the Audit Committee Chair are reported to the full Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
Board Voting Recommendation
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THERATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee is currently composed of four directors who are independent, as defined by the applicable rules for companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, a copy of which is available to shareholders on our website at www.mts.com (select "Investor Relations" and click on "Corporate Governance").
Management is responsible for preparing the financial statements, establishing and maintaining the system of internal controls over the financial reporting processes, and assessing the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements and internal controls in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States and for issuing reports on such audit. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes.
Management has represented to the Audit Committee that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the Audit Committee has reviewed and extensively discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and KPMG, our independent registered public accounting firm.
In reviewing our fiscal year 2018 audited consolidated financial statements, the Audit Committee discussed with KPMG matters required to be discussed by the applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Standards. In addition, the Audit Committee received from the independent registered public accounting firm the written disclosures required by the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and discussed with them their independence from us and our management. The Audit Committee determined that the tax services provided to our Company by our independent registered public accounting firm are compatible with the independent registered public accounting firm's independence.
Based upon the Audit Committee's discussions with management and KPMG and the Audit Committee's review of the representations of management and the reports of KPMG, the Audit Committee recommended that the Board include the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended `September 29, 2018.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) explains the compensation programs for our Named Executive Officers (NEOs) and the oversight by the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee (for purposes of this CD&A, the Committee) in setting executive pay for fiscal year 2018. This CD&A should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures that follow this CD&A.
Our fiscal year 2018 Named Executive Officers are:
This CD&A is organized into the following sections:
Executive Summary
We consider our executive pay program to be instrumental in helping us achieve our business objectives and effective in rewarding our overall financial and operational performance.
Our overarching philosophy is that we should structure executive pay to be consistent with market competitive practices and to align the long-term interests of our executive officers, shareholders, and customers so that pay appropriately reflects the executive officers' performance. We believe that a significant portion of an executive officer's pay should be at risk in the form of performance-based incentive awards that are only paid if performance targets are met.
The Committee leverages the following best practices in designing, administering and governing our executive compensation programs:
The primary components of our fiscal year 2018 executive compensation program consisted of base salary, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives, as summarized in the following table, along with the Committee's decisions for fiscal year 2018:

The following chart shows the relative weighting of target pay across these three components for fiscal year 2018:
Say-on-Pay Results
At our annual shareholder meeting in February 2018, our shareholders continued to show strong support of our executive pay program, with 98.1 percent of the votes approving the say-on-pay resolution.
The Committee believes this result affirms our shareholders' continuing support of the Committee's approach to executive pay. Thus, the Committee made only nonsubstantive changes to executive pay for fiscal year 2018. We continue to solicit and accept shareholder feedback regarding our compensation programs, and take this input into consideration along with market trends and our business environment, both internal and external.
Our Compensation Process
Independent Compensation Consultant
Under the Committee's charter, the Committee has the authority to select, retain and compensate executive compensation consultants and other advisors as it deems necessary to carry out its responsibilities. For fiscal year 2018, the Committee engaged Willis Towers Watson to provide information regarding compensation of our executive officers. Specifically, Willis Towers Watson was asked by the Committee to:
Determining Competitive Compensation
The Committee works with Willis Towers Watson to analyze competitive market data to determine appropriate base salary levels, short-term incentive target pay, and long-term incentive grant values for all of our executive officers. When making comparisons to the market data, the Committee generally seeks to establish compensation levels that approximate the market median.
With respect to our CEO's pay, the Committee conducts an annual performance assessment of the CEO and determines appropriate adjustments to all elements of his pay based on his individual performance and the Company's performance. The Committee recommends CEO pay to the Board for approval. The CEO does not participate in these Committee deliberations and does not vote on Board matters concerning CEO pay.
For other executive officers, the CEO makes recommendations to the Committee for all elements of pay based on individual and Company performance and market data. The Committee reviews, discusses, modifies, and approves the recommendations, as appropriate.
Market Data Sources and Analysis
The Committee annually assesses "competitive market" compensation for each element of executive compensation using a number of sources. A primary source is our peer group and the related data provided by Willis Towers Watson. In determining our peer group, we recognize that many of our direct competitors are either privately-owned companies, or divisions of much larger, more diversified, public companies. However, by considering relevant industries (e.g., industrial, manufacturing, engineering and electrical components) and size parameters (e.g., revenue, earnings and market capitalization) we developed the following list of peer companies:
John Bean Technologies Corporation
In addition to the data from these peer companies, market competitive data was obtained from the 2017 Willis Towers Watson Compensation DataBank Survey and the 2017 Willis Towers Watson Compensation Survey Report for companies with less than $1 billion in revenue.
The Committee does not have a set policy or formula for weighting the elements of compensation (i.e., base salary, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives) for each executive officer. Instead, the Committee considers market factors relevant to each executive officer and their tenure, role within the Company and contributions to the Company's performance. In general, as executive officers assume greater responsibility, a larger portion of their total cash compensation is payable as short-term cash incentive, which is variable based on performance, as opposed to base salary and a larger portion of their total direct compensation comes in the form of long-term equity incentives.
Components of Pay
Fiscal Year 2018 Base Salaries
The Committee reviews executive officer base salaries annually and may choose to make adjustments. The following table outlines fiscal year 2018 base salary increases for our NEOs as approved by the Committee:
Fiscal Year 2018 Short-Term Incentives
Under the EVC Plan, all of the NEOs employed by the Company at the end of fiscal year 2018, other than Mr. Hore, were eligible for cash payments as determined based upon our financial performance as compared to set performance standards. Mr. Hore does not participate under the EVC Plan because the Hore Employment Agreement provides that payment of any bonus to him is at the sole discretion of the Board.
The following table shows the fiscal year 2018 target incentive opportunity for the EVC Plan:

[END TABLE]
The following diagram shows the fiscal year 2018 EVC Plan Metrics and Weightings for our NEOs:
2018 EVC Plan Metrics and Weightings for
Named Executive Officers
For Dr. Graves and Mr. Ross, all performance metrics, Leverage Ratio, revenue and EPS, were based on total Company performance. For Messrs. Becker and Harrison, the Leverage Ratio performance metric was based on total Company performance, while the revenue performance metric was based upon achievement of financial targets for the Test and Simulation segment. In lieu of an EPS metric for Messrs. Becker and Harrison, a performance metric of EBIT was used, which was also based on achievement of financial targets for the Test and Simulation segment. The Committee established these revenue and EBIT goals based on segment (rather than total Company) performance for these executive officers to reflect their accountability for the performance of that segment. The Committee believes that the leader of the segment has a meaningful opportunity to directly impact the achievement of the performance goals through his individual performance as the leader of that segment.
The Committee established minimum, target and maximum levels of achievement for each of the performance metrics, as shown in the following table:
The Committee believes that the EPS and EBIT performance goals provide a strong link between the EVC Plan and shareholder value, and therefore, if the target level of EPS or EBIT achievement, as applicable, is not met, participants are limited to target payouts under the EVC Plan regardless of the results of other performance goals.
Based on the results for fiscal year 2018, the payouts to each NEO, other than Mr. Hore, under the EVC Plan by performance goal were calculated as follows based upon their respective fiscal year 2018 base salaries:
Mr. Hore does not participate in the EVC Plan, so he also did not qualify for a payout under the EVC Plan. However, taking into consideration the performance of the Sensors segment, the Committee decided to provide Mr. Hore a discretionary bonus of $107,100 for fiscal year 2018.
Fiscal Year 2018 Long-Term Incentives
The long-term incentives (LTIs) granted to each NEO in fiscal year 2018 consisted of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), and performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs), according to the following mix:
2018 LTI Type Mix(% of total grant dollar value)

[END TABLE]
The fiscal year 2018 LTIs are summarized for each NEO in the following table (except as noted below, all LTIs were granted in April 2018):
In determining the number of stock options to grant, 25% of the aggregate value of the award is divided by the average of the Black Scholes values over the 90 days prior to the end of the fiscal year. This methodology, versus determining the number of stock options to grant based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, better represents the value of our equity over a period of time prior to the date of the award and signals that pay realized from stock option grants will be more sensitive to future stock price appreciation and less sensitive to past stock price volatility. In determining the number of RSUs and PRSUs to grant, 25% and 50%, respectively, of the aggregate value of the award is divided by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.
The table below sets forth the threshold, target and maximum levels for the three-year average Adjusted ROIC performance goal for the performance period of fiscal year 2016 through fiscal year 2018 as well as the actual achievement of that performance goal and the percentage of the target level of that achievement.
The payout for the PRSUs granted on December 9, 2015 was calculated as follows based upon fiscal years 2016 through 2018 performance.

Other Compensation and Policies
Benefits and Perquisites
Our executive officers are provided retirement and health benefits that are generally available to our other salaried employees, including:
Our executive officers, other than Mr. Hore, are eligible to participate in our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which allows us to provide non-qualified retirement benefits that are identical to the tax-qualified benefits but on income above the allowable level of qualified plans.
We provide limited executive perquisites, based upon competitive market data and, in the case of physical examinations, to promote vitality and succession in the executive team, including:
Executive Compensation Clawback Policy
The EVC Plan, the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan) and the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) include clawback provisions. The provisions require an executive officer to forfeit and allow us to recoup from the executive officer any payments or benefits received by the executive officer under the EVC Plan, the 2011 Plan or the 2017 Plan under certain circumstances, such as certain restatements of our financial statements, termination of employment for cause, violation of the MTS Code of Conduct and breach of an agreement between us and the executive officer.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
To align our executive officers' interests with our shareholders' interests, the Committee expects our executive officers to acquire significant equity ownership in the Company. Accordingly, we have adopted stock ownership guidelines requiring each executive officer to achieve an equity ownership level equal to a specified multiple of his or her base salary within five years of being appointed as an executive officer or within five years of a change in executive officer status resulting in an increased required level of ownership.
The current minimum equity ownership levels as a multiple of base pay are as follows:
The policy requires that our executive officers hold equity acquired through our equity compensation plans in a minimum amount of 75% of the net shares acquired (net of taxes) until ownership levels are met. The policy also provides that failure by a participant to meet the required ownership level within the time period established will result in a requirement that such participant retain 100% of the net shares acquired (net of taxes) through our equity compensation programs until ownership levels are met.
Our independent directors also have a guideline for achieving significant equity ownership. Our independent directors are expected to achieve ownership of our common stock equal to a minimum of five times their annual cash retainer.
The Committee reviews the progress of our executive officers toward the ownership guidelines on a regular basis and has determined that all of the executive officers are on track for meeting the ownership guidelines within the established timeframes.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Performance Metrics
Below is information on how we calculate target levels and actual results for certain metrics discussed above:
Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Report
The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee has discussed and reviewed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis set forth above with management. Based upon this review and discussion, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

Risk Considerations in Our Compensation Programs
In fiscal year 2018, management and the Compensation Committee continued to focus on responsible pay practices designed to produce positive results for the Company and its shareholders without encouraging excessive or inappropriate risk-taking. The Compensation Committee's analysis identified the following components of our compensation programs that it believes effectively reduce risk without reducing incentives:
Based on the Company's use of these programmatic safeguards and on the Compensation Committee's continued review of the Company's incentive compensation policies and practices for all of the Company's worldwide locations, the Compensation Committee concluded in fiscal year 2018 that any risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Conflict of Interest Analysis
Our Compensation Committee has considered the relationships that its independent compensation consultants have had with the Company, the members of the Compensation Committee and our executive officers, as well as the policies that the consultants have in place to maintain their independence and objectivity and has determined that the work performed by its compensation consultants has raised no conflicts of interest.

Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2018
As reflected in the table below, the named executive officers received four types of plan-based awards for their service in fiscal year 2018: a cash award under the EVC Plan, payable in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019; stock options granted on April 17, 2018 under the 2017 Plan; RSUs granted on April 17, 2018 under the 2017 Plan; and PRSUs granted on April 17, 2018 under the 2017 Plan.
EVC Awards
Under our EVC Plan, the named executive officers may receive cash payouts after the completion of each fiscal year if specified performance goals established at the beginning of the fiscal year are attained. For each named executive officer, a cash incentive amount, expressed as a percentage of his or her base salary, is established for performance at each of the target and maximum levels. The EVC Plan awards for fiscal year 2018 were structured so that the cash incentive paid to each named executive officer would be 0% to 200% of the payout level established for performance at the target level for each goal. Mr. Hore did not participate in the EVC Plan during fiscal year 2018 and, as a result, did not receive any cash payouts under the EVC Plan. However, based on Sensors segment performance, Mr. Hore did receive a discretionary bonus.
Information about the potential payout levels established for each named executive officer, other than Mr. Hore, and the nature and weighting of the goals selected for fiscal year 2018 can be found under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." The actual amounts paid pursuant to the EVC Plan for fiscal year 2018 performance are listed in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column to the Summary Compensation Table.
Stock Options
Unless an option holder is terminated for cause, vested stock options are exercisable for 90 days after the termination of the option holder's employment, or 180 days upon death, disability or retirement. If an option holder's employment is terminated for "Cause," as such term is defined in our 2011 Plan or 2017 Plan, as applicable, all unexercised options will immediately terminate. The Committee may, at any time after the award is granted, accelerate the vesting of some or all of the unvested options as it deems appropriate.
These stock options would become fully exercisable upon the occurrence of a "Change in Control," as such term is defined in our 2011 Plan or 2017 Plan, as applicable, unless the acquiring entity assumed or provided a substitute for the award. The Committee may require options be exercised prior to the Change in Control and may pay cash or other securities to cancel awards in connection with the Change in Control.
Restricted Stock Units
If a unit holder's employment is terminated, the unvested units will be forfeited. The Committee may, at any time after the award is granted, accelerate the vesting of some or all of the unvested units as it deems appropriate.
These RSUs would become fully exercisable upon the occurrence of a "Change in Control," as such term is defined in our 2011 Plan or 2017 Plan, as applicable, unless the acquiring entity assumed or provided a substitute for the award. The Committee may pay cash or other securities to cancel awards in connection with the Change in Control.
Grants to named executive officers of plan-based awards in fiscal year 2018 are set forth in the table below.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
Our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides a select group of employees, including all of the named executive officers, with the option to defer up to 90% of base salary or short-term cash incentive. Independent directors are also eligible to participate in the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and may elect to defer up to 100% of the director's fees we pay.
Participants' deferred compensation accounts earn a monthly rate of return based on an established interest rate. The interest rate is approved by the Committee in November of each year for the following calendar year. Historically, the ten-year government treasury note rate as of the first business day of the calendar year has been used. As such, the interest rate for calendar year 2018 was 2.46%.
At the time of the deferral election, participants must also select a distribution date and form of distribution. Participants may elect to receive distribution in a single payment, installments, or combination thereof. Distribution elections cannot change unless the election is to postpone payment until the fifth anniversary of separation from service or, if later, age 60 and the election must be made at least 12 months before separation from service. In no case can an earlier distribution election be allowed.
None of our named executive officers elected to participate in the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan during fiscal year 2018.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
Payments and benefits receivable by the named executive officers upon termination of employment or a change in control of our Company are governed by the arrangements described below.
Executive Change in Control Severance Plan
We adopted the Executive Change in Control Severance Plan (the "Change in Control Severance Plan") on September 30, 2013, which became effective January 1, 2014, so that the treatment of all eligible named executive officers would be consistent if such individual's employment with the Company or an affiliate was terminated without Cause or for Good Reason following a Change in Control, each such capitalized term as defined in the Change in Control Severance Plan. Under the Change in Control Severance Plan, the Company will pay and provide to the eligible participants benefits in a sum equal to 200% of the following: annualized basic cash remuneration in effect during the then current year; average annual Executive Variable Compensation paid for the preceding three years (or the actual number of years of receipt of such incentive compensation if less than three years); and any other form of compensation paid to the participant and included in such individual's gross income during the 12-month period immediately prior to the date of termination. The cash severance benefit will be paid in a lump sum following termination. The executive will also receive certain life, disability, accident, and health insurance coverage for a period of up to 18 months following termination and officers' liability insurance for not less than six years from the date of a Change in Control. As a condition to the receipt of such benefits, the executive may not render services to any entity offering any competing product for a period of two years following the date of termination unless the change in control was not approved by the Board of Directors. Mr. Hore was previously provided a change in control severance benefit under the Hore Employment Agreement, which agreement expired on July 5, 2018. Upon expiration of the Hore Employment Agreement, Mr. Hore became an eligible participant under the Change in Control Severance Plan.
Executive Severance Plan
We adopted the Executive Severance Plan on September 30, 2013 (the "Severance Plan"), so that the treatment of all eligible named executive officers would be consistent if such individual's employment with the Company or an affiliate was terminated without Cause or for Good Reason, each as defined in the Severance Plan. In the event of such termination, the Severance Plan provides that the eligible participant would receive as benefits a sum equal to 100% of his or her annualized basic cash remuneration in effect during the then current year and certain life, accident and health insurance coverage. The cash severance benefit would be paid in equal installments on each payroll pay date during the 12 month period beginning no later than 60 days following the date of termination. As a condition of the receipt of these benefits, the executive may not render services to any entity offering any competing product for a period of one year following the date of termination. In addition, payments to be paid under the Severance Plan can be forfeited, and certain payments already made can be recaptured, if the executive engaged or engages in conduct detrimental to the Company while employed by the Company or violates the Severance Plan's non-compete provisions. Mr. Hore was previously provided a severance benefit under the Hore Employment Agreement, which agreement expired on July 5, 2018. Upon expiration of the Hore Employment Agreement, Mr. Hore became an eligible participant under the Severance Plan.
Equity Incentives
The 2011 Plan and the 2017 Plan provide that, if any awards have not been assumed or substituted by an acquiring entity, any stock incentives accelerate upon a change in control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the Committee determines otherwise at or prior to the change in control, no stock incentive that is subject to any performance criteria for which the performance period has not expired shall accelerate at the time of a change in control.
Short-Term Cash Incentives
Under the terms of the awards made pursuant to the EVC Plan, if a named executive officer's employment with the Company is terminated for any reason other than death before the end of the fiscal year on which the performance goals are based, the officer will not receive any payout under the EVC Plan. If a named executive officer dies during the fiscal year on which the performance goals are based, a prorated payout based on actual achievement of the performance goals at the end of the fiscal year will be made to the officer's estate. Such a payout will be proportionately reduced based upon the time such named executive officer was employed during the fiscal year.
Estimated Payments for Named Executive Officers
Assuming that a termination of employment and/or change in control occurred on September 29, 2018, the total compensation payable to the following named executive officers in accordance with the Executive Change in Control Severance and Executive Severance Plans that were in place at that time is as set forth in the table below.

CEO Pay Ratio
As required by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the ratio of the median of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Jeffrey A. Graves, our President and Chief Executive Officer. For fiscal year 2018:
To identify our median employee, we began by considering each individual employed by us worldwide on July 1, 2018, which included approximately 3,500 total employees. We then calculated total cash compensation for each employee including both current base salary (or annual wage rate) and bonuses paid during the prior 12 months. To calculate total cash compensation for any employee that we paid in currency other than U.S. Dollars, we applied the applicable foreign currency exchange rate in effect on July 1, 2018 to determine the amount in U.S. Dollars. Once compiled into a single database, we analyzed the compensation amounts for all of our employees (excluding Dr. Graves) to determine our median employee.
Once we identified our median employee, we added together all of the elements of such employee's compensation for fiscal year 2018 in the same way that we calculate the annual total compensation of our Named Executive Officers in the Summary Compensation Table. To calculate our ratio, we divided Dr. Graves's annual total compensation, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table above, by the median employee's annual total compensation.
PROPOSAL 3
NON-BINDING, ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATIONOF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
General Information
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, shareholders are being asked to vote on the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the shareholders of MTS Systems Corporation approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the compensation tables and the accompanying narrative disclosure, set forth in the Company's proxy statement.
The compensation of our named executive officers is disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the related disclosures contained on pages 12 to 30 of this proxy statement. As discussed in those disclosures, we believe that our compensation policies and decisions are focused on pay-for-performance principles and are strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. Compensation of our named executive officers is designed to enable us to attract and retain talented and experienced senior executives to lead the Company successfully in a competitive environment.
Your vote on Proposal 3 is advisory and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee, or the Board. The vote will not be construed to create or imply any change to the fiduciary duties of the Company or the Board, or to create or imply any additional fiduciary duties for the Company or the Board. However, our Board and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our shareholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, we will consider our shareholders' concerns and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.
The Board believes that the Company should hold an advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers (the "Say-on-Pay Vote") annually, and plans to hold a similar Say-on-Pay Vote each year until the next required vote on the frequency of Say-on-Pay Votes or until the Board determines that it is in the best interest of the Company to hold such vote with a different frequency. The next Say-on-Pay Vote will be held at our fiscal year 2019 annual meeting to be held early in calendar year 2020.
Board Voting Recommendation
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS DESCRIBED IN THE COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SECTION, THE COMPENSATION TABLES AND THE ACCOMPANYING NARRATIVE DISCLOSURE, SET FORTH IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.

[END TABLE]
The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of shares of the Company's common stock as of December 18, 2018 by:
Related Party Transactions
The Audit Committee is responsible for the review and approval of all related party transactions between the Company and any of our executive officers, directors or director nominees, or any immediate family member of any such person. Pursuant to a related party transactions approval procedure adopted by the Audit Committee, all related party transactions that involve amounts in excess of $120,000 and in which a related party has or will have a direct or indirect material interest, must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee. If the proposed transaction involves a member of the Audit Committee, such member will not participate in the deliberations or vote on the proposed transaction. Related party transactions may be approved if the Audit Committee in good faith determines them to be (i) fair and reasonable to us, (ii) on terms no less favorable than could be obtained by us if the transaction did not involve a related party and (iii) in our best interests.
There were no related party transactions during fiscal year 2018.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
The rules of the SEC require us to disclose the identity of directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of our Common Stock who did not file on a timely basis reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. Based solely on a review of copies of such reports and written representations from reporting persons, we believe that all directors and executive officers complied with all filing requirements applicable to them during fiscal year 2018.
Information Regarding Equity Compensation Plans
The following table sets forth information regarding our equity compensation plans as of September 29, 2018.
Under the 2012 ESPP, there is a two-year mandatory holding period for stock acquired upon exercise of options granted thereunder. In contrast, there is no mandatory holding period for stock acquired upon exercise of options granted under the 2017 Plan. However, the federal income tax consequences to an employee for immediate disposition of stock acquired upon exercise of incentive stock options may make it more advantageous to the employee to hold such shares for at least one year from the date of exercise and two years from the date of grant. In addition, our executive officers and directors are subject to stock ownership guidelines that may encourage our executive officers and directors to hold shares acquired upon exercise of options. See the section of this proxy statement entitled "Executive Compensation – Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Compensation Policies – Stock Ownership Guidelines" for more information.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
No member of our Compensation Committee has been an officer or employee of our Company or any of our subsidiaries and affiliates or has had any relationship with our Company requiring disclosure in our proxy statement other than service as a director. None of our executive officers has served on the board of directors or on the compensation committee of any other entity, any officer of which served either on our Board of Directors or on our Compensation Committee.
Shareholder Proposals
Proposals Included in the Proxy Statement
Proposals of our shareholders that are intended to be presented by such shareholders at our fiscal year 2019 annual meeting that we anticipate will be held in early calendar year 2020 and that shareholders desire to have included in our proxy materials related to such meeting must be received by us at our principal executive offices no later than 5:00 p.m., Central Time, September 5, 2019, which is 120 calendar days prior to the anniversary of this year's mailing date. Upon timely receipt of any such proposal we will determine whether or not to include such proposal in the proxy statement and proxy in accordance with applicable regulations governing the solicitation of proxies.
Proposals Not Included in the Proxy Statement
If a shareholder wishes to present a proposal at our fiscal year 2019 annual meeting to be held in early calendar year 2020 or to nominate one or more directors and the proposal is not intended to be included in our proxy statement relating to that meeting, the shareholder must give advance notice to us prior to the deadline for such meeting determined in accordance with our Bylaws. In general, our Bylaws provide that such notice should be addressed to the Secretary and be no less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, except in certain circumstances as further described in our Bylaws. For purposes of our fiscal year 2019 annual meeting, such notice must be received no earlier than October 16, 2019 and not later than November 15, 2019. These time limits also apply in determining whether notice is timely for purposes of rules adopted by the SEC relating to the exercise of discretionary voting authority. Our Bylaws set out specific requirements that such shareholders and written notices must satisfy. Copies of those requirements will be forwarded to any shareholder upon written request to the Secretary of the Company.
Our management knows of no matters other than the foregoing to be brought before the Annual Meeting. However, this proxy gives discretionary authority in the event that additional matters should be presented.
A copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, which includes audited financial statements, will be furnished without charge to any shareholder who requests it in writing from Treasurer, MTS Systems Corporation, 14000 Technology Drive, Eden Prairie, Minnesota 55344 and are also available from the SEC's Internet site at www.sec.gov or via our Internet site at www.mts.com.
Important Notice Regarding Internet Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting: The Notice and Proxy Statement and Annual Report are available at www.proxyvote.com.
ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND PROXY MATERIALS
What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting?
At the Annual Meeting, shareholders will vote upon (1) the election of seven directors, (2) the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019, (3) a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, and (4) such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. In addition, our management will report on the performance of the Company and respond to questions from shareholders.
Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials?
Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, we have elected to provide access to our proxy materials over the Internet. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice of Internet Availability") to our shareholders of record and beneficial owners. All shareholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice of Internet Availability or request a printed set of the proxy materials at no cost to the shareholder. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice of Internet Availability.
If you do not affirmatively elect to receive printed copies of the proxy materials, you will only be able to view our proxy materials electronically on the Internet. Providing our proxy materials to shareholders on the Internet rather than printing and mailing hard copies saves us these costs. We encourage you to view our proxy materials on the Internet. Shareholders who have affirmatively elected to receive a printed set of our proxy materials may change their election and elect to view all future proxy materials on the Internet instead of receiving them by mail.
Who is entitled to vote?
Only shareholders of record at the close of business on December 18, 2018 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, or any adjournments or postponements thereof. Each outstanding share of the Company's common stock, $0.25 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), entitles its holder to cast one vote on each matter to be voted upon.
Shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. If any shareholder gives proper written notice to any officer of the Company before the Annual Meeting, or to the presiding officer at the Annual Meeting, that shareholder may cumulate their votes for the election of directors by multiplying the number of votes to which the shareholder is entitled by the number of directors to be elected and casting all such votes for one nominee or distributing them among any two or more nominees. If such notice is given by any shareholder, votes for directors by such shareholder will be cumulated. For instance, if a shareholder only votes for one nominee, such vote will be automatically cumulated and cast for that nominee. If a shareholder has voted for more than one nominee, the total number of votes that the shareholder is entitled to cast will be divided equally among the nominees for whom the shareholder has voted.
Who can attend the Annual Meeting?
All shareholders as of the Record Date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the virtual Annual Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MTSC2019. If you hold your shares in street name, you must request a legal proxy from your broker or nominee to attend and vote at the Annual Meeting.
What constitutes a quorum?
The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of our Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date will constitute a quorum. A quorum is required for business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, 17,886,001 shares of our Common Stock were outstanding, so holders of at least 8,943,001 shares of our Common Stock must be present, attending the virtual Annual Meeting or by proxy, to have a quorum. If you vote your proxy electronically through the Internet or by telephone, or submit a properly executed paper proxy card, your shares will be considered part of the quorum even if you abstain from voting.
How do I vote?
You may vote in one of the following ways:
Shares represented by proxies submitted through the Internet or by telephone, or those paper proxy cards properly signed, dated and returned, will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions set forth therein. If a proxy is properly submitted, whether through the Internet, by telephone, or by mail using a paper proxy card, but contains no instructions, the shares represented thereby will be voted:
The Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to verify shareholders' identities, allow them to give voting instructions and confirm that their instructions have been recorded properly. Shareholders voting through the Internet should be aware that they may incur costs to access the Internet and that these costs will be at the expense of the shareholder.
When do I vote?
If you wish to vote by Internet or telephone, you must do so before 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 12, 2019, using www.proxyvote.com or calling 1-800-690-6903, as applicable. If you want to vote after February 12, 2019, or revoke an earlier proxy, you must submit a signed proxy card or vote during the virtual Annual Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MTSC2019.
Can I change my vote after I vote electronically or return my proxy card?
Yes. Even after you have voted electronically through the Internet or by telephone or submitted your proxy card, you may change your vote at any time before the proxy is exercised at the Annual Meeting. You may change your vote by:
Shareholders who hold shares through a broker or other intermediary should consult that party as to the procedures to be used for revoking a vote.
What does the Board recommend?
The Board's recommendations are set forth after the description of the proposals in this proxy statement. In summary, the Board recommends a vote:
If you return a properly executed proxy card without specific voting instructions, the persons named as proxy holders on the proxy card will vote in accordance with the recommendations of the Board. With respect to any other matter that properly comes before the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will vote as recommended by the Board or, if no recommendation is given, at their own discretion.
What vote is required to approve each proposal?
For Proposal 1, the seven nominees receiving the highest number of "FOR" votes will be elected.
For Proposals 2 and 3, each shareholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held and the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal will be required for approval.
With respect to any other matter that properly comes before the Annual Meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal will be required for approval.
A "WITHHELD" vote will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum, but will not be considered to have been voted in favor of the director nominee with respect to whom authority has been withheld.
A properly executed proxy marked "ABSTAIN" with respect to Proposals 2 or 3, and any other matter that properly comes before the Annual Meeting, will not be voted, although it will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum. In Proposals 2 and 3, abstentions will have the same effect as a negative vote.
If your shares are held in the "street name" of a broker or other nominee, your broker or nominee may not be permitted to exercise voting discretion with respect to the proposal to be acted upon. If you do not give your broker instructions as to how to vote your shares, your broker has authority under New York Stock Exchange rules to vote those shares for or against "routine" matters, such as the ratification of accounting firms. Brokers cannot vote on their customers' behalf on "non-routine" proposals such as the election of directors and the non-binding, advisory vote to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers. These rules apply notwithstanding the fact that shares of our Common Stock are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
If your brokerage firm votes your shares only on "routine" matters because you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum to conduct business at the Annual Meeting and in determining the number of shares voted for or against the routine matter. If your brokerage firm lacks discretionary voting power with respect to an item that is not a routine matter and you do not provide voting instructions (a "broker non-vote"), your shares will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum to conduct business at the Annual Meeting, but will not be counted in determining the number of shares voted for or against non-routine matters.
Who will count the vote?
Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will act as inspector of elections to determine whether or not a quorum is present and tabulate votes cast by proxy or at the Annual Meeting.
What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability?
If your shares are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability. To ensure that all your shares are voted, vote electronically through the Internet or by telephone, or sign, date and return a paper proxy card for each Notice of Internet Availability you receive. We encourage you to have all accounts registered in the same name and address (whenever possible). You can accomplish this by contacting Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. by telephone at 800-542-1061 or in writing at Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717.
How will voting on any other business be conducted?
We do not know of any business to be considered at the Annual Meeting other than the matters described in this proxy statement. However, if any other business is properly presented at the Annual Meeting, your proxy gives authority to each of David J. Anderson and Jeffrey A. Graves to vote on such matters at their discretion.
How are proxies solicited?
In addition to use of the Internet and mail, proxies may be solicited by our officers, directors and other employees by telephone, through electronic transmission, facsimile transmission, or personal solicitation. No additional compensation will be paid to such individuals for such activity.
What is "householding"?
We may send a single Notice of Internet Availability, as well as other shareholder communications, to any household at which two or more shareholders reside unless we receive other instruction from you. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce duplicate mailings and printing and postage costs and conserve natural resources. If your Notice of Internet Availability is being householded and you wish to receive multiple copies of the Notice of Internet Availability, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive a single copy, or if you would like to opt out of this practice for future mailings, you may contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., by telephone at 800-542-1061 or in writing at Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717.
Who pays for the cost of this proxy solicitation?
We will bear the entire cost of the solicitation of proxies, including the preparation, assembly, printing and mailing of the Notice of Internet Availability, the proxy statement and any additional information furnished to shareholders. We will reimburse banks, brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and certain fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses incurred in mailing proxy materials to their principals.
