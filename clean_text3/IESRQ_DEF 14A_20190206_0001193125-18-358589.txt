 ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
The Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended through May 24, 2016 (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), and Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that the number of members of the Board shall be fixed from time to time by the Board but shall not be less than one nor more than fifteen persons. The Board has set the number of directors at seven. As such, if each of the nominees named below is elected to the Board, there will be no vacancies on the Board following the Annual Meeting. Directors hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified. Vacancies may be filled by recommendation from the Nominating/Governance Committee and a majority vote by the remaining directors. 
It is the intention of the persons named in the proxy card to vote "FOR" the election of the nominees named below, unless a stockholder has directed otherwise or withheld such authority. The affirmative vote of holders of a plurality of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote is required to elect each director nominee. 
Each of the nominees has consented to being named in this proxy statement and has consented to serve, if elected. If, at the time of or prior to the Annual Meeting, a nominee should be unable or decline to serve, the discretionary authority provided in the proxy may be used to vote for a substitute nominee designated by the Board. The Board has no reason to believe that any substitute nominee will be required. No proxy will be voted for a greater number of persons than the nominees named herein. 
Each nominee with an asterisk next to his name is independent in accordance with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Global Market System ("NASDAQ") and the SEC. After reviewing all relevant facts and circumstances, the Board has affirmatively determined that Messrs. Cleveland, Koshkin, Luke and Dowling are independent since they have no relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company), other than as stockholders and/or directors of the Company. Additionally, the Board has affirmatively determined that Mr. Jeffrey Gendell is independent in accordance with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ and the SEC; however, as Mr. Jeffrey Gendell is the founder and managing member of Tontine Associates, L.L.C., a private investment management firm, which, together with its affiliates, (collectively, "Tontine") is the Company's majority stockholder, and Mr. Jeffrey Gendell is the brother of Mr. David Gendell, who is a director and an employee of the Company, the Board has determined that Mr. Jeffrey Gendell does not satisfy the audit committee independence standard set forth in Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. The review was undertaken on a director-by-director basis and did not involve a pre-set formula or minimum standard of materiality. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF THE NOMINEES LISTED BELOW, AND PROXIES EXECUTED AND RETURNED WILL BE SO VOTED UNLESS CONTRARY INSTRUCTIONS ARE INDICATED THEREON.

 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Information with respect to the executive officers of the Company is included in the section titled "Executive Officers of the Registrant" in Part I of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, and is incorporated by reference herein. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD 
Attendance at Meetings 
It is the policy of the Board that all directors of the Company attend the Company's annual meetings. Each of the directors attended the 2018 annual meeting held on February 7, 2018. 
During fiscal year 2018, there were nine meetings of the full Board (four in person and five telephonically or via videoconference), and each member of the Board attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the full Board and meetings of Board committees on which he served. At all regularly scheduled meetings of the Board, the Company's non-executive Chairman presided and an executive session was held without management present. 
Stockholder Communications with the Board of Directors 
Stockholders who wish to communicate directly with the Board may do so by writing to IES Holdings, Inc. Board of Directors, c/o Corporate Secretary, IES Holdings, Inc., One Sound Shore Drive, Suite 304, Greenwich, Connecticut 06830. Stockholders may also communicate directly with individual directors by addressing their correspondence accordingly. Interested parties may make any concerns known to non-management directors by contacting the Company's Ethics Line at 1-800-347-9550. 
The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics for Financial Executives and a code of business conduct and ethics for all directors, officers and employees, which has been memorialized as part of the Company's Legal Compliance and Corporate Policy. Each of these documents can be found in the Corporate Governance section of the Company's website at www.ies-co.com. The Policy is also available in print to any stockholder who requests it by contacting Gail D. Makode, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, IES Holdings, Inc., One Sound Shore Drive, Suite 304, Greenwich, Connecticut 06830. 
The Nomination Process 
The Nominating/Governance Committee of the Board, which, as described below, is composed entirely of independent directors, is responsible in accordance with its charter for establishing standards for members of the Board and overseeing the performance evaluation of the Board and its members. Based upon such evaluations, the Nominating/Governance Committee recommends to the Board whether existing members should be nominated for new terms or replaced and whether more or fewer members are appropriate. 
The Board, with the assistance of the Nominating/Governance Committee, establishes criteria for the selection of new members. The basic criteria are found in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines under "Core Competencies of the Board." At any given time, in order to maintain a proper balance of expertise, individuals with particular skills may be favored over other candidates who lack such skills but otherwise possess a core competency. Additional attributes may include a candidate's character, judgment and diversity of experience, business acumen, ability to act on behalf of all stockholders and a willingness to devote sufficient time to carrying out the duties and responsibilities of Board membership. Candidates must be capable of working with the entire Board and contributing to the overall Board process. The Committee also considers diversity of background experience, age, and specialized training, as well as gender and ethnicity. The Committee strives to   identify director candidates who represent a mix of backgrounds and experiences that will enhance the quality of the Board's deliberations and oversight of the Company's businesses. While the Nominating/Governance Committee considers diversity, among other factors, when considering potential director nominees, the Board does not have a policy with regard to diversity in identifying director nominees. Since a majority of the Board is to be independent of management, consideration is also given as to whether or not the individual is independent in accordance with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ and the SEC. 
When there is an opening or anticipated opening for a director position, Board members and the Company's controlling shareholder are asked to submit recommendations. Outside sources or third parties may, but are not likely to, be used to find potential candidates and similarly may be used to evaluate or assist in evaluating nominees brought to the attention of the Nominating/Governance Committee. Should the Company use the services of a third party, it would expect to pay a fee for such services. 
The Nominating/Governance Committee will also consider director candidates recommended by stockholders. Such candidates will be evaluated using the same criteria and standards described above. Any such recommendation must be delivered to the Company's Corporate Secretary at the address set forth below under "Corporate Governance Guidelines," not later than 80 days prior to the date of the applicable annual meeting. In the event that the date of such annual meeting was not publicly announced by the Company by mail, press release or otherwise more than 90 days prior to the annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered to the Corporate Secretary of the Company not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such announcement of the date of the annual meeting was communicated to the stockholders. The recommendation should also provide the reasons supporting a candidate's recommendation, the candidate's qualifications, the candidate's consent to being considered as a nominee and a way to contact the candidate to verify his or her interest and to gather further information, if necessary. In addition, the stockholder should submit information demonstrating the number of shares he or she owns, the name and address of the stockholder, a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the SEC had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board. Stockholders who themselves wish to nominate an individual to the Board must follow the advance notice requirements and other requirements of the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws. 
Board Observer 
On December 6, 2018, the Company entered into a Board Observer Letter Agreement with Tontine Associates, L.L.C. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, the Company granted Tontine the right, at any time that Tontine holds at least 20% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, to appoint a representative to serve as an observer to the Board (the "Board Observer"). The Board Observer, who shall serve at the discretion of and must be reasonably acceptable to those members of the Board who are not affiliates of Tontine, shall have no voting rights or other decision making authority.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES 
The Company's management and Board are committed to conducting business consistent with good corporate governance practices. To this end, the Board has established a set of Corporate Governance Guidelines which reflect its view of how to help achieve this goal. These guidelines, which may be amended and refined from time to time, are outlined below and may also be found in the Corporate Governance section of the Company's website at www.ies-co.com. The guidelines are also available in print to any stockholder who requests them by contacting Gail D. Makode, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, IES Holdings, Inc., One Sound Shore Drive, Suite 304, Greenwich, Connecticut 06830. 
Directors 
Core Competencies of the Board 
In order to adequately perform the general corporate oversight responsibilities assumed by the Board, the Board as a whole should possess the following competencies: 
Accounting & Finance — The Board should have one or more members who are experienced in accounting and finance matters. 
Management — In order to oversee the Company's management team, the Board should have one or more directors who have experience as a Chief Executive Officer (or other equivalent position) or a Chief Operating Officer or possess similar significant operating experience. 
Industry Knowledge — While the theory of management is important, it is essential that the Board have one or more members with extensive hands-on practical, relevant, industry-specific knowledge. 
Long-Range Strategy — In addition to monitoring the Company's performance in the present, the Board should have one or more members with the skills to look to the future and provide direction for stability and growth. 
Track Record — The Board should have one or more members who have achieved prominence and strong reputations in their respective professions. 
Independence of the Board 
A majority of the Board shall be independent of management. An independent director must meet the standards imposed by the SEC and NASDAQ. 
Leadership Structure and Risk Management 
The Board does not have a formal policy regarding whether the position of Chairman of the Board may be filled by the Company's Chief Executive Officer or a similar position. Instead, the Board has adopted a fluid approach to the Board's leadership structure that allows for variations depending on the circumstances and changing needs of the Company over time. The Company currently subscribes to a Board leadership structure under which the Chairman position is separate from the Company's principal executive officer role, with Mr. Jeffrey Gendell serving as the Company's non-executive Chairman of the Board and Mr. Robert W. Lewey serving as the Company's President. The Board believes the current structure enhances corporate governance and allows our Chairman and President to remain focused on their distinct roles, which for the Chairman, primarily involves Board and corporate governance and for the President primarily involves day-to-day management leadership and implementing our corporate strategy. Our Board regularly reviews all the aspects of our governance profile, including our leadership structure, and will make changes as circumstances warrant.  The overall duty of risk identification and management lies with the Board. To assist in this task, the Board utilizes the various Board committees to review their respective areas of responsibility. The Audit Committee addresses accounting controls and general financial risk, the Nominating/Governance Committee addresses Board composition and internal communication risks, such as ethical issues, and the Human Resources and Compensation Committee addresses workforce risks and pay levels. 
Committees 
The Board has established the Audit, Human Resources and Compensation, and Nominating/Governance Committees to assist in the performance of its functions of overseeing the management and affairs of the Company. The Audit, Human Resources and Compensation, and Nominating/Governance Committees are composed entirely of independent directors under current NASDAQ and SEC standards, have written charters, and have the authority to retain and compensate counsel and experts. Copies of the charters may be found in the Corporate Governance section of the Company's website, www.ies-co.com. The charters are also available in print to any stockholder who requests them by contacting Gail D. Makode, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, IES Holdings, Inc., One Sound Shore Drive, Suite 304, Greenwich, Connecticut 06830.

 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
The Company has adopted a written Related Person Transaction Policy that addresses the reporting, review and approval or ratification of transactions with related persons. The Company recognizes that related person transactions can involve potential or actual conflicts of interest and pose the risk that they may be, or be perceived to have been, based on considerations other than the Company's best interest. Accordingly, as a general matter, the Company seeks to avoid such transactions. However, the Company recognizes that in some circumstances transactions between related persons and the Company may be incidental to the normal course of business or provide an opportunity that is in the best interests of the Company to pursue or that, where it is not efficient to pursue an alternative transaction, is not inconsistent with the best interests of the Company. The policy therefore is not designed to prohibit related person transactions; rather, it is intended to provide for timely internal reporting of such transactions and appropriate review, oversight and public disclosure of them. 
The policy supplements the provisions of the Conflict of Interest Policy in the Company's Legal Compliance and Corporate Policy concerning potential conflict of interest situations. With respect to persons and transactions subject to the policy, the procedures for reporting, oversight and public disclosure apply. With respect to all other potential conflict of interest situations, the provisions of the Company's Legal Compliance and Corporate Policy continue to apply. 
The policy applies to the following persons (each a "Related Person" and, collectively, "Related Persons"): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each director or executive officer of the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any nominee for election as a director of the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any security holder who is known to the Company to own of record or beneficially more than five percent of any class of the Company's voting  securities; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons.  
[END TABLE]
A transaction participated in by the Company with a company or other entity that employs a Related Person or is controlled by a Related Person, or in which a Related Person has an ownership of financial interest material to such Related Person, shall be considered a transaction with a Related Person for purposes of the policy. For purposes of the policy, "related person transaction" means a transaction or arrangement or series of transactions or arrangements in which the Company participates (whether or not the Company is a party) and a Related Person has a direct or indirect interest material to such Related Person. A transaction in which a subsidiary or any other company controlled by the Company participates shall be considered a transaction in which the Company participates. 
Except as otherwise provided in the policy, including any delegation of review and approval authority, (i) any director, director nominee or executive officer who intends to enter into a related person transaction shall disclose the intention and all material facts with respect to the transaction to the Audit Committee of the Board, the Chairman of the Audit Committee or the Company's General Counsel, and (ii) any officer or employee of the Company who intends to cause the Company to enter into any related person transaction shall disclose that intention and all material facts with respect to the transaction to his or her superior, who shall be responsible for seeing that such information is reported to the Audit Committee, the Chairman of the Audit Committee or the Company's General Counsel. If a member of the Audit Committee, or the party reviewing the transaction, has an interest in a related person transaction and, after such person excusing himself or herself from consideration of the transaction, there would be fewer than two members of the reviewing party available to review the transaction who do approve the transaction, the transaction shall be reviewed by an ad hoc committee of at least two independent directors designated by the Board (which shall be considered the "Audit Committee" for this purpose).  Subject to the policy, the Audit Committee will review all related person transactions and approve such transactions in advance of such transaction being given effect. Subject to the policy, the Board has also delegated to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Company's General Counsel the authority to review and approve any related person transaction that is not required to be publicly reported; such transactions must be disclosed to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. At the discretion of the Audit Committee, consideration of a related person transaction may be submitted to the Board. All related person transactions shall be publicly disclosed to the extent and in the manner required by applicable legal requirements and listing standards. The Audit Committee may determine that public disclosure shall be made even where it is not so required, if the Audit Committee considers such disclosure to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
The Company is party to a sublease agreement with Tontine Associates, L.L.C., an affiliate of Tontine, for corporate office space in Greenwich, Connecticut. The lease term extends through April 2019, with monthly payments due in the amount of approximately $8,000. The lease has terms at market rates and payments by the Company are at a rate consistent with that paid by Tontine Associates, L.L.C. to its landlord. 
On December 6, 2018, the Company entered into a Board Observer Letter Agreement with Tontine Associates, L.L.C. in order to assist Tontine in managing its investment in the Company. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, the Company granted Tontine the right, at any time that Tontine holds at least 20% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, to appoint a representative to serve as an observer to the Board. The Board Observer, who shall serve at the discretion of and must be reasonably acceptable to those members of the Board who are not affiliates of Tontine, shall have no voting rights or other decision making authority. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, so long as Tontine has the right to appoint a Board Observer, the Board Observer will have the right to attend and participate in meetings of the Board and the committees thereof, subject to confidentiality requirements, and to receive reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in his or her capacity as a Board Observer and such rights to coverage under the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy as are available to the Company's directors.

Review of the Company's Audited Financial Statements for the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2018 
The Audit Committee meets regularly with the Company's internal auditors and Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent auditors, with and without representatives of management, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of the Company's internal controls and the overall quality of the Company's accounting principles.

 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
The Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Human Resources and Compensation Committee (referred to in this section as the "Committee") of the Board is comprised entirely of independent directors and is responsible for ensuring that the Company's executive compensation policies and programs are appropriate to the duties of the Company's executives and reflect the investment interests of our stockholders. The Committee reviews and approves the compensation levels and benefits programs for the Company's named executive officers ("NEOs"). 
The NEOs are the executives who appear in the compensation tables of this proxy statement. The NEOs in this proxy statement are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Robert W. Lewey, President  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Tracy A. McLauchlin, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Gail D. Makode, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary  
[END TABLE]
The Company's Human Resources Department staff, General Counsel, President and representatives of Tontine (in its capacity as the Company's controlling shareholder) may also provide analysis and counsel as requested by the Committee. You can learn more about the Committee's purpose, responsibilities, and structure by reading the Committee's charter, which can be found in the Corporate Governance section of the Company's website at www.ies-co.com. 
The following is a more detailed discussion of the actions taken by the Committee with respect to fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 and the reasons for such actions. 
Compensation Objectives 
The Company's compensation and benefits program for the NEOs, as described below, is focused on balancing the objectives of conserving the Company's resources, such as the Company's cash and outstanding Common Stock, with attracting, retaining and motivating the individuals who will engage in the behaviors necessary to enable the Company to succeed. 
Beginning with the Company's 2011 annual meetings of stockholders, the Company has, in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, sought an advisory vote of stockholders to approve on an advisory basis the compensation of the Company's NEOs, as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for each annual meeting at which such a vote was required. At each such annual meeting, including the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company's stockholders approved, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation awarded to the Company's NEOs for the prior fiscal year. The Committee has considered the result of these stockholder votes in setting compensation policies and making compensation decisions for each of the fiscal years that has followed. At the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company's stockholders determined, on a non-binding advisory basis, that the stockholder vote on executive compensation should be held once every year. In accordance with this determination, the Company has included in this proxy statement a proposal to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation awarded to the Company's NEOs, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. For additional information, please see "Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation" below.  Under the Committee's supervision, in fiscal year 2018, we implemented a compensation program which is comprised of salary, benefits, and incentive opportunity, and is intended to achieve the following objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Be fair. The program design and levels are intended to fairly reward executives for their level of responsibility and are set with certain  consideration to the practices of similar companies with which the Company competes for talent.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Link executive pay to Company performance and retain talent. The program offers variable, at-risk  incentive award opportunities, which are payable only if specified short-term financial and strategic goals are achieved, with a certain portion payable based on individual performance. While the awards may be made in cash, equity or a combination  thereof, these incentive awards for NEOs in fiscal year 2018 were focused on cash awards under the annual incentive plan. In 2018, at-risk cash awards represented approximately  25-40% of the NEOs' targeted total direct compensation, with base salary representing approximately 60-75%. See "Annual Cash Incentive Awards" below for  additional information.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reward long-term superior growth in the Company's earnings and market value. The Company has, and may from time to time in the future  award, certain performance-based equity and cash grants, which have time-based restrictions and are based on achievement of certain financial and market value goals of the Company over a specified period. During fiscal year 2018, these awards  consisted of three-year performance-based phantom stock units awarded in fiscal 2016 to the NEOs and certain other employees, the performance period for which ended in December 2018. See "Long-Term Incentives" below for additional  information.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Conserve Company resources. While the Committee considers competitive compensation, the Committee is also focused on striking a balance between  limiting cash compensation to a reasonable percentage of the Company's profits and holding equity compensation to a reasonable percentage of the Company's total outstanding Common Stock.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Emphasize stock ownership. In conjunction with our compensation program, the Committee awards equity grants to the NEOs, such as the  performance-based phantom stock units, to encourage alignment with the perspective of the Company's long-term stockholders.  
[END TABLE]

Compensation elements are either cash-based, partly or solely equity-based (and have a value which is at least partly related to the price of the Company's Common Stock) or are comprised of other benefits. 
Market Benchmarking 
The Committee does not target a specific competitive position versus the market or peer companies in determining the compensation of its executives as, in light of the Company's diverse mix of businesses, strict benchmarking against a selected group of companies would not provide a meaningful basis for establishing compensation. In prior years, the Committee has reviewed peer group data for purposes of assessing competitive compensation practices. However, given the limitations of identifying peer companies that reflect the relevant market for executive talent for the Company, the Committee has shifted away from reviewing peer company data and has focused instead on evaluating whether our executive compensation program supports our recruitment and retention needs and is fair and efficient.  The Committee believes the following factors are relevant to establishing a fair compensation structure that promotes retention, and the Committee considers these factors in establishing an individual executive's base salary, annual cash incentive awards, short-term incentives and long-term incentive awards: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's performance against financial measures, including net income before taxes, cost management discipline and safety performance.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's performance relative to goals approved by the Committee.

[END TABLE]
The President develops pay recommendations for Company NEOs (other than himself) based on each NEO's contribution to the Company's return to shareholders, market data, the Company's performance relative to goals approved by the Committee and individual performance versus personal goals. The Committee reviews and approves all compensation elements for the executive officers and sets the compensation of the President. 
The Committee generally reviews tally sheets for the NEOs, modeling elements of compensation (base salary, annual cash incentive awards, short-term equity incentives, benefits and perquisites), which are utilized as the targeted overall compensation level. 
Risk Analysis 
The Committee analyzes risk with respect to the Company's compensation programs on an annual basis. During fiscal year 2018, the Committee concluded that our compensation programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In reaching this conclusion, the Committee considered the following: (i) balanced performance targets, where no one metric is excessively weighted and executives generally receive a balance of long and short-term incentive opportunities; (ii) the Company's "clawback" policy, as described under "Severance and Employment Agreements" below; (iii) performance metrics that are uniformly applied to executives; (iv) annual incentives that do not allow for unlimited payouts; and (vi) annual performance and bonus targets for divisional management that are measured and partially paid on a quarterly basis, withholding a significant portion of such bonus amounts for payment in subsequent quarters, with the goal of providing operating management with immediate incentive for superior performance, while simultaneously promoting employee retention and consideration of longer-term performance. 
Fiscal Year 2018 and 2019 Compensation Decisions 
Base Pay 
The Committee evaluates the President's performance annually in light of established corporate and personal goals and objectives. NEO salary levels and adjustments are recommended by the President and reviewed and approved by the Committee. Any changes in base salary for the President and the NEOs are based on responsibility, the external market for similar jobs, the individual's current salary compared to the market and success in achieving business results. 
Fiscal Year 2018 Base Pay 
In December 2017, the Committee agreed to increase the salary levels of the President, the Chief Financial Officer and the General Counsel, effective January 1, 2018, by approximately 2% each to $510,000, $347,000, and $347,000, respectively, for fiscal 2018.  Fiscal Year 2019 Base Pay 
In December 2018, the Committee agreed to increase the salary levels of the President, the Chief Financial Officer and the General Counsel. Effective January 1, 2019, the Committee increased the salary level of the President by approximately 2.5% to $522,750 as a cost of living adjustment, and the salary levels of each of the Chief Financial Officer and the General Counsel by approximately 6.8%, to $370,675, as a cost of living and performance adjustment. 
Annual Cash Incentive Awards 
Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Incentive Plan 
On December 6, 2017, the Committee approved the Annual Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2018 (the "2018 Annual Incentive Plan"). The 2018 Annual Incentive Plan provides for incentive compensation awards for certain key employees and officers of the Company, which were determined on a recipient-by-recipient basis based on specified performance criteria, with the maximum award payable set as a percentage of the recipient's base salary. For each NEO, the Committee determined the maximum award payable, specified performance criteria and amount payable under each award. For other key employees and officers of the Company, these determinations were made by senior management, with the Committee approving an aggregate award amount for that group of employees and officers. 
For fiscal year 2018, the awards for NEOs could be made either in cash, equity or a combination thereof, at the Committee's discretion, and were based (1) 66.67% on achievement of the financial goal outlined below for fiscal year 2018 and (2) 33.33% on the achievement of the personal goals outlined below for fiscal year 2018. Pursuant to the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan, Mr. Lewey, Ms. McLauchlin and Ms. Makode were eligible to receive target awards between $0 and a maximum of $510,000 (100% of base salary), $208,200 (60% of base salary), and $173,500 (50% of base salary), respectively, corresponding to the level of performance achieved with respect to these goals for fiscal year 2018, with the maximum award representing 100% performance with respect to the financial and personal goals outlined below. 
The performance review of the NEOs was based upon the attainment of individual goals and objectives established as discussed below. Except to the extent the annual incentive award is intended to qualify for grandfather treatment under the performance-based exception of Section 162(m) (see "Deductibility Cap on Executive Compensation," below), the Committee had the sole discretion to increase or decrease the annual incentive award made to the President and the other NEOs. The Committee had the right, in its sole discretion, to reduce or eliminate the amount otherwise payable based upon individual performance or any other factors the Committee deemed appropriate. 
Fiscal Year 2018 Goals and Objectives 
On December 6, 2017, the President recommended, and the Committee approved, the following goals and objectives to be used by the Committee when determining awards under the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan. 
Financial Goal: Reflecting a primary focus on maintaining the Company's profitability, the financial performance measure for NEOs was based on fiscal year 2018 income from continuing operations before income taxes. This financial measure could be considered on an adjusted basis, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to reflect unusual items during the fiscal year. 
Business/Personal Goals: The following business/personal goals and objectives were established for each NEO: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Incentive Plan Awards 
Based on a review of fiscal year 2018 financial results, the Committee assessed the Company's performance against the financial goal described above and determined that the Company recorded income from continuing operations before income taxes below the Company's target, achieving 70.1% of the target fiscal year 2018 income from continuing operations before income taxes, as described in the table below. The Committee therefore awarded each of Mr. Lewey, Ms. McLauchlin and Ms. Makode 70.1% of the financial goals component of his or her maximum eligible award under the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan, which component represented 66.67% of each of their overall maximum eligible awards. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Income from continuing operations before income taxes    $ 34,224,000      $ 23,994,000        70.1%  
[END TABLE]
The Committee then assessed the performance of each of Mr. Lewey, Ms. McLauchlin and Ms. Makode against their respective business/personal goals outlined above, which represented 33.33% of their maximum eligible awards, and determined to award each of them 60%, 85%, and 90%, respectively, of the personal goals component of their maximum eligible awards under the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan. The Committee believes Mr. Lewey's award reflects his solid performance against his personal goals, including management of the safety performance and human capital investments at the Company, along with the closing of two strategic transactions in furtherance of the Company's strategic goals, balanced against progress in the development of the Company's strategic and capital plan. The Committee likewise believes Ms. McLauchlin's and Ms. Makode's awards reflect their leadership in their respective areas of management and strong personal performance along with their contributions to the closing of the strategic transactions noted above in furtherance of the Company's strategic goals. As a result, the Committee awarded annual cash incentive awards to Mr. Lewey of $340,357, to Ms. McLauchlin of $156,278, and to Ms. Makode of $133,121, representing 67%, 75%, and 77%, respectively, of his or her maximum eligible award under the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan. 
Fiscal Year 2019 Annual Incentive Plan 
On December 5, 2018, the Committee approved the Annual Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2019 (the "2019 Annual Incentive Plan"). As with the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan, the 2019 Annual Incentive Plan provides for incentive compensation awards for certain key employees and officers of the Company, which are determined on   a recipient-by-recipient basis based on specified performance criteria, with the target award payable set as a percentage of the recipient's base salary. In addition, for the 2019 Annual Incentive Plan, the Committee added threshold and maximum levels of payouts for NEOs based on performance at the levels outlined below. For NEOs, the Committee determines the maximum, target and threshold levels for each award, specified performance criteria and amount payable under each award, and for other key employees and officers of the Company, these determinations are made by senior management, with the Committee approving an aggregate award amount for that group of employees and officers. 
The awards under the 2019 Annual Incentive Plan may be made either in cash, equity or a combination thereof, at the Committee's discretion. If the applicable performance conditions are fully satisfied, then the target award for each of the NEOs is 100% of base salary (for Mr. Lewey), 60% of base salary (for Ms. McLauchlin) and 50% of base salary (for Ms. Makode), with threshold and maximum levels established as shown below. The performance conditions have two parts, with 66.67% of the award being based upon achievement of net income from continuing operations before income taxes, as adjusted in the Committee's sole discretion (the "Financial Portion of Award"), and 33.33% of the award being based upon achievement of the personal goals (the "Personal Portion of Award"), all as outlined in the following table.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  Linear interpolation on a straight line basis will apply to financial goals and performance goals achieved between Threshold, Target and  Maximum levels above.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee believes that the target level was designed to have a 50% probability of achievement. The Committee has the sole discretion to increase or decrease the annual incentive award made to the President and the other NEOs. The Committee has the right, in its sole discretion, to reduce or eliminate the amount otherwise payable based upon individual performance or any other factors the Committee deems appropriate. 
Short-Term Incentives 
In addition to the annual cash incentive awards, the Company has in the past provided, and may from time to time in the future provide, discretionary equity or cash incentive awards for NEOs that have short-term or no time-based restrictions and that are based on achievement of significant strategic events, such as acquisitions, which the Committee believes will significantly impact the long-term performance of the Company. 
The Committee did not award any short-term incentives to NEOs during fiscal year 2018.  Long-Term Incentives 
In fiscal 2016, the Committee awarded performance-based, long-term equity incentives to NEOs and certain other holding company officers to incentivize performance consistent with the Company's long-term strategic and financial objectives. The performance period for these awards ended in December 2018, as described below and all outstanding long-term equity incentives for NEOs vested as of December 7, 2018. The Committee is evaluating a new long-term incentive award plan and intends to award new long-term equity incentive awards to NEOs in the future. 
In addition, in recent years, the Committee has awarded, and may from time to time in the future award, equity-based and other long-term incentive awards as an incentive and retention device in connection with specific events, such as new hires and promotions. 
Performance-Based Phantom Stock Unit Grants 
In fiscal 2016, the Committee approved awards pursuant to the Company's 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the "2006 Equity Incentive Plan"), to certain officers, including each of its then current NEOs, of performance-based phantom stock units (the "Performance Units"). The following Performance Units were awarded to NEOs at that time: 140,000 Performance Units to Mr. Lewey, 70,000 Performance Units to Ms. McLauchlin and 60,000 Performance Units to Ms. Makode. 
Each Performance Unit represents a contractual right in respect of one share of the Company's Common Stock. The Performance Units were to become vested, if at all, upon the achievement of certain specified performance objectives and the continued performance of services through mid-December 2018 (the "Service Vesting Date"). To receive the full benefit of the Performance Units, the Company was required to achieve superior growth, over the applicable performance periods, in the Company's net income before taxes ("NIBT") and in the market value of the Company's Common Stock above the grant date market value. The Committee authorized the grant of Performance Units to incent management to achieve these superior increases in the Company's net income and stock price over the next three fiscal years. 
The vesting of seventy-five percent (75%) of the Performance Units (the "NIBT Performance Units") was subject to the achievement of specified levels of cumulative net income before taxes, as reported in the Company's annual financial statements for each of fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018, but adjusted to exclude the effect of any extraordinary items and of the awards made as part of the Performance Unit program (the "Cumulative NIBT"), as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        Cumulative  NIBT           Percentage of NIBT   Performance Units Vested 
[END TABLE]
For achievement between the threshold and maximum levels of Cumulative NIBT, the percentage of the NIBT Performance Units that could become vested was to be determined by mathematical interpolation. If Cumulative NIBT exceeded the maximum NIBT level, the Company could allocate 10% of the excess over the maximum NIBT level to a bonus pool to be allocated and payable to eligible officers and other key employees at the discretion of, and on such terms and conditions as were to be specified by, the Committee. The applicable performance objectives were quite challenging. To achieve even the threshold level of performance would have required the Company to achieve significant increases in net income before taxes over the three-year performance period. Except in the event of death, disability and a change of control, or as otherwise provided under the Executive Officer Severance Benefit Plan described under "Severance and Employment Agreements"   below, to vest in the NIBT Performance Units, the recipient must also have remained continuously employed through the Service Vesting Date. 
The remaining twenty-five percent (25%) of the Performance Units (the "Stock Price Units") was subject to the achievement of specified stock price levels, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Highest Average Stock Price During the Measurement Period    Percentage of Stock Price Units Vested 
 Highest Average Stock Price During the Measurement Period    Percentage of Stock Price Units Vested 
[END TABLE]
As reflected in the table above, a portion of the Stock Price Units was to vest if the average closing prices of a share of the Company's Common Stock during any period of 20 consecutive trading days ending after October 2, 2015 and on or before December 15, 2018 (the "Average Price") at least equaled $14.00. All of the Stock Price Units were to vest (subject to employment through the Service Vesting Date) if the highest Average Price was at least $18.00. If the highest Average Price achieved in the measurement period was greater than $14.00, but less than $18.00, the portion of the Stock Price Units that was to vest was to be determined by mathematical interpolation. In the event of the occurrence of any transactions affecting the Company's capital structure, the Committee will adjust the stated hurdles in a manner intended to prevent any enhancement or diminution of the rights and opportunities provided in respect of the Performance Units as a result of such event. The market conditions required as described above for vesting of the Stock Price Units were achieved during fiscal year 2017. Except in the event of death, disability and a change of control, or as otherwise provided under the Executive Officer Severance Benefit Plan described under "Severance and Employment Agreements" below, to vest in the Stock Price Units, the recipient was also required to remain continuously employed through the Service Vesting Date (the "Service Condition"). 
As of December 5, 2018, the Committee reviewed the performance conditions for the Performance Units and determined that (i) the Service Condition was met for each of the NEOs, (ii) the performance condition for the Stock Price Units was met at the highest stock price level, and (iii) the Cumulative NIBT, as calculated under the award agreements, was $70,403,000, and therefore, the performance condition for the NIBT Performance Units was met at the 37.8% vesting level. As such, the Committee determined that, as of December 7, 2018, 100% of the Stock Price Units for the NEOs vested and that 37.8% of the NIBT Performance Units for the NEOs vested. Mr. Lewey therefore vested in 74,701 Performance Units, Ms. McLauchlin vested in 37,350 Performance Units and Ms. Makode vested in 32,015 Performance Units at such time, with each Performance Unit representing one share of the Company's common stock. 
401(k) and Deferred Compensation Plan 
The Company provides all employees the opportunity to participate in one of several 401(k) plans, which vary by division. Under the Company's largest 401(k) plan, the IES Holdings, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the "401(k) Plan"), the Company matches 30% of the first 5% that an employee contributes to the 401(k) Plan on a pre-tax basis, and for calendar year 2019 expects to continue the same level of match. However, in order for the 401(k) Plan to comply with nondiscrimination requirements of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, highly compensated employees ("HCEs") are generally subject to an aggregate contribution limit in the range of 4-6% of their base annual earnings. 
In order to further assist NEOs and certain other HCEs in saving for retirement, the Company also historically provided an elective Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan allowed participants to voluntarily defer the receipt of salary (maximum deferral of 75%) and earned annual incentive awards (maximum deferral of 75%). In October 2007, the Committee amended the Deferred Compensation Plan   to provide a Company matching component effective for deferrals made beginning January 1, 2008 for selected employees, which included the NEOs. Each participant who elected to make deferrals of eligible compensation to the Deferred Compensation Plan was eligible to receive a matching contribution equal to 25% of the first 10% of a participant's annual base salary deferrals into the Deferred Compensation Plan. Effective February 15, 2009, the Company instituted a suspension of the employer matching contribution to the Deferred Compensation Plan as part of its cost cutting initiatives. The Deferred Compensation Plan has not received contributions since December 31, 2011. 
Details about NEO participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan and accumulated balances are presented under "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" below. The NEOs' accumulated balances, if any, disclosed under "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" represent voluntary deferrals of earned compensation, not matching contributions by the Company. 
Other Benefits 
During fiscal year 2018, no perquisites were provided by the Company to an NEO. An item is not a perquisite if it is integrally and directly related to the performance of the executive's duties. An item is a perquisite if it confers a direct or indirect benefit that has a personal aspect, without regard to whether it may be provided for some business reason or for the convenience of the Company, unless it is generally available on a non-discriminatory basis to all employees. 
The Committee annually reviews the perquisites and additional benefits, if any, provided to executive officers as part of its overall review of executive compensation. Details about the 401(k) Plan and the Deferred Compensation Plan, including the fiscal year 2018 cost to the Company, are shown in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "Summary Compensation Table" and in the accompanying narrative. Because no perquisite was paid to any NEO during fiscal year 2018, perquisites are not quantified in the "Summary Compensation Table" and "All Other Compensation" table below. 
Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board does not impose formal stock ownership guidelines for the Company's executive officers, including the NEOs. The Board believes its annual review of each executive's compensation and stock ownership levels and short and long-term equity incentive programs are sufficient to ensure that executives maintain a meaningful economic stake in the Company.  TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
Deductibility Cap on Executive Compensation 
Under Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)"), the Company generally cannot take a tax deduction for compensation paid in excess of $1 million to our executive officers. However, this deduction limit does not apply to certain compensation that qualifies as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) and was awarded by the Company pursuant to a legally-binding contract that existed on or before November 2, 2017. As a result, compensation paid to certain current and former executive officers in excess of $1 million in a taxable year generally will not be deductible unless such compensation qualifies for the above transition relief. 
The Committee considers tax implications to the Company as one of many factors in its compensation decisions and attempts to structure compensation and awards to preserve tax deductibility. The Committee may choose, however, to provide compensation that may not be deductible if it believes such payments are necessary to achieve our compensation objectives and to protect stockholder interests. The Committee will continue to monitor any changes to tax laws and accounting rules, and reserves the right to revise certain programs to appropriately align the tax consequences and accounting expenses of our equity awards with our overall executive compensation philosophy and objectives. 
Golden Parachute Taxes 
Under certain circumstances, payments received by our executive officers as a result of a change in control may be subject to excise taxes and may not be fully deductible. The Committee considered the possible effects of these taxes in developing the Executive Officer Severance Benefit Plan described under "Severance and Employment Agreements" below. 
Section 409A 
During fiscal year 2018, the Committee continued to monitor its compliance with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, which was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Section 409A imposes additional limitations on non-qualified deferred compensation plans in order to ensure their full compliance with the Act. The Company believes all of its benefit plans substantially conform to the requirements of Section 409A.  PAYMENTS UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL 
For information concerning payments upon the termination of the NEOs, including upon certain triggering events, please see "Severance and Employment Agreements" below. In addition to the severance related matters discussed below, the Performance Units granted during fiscal year 2016 had special vesting provisions which would have applied if, prior to the Service Vesting Date, there had been a change in control of the Company (as defined in the Company's 2006 Equity Incentive Plan in effect at the time of the grant). If, following the occurrence of a change in control, the Performance Units would have related to a class of stock that was publicly traded on an established U.S. securities market (a "Publicly Traded Stock"), then the performance conditions with respect to such Performance Units that would have related to such Publicly Traded Stock would have been waived, and such Performance Units would have become subject only to the continued employment conditions otherwise applicable to such Performance Units. In addition, such Performance Units would have become fully vested if the officer's employment had been terminated following the change in control (i) by the Company other than for cause or (ii) by the officer for good reason. If the Performance Units did not relate to a Publicly Traded Stock following the occurrence of a change in control, then such Performance Units would have vested in full upon the occurrence of the change in control.  HUMAN RESOURCES AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Committee believes that the executive compensation and policies provide the necessary incentives to properly align executive performance and the interests of the stockholders. 
The Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and, based on such review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

In order to further assist NEOs and certain other executives in saving for retirement, the Company also historically provided an elective Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation Plan allowed participants to voluntarily defer the receipt of salary (maximum deferral of 75%) and earned annual incentive awards (maximum deferral of 75%). The Deferred Compensation Plan has not received contributions since December 31, 2011. For additional information on the Deferred Compensation Plan, please see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis-401(k) and Deferred Compensation Plan" above.  SEVERANCE AND EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS 
Introduction 
All NEOs are subject to the Company's Executive Officer Severance Benefit Plan (the "Severance Plan"). The Committee annually reviews the Severance Plan to determine its continuing need as well as the amount and nature of compensation potentially payable thereunder. In January 2016, the Severance Plan was amended and restated to include a noncompetition and nonsolicitation provision. 
When executive positions become available, we may search for potential replacements not only within the Company but also in the marketplace, with the assistance of placement firms. Since prospective candidates from outside the Company are often already employed, they must be recruited and the total compensation offered must satisfy the need to incentivize and reward the individual. Additionally, we find that, in light of variable economic conditions, prospective executives are often also looking for an element of security, which will ensure a source of income in the event that their employment is terminated without Cause (as defined in the Severance Plan). 
The risk of unemployment is heightened in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the Severance Plan) of the Company, since the limited number of executive positions often results in terminations due to non-cost effective duplication. Thus, in order for the Company to recruit the best possible executives, the Severance Plan provides for the mutual benefit of the Company and the executive. Income, under the Severance Plan, is comprised of the same elements of compensation as the Company's ongoing compensation program discussed above, which includes base salary, annual cash incentives, equity incentives, benefits and, in certain circumstances, perks such as car allowances. 
The Severance Plan also includes a "clawback" provision which permits the Company, in the event the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires an executive to repay the Company "erroneously awarded" amounts of incentive compensation, to recoup such amount by reducing the severance pay or benefit otherwise due the executive under the Severance Plan. 
The following information provides more detail concerning the specific terms and conditions of the Severance Plan and describes the approximate value of the payments to be received by each of the NEOs in the event of a qualifying termination or death or disability under the Severance Plan. The actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of an executive's separation from the Company. Thus, as disclosed herein, the amounts of compensation payable to Mr. Lewey and Mmes. McLauchlin and Makode assume that such terminations were effective as of September 30, 2018 and include amounts earned through such time.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any material reduction in his position, authority or Base Salary,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any relocation of the Company's corporate office that is more than 50 miles from his primary location of work, or

All of the above are valid reasons only if the Company fails to cure such event within 30 days after receipt from him of written notice of the event which constitutes Good Reason and he must give the Company written notice of the event by the 60th day following its occurrence. 
A "Change in Control" is defined in the Severance Plan as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
 PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE 
In accordance with newly effective SEC rules, we have calculated the ratio of the compensation of our Principal Executive Officer, which is our President during fiscal year 2018, and the compensation of our median employee, as calculated below, during fiscal year 2018 (the "Median Compensation Amount"). 
During fiscal year 2018, the Median Compensation Amount was $51,642, and the annual total compensation for our President, Mr. Lewey, including salary, incentive compensation and any equity granted during the year, was $853,782. Accordingly, the reasonable estimated ratio of the total annual compensation of the President to the Median Compensation Amount was 16.53 to 1. 
The methodology we used for calculating the pay ratio was first to determine the total employee population (other than the President) as of September 30, 2018, including full-time, part-time and temporary employees, which we determined to be 4,519 employees. In order to determine the median employee within the identified employee population, we collected fiscal year 2018 payroll compensation per employee, which we defined as all wages reported for the employee on his or her most recent W-2 form. For such employees, we did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total payroll compensation, and we did not annualize the compensation for any part-time employees or any full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of fiscal 2018. We then calculated the Median Compensation Amount on the same basis as the total annual compensation of the President was calculated. The Company believes its compensation philosophy and process yield an equitable result. 
The pay ratio reported above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules, based on our internal records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. Accordingly, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may use different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Directors who are officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries do not receive a retainer or fees for service on the Board or any committees. Mr. David Gendell, who became an employee of the Company in November 2017, but is not an officer of the Company, continues to receive a Board retainer and fees. Each non-officer director receives a $40,000 annual retainer (the "Annual Retainer"), paid in quarterly installments after the annual stockholders' meeting, as well as the following additional retainers for committee and committee Chairman service, which are also paid in quarterly installments: each director receives $5,000 annually for each committee on which the director serves other than as Chairman, the Chairmen of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee and the Nominating/Governance Committee each receive $10,000 annually, and the Chairman of the Audit Committee receives $25,000 annually. 
In addition to the annual retainers described above, upon his or her election or re-election to the Board at an annual stockholders' meeting, each director receives a $25,000 grant (the "Annual Meeting Grant"), paid quarterly, for his or her subsequent periods of service on the Board, provided that he or she is re-elected at subsequent annual stockholders' meetings. 
During the first quarter of each fiscal year, each director is provided the opportunity to elect, in respect of his or her compensation for his or her services rendered in the following calendar year, whether to receive the combined amount of his or her Annual Retainer, the value of the Annual Meeting Grant and any additional retainer payable for serving on, or as Chairman of, a committee of the Board (the "Total Annual Compensation"), in whole or in part, in (i) cash, (ii) fully vested shares of Common Stock, or (iii) phantom stock units issued pursuant to the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, as it may be amended and restated from time to time, that convert to shares of Common Stock on the date the director leaves the Board for any reason ("Director PSUs"). 
For fiscal year 2018, following the 2018 Annual Meeting, each of the directors received the following portions of his Total Annual Compensation in the form of (i) cash, (ii) fully vested shares of Common Stock, or (iii) Director PSUs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name% of Total Annual   Compensation Elected to be Paid in Cash% of Total Annual   Compensation Elected to be Paid in Common Stock% of Total Annual   Compensation Elected to be Paid in Director PSUs   
 Todd M. Cleveland      75%      0%      25%  
 Joseph L. Dowling III      50%      0%      50%  
 David B. Gendell      50%      0%      50%  
 Jeffrey L. Gendell      0%      0%      100%  
 Joe D. Koshkin      75%      0%      25%  
 Donald L. Luke      80%      0%      20%  
[END TABLE]
For each director electing to receive a portion of his Total Annual Compensation in Director PSUs or Common Stock, the number of Director PSUs or shares of Common Stock granted is determined by dividing the amount of such director's Total Annual Compensation to be paid in either such form by the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the last trading day of the quarter. 
The following additional compensation was paid to directors during fiscal year 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vice Chairman Retainer: From November 2016 to November 7, 2017, Mr. David Gendell served as Vice Chairman of the Board (the "Vice  Chairman") and as the Board's liaison to management.

 COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
During fiscal year 2018, no executive officer of the Company served as (i) a member of the compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire Board of Directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Company, (ii) a director of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Company or (iii) a member of the compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire Board of Directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director of the Company. During fiscal year 2018, no member of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (i) was an officer or employee of the Company, (ii) was formerly an officer of the Company or (iii) had any business relationship or conducted any business with the Company other than as an independent director of the Company, except for Mr. David Gendell, who, until December 31, 2017, was an employee of Tontine Associates, L.L.C. (an affiliate of Tontine, the majority shareholder of the Company), is a director of the Company, was appointed Interim Director of Operations in November 2017, served during fiscal year 2017 as non-executive Vice Chairman and non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, and is the brother of Mr. Jeffrey Gendell, who is the founder and managing member of Tontine (the majority shareholder of the Company) and is the non-executive Chairman of the Company. At the beginning of fiscal year 2018, the Board evaluated each member's independence under the independence standards promulgated by NASDAQ for compensation committees and determined that each member was independent for purposes of serving on the Company's Human Resources and Compensation Committee. In reaching this conclusion, the Board considered in particular whether Mr. David Gendell's affiliation with Tontine would impair his judgment as a member of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee, as outlined under the independence standards, and determined that it would not in light of his independence from management and the Board's belief that the interests of Tontine and the Company's other stockholders are aligned in seeking to set appropriate levels of executive compensation at the time of such appointment. Subsequently, upon Mr. David Gendell's appointment as the Company's Interim Director of Operations, a non-officer employee role, he was removed by the Board from the Human Resources and Compensation Committee and Nominating/Governance Committee, based on the Board's determination that he was no longer independent as a result of his employment with the Company.  SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors, executive officers and persons holding more than 10 percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities to file with the SEC and any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Common Stock may then be listed or quoted (i) initial reports of ownership, (ii) reports of changes in ownership and (iii) annual reports of ownership of Common Stock and other equity securities of the Company. Such directors, officers and ten-percent stockholders are also required to furnish the Company with copies of all such filed reports. 
Based solely upon review of the copies of such reports furnished to the Company and written representations that no other reports were required during fiscal year 2018, the Company believes that all Section 16(a) reports required to be filed by the Company's directors and executive officers during fiscal year 2018 were timely fulfilled.  RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 
The Audit Committee has re-appointed Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, subject to ratification by the Company's stockholders. Ernst & Young LLP was the Company's independent auditor for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. 
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so, and to respond to appropriate questions from those attending the Annual Meeting. 
The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock voted at the Annual Meeting is required to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent auditors for fiscal year 2019. 
If the stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the Company's and its stockholders' best interests. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" RATIFICATION OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP'S APPOINTMENT, AND PROXIES EXECUTED AND RETURNED WILL BE SO VOTED UNLESS CONTRARY INSTRUCTIONS ARE INDICATED THEREON.  ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation awarded to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K. 
As described in detail under the heading "Executive Compensation" of this proxy statement, we seek to closely align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our stockholders. Our compensation programs are designed to reward our named executive officers for the achievement of strategic and operational goals, while at the same time avoiding the encouragement of unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. 
The Company has established comprehensive compensation programs for our executive officers, including our named executive officers, and this proxy statement fully and fairly discloses all material information regarding compensation of the Company's named executive officers as required by Item 402 of Regulation S-K. Stockholders should reference and consider this information in evaluating the Company's approach to compensating the NEOs. 
The Company's Board of Directors and the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors monitor executive compensation programs of the Company and our competitors and adopt changes in the Company's executive compensation program to reflect the duties of each executive, the competitive market in which the Company competes for talent, as well as general economic, regulatory and legislative developments affecting executive compensation. 
The Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors will continue to emphasize compensation arrangements that align the financial interests of our executives with the near-term critical goals of the Company, balanced against the long-term interests of our stockholders. Please refer to the section entitled "Executive Compensation" of this proxy statement for a detailed discussion of the Company's executive compensation practices and philosophy. 
You have the opportunity to vote for, against or abstain from voting on the resolution approving the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement. The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock voted at the Annual Meeting is required to approve the resolution. 
Accordingly, at the Annual Meeting, we will ask our stockholders to vote on the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT, AND PROXIES EXECUTED AND RETURNED WILL BE SO VOTED UNLESS CONTRARY INSTRUCTIONS ARE INDICATED THEREON.  OTHER BUSINESS 
The Board knows of no business that will come before the Annual Meeting except that indicated above. However, if any other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, it is intended that the persons acting under the proxy will vote thereunder in accordance with their best judgment. 
DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS OF BOARD MEMBERS

In general, written notice of a stockholder proposal or a director nomination for the next annual meeting must be received by the Secretary of the Company not later than 80 days prior to the next annual meeting (or, if less than 90 days' notice of the date of the meeting is given by the Company, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be received by the Secretary of the Company no later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the meeting is first made by the Company), and must contain specified information and conform to certain requirements, as set forth in the bylaws.

Stockholder proposals submitted for consideration at the Annual Meeting must be delivered to the Corporate Secretary no later than the close of business on January 6, 2019, or the tenth day following the public announcement of the Annual Meeting. 
In addition, if a stockholder submits a proposal outside of Rule 14a-8 for the Annual Meeting, and the proposal fails to comply with the advance notice procedures described by the by-laws, then the Company's proxy may confer discretionary authority on the persons being appointed as proxies on behalf of the Board of Directors to vote on the proposal.
