IMPORTANT NOTICE
PROXY MATERIAL FOR
INTERNATIONAL GROWTH AND INCOME FUND
Dear Shareholder:
You recently received a notice relating to the upcoming Special Meeting of Shareholders for International Growth and Income Fund. Due to an error on the part of the fund's proxy mail vendor, the proposal on the notice you received was listed incorrectly. However, the proposal was accurately described in the fund's proxy statement and on all other voting platforms, including the fund's online and telephonic voting platforms.
Please find enclosed a revised notice card, which includes an accurate description of the proposal to be voted on at the fund's upcoming meeting of shareholders. If you have already voted, you need not vote again. If you have not yet voted (or, if you have, but would like to confirm or change your vote), you may do so by following the instructions and using the unique identifier(s) included in the enclosed notice(s).
Note that all costs associated with this additional mailing will be borne by the fund's proxy mailing vendor (and not by the fund or its shareholders).
We sincerely regret any inconvenience this error may have caused, and we thank you for your continued support of American Funds.
