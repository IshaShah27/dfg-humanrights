​ ​ ​ ​  provide voting instructions. NASDAQ rules determine whether proposals presented at the Annual Meeting are routine or non-routine. If a proposal is routine, a broker or other entity holding your shares in "street" name may vote your shares on the proposal without voting instructions from you. If a proposal is non-routine, the broker or other entity may vote your shares on the proposal only if you have provided voting instructions. A "broker non-vote" occurs when the broker or other entity is unable to vote on the proposal because the proposal is non-routine and the owner does not provide instructions. As a result, brokers or other entities holding your shares in "street" name may vote your shares on routine proposals even if no voting instructions are provided by you. Proposals No. 1 and 3 presented at the Annual Meeting are considered non-routine proposals under the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the "NASDAQ"). If your broker does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on Proposals No. 1 and 3, your broker may not vote on those matters. Proposal No. 2 presented at the Annual Meeting is considered a routine proposal under NASDAQ rules. Thus, brokers or other entities holding shares for you in "street" name are permitted to use own discretion in voting on Proposal No. 2 if you do not provide them with voting instructions.   ​ 
​ Q. What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card or voting instruction form? ​​ ​ 
A.
 It generally means your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account. To ensure that all of your shares are voted, please vote using each proxy card or voting instruction form you receive or, if you vote by Internet or telephone, you will need to enter each of your control numbers. Remember, you may vote by telephone, Internet or by signing, dating and returning the proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided with these proxy materials, or by voting by ballot at the Annual Meeting.  ​​

A.

A quorum is necessary in order to conduct the Annual Meeting.

STOCKHOLDER MATTERS 
Stockholder Communications with our Board 
Stockholders and other interested parties may send correspondence by mail to the full Board of Directors or to individual directors. Stockholders should address such correspondence to our Board of Directors or the relevant Board members in care of: SITO Mobile, Ltd., The Newport Corporate Center 100 Town Square Place, Suite 204, Jersey City, New Jersey 07310, Attention: Secretary. 
All such correspondence will be compiled by our Secretary and forwarded as appropriate. In general, correspondence relating to corporate governance issues, long-term corporate strategy or similar substantive matters will be forwarded to our Board of Directors, one of the committees of our Board, or a member thereof for review. Correspondence relating to the ordinary course of business affairs, personal grievances, and matters as to which we tend to receive repetitive or duplicative communications are usually more appropriately addressed by the officers or their designees and will be forwarded to such persons accordingly. 
Stockholder Proposals And Director Nominations 
Stockholder Proposals Submitted Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act 
To be considered for inclusion in next year's Proxy Statement and form of proxy pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, and acted upon at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, stockholder proposals must be submitted in writing to the attention of our Secretary, at our principal office, no later than June 6, 2019. In order to avoid controversy, stockholders should submit proposals by means (including electronic) that permit them to prove the date of delivery. Such proposals also need to comply with Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act and the interpretations thereof, and may be omitted from the Company's proxy materials relating to the 2019 annual meeting if such proposals are not in compliance with applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. 
Director Nominations and Stockholder Proposals Not Submitted Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act 
Our Amended and Restated Bylaws also establish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals and director nominations that are not submitted for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. With respect to such stockholder proposals or director nominations, a stockholder's advance notice must be made in writing, must meet the requirements set forth in our Amended and Restated Bylaws and must be delivered to, or mailed by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, and received by, our Secretary at our principal office no earlier than 5:00 pm on July 19, 2019, and no later than 5:00 pm on August 18, 2019. However, in the event our 2019 annual meeting is scheduled to be held on a date before October 17, 2019, or after January 15, 2020, then such advance notice must be received by us not later than the close of business on the later of  (1) the ninetieth (90th) calendar day prior to our 2019 annual meeting and (2) if the first public announcement of the date of our 2019 annual meeting is less than one hundred (100) days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the 10th calendar day following the day on which we first make public disclosure of the date of the our 2019 annual meeting (or if that day is not a business day for the Company, on the next succeeding business day). 
General Requirements 
Each proposal submitted must be a proper subject for stockholder action at an annual meeting of stockholders, and all proposals and nominations must be submitted to: Secretary, SITO Mobile, Ltd., The Newport Corporate Center, 100 Town Square Place, Suite 204, Jersey City, New Jersey 07310. The stockholder proponent must appear in person to present the proposal or nomination at the related annual meeting or send a qualified representative to present such proposal or nomination. If a stockholder gives notice after the applicable deadlines or otherwise does not satisfy the relevant requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act or our Amended and Restated Bylaws, the stockholder will not be permitted to present the proposal or nomination for a vote at an annual meeting of our stockholders. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Discretionary Authority Pursuant to Rule 14a-4(c) of the Exchange Act 
If a stockholder who wishes to present a proposal before our 2019 annual meeting outside of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act fails to notify us by the required dates indicated above for the receipt of advance notices of stockholder proposals and proposed director nominations, the proxies that our Board solicits for the our 2019 annual meeting will confer discretionary authority on the person named in the proxy to vote on the stockholder's proposal if it is properly brought before that meeting subject to compliance with Rule 14a-4(c) of the Exchange Act. If a stockholder makes timely notification, the proxies may still confer discretionary authority to the person named in the proxy under circumstances consistent with the SEC's proxy rules, including Rule 14a-4(c) of the Exchange Act. 
Director Candidates Recommended by Stockholders 
Our Board, through our Governance and Nominating Committee, will consider nominees recommended by stockholders. A stockholder wishing to recommend a candidate must submit the following documents to the Secretary, SITO Mobile, Ltd., The Newport Corporate Center, 100 Town Square Place, Suite 204, Jersey City, New Jersey 07310: 
 A recommendation that identifies the candidate and provides contact information for that candidate; 
​
 The written consent of the candidate to being named in the Proxy Statement as a nominee and to serve as a director of SITO, if elected; and 
​
 If the candidate is to be evaluated by our Governance and Nominating Committee, the Secretary will request from the candidate a detailed resume, an autobiographical statement explaining the candidate's interest in serving as a director of SITO, a completed statement regarding conflicts of interest, and a waiver of liability for a background check.

To assist it in carrying out its duties, our Board of Directors has delegated certain authority to the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Governance and Nominating Committee. The functions of each of the Committees are described below. 
Audit Committee 
Current members of the Audit Committee are Mr. Bond, Mr. Durden, and Mr. Felsher (Chair). Our Board has not yet determined who will fill the vacancy on the Audit Committee created as a result of Mr. Durden's retirement from the Board at the Annual Meeting. Our Board of Directors has concluded that all the members of our Audit Committee are "independent," as defined by SEC rules adopted pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the listing standards of NASDAQ. The Audit Committee met five times in fiscal 2017. 
The duties and responsibilities of our Audit Committee are set forth in our Audit Committee's charter adopted by our Board of Directors and available on our website (www.sitomobile.com). 
Our Audit Committee oversees the financial reporting process for the Company on behalf of our Board of Directors and has other duties and functions as described in its charter. 
Our Audit Committee serves to assist our Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to: (i) the Company's systems of internal controls regarding finance, accounting, legal and regulatory compliance; (ii) the Company's auditing, accounting and financial reporting processes generally; (iii) the Company's financial statements and other financial information provided by the Company to its stockholders and the public; (iv) the Company's compliance with its legal and regulatory requirements; and (v) the performance of the Company's internal audit department and independent auditors. 
The financial literacy requirements of the SEC require that each member of our Audit Committee be able to read and understand fundamental financial statements. In addition, our Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Felsher qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert," as such term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and has financial sophistication in accordance with the NASDAQ Listing Rules. 
Compensation Committee 
Current members of the Compensation Committee are Mr. Bornstein, Mr. Bough, and Mr. Durden (Chair). Following the Annual Meeting, our Compensation Committee will consist of Mr. Bornstein and Mr. Bough. Our Board of Directors has determined that all of the members of our Compensation Committee are "independent," as defined by SEC rules adopted pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the listing standards of NASDAQ. Our Compensation Committee met three times in fiscal 2017.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
The duties and responsibilities of our Compensation Committee are set forth in our Compensation Committee's charter adopted by our Board of Directors, which is available on our website (www.sitomobile.com). 
Among its duties, our Compensation Committee determines the compensation and benefits paid to our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Revenue Officer. 
Our Compensation Committee reviews and determines salaries, bonuses and other forms of compensation paid to our executive officers and management, approves recipients of stock option awards and establishes the number of shares and other terms applicable to such awards. 
Our Compensation Committee also determines the compensation paid to our Board of Directors, including equity-based awards. 
Governance and Nominating Committee 
Current members of the Governance and Nominating Committee are Mr. Bough, Mr. Durden, Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Felsher (Chair). Following the Annual Meeting, our Governance and Nominating Committee will consist of Mr. Bough, Mr. O'Brien, and Mr. Felsher. Our Board of Directors has determined that all the members of our Governance and Nominating Committee are "independent," as defined by SEC rules adopted pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the listing standards of NASDAQ. Our Governance and Nominating Committee met one time in fiscal 2017. 
The duties and responsibilities of our Governance and Nominating Committee are set forth in our Governance and Nominating Committee's charter adopted by our Board of Directors, and available on our Company's website (www.sitomobile.com). 
Our Governance and Nominating Committee serves to assist our Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to: (i) developing and recommending to our Board a set of corporate governance principles applicable to the Company, and reviewing and reassessing the adequacy of such guidelines annually and recommending to our Board any changes deemed appropriate; (ii) developing policies on the size and composition of our Board; (iii) reviewing possible candidates for Board membership consistent with our Board's criteria for selecting new directors; (iv) performing Board member performance evaluations on an annual basis; (v) annually recommending a slate of nominees to our Board with respect to nominations for our Board at the annual meeting of the Company's stockholders; (vi) reviewing and discussing with our management the program that management has established to monitor compliance with the Company's code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees; and (vii) generally advising our Board (as a whole) on corporate governance matters. 
The process followed by our Governance and Nominating Committee to identify and evaluate candidates includes (i) requests to Board of Director members, our Chief Executive Officer, and others for recommendations; (ii) meetings from time to time to evaluate biographical information and background material relating to potential candidates and their qualifications; and (iii) interviews of selected candidates. Our Governance and Nominating Committee also considers recommendations for nomination to our Board of Directors submitted by stockholders. 
In evaluating the suitability of candidates to serve on our Board of Directors, including stockholder nominees, our Governance and Nominating Committee seeks candidates who are "independent," as defined by SEC rules adopted pursuant to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and who meet certain selection criteria established by our Governance and Nominating Committee.

Director Attendance at Annual Meetings 
Our Board of Directors met 22 times in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Each incumbent director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of board and applicable committee meetings in 2017 during their respective periods of service, with the exception of Jonathan Sandelman, who attended approximately 67% of the meetings of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. 
Our policy is that all directors, absent special circumstances, should attend our annual meeting of stockholders. All of our directors then in office, Mr. Rosenthal, Mr. Bornstein, Mr. Durden, Mr. Fisher, and Ms. Seminara Patton, were in attendance at our annual meeting of stockholders in 2017. 
Code of Ethics 
On December 1, 2004 we adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions. A copy of our Code of Ethics will be provided to any person requesting same without charge. Our Code of Ethics is also available online at http://ir.sitomobile.com/governance-documents. To request a hard copy of our Code of Ethics, please make written request to our Secretary c/o SITO Mobile, Ltd. at 100 Town Square Place, Suite 204, Jersey City, New Jersey 07310. 
Risk Oversight 
Our Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of the Company's risk management efforts. While the full Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for this oversight function, individual committees may consider specific areas of risk from time to time as directed by our Board. Members of management responsible for particular areas of risk for the Company provide presentations, information and updates on risk management efforts as requested by our Board or a Board committee. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our Board is responsible for the selection of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. Our Board does not have a policy on whether or not the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman should be separate and, if they are to be separate, whether the Chairman should be selected from the non-employee directors or be an employee. Currently, Jonathan Bond serves as our Chairman of the Board and Thomas J. Pallack serves as our Chief Executive Officer. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires that our directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock (referred to in this Proxy Statement as the "reporting persons") file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership in our common stock. Such reporting persons are required by the SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. To our knowledge, based solely upon a review of copies of Section 16(a) reports and representations received by us from reporting persons and without conducting any independent investigation of our own, in 2017 all such Section 16(a) filing requirements were met, except that (i) one Form 4 was filed late by one Michael Blanche, resulting in 2 transactions not being reported on a timely basis, (ii) two Form 4s were filed late by Chester Petrow, resulting in five transactions not being reported on a timely basis, (iii) one Form 4 was filed late by former director Betsy J. Bernard, resulting in two transactions not being reported on a timely basis, (iv) one Form 4 was filed late by Thomas J. Pallack, resulting in one transaction not being reported on a timely basis, and (v) one Form 4 was filed late by Steve Bornstein, resulting in five transactions not being reported on a timely basis.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, one Form 3 and one Form 4 were filed late by one B. Bonin Bough, resulting in 1 transaction not being reported on a timely basis, (ii) one Form 3 and one Form 4 were filed late by one Steven G. Felsher, resulting in 1 transaction not being reported on a timely basis, (iii) one Form 3 and one Form 4 were filed late by one Jonathan Bond, resulting in 1 transaction not being reported on a timely basis, (iv) one Form 3 and one Form 4 were filed late by one Brett O'Brien, resulting in 1 transaction not being reported on a timely basis, (v) one Form 3 was filed late by one Aaron Tam, resulting in 1 transaction not being reported on a timely basis, (vi) one Form 4 was filed late by one Thomas Pallack, resulting in 1 transaction not being reported on a timely basis, (vii) one Form 4 was filed late by one William Seagrave, resulting in 1 transactions not being reported on a timely basis, (viii) one Form 4 was filed late by one Chester Petrow, resulting in 1 transaction not being reported on a timely basis, (ix) two Form 4s were filed late by one Mark Del Priore, resulting in 2 transactions not being reported on a timely basis. 
Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions 
The following is a description of transactions since January 1, 2017 to which we have been a party in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000 and in which any of our directors, executive officers, beneficial holders of 5% or more of our capital stock, or entities affiliated with them, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 
On October 3, 2014, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, SITO Mobile Solutions, Inc. and SITO Mobile R&D IP, LLC, entered into a Revenue Sharing and Note Purchase Agreement (the "NPA") with Fortress Credit Co LLC, as collateral agent, and CF DB EZ LLC and Fortress Credit Co LLC. On July 11, 2017, TAR SITO LendCo LLC, an entity owned and controlled by Julian Singer, the son of Karen Singer (sole member of TAR Holdings LLC, which at that time owned more than 5% of our common stock), acquired from Fortress Credit Opportunities V CLO Limited, CF EZ LLC, and CF DB EZ LLC all rights, title and interest as "Purchaser" and "Revenue Participant" under the NPA and related documents. On August 1, 2017, the Company used approximately $4,900,000 of the proceeds of an offering of common stock and warrants to prepay in full all outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest due through the date of repayment and termination fees payable with respect to the senior secured note sold under the NPA (the "Note"). The Company has no further obligations with respect to the Note but will remain obligated to continue to make payments with respect to the Revenue Stream (as defined in the NPA), if and when due, according to the terms of the NPA. According to public filings made in accordance with Section 13 of the Exchange Act, Karen Singer and TAR Holdings LLC currently hold less than 5% of the Company's capital stock. 
On February 20, 2018, the Company and TAR, Mr. Julian Singer, Ms. Karen Singer and Mr. Gary Singer (collectively, the "TAR Group"), entered into a settlement agreement, pursuant to which the NPA was terminated and discharged and all pending litigation between the Company and the members of the TAR Group was dismissed with prejudice in exchange for a lump sum payment of  $3.5 million from the Company to the TAR Group. No future amounts are due with respect to the NPA or the Revenue Stream and the lump sum payment has been recorded as of December 31, 2017. 
Policies and Procedures for Approving Transactions with Related Persons 
The independent members of our Board of Directors are responsible for reviewing and approving related person transactions, either in advance or when we become aware of a related person transaction that was not reviewed and approved in advance; however, our Board of Directors has not yet adopted a written policy or procedures governing its approval of transactions with related persons. During 2017, all related party transactions were reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors, and each related person who was at the time serving as a director abstained from voting on the particular transaction. 
Indemnification Agreements 
We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our current directors, executive officers and certain other officers. The indemnification agreements and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Director Independence 
The NASDAQ Listing Rules require a majority of a listed company's board of directors to consist of independent directors within one year of listing. In addition, the NASDAQ Listing Rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company's audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent and that audit committee members also satisfy independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 
Our Board undertook a review of the composition of the Board and its committees and the independence of each director. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our Board has determined that each of our directors, with the exception of Mr. Pallack, our Chief Executive Officer, is an "independent director" as defined under the NASDAQ Listing Rules. Our Board also determined that Messrs. Bond, Durden, and Felsher, who serve on our Audit Committee, Messrs. Bornstein, Bough, and Durden, who serve on our Compensation Committee, and Messrs. Bough, Durden, O'Brien, and Felsher, who serve on our Governance and Nominating Committee, satisfy the independence standards for such committees established by the SEC and the NASDAQ Listing Rules, as applicable. In making the independence determinations set forth above, our Board considered the relationships that each such non-employee director has with our Company and all other facts and circumstances our Board deemed relevant in determining independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers. 
Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings 
During the past ten years, none of our directors, executive officers, promoters, control persons, or nominees has been: 
 the subject of any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; 
​
 convicted in a criminal proceeding or is subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);

​
 found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law; 
​
 the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of (a) any federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation; (b) any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order; or (c) any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or 
​
 the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a member.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 
The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of our common stock by each of our directors and director nominees, each of our named executive officers, each person known to us to beneficially own 5% or more of our common stock, and all of our officers and directors as a group. Except as otherwise indicated, all shares are owned directly, and percentages shown in the table below are based on 25,437,536 shares outstanding as of the Record Date. We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities. In addition, the rules attribute beneficial ownership of securities as of a particular date to persons who hold options or warrants to purchase shares of common stock and that are exercisable within 60 days of such date. These shares are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding those options or warrants for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person, but they are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to the following table, each person named in the table has sole voting and investment power (subject to applicable community property laws) and that person's address is c/o SITO Mobile, Ltd., 100 Town Square Place, Suite 204, Jersey City, New Jersey 07310.

Fiscal Year 2018 (To Date) 
On July 23, 2018 (the "Resignation Date"), Mark Del Priore resigned as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Following the resignation of Mr. Del Priore, the Board appointed William Seagrave, Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and Aaron Tam, who served as the Company's Finance Manager, as interim Co-Chief Financial Officers of the Company, on July 24, 2018. The compensation of Mr. Seagrave, who is serving as Chief Operating Officer of the Company, did not change as a result of his appointment as interim Co-Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Tam's compensation as interim Co-Chief Financial Officer consists of  (i) an annual base salary of  $200,000 and (ii) a one-time cash bonus of  $50,000. On September 11, 2018, the Company entered into a separation agreement and mutual release with Mr. Del Priore (the "Separation Agreement").  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the Company will (i) continue to pay Mr. Del Priore his base salary of  $225,000 per annum for a period of twelve months immediately following the Resignation Date, which amount shall be payable in accordance with the Company's standard payroll practices, (ii) pay Mr. Del Priore an amount equal to $225,000, which amount shall be paid in one lump sum in calendar year 2019, at the time annual bonuses are paid to the Company's other senior executives (or, if no such bonuses are paid by June 30, 2019, then on or before that date), (iii) accelerate the vesting of the options granted to Mr. Del Priore pursuant to his employment agreement to purchase an aggregate of 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at an exercise price of  $6.01 per share, which will remain exercisable until December 11, 2018, (iv) accelerate the vesting of a portion of restricted stock units granted to Mr. Del Priore pursuant to his employment agreement with respect to a total of 64,397 shares of the Company's common stock, while the remainder of Mr. Del Priore's unvested restricted stock units were forfeited, and (v) waive the applicable premium otherwise payable for continuation of health insurance coverage for Mr. Del Priore, his spouse, and eligible dependents under The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act for twelve months. The Separation Agreement contains confidentiality and non-solicitation restrictions, which will apply for a one-year period following the effective date of the Separation Agreement, mutual non-disparagement provisions and a mutual release. 
Best Practices 
The following compensation decisions and practices demonstrate how the Company's new 2017 executive compensation program reflects best practices and reinforces the Company's culture and values: 
 Emphasis on At-Risk Pay — For our named executive officers, the majority of their total compensation opportunity is contingent upon the Company's financial performance and appreciation in the market price of our common stock. 
​
 Equity-Based Compensation — Because the majority of the 2017 total compensation opportunity for our named executive officers is in the form of restricted stock units ("RSUs"), which are market-based, and stock options, we believe that the interests of our management is properly aligned with the long-term financial interests of the Company's stockholders. Because the RSUs granted to our named executive officers only vest upon sustained performance of our common stock at prices higher than the Company's current stock price, subject to continued service, we believe our management is properly incentivized to increase sustainable stockholder value. 
​
 Rigorous Performance Metrics — Both the bonus payments and the performance-based RSUs awarded to our new management team, including the named executive officers, are earned based on achieving rigorous strategic and financial performance goals. The 2017 bonus payments to our named executive officers are contingent on two metrics tied to financial and strategic performance: (i) revenue earned during the six months ended December 31, 2017 and (ii) the number of  "Data Deals" (as described below in the "Annual Bonuses" section) consummated by our management team during such period. Vesting of RSUs for our named executive officers is contingent on the price of our common stock consistently remaining above certain thresholds for 65 consecutive trading days. As such, we believe that performance targets for annual bonuses incentivize strong short-term performance with respect to operational metrics and performance targets applicable to our RSUs are intended to be challenging over a longer time period. 
​
 No Excise Tax Gross-Up Payments — None of the named executive officers are entitled to gross-up payments in the event that any payments or benefits provided to her or him by the Company are subject to the golden parachute excise tax under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
​
 Derivatives and Hedging Policy — The Company prohibits employees (including our named executive officers) and directors from engaging in hedging transactions with respect to any equity securities of the Company held by them. 
​
 Policy Against Pledging — The Company prohibits associates, employees (including our named executive officers) and directors from pledging any equity securities of the Company held by them.

Compensation Process and Objectives 
The Company's business is to develop customized, data-driven advertising solutions for brands and provide privacy-compliant data and strategic insights. We harness our proprietary location-based marketing intelligence platform to provide advertisement delivery, measurement and attribution services and consumer insights to brands, advertising agencies, out-of-home advertisers, media companies and non-media companies that utilize consumer insights for strategic decision-making purposes. Our products, fueled by our robust locational data, allow marketers and executive decision makers to better understand the movement and behaviors of their existing and prospective consumers. 
To be successful, the Company must attract and retain key creative and management talents who thrive in this environment. The Company sets high goals and expects superior performance from these individuals. The Company's executive compensation structure is designed to support this culture, encourage a high degree of teamwork, and reward individuals for achieving challenging financial and operational objectives that we believe lead to the creation of sustained, long-term stockholder value. 
The Company's executive compensation and benefit programs are designed to: 
 Drive high performance to achieve financial goals and create long-term stockholder value; 
​
 Reflect the strong team-based culture of the Company; and 
​
 Provide compensation opportunities that are competitive with those offered by similar marketing intelligence platforms and other companies with which the Company competes for high caliber executive talent. 
​
Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for recommending to our Board the compensation of our executive officers. Members of the Compensation committee are appointed by our Board. The Compensation Committee seeks to ensure sound executive compensation practices to adhere to pay-for-performance while appropriately managing risk and aligning our executive compensation program with long-term stockholder interests. 
Elements of our Compensation Program 
The primary elements of our 2017 executive compensation structure are base salary, annual bonuses, equity incentive awards and certain employee benefits. Each principal element of our executive compensation program for 2017 along with the objectives of each element are summarized in the following table and described in more detail below.

Base Salary 
The base salary component of executive officer compensation is intended to provide a competitive, stable level of minimum compensation to each officer commensurate with the executive's role, experience and duties. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves base salaries for our named executive officers based on several factors, including the individual's experience, responsibilities, performance, expected future contribution, our expected financial performance and salaries of similarly situated executives of our public peers in our industry. The initial base salaries of our named executive officers are set forth in each such executive's employment agreement. 
In July 2017, following the appointment of Messrs. Pallack, Seagrave and Del Priore in June 2017, the Company entered into employment agreements with each such executive, which are described below (referred to as the "Employment Agreements"). The Employment Agreements set forth initial base salaries, which are set forth in the table below, that were established based on an evaluation of the factors described above, our desire to reward and retain the key executives who we believe are instrumental to our success, and the competitiveness of base salaries based upon a review of publicly available data for our competitors. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive   ​ ​  Base Salary   ​ 
 Thomas J. Pallack   ​ ​ ​ $ 350,000 ​ ​ 
 William A. Seagrave   ​ ​ ​ $ 300,000 ​ ​ 
 Mark Del Priore   ​ ​ ​ $ 225,000 ​ ​ 
[END TABLE]
Prior to his resignation, Mr. Hug received an annual base salary of  $350,000, which was reviewed annually. Mr. O'Connell was paid an annualized base salary of  $350,000 for his service as Interim Chief Executive Officer. 
Annual Bonuses 
The Compensation Committee historically awarded discretionary cash bonuses to reward performance. For 2017, the Employment Agreements with Messrs. Pallack, Seagrave and Del Priore established an incentive bonus opportunity based on Company performance. For 2018 and subsequent years, the Employment Agreements provide that Messrs. Pallack, Seagrave and Del Priore are eligible for incentive bonuses, however, due to Mr. Del Priore's departure prior to the end of the 2018 fiscal year, he is not eligible for a bonus for 2018. Tying a portion of total compensation to annual Company performance permits us to adjust the performance measures each year to reflect changing objectives and those that may be of special importance for a particular year. Through this program, we seek to provide an appropriate amount of pre-established short-term cash compensation that is at-risk and tied to the achievement of certain short-term performance goals. Due to their respective departures from the Company, Messrs. Hug and O'Connell were not eligible for bonuses with respect to 2017. 
The 2017 bonus payments to Messrs. Pallack, Seagrave and Del Priore are contingent on two metrics tied to financial and strategic performance: (i) revenue earned during the six months ended December 31, 2017 and (ii) the number of  "Data Deals" consummated by our management team during such period. TABLE OF CONTENTS
The performance objectives and the associated target bonus amounts as a percent of salary are described in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
In the event that the Company's total revenue during the six months ended December31, 2017 are at least:  ​ ​  And the Company executes not less than the number of Data Deals (as defined below) specified below:   ​ ​  Executive shall be entitled to a cash bonus of the following percentage of Executive's Base Salary:   ​ 
$22.0 million  ​ ​  Two(2)  ​ ​  50%   ​ 
$22.5 million  ​ ​  Three(3)  ​ ​  100%   ​ 
$25.0 million  ​ ​  Four(4)  ​ ​  200%  ​ 
[END TABLE]
These performance objectives reflect the Board's objectives for the Company's new management following their appointment in June 2017. In particular, the Compensation Committee's revenue targets reflected a desire for significant revenue growth over the prior year and a strategic transition from our traditional ad placement business in favor of our data business. The maximum revenue target for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was set at approximately 86% of the revenue target for the entire prior year. 
Data Deals, as defined in each of the Employment Agreements, refers to either the sourcing of new data or data models that are not generally available in the Company's data brokerage ecosystem and that are then available for inclusion in the Company's data analytics, included in the Company's sales packages and solutions for clients, used to create new avenues of the Company's analytic results for client leverage, or the packaging of the Company's data models, analytics, and insights for direct inclusion in sales and solutions to clients. Additionally, Data Deals include the multi-year licensing of the Company's data assets to third parties for inclusion in their data and marketing assets and for which the Company receives periodic licensing revenue and for which the Company must provide periodic data updates. 
The performance objectives are the same for the entire management team, reflecting our high value placed upon team performance. The actual bonus amounts vary only by differences in the base salary to which the above percentages are applied. The table below outlines the salaries and possible bonus amounts for each eligible named executive officer. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive   ​ ​  Base Salary   ​ ​  Bonus at 50% of Base Salary   ​ ​  Bonus at 100% of Base Salary   ​ ​  Bonus at 200% of Base Salary   ​ 
 Thomas J. Pallack   ​ ​ ​ $ 350,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 175,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 350,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 700,000 ​ ​ 
 William A. Seagrave   ​ ​ ​ $ 300,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 150,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 300,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 600,000 ​ ​ 
 Mark Del Priore   ​ ​ ​ $ 225,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 112,500 ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 225,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 450,000 ​ ​ 
[END TABLE]
The Company's revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2017, excluding certain joint venture revenue, was $25.6 million and the Compensation Committee certified that the Company had executed four Data Deals during the same period. As a result, each of Messrs. Pallack, Seagrave and Del Priore were awarded bonuses at 200% of target. In order to allow the Company to preserve cash for strategic purposes, each of Messrs. Pallack, Seagrave and Del Priore elected to receive (i) 25% of such bonus in cash and (ii) 75% of their 2017 bonuses in the form of fully-vested shares of common stock (with the number of shares determined based on an assumed price of  $4.02 per share, representing the share price on March 29, 2018). 
The bonus opportunities for Messrs. Pallack and Seagrave with respect to 2018 are contingent on Company performance as measured by revenue and EBITDA (defined as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense) earned during the year ending December 31, 2018. Threshold, target and maximum goals, along with relative weighting, are set forth in the table below. The target payout level was designed to be achievable with strong management performance and the maximum level was designed to encourage and reward our named executive officers for outstanding performance. Due to Mr. Del Priore's departure prior to the close of the 2018 fiscal year, he is not entitled to a bonus in respect of 2018. 
The approach to goal setting for 2018 bonuses involved a process of reviewing, among other things, our prior year's financial performance and our short-term and long-term strategic objectives. We also took into account the need for setting goals that are challenging yet reasonably achievable so as to provide a competitive pay package necessary for the retention of our talent.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
The performance objectives and the associated target bonus amounts as a percentage of salary are described in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 EBITDA   ​ ​ ​ ​ 40% ​ ​ ​  $1.0 million   ​ ​  $3.0 million   ​ ​  $4.0 million  ​ 
[END TABLE]
All bonuses for 2018 are subject to continuous service through the date of payment and certification of performance by the Compensation Committee. 
Equity Incentive Awards 
We believe that equity awards are an important component of our executive compensation program. Equity compensation aligns our executives' and stockholders' interests by linking rewards with achievement of return to our stockholders based on our long-term growth plan. 
In connection with the Employment Agreements, during 2017 we made one-time equity awards to each of Messrs. Pallack, Seagrave and Del Priore, which consisted of  (i) options to purchase shares of our common stock and (ii) market-based RSUs, which will vest only in the event that the average closing price per share of our common stock reaches certain targets described below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive   ​ ​  Stock Options ($6.01 Exercise Price)   ​ ​  RSUs   ​ 
 Thomas J. Pallack   ​ ​ ​ ​ 400,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 1,028,050 ​ ​ 
 William A. Seagrave   ​ ​ ​ ​ 100,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 225,468 ​ ​ 
 Mark Del Priore   ​ ​ ​ ​ 100,000 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 225,468 ​ ​ 
[END TABLE]
The stock options vest ratably over four years, beginning on July 24, 2018, subject to continuous service, and have an exercise price of  $6.01 based upon the closing price of a share of our common stock on the date of grant, which we believe will properly incentivize management to create and sustain stockholder value over a prolonged time period. 
The RSUs vest only in the event that the average closing price per share of our common stock reaches certain targets for a period of 65 consecutive trading days, subject to continued service, as set forth in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Share Price Target Achieved and Sustained for 65 Consecutive Trading Days   ​ ​  Percentage of Award Vested   ​ 
 $7.00 per share   ​ ​  20%   ​ 
 $10.00 per share   ​ ​  an additional 30%   ​ 
 $15.00 per share   ​ ​  an additional 50%  ​ 
[END TABLE]
We believe that the vesting conditions of the RSUs incentivize significant growth in stockholder value, particularly the per share price targets of  $10.00 and $15.00, which are set significantly higher than the historic trading value of our common stock. 
Due to their respective departures from the Company, Messrs. Hug and O'Connell did not receive grants of equity compensation in 2017. Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Del Priore's Separation Agreement, the Company (i) accelerated the vesting of the options granted to Mr. Del Priore pursuant to his employment agreement to purchase an aggregate of 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value of  $0.001 per share, at an exercise price of  $6.01 per share, which will remain exercisable until December 11, 2018 and (ii) accelerated the vesting of a portion of restricted stock units granted to Mr. Del Priore pursuant to his employment agreement with respect to a total of 64,397 shares of the Company's common stock. The remainder of Mr. Del Priore's unvested restricted stock were forfeited. TABLE OF CONTENTS

In 2017, the Company made a one-time grant of market share-price-based RSUs to each of Messrs. Pallack, Seagrave and Del Priore pursuant to their respective Employment Agreements as described in "Elements of our Compensation Program — Equity Incentive Awards" above. Assuming that the highest level of performance conditions is met for the RSUs, a maximum of 1,028,050 shares of our common stock may be issued to Mr. Pallack, and 225,468 shares of our common stock may be issued to each of Messrs. Seagrave and Del Priore. The value of these awards on the grant date, if we were to assume that the highest level of performance conditions will be achieved, would be $2,091,461 for Mr. Pallack and, $458,691 for each of Messrs. Seagrave and Del Priore. The assumptions used by the Company in calculating these amounts were determined utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model which requires us to make judgments on assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield, expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but those estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future. Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Del Priore's Separation Agreement, the Company accelerated the vesting of a portion of restricted stock units granted to Mr. Del Priore pursuant to his employment agreement to a total of 64,397 shares of the Company's common stock. The remainder of Mr. Del Priore's unvested restricted stock were forfeited.

PROPOSAL NO. 1
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Board of Directors currently consists of seven directors. Each of our current directors, other than Mr. Michael Durden, is a nominee in the current election. Mr. Durden will retire from the Board at the Annual Meeting following the expiration of his current term. Our Board of Directors has no immediate plans to fill the vacancy created by Mr. Durden's departure and, as a result, will decrease the size of our Board of Directors to six effective as of the expiration of Mr. Durden's current term at the Annual Meeting. 
Upon the recommendation of our Governance and Nominating Committee, our Board of Directors has nominated each of Jonathan Bond, Steve Bornstein, Bonin Bough, Steven Felsher, Brett O'Brien, and Thomas J. Pallack to serve as our directors until our next annual meeting of stockholders and until their respective successors are elected and have been qualified or until their earlier resignation, removal or death. Each nominee is a current director standing for re-election. 
The nominees recommended by our Board have consented to serving as nominees for election to our Board, to being named in this Proxy Statement and to serving as members of our Board if elected by the Company's stockholders. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Company has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected as a director. However, if for any reason a nominee becomes unable to serve or for good cause will not serve if elected, our Board, upon the recommendation of its Governance and Nominating Committee, may designate substitute nominees, in which event the shares represented by proxies returned to us will be voted for such substitute nominees. If any substitute nominees are so designated, the Company will file an amended proxy statement or additional soliciting material that, as applicable, identifies the substitute nominees, discloses that such nominees have consented to being named in the amended proxy statement or additional soliciting material and to serve as directors if elected, and includes certain biographical and other information about such nominees required by the applicable rules promulgated by the SEC.

Unless otherwise instructed, the persons named in the enclosed proxy card will vote to elect Jonathan Bond, Steve Bornstein, Bonin Bough, Steven Felsher, Brett O'Brien, and Thomas J. Pallack to our Board, unless, by marking the appropriate space on the proxy card, the stockholder instructs that he, she or it withholds authority from the proxy holder to vote with respect to a specified candidate(s). 
So that you have information concerning the independence of the process by which our Board of Directors selected the nominees, we confirm, as required by the SEC, that (1) there are no family relationships among any of the nominees or among any of the nominees and any officer and (2) there is no arrangement or understanding between any nominee and any other person pursuant to which the nominee was selected.

The Governance and Nominating Committee considers the particular qualifications and experience of directors standing for re-election and potential nominees for election and strives to nominate a Board that has expertise in a number of areas critical to the Company.

Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services 
Pursuant to applicable law, and as set forth in the terms of its charter, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for appointing, setting compensation for, and overseeing the work of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Any audit or non-audit services proposed to be performed are considered by and, if deemed appropriate, approved by the Audit Committee in advance of the performance of such services.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
The Audit Committee oversees the financial reporting process for the Company on behalf of the Board of Directors, and has other duties and functions as described in its charter. 
Company management has the primary responsibility for the Company's financial statements and the reporting process. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing the Company's financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
In this context, then-serving members of the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the Company's management. The Audit Committee has discussed with our independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees), which includes, among other items, matters related to the conduct of the audit of our annual financial statements. 
The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding such independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence from us and our management. In addition, the Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services by our independent registered public accounting firm in fiscal year 2017 was compatible with maintaining our registered public accounting firm's independence and has concluded that it was. 
Based on its review of the audited financial statements and the various discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to our Board of Directors that our audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
Respectfully submitted by the Audit Committee,

PROPOSAL NO. 3
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS (SAY ON PAY) 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to vote to approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers, commonly referred to as the "say-on-pay" vote. In accordance with the requirements of the SEC, we are providing our stockholders with an opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers' compensation. Although this advisory vote is nonbinding, our board of directors and compensation committee will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding our named executive officer compensation and related executive compensation programs. 
We encourage stockholders to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis in this Proxy Statement, which describes the processes our compensation committee used to determine the structure and amounts of the compensation of our named executive officers in 2017 and how our executive compensation philosophy, policies and procedures operate and are designed to achieve our compensation objectives. The Compensation Committee and our Board of Directors believe that our executive compensation strikes the appropriate balance between utilizing responsible, measured pay practices and effectively incentivizing our named executive officers to dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our stockholders. 
Following a vote by our stockholders in 2013 on how frequently the Company should conduct say-on-pay votes, the Company currently conducts say-on-pay votes on a triennial basis. In the proxy statement for our annual meeting of stockholders in 2019, we will again ask stockholders to vote on how frequently we should conduct a say-on-pay vote. 
Required Vote 
Approval of the compensation of our named executive officers will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our Common Stock, present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter, provided that a quorum exists. In the absence of your voting instructions, your broker may not vote your shares in its discretion with respect to the approval of the executive compensation of our named executive officers.
