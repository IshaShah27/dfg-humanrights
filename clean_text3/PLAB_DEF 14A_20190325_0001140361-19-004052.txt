[BEGIN TABLE]
 5.2   [a]   Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 5.2[b] and 6.3, and to the other terms and conditions of the Plan, in each offering under the Plan, each Eligible Employee on an Offering Date shall be offered the right during the Subscription Period as provided in Section 6.2, to subscribe to purchase such number of Shares as the percentage designated by the Plan Committee for such offering (not to exceed 5%) of his Compensation would buy, at a price equal to the product of (i) the fair market value of a Share on the Offering Date, multiplied by (ii) the Purchase Price percentage utilized under Section 5.3 hereof.  
     [b]   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Sub-Section [a] of this Section 5.2, no Eligible Employee shall be eligible to subscribe for Shares in an Offering if, immediately after he would subscribe for such Shares, such subscription would permit his rights to purchase shares of Common Stock under all employee stock purchase plans of the Company to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 (or such other maximum amounts as may be prescribed from time to time under the Code) of the fair market value of such shares (determined as of the Offering Date for such Offering) for each calendar year in which such subscription would be outstanding at any time. For purposes of this limitation the provisions of Section 423[b][8] of the Code shall be applicable.  
[END TABLE]
A- 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 7.2   [a]   The aggregate Purchase Price for Shares shall be paid by payroll deductions in equal amounts over a period of 24 months (or such shorter period as shall be determined by the Plan Committee in accordance with the Plan) from the Offering Date. The period over which such payroll deductions are to be made in hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Period".  
     [b]   Such payroll deductions with respect to an Offering shall commence as soon as practicable after the receipt of the Company of the executed Subscription Agreement authorizing such payroll deductions, and shall cease upon the earlier of the termination of the Payment Period or payment in full of the Purchase Price for such Shares. A Participant may cancel his subscription to the extent provided for in Article X, but no other change in terms of his Subscription Agreement may be made during the Payment Period and, in particular, in no event may a Participant change the amount of his payroll deductions under such Subscription Agreement. All payroll deductions withheld from a Participant under a Subscription Agreement shall be credited to his account under the Plan. In the event that payroll deductions are simultaneously being made with respect to more than one Subscription Agreement, the aggregate amount of such payroll deductions at any payday shall be credited first toward the payment for Shares subscribed for in the earliest Offering. A Participant may not make any separate cash payment into his account, provided, however, that a Participant who has been deemed to be in the employ of the Company while on an Authorized Leave of Absence without pay during the Payment Period, may upon his return to the actual employ of the Company, make a cash payment into his account in an amount not exceeding the aggregate of the payroll deductions which would have been made during such Authorized Leave of Absence.

     [c]   All funds representing payroll deductions for the accounts of Participants will, except as provided in Section 7.3, be paid into the general funds of the Company. No interest will be paid or accrued under any circumstances on any funds withheld by the Company as payroll deductions pursuant to this Section 7.2 or on any other funds paid to the Company for purchases of Shares under the Plan.
