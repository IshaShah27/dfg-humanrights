PROXY STATEMENT
General
This proxy statement ("Proxy Statement") is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of GlobalSCAPE, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("GlobalSCAPE," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our"), of proxies from the stockholders of GlobalSCAPE to be used at GlobalSCAPE's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"). In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") rules, instead of mailing a printed copy of our Proxy Statement, annual report and other materials relating to the Annual Meeting to stockholders, we intend to mail a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice of Internet Availability"), which advises that the proxy materials are available on the Internet to stockholders. We intend to commence distribution of the Notice of Internet Availability on or about March 29, 2019. Stockholders receiving a Notice of Internet Availability by mail will not receive a printed copy of proxy materials unless they so request. Instead, the Notice of Internet Availability will instruct stockholders as to how they may access and review proxy materials on the Internet. Stockholders who receive a Notice of Internet Availability by mail who prefer to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, including a proxy card or voting instruction card, should follow the instructions for requesting these materials included in the Notice of Internet Availability. Please note that, although our proxy materials are available on our website, no other information contained on the website is incorporated by reference in or considered to be a part of this Proxy Statement.
This process is designed to expedite stockholders' receipt of proxy materials, lower the cost of the Annual Meeting, and help conserve natural resources. If you previously elected to receive our proxy materials electronically, you will continue to receive these materials in that manner unless you elect otherwise. However, if you prefer to receive printed proxy materials, please follow the instructions included in the Notice of Internet Availability.
Date, Time and Place of Annual Meeting
The Annual Meeting will be held at 9:00 a.m., Central Daylight Time, on May 9, 2019, at GlobalSCAPE's office at 4500 Lockhill-Selma Road, Suite 150, San Antonio, Texas 78249. Please call us at (210) 801-8489 if you need assistance with directions to our office.
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum
The Board has fixed the close of business on March 12, 2019 as the record date (the "Record Date") for GlobalSCAPE stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 17,187,515 shares of GlobalSCAPE common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), outstanding, which were held by approximately 1,728 holders of record. Stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held as of the Record Date. There are no cumulative voting rights.
The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock issued and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, totaling 8,593,758 shares, must be present in person or by proxy to establish a quorum for business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting. Whether you attend the Annual Meeting in person, complete, sign and return the proxy card or vote via the Internet or telephone, your shares will be counted as present at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are included for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. If you own shares through a bank or broker in street name, you may instruct your bank or broker how to vote your shares. A "broker non-vote" occurs when you fail to provide your bank or broker with voting instructions and the bank or broker does not have the discretionary authority to vote your shares on a particular proposal because the proposal is not a routine matter under the New York Stock Exchange rules. Please consider the following voting matters specific to each proposal on the ballot:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Proposal 1 (election of directors) is not considered a routine matter under New York Stock Exchange rules. Your bank or broker will not have discretionary authority to vote your shares held in street name on this proposal. A broker non-vote may also occur if your broker fails to vote your shares for any reason.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Proposal 2 (ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm) is considered a routine matter under New York Stock Exchange rules. Your bank or broker will have discretionary authority to vote your shares held in street name on this proposal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Proposal 3 (advisory vote on executive compensation) is an advisory vote and must receive the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total votes cast on the proposal in order to be approved. Broker non-votes are not considered votes cast "for" or "against" this proposal and will have no effect.  
[END TABLE]
If sufficient votes for approval of the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting have not been received prior to the meeting date, GlobalSCAPE may postpone or adjourn the Annual Meeting in order to solicit additional votes. The form of proxy being solicited by this Proxy Statement provides the authority for the proxy holders, in their discretion, to vote the stockholders' shares with respect to a postponement or adjournment of the Annual Meeting. At any postponed or adjourned meeting, proxies received pursuant to this Proxy Statement will be voted in the same manner described in this Proxy Statement with respect to the original meeting.
Stockholders of Record and Beneficial Owners
Many of our stockholders hold their shares through a broker, bank, or other agent rather than directly in their own names. Following are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Stockholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. Access to our proxy materials is being provided directly to you by us. As a stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to us or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Beneficial Owner. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank, you are considered the beneficial owner of the shares held in "street name." Access to these proxy materials is being provided by your broker or bank who is considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or bank on how to vote. You are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Attendance and Voting by Proxy
If you are a stockholder whose shares are registered in your name, you may vote your shares by one of the following four methods:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Vote in person, by attending the Annual Meeting. We can give you a proxy card or a ballot when you arrive, if requested.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Vote by Internet, by going to the web address, www.proxyvote.com, and following the instructions for Internet voting. Please note that the deadline for voting electronically on the Internet is 11:59 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on May 8, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Vote by telephone, by calling the number printed on your voting document.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Vote by mail, by completing, signing, dating, and mailing the proxy card mailed to you in the envelope provided. If you vote by Internet, please do not mail your proxy card. If you vote by mail, your signed proxy card must be received before the Annual Meeting to be counted at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in "street name" (through a broker, bank, or other agent), you should have received a separate voting instruction form or you may vote by telephone or on the Internet as instructed by your broker, bank or other agent.
PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOUR SHARES ARE HELD OF RECORD BY A BROKER, BANK OR OTHER AGENT AND YOU WANT TO VOTE AT THE ANNUAL MEETING, YOU MUST FIRST OBTAIN A LEGAL PROXY ISSUED IN YOUR NAME FROM THE RECORD HOLDER. YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO VOTE IN PERSON AT THE ANNUAL MEETING WITHOUT THE LEGAL PROXY.
The proxies identified on the back of the proxy card will vote the shares of which you are stockholder of record in accordance with your instructions. If you sign and return your proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, the proxies will vote your shares as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● "FOR" the nominated director.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Weaver and Tidwell, LLP as GlobalSCAPE's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● "FOR" approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of GlobalSCAPE's executives named in the Summary Compensation Table in this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
The giving of a proxy will not affect your right to vote in person if you decide to attend the Annual Meeting.
If for any reason the director nominee does not stand for election, any proxies we receive may be voted for a substitute nominee in place of the nominee who does not stand. We have no reason to expect that the director nominee will not stand for election. If any matters other than those addressed on the proxy card are properly presented for action at the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the proxy card will have the discretion to vote on those matters in their best judgment unless authorization is withheld. We are not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting other than as set forth herein.
Revocation of Proxy
If you are a stockholder of record, whether you vote by Internet, by telephone, or by mail, you may change or revoke your proxy before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Submitting a new proxy card bearing a later date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Voting again by the Internet at a later time.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Giving written notice before the Annual Meeting to our Secretary at the address set forth on the cover of this Proxy Statement stating that you are revoking your proxy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Attending the Annual Meeting and voting your shares in person.  
[END TABLE]
Please note that your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not alone serve to revoke your proxy. If you own shares held in street name, you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your broker, bank or nominee.
Vote Requirements
Proposal 1: Election of Directors
Directors are elected by a majority of the votes of the holders of shares of Common Stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Under Delaware law, votes that are withheld from a director's election will be counted toward a quorum but will not affect the outcome of the vote on the election of a director. An abstention is treated as entitled to vote and, therefore, has the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the proposal. Broker non-votes will not be taken into account in determining the outcome of the election. Unless otherwise instructed or unless authority to vote is withheld, the proxy card accompanying these materials will be voted "FOR" election the director nominee.
Proposal 2: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
With respect to Proposal 2, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote is required to ratify the appointment of Weaver and Tidwell, LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. An abstention is treated as entitled to vote and, therefore, has the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the proposal. Since this proposal is considered a "routine" matter, brokers will be permitted to vote on behalf of their clients if no voting instructions are furnished. Unless otherwise instructed or unless authority to vote is withheld, the proxy card accompanying these materials will be voted "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Weaver and Tidwell, LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.
Proposal 3: Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
With respect to Proposal 3, the advisory vote on executive compensation, an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" this proposal, and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. Brokers, as nominees for the beneficial owner, may not exercise discretion in voting on this matter and may only vote on this proposal as instructed by the beneficial owner of the shares. The outcome of this proposal is advisory in nature and is non-binding.
Important Note Regarding NYSE Rules
If a broker does not receive instructions from the beneficial owner of shares held in street name for certain types of proposals, the broker must indicate on the proxy that it does not have authority to vote such shares (a "broker non-vote") as to such proposals. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, if your broker does not receive instructions from you, your broker will not be able to vote your shares in the election of directors. Therefore, it is important that you provide voting instructions to your broker.
Solicitation of Proxies
Proxies will be solicited by mail and the Internet. Proxies may also be solicited personally, or by telephone, fax, or other means by the directors, officers, and employees of GlobalSCAPE. Directors, officers, and employees soliciting proxies will receive no extra compensation but may be reimbursed for related out-of-pocket expenses. GlobalSCAPE will make arrangements with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries to send the proxy materials to beneficial owners. GlobalSCAPE will, upon request, reimburse these brokerage houses, custodians, and other persons for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in doing so. GlobalSCAPE will pay the cost of solicitation of proxies.
PROPOSAL ONE  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
GlobalSCAPE's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation divides the Board of Directors into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms, with one class to be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders. At the Annual Meeting, one Class II director is to be elected for a term of three years, to hold office until the expiration of his term in 2022, or until a successor shall have been qualified and elected. The nominee for election is Dr. Thomas E. Hicks, whose current term expires in 2019.
Assuming the presence of a quorum, the nominees for director who receive the most votes will be elected. The form of proxy provides a means for stockholders to vote for or to withhold authority to vote for the nominee for director. If a stockholder executes and returns a proxy but does not specify how the shares represented by such stockholder's proxy are to be voted, such shares will be voted FOR the election of the nominee for director. In determining whether this proposal has received the requisite number of affirmative votes, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted and will have no effect.
The following table sets forth the name and age of each nominee, director and executive officer as of the date of this Proxy Statement, including such person's principal occupation during at least the past five years, the experiences and skills that led to the conclusion that each nominee and director should serve as director and, if applicable, the year he began serving as a director of GlobalSCAPE. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers.

Vote Required
The director nominee receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be elected as a director.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF THE NOMINEE TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. 
Board Meetings and Attendance
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Board of Directors held 12 meetings. Separate from the full Board of Directors' meetings, there were 11 Audit Committee meetings, 3 Nominating Committee meetings, and 5 Compensation Committee meetings. During 2018, each of our current directors attended at least 75% of all Board of Directors and applicable Committee meetings.
During 2018, our directors received compensation for service to GlobalSCAPE as a director. See "Executive Compensation – Compensation of Directors." GlobalSCAPE encourages, but does not require, directors to attend the annual meeting of stockholders. At GlobalSCAPE's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, all members of the Board of Directors were present.
Board Leadership Structure
The Board of Directors believes it is in the best interests of the Company to separate the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. This structure ensures a greater role for the directors in the oversight of management and the Company and promotes active participation of the directors in setting meeting agendas and establishing Board priorities and procedures. Further, this structure permits the Chief Executive Officer to focus on the management of the Company's day-to-day operations.
Board Independence
A majority of the Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. Alpert, Mann, Morgan, and Webb and Dr. Hicks are independent as determined in accordance with the listing standards of the NYSE American LLC and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). All members of the Audit and Compensation Committees are "independent" as defined by the SEC and the listing standards of the NYSE American LLC.
Committees of the Board of Directors
GlobalSCAPE has standing Audit, Compensation, and Nominating Committees. The Nominating Committee was established in March 2018.
The Audit Committee is a separately-designated audit committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act. The Audit Committee consisted of Messrs. Mann, Morgan and Webb and Dr. Hicks during 2018. Mr. Mann was the chairman of this committee during 2018. This committee met 11 times during 2018. The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Mann is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules. The Audit Committee aids management in the establishment and supervision of our financial controls, evaluates the scope of the annual audit, reviews audit results, makes recommendations to our Board of Directors regarding the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm, consults with management and our independent registered public accounting firm prior to the production of financial statements to stockholders and, as appropriate, initiates inquiries into aspects of our financial affairs. The Audit Committee has authority under its charter to retain, approve fees for and terminate advisors, consultants, and agents as it deems necessary to assist in the fulfillment of its responsibilities. The Audit Committee Report, which appears in a subsequent section of this Proxy Statement, more fully describes the activities and responsibilities of the Audit Committee.
The Compensation Committee consisted of Messrs. Alpert, Mann, Morgan, Webb and Dr. Hicks during 2018. Mr. Morgan was chairman of this committee from January to October 10, 2018, when Mr. Webb was elected chairman. This committee met 5 times during 2018. The Compensation Committee's role is to establish and oversee GlobalSCAPE's compensation and benefit plans and policies, administer its stock option plans, and review and approve annually all compensation decisions relating to GlobalSCAPE's officers. At least annually, our President and Chief Executive Officer submits to the Compensation Committee his recommendations as to base salary, bonus and equity incentive awards for each executive officer, except himself, for the following fiscal year based upon his subjective evaluation of their individual performance. The Compensation Committee reviews and discusses the recommendations and has the sole authority to determine the base salary, bonus, and equity incentives for the President and Chief Executive Officer.
The agenda for meetings of the Compensation Committee is determined by its Chairman. At each meeting, the Compensation Committee meets in executive session. The Compensation Committee's Chairman reports the Committee's recommendations on executive compensation to the Board of Directors. The Company's personnel support the Compensation Committee in its duties and, along with the President and Chief Executive Officer, may be delegated authority to fulfill certain administrative duties regarding the compensation programs. The Compensation Committee has authority under its charter to retain, approve fees for and terminate advisors, consultants, and agents as it deems necessary to assist in the fulfillment of its responsibilities.
The Nominating Committee consisted of Messrs. Alpert Morgan and Webb and Dr. Hicks during 2018. The chairman of this committee is Dr. Hicks. This committee met 3 times during 2018. The primary function of the Nominating Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in identifying, screening and recruiting qualified individuals to become Board of Directors members and in determining the composition of the Board of Directors and its committees by recommending nominees for election at the annual meeting of stockholders or to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors.
Each of the Board of Directors committees has a written charter. Copies of the charters are available for review on the Company's website at www.globalscape.com on the Investor Relations page.
Risk Management
The Company has a risk management program overseen by its President and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer. Material risks are identified and prioritized by management. Each prioritized risk is referred to a Board of Directors committee or the full Board of Directors for oversight.
The Board of Directors reviews information regarding the Company's credit, liquidity, and operations, as well as the risks associated with each. The Board of Directors also reviews and approves the annual operating budget of the Company. Because we rely on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to fund our operations, the Board of Directors as a whole devotes significant time to reviewing and approving our levels of indebtedness, contractual obligations and spending supporting our business activities. While each committee is responsible for specific risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board of Directors is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks. In addition, the Compensation Committee periodically reviews the most important risks to the Company to ensure that compensation programs do not encourage excessive risk taking.
Code of Ethics
GlobalSCAPE has adopted a Code of Ethics that applies to all of its directors, officers and employees, including its President and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer. This Code is a statement of GlobalSCAPE's high standards for ethical behavior, legal compliance, and financial disclosure. A copy of the Code of Ethics can be found in its entirety on GlobalSCAPE's website at www.globalscape.com. Should there be any changes to, or waivers from, GlobalSCAPE's Code of Ethics, those changes or waivers will be posted immediately on our website at the address noted above.
Stockholder Communications with Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has a process by which stockholders may communicate with the Board of Directors. Any stockholder desiring to communicate with the Board of Directors may do so in writing by sending a letter addressed to The Board of Directors, c/o Corporate Secretary at the following address: 4500 Lockhill-Selma Road, Suite 150, San Antonio, Texas 78249. The Corporate Secretary has been instructed by the Board of Directors to promptly forward communications so received to the members of the Board of Directors.
Nominations
The Nominating Committee is responsible for determining the slate of director nominees for election by stockholders. All director nominees will be approved by the Nominating Committee prior to annual proxy material preparation and are required to stand for election by stockholders at the next annual meeting. For positions on the Board of Directors created by a director's leaving the Board of Directors prior to the expiration of his current term, whether due to death, resignation, or other inability to serve, Article III of the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws provides that a director elected by the Board of Directors to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his predecessor in office.
The Nominating Committee does not currently use any third-party search firm to assist in the identification or evaluation of Board member candidates. The Nominating Committee may engage a third party to provide such services in the future as it deems necessary or appropriate.
The Nominating Committee will determine the required selection criteria and qualifications of director nominees based upon the needs of the Company at the time nominees are considered. A candidate must possess the ability to apply good business judgment and must be in a position to properly exercise his duties of loyalty and care. Candidates should also exhibit proven leadership capabilities, high integrity, experience with a high level of responsibility within their chosen fields, and have the ability to quickly understand complex principles of, but not limited to, business and finance. Candidates with potential conflicts of interest or who do not meet this criteria are disqualified. The Nominating Committee will consider these criteria for nominees identified by the Nominating Committee, by stockholders, or through some other source. When current Board members are considered for nomination for reelection, the Nominating Committee also takes into consideration the member's prior Board contributions, performance, and meeting attendance records.
The Nominating Committee will consider qualified candidates that are recommended by stockholders for possible nomination. Stockholders wishing to make such a recommendation may do so by sending the following information to the Board of Directors, c/o Corporate Secretary, at the address listed above:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Name of the candidate with brief biographical information and résumé.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Contact information for the candidate and a document evidencing the candidate's willingness to serve as a director if elected.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A signed statement as to the submitting stockholder's current status as a stockholder and the number of shares currently held.  
[END TABLE]
Any such nomination must comply with the advance notice provisions of our Amended and Restated Bylaws. These provisions are summarized under "Stockholder Proposals to be Presented at Next Annual Meeting" in a subsequent section of this Proxy Statement.
The Nominating Committee will conduct a process of making a preliminary assessment of each proposed nominee based upon the résumé and biographical information, an indication of the individual's willingness to serve and other background information. This information will be evaluated against the criteria set forth above as well as the specific needs of the Company at that time. Based upon a preliminary assessment of the candidate(s), those who appear best suited to meet the needs of the Company may be invited for further evaluation through a series of interviews. The Nominating Committee uses the same process for evaluating all nominees, regardless of the original source of the information. The Company does not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, but the Nominating Committee will strive to nominate directors with a variety of complementary skills so that, as a group, the Board will possess the appropriate talent, skills, and expertise to oversee the Company's businesses.
No candidates for director nominations were submitted to the Board of Directors by any stockholder in connection with the Annual Meeting.
Composition of the Board of Directors
The Company believes that its Board of Directors as a whole should encompass a range of talent, skill, diversity, experience and expertise enabling it to provide sound guidance with respect to the Company's operations and business goals. In addition to considering a candidate's background and accomplishments, candidates are reviewed in the context of the current composition of the Board of Directors and the evolving needs of the Company. The Company's policy is to have at least a majority of its directors qualify as "independent" as determined in accordance with the listing standards of the NYSE American LLC and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. The Nominating Committee will identify candidates for election to the Board of Directors and review their skills, characteristics and experience.
The Nominating Committee will seek directors with strong reputations, high integrity and experience in areas relevant to the strategy and operations of the Company, particularly in the high technology industry and areas involving complex business and financial dealings. The Nominating Committee believes that each nominee and current director also has other key attributes that are important to an effective board including the ability to engage management in a constructive and collaborative fashion and a diversity of background, experience and thought.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Transactions in 2018
We did not have any related-party transactions in 2018.
Policy Related to Related Party Transactions
Our Board of Directors has adopted a formal, written related-person transaction approval policy, setting forth GlobalSCAPE's policies and procedures for the review, approval, or ratification of "related-person transactions." For these purposes, a "related person" is a director, nominee for director, executive officer, or holder of more than 5% of our Common Stock, or any immediate family member of any of the foregoing. This policy applies to any financial transaction, arrangement, or relationship or any series of similar financial transactions, arrangements, or relationships in which GlobalSCAPE is a participant and in which a related person has a direct or indirect interest, other than the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Payment of compensation by GlobalSCAPE to a related party for the related person's service in the capacity or capacities that give rise to the person's status as a "related person".  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Transactions available to all employees or all stockholders on the same terms.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Purchases of products or services from GlobalSCAPE in the ordinary course of business at the same price and on the same terms as offered to our other customers, regardless of whether the transactions are required to be reported in GlobalSCAPE's filings with the SEC.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Transactions, which when aggregated with the amount of all other transactions between the related person and GlobalSCAPE, involve less than $5,000 in a fiscal year.  
[END TABLE]
Our Audit Committee is required to approve any related-person transaction subject to this policy before commencement of the related-person transaction, provided that if the related-person transaction is identified after it commences, it shall be brought to the Audit Committee for ratification, amendment, or rescission. The Chairman of our Audit Committee has the authority to approve or take other actions with respect to any related-person transaction that arises, or first becomes known, between meetings of the Audit Committee, provided that any action by the Chairman must be reported to our Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.
Our Audit Committee will analyze the following factors, in addition to any other factors the members of the Audit Committee deem appropriate, in determining whether to approve a related-person transaction:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Whether the terms are fair to GlobalSCAPE.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Whether the transaction is material to GlobalSCAPE.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The role the related person has played in arranging the related-person transaction.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The structure of the related-person transaction.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The interest of all related persons in the related-person transaction.  
[END TABLE]
Our Audit Committee may, in its sole discretion, approve or deny any related-person transaction. Approval of a related-person transaction may be conditioned upon GlobalSCAPE's and the related party's following certain procedures designated by the Audit Committee.

 (1)   These amounts represent the aggregate grant date fair value of stock option awards for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 calculated as described in our Consolidated Financial Statements included our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on March 18, 2019. See specifically footnote 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and footnote 8, Stock Options, Restricted Stock and Share-Based Compensation for a discussion of all assumptions made in the calculation of this amount. These amounts do not necessarily represent the actual amounts paid to or realized by the Named Executive Officer for these awards during fiscal years 2018 or 2017. These amounts are recognized as an expense in our financial statements over the period of service required for the grant to become vested which is generally three years. For the options granted to Mr. Goulet in 2018, those expenses were determined to be $27,268, $128,026, $128,377, $128,026, and $101,109 in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.

Employment Agreements and Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
GlobalSCAPE has entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Goulet, Canavan, and Mello pursuant to which each will receive compensation as determined from time to time by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion.
Absent a Change in Control, these agreements do not provide for any minimum term of employment. In the event there is a Change in Control without a termination in connection with that event, a one year employment term commences as of the date of the Change in Control. Each agreement automatically renews on each subsequent annual anniversary date for an additional one year period unless the agreement is cancelled by the Company at least 90 days prior to the end of any such one year term. These agreements do not provide for any payment in the event of termination, except that if their employment is terminated in connection with a Change in Control, the Company will pay them an amount equal to their annual base salary which the Company may, at its option, pay as a lump sum.
A Change in Control occurs under these employment agreements upon the occurrence of any of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of securities representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; provided, however, that if Thomas W. Brown and/or David L. Mann acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of securities representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of GlobalSCAPE's then outstanding securities, then it shall not be deemed a Change in Control.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Any person or group makes a tender offer or an exchange offer for 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● At any time during any period of twelve consecutive months, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted a majority of the Board of Directors ("Incumbent Directors") of the Company cease for any reason other than death to constitute a majority of the board; provided, however, that an individual who becomes a member of the Board subsequent to the beginning of the 12-month period, shall be deemed to have satisfied such 12-month requirement and shall be deemed an Incumbent Director if such Director was elected by or on the recommendation of, or with the approval of, at least two-thirds of the Directors who then qualified as Incumbent Directors either actually (because they were Directors at the beginning of such period) or whose election was approved by two-thirds of the Incumbent Directors; if any such individual initially assumes office as a result of or in connection with either an actual or threatened solicitation with respect to the election of Directors (as such terms are used in Rule 14a-12(c) of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) or other actual or threatened solicitations of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person other than a member of the Board, then such individual shall not be considered an Incumbent Director.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The Company consolidates, merges or exchanges securities with any other entity where the stockholders of the Company immediately before the effective time of such transaction beneficially own, immediately after the effective time of such transaction, less than 50% of the combined voting power of the outstanding securities of the entity resulting from such a transaction.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Any person or group acquires all or substantially all of the Company's assets.  
[END TABLE]
All of our employment agreements provide for termination without any further payments due if the termination is for "cause", with that term defined to include any one of the following events:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Employee substantially fails to perform his duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from his incapacity due to disability or any such actual or anticipated failure resulting from termination by employee for Good Reason, as defined below) after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to employee by the Board, which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that employee has not substantially performed his duties.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Employee engages in conduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company or any of its affiliates, monetarily or otherwise.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Employee commits fraud, bribery, embezzlement or other material dishonesty with respect to the business of the Company or any of its affiliates, or the Company discovers that employee has committed any such act in the past with respect to a previous employer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Employee is indicted for any felony or any criminal act involving moral turpitude, or the Company discovers that employee has been convicted of any such act in the past.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Employee commits a material breach of any of the covenants, representations, terms or provisions of the employment agreement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Employee violates any instructions or policies of the Company with respect to the operation of its business or affairs that causes material harm, economic or otherwise, to the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Employee uses illegal drugs.  
[END TABLE]
"Good Reason," as used above, means, without the officer's express written consent, any of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The material failure by the Company, without employee's consent, to pay to employee any portion of his current compensation within ten (10) days of the date any such compensation payment is due.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The Company commits a material breach of any of the covenants, representations, terms or provisions of the employment agreement, and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to the Company, which notice shall identify in reasonable detail the nature of the breach and give the Company an opportunity to respond, excluding, however, failure to pay salary within ten (10) days as described above.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Any material diminution of employee's title, function, duties, authority or responsibilities, including reporting requirements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A reduction in employee's base salary as in effect on the date of the employment agreement or as may be increased from time to time.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A material reduction in the employee benefits that are in effect from time to time for employee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A relocation of the employee's principal place of employment to a location which is beyond a 50 mile radius from San Antonio, Texas.  
[END TABLE]
If any lump sum payment to a Named Executive Officer would individually or together with any other amounts paid or payable constitute an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and applicable regulations thereunder, the amounts to be paid will be increased so that each Named Executive Officer, as the case may be, will be entitled to receive the amount of compensation provided in his contract after payment of the tax imposed by Section 280G.
In the event of a Change in Control, unvested options to purchase our common stock that have been awarded to our NEOs will become fully vested.
The table below contains information concerning termination and Change in Control payments to each of our Named Executive Officers as if the event occurred on December 31, 2018, assuming each of the NEOs were employed by the Company as of such date.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name & Principal Position     Benefit       Before Change in Control   			Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason     After Change in Control Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason

 Vice President of Technical Services     Option Acceleration  (1)    not applicable      57,001   
 (1)   The option acceleration amount is the intrinsic value of equity awards minus the exercise price. This intrinsic value is based upon the closing price for a share of our common stock of $4.48 on December 31, 2018, minus the exercise price. If the number in this column is zero, the option exercise price of all options held by that NEO is greater than the closing price of our Common Stock used in determining this amount.

[END TABLE]
Mr. Goulet, an employee of the Company, does not receive a monthly retainer or attendance fees for his service on the Board.
We also provide stock-based compensation to our directors under the GlobalSCAPE, Inc. 2015 Non-Employee Directors Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2015 Directors Plan, and previously under the GlobalSCAPE, Inc. 2006 Non-Employee Directors Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2006 Directors Plan. Under the 2015 Directors Plan, a maximum of 500,000 shares of Common Stock may be awarded. As of March 12, 2019, 160,000 shares were reserved for issuance under the 2015 Directors Plan.
The 2015 Directors Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors which sets the exercise price, term, and other conditions applicable to each stock option granted under the plan. Stock options awarded under this plan shall have an exercise share price of no less than 100% of the fair market value on the date of the award while the option terms and vesting schedules are at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. The 2015 Directors Plan provides that each year, at the first regular meeting of the Board of Directors immediately following GlobalSCAPE's annual stockholders' meeting, each non-employee director shall be granted or issued maximum awards of either (1) a grant of an option to purchase 20,000 shares of our Common Stock or (2) the issuance of 20,000 shares of restricted Common Stock for participation in Board and Committee meetings during the previous calendar year. In 2018, the Compensation Committee granted 20,000 shares of restricted stock to each director except for Mr. Goulet, who received no such shares as a result of his being an employee of the Company. The restrictions on this restricted stock lapse in October 2019.
Effective April 1, 2018, the base monthly retainer we pay to the Board Chairman increased from $5,000 per month to $6,500 per month and the base monthly retainer we pay to all other non-employee Board members increased from $2,000 per month to $5,500 per month. Also effective April 1, 2018, we no longer pay the $1,000 per month committee chair retainer nor the $1,000 per meeting attendance fee.
The following table sets forth a summary of compensation for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 that GlobalSCAPE paid to each director. GlobalSCAPE does not sponsor a pension benefits plan, a non-qualified deferred compensation plan or a non-equity incentive plan for our directors and, accordingly, these columns have been omitted from the following table:

PROPOSAL TWO  RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED  PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
GlobalSCAPE's Audit Committee has appointed Weaver and Tidwell, LLP ("Weaver") to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Although stockholder ratification is not required, the Board of Directors has directed that the appointment of Weaver be submitted to the stockholders for ratification at the Annual Meeting.
Weaver provided audit services to GlobalSCAPE for the year ended December 31, 2018. A representative of Weaver will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
On October 19, 2016, Padgett Stratemann & Co., L.L.P. ("Padgett") resigned as our independent registered public accounting firm as a result of the partners of Padgett becoming partners of RSM US LLP ("RSM"). On October 19, 2016, the Audit Committee appointed RSM to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decision to engage RSM was approved by the Audit Committee.
During 2014 and 2015 and through October 19, 2016, the Company (or someone on its behalf) had not consulted with RSM with respect to: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; (ii) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, and RSM did not provide either a written report or oral advice to the Company that RSM concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing, or financial reporting issue; or (iii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
Effective on March 27, 2017, RSM was dismissed as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee approved this dismissal.
RSM performed the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the "2016 Financial Statements"). In connection with the preparation of the 2016 Financial Statements, the Company changed certain accounting methods and the classification and presentation of its business activities in its financial statements. To ensure comparability between periods, the Company revised the 2015 Financial Statements (as defined below) to conform them to the method of presentation in the 2016 Financial Statements. For more information, please see Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC on June 14, 2018.
On March 27, 2017, the Company announced that the Audit Committee had approved the appointment of BDO USA, LLP ("BDO") as its independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Company's financial statements subject to completion of its standard client acceptance procedures.
Effective as of April 11, 2017, BDO notified the Company that it had completed such client acceptance procedures. On April 12, 2017, the Audit Committee formally engaged BDO as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Company's financial statements.
During 2015 and 2016 and through April 12, 2017, the Company (or someone on its behalf) had not consulted with BDO with respect to: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; (ii) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements; or (iii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
On August 1, 2017, the Company informed BDO that it had been dismissed as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.  The Audit Committee approved this dismissal. BDO did not issue any audit reports during the period of its engagement.
On August 2, 2017, GlobalSCAPE received a letter (the "10A Letter") from BDO in accordance with Section 10A(b)(2) of the Exchange Act.
In the 10A Letter, BDO advised that on or around July 6, 2017 BDO was contacted by David Mann, the Audit Committee Chairman, who provided information about conduct that in BDO's view indicated an illegal act, as defined by Section 10A of the Exchange Act, may have occurred. BDO stated in the 10A Letter that BDO was informed that the Company had learned of the subject conduct in May of 2017 and had already engaged the Company's corporate outside counsel, along with forensic accountants, to conduct an investigation into the conduct and that additional information would be provided as the investigation continued.  In a separate communication to the Audit Committee Chairman on July 6, 2017, BDO advised GlobalSCAPE of both its and BDO's obligations under Section 10A of the Exchange Act and auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and that BDO would recommend that the Audit Committee engage independent counsel to conduct the investigation, which BDO defined as counsel who had not previously performed substantial work for the Company.  BDO communicated that it did not believe the counsel GlobalSCAPE had engaged met that definition due to GlobalSCAPE's historical working relationship with them.
BDO stated in the 10A Letter that additional information related to the conduct under investigation was provided to BDO by GlobalSCAPE's corporate outside counsel on July 10, 2017, noting that employees of the Company had entered into "side agreements" with customers of the Company in December 2016 which increased revenue recorded, and accounts receivable, by amounts that had not been fully quantified at that time. BDO was engaged by GlobalSCAPE on April 12, 2017, and was not the Company's independent registered public accounting firm during the period in which the misconduct was alleged to have occurred.
BDO stated in the 10A Letter that in a discussion with the Audit Committee Chairman on July 10, 2017, BDO discussed its request for the Company to engage other counsel to lead the investigation, and was told that the Company considered the engaged counsel to be independent.  BDO stated in the 10A Letter that during that discussion BDO detailed the reasons for its concern, and that BDO viewed the Company's failure to engage alternate legal counsel as a failure to take timely and appropriate remedial action as defined by Section 10A(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, where absent action by the Company, BDO would not be in a position to assess the adequacy of the investigation, which BDO would consider a disagreement with the Company as it would limit the scope of BDO's audit, warranting either a departure from its standard report or resignation from the audit engagement. In the 10A Letter, BDO stated that since July 10, 2017, in response to multiple requests by BDO, the Audit Committee reiterated their position that they would continue the investigation being performed by their corporate outside counsel, who they believe were sufficiently independent.
In the 10A Letter, BDO stated its belief that the Company had not been forthcoming with details regarding the investigation or the conclusions, if any, reached by counsel and the Company about the conduct at issue. In the 10A Letter, BDO stated that due to the lack of details that BDO had been provided regarding the investigation, and its dismissal as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, it was unable to determine whether it was likely that an illegal act had occurred, and whether the impact of any misstatements resulting from the alleged misconduct had a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  In the 10A Letter, BDO stated that based on the limited information BDO had been provided, it believed that it was possible that the conduct could have had a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements that had been filed with the SEC, or that were expected to be filed in the foreseeable future. In the 10A Letter, BDO stated that it had been informed but had not confirmed that, at its urging in its communications with the Company on July 6, 2017, the Company had advised its prior auditor of the investigation. In the 10A Letter, BDO also stated that it did not believe senior management had taken timely and appropriate remedial action in response to the conduct, in particular by not having the investigation performed by counsel with no prior affiliation with the Company and by not sharing information from the investigation with BDO on a timely basis. In the 10A Letter, BDO also stated that the failure to take timely and appropriate remedial action may have either warranted a departure from a standard report or warranted BDO's resignation, had BDO not been terminated.
As a result of the 10A Letter, on August 3, 2017, GlobalSCAPE filed a notice pursuant to Section 10A of the Exchange Act (the "Notice") with the SEC.  In the Notice, GlobalSCAPE notified the SEC of the 10A Letter received from BDO.
During the period from April 12, 2017 until the date of BDO's dismissal and through August 7, 2017, the date of our Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing our receipt of the 10A Letter, except for the matters described above, there were no disagreements between the Company and BDO on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of BDO, would have caused BDO to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its report on the Company's financial statements for such year. On August 2, 2017, BDO reported that it considered the use of non-independent counsel to lead the investigation described above to be a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, as such counsel could be influenced by the Company's existing relationship with such counsel. During the period from April 12, 2017 until the date of BDO's dismissal and through August 7, 2017, there were no other reportable events within the meaning set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
Effective on August 1, 2017, the Audit Committee approved the appointment of Weaver as its independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Company's financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the two most recent fiscal years prior to such appointment and through August 1, 2017, the Company (or someone on its behalf) had not consulted with Weaver with respect to: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; (ii) the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements; or (iii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
On November 20, 2017, the Chairman of the Audit Committee was orally informed by RSM that RSM was withdrawing from its engagement by the Audit Committee to reissue its audit report on the 2016 Financial Statements. On November 21, 2017, RSM delivered a withdrawal letter to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. In its withdrawal letter, RSM stated that (x) as of November 21, 2017, it had not completed the audit procedures necessary to reissue its report on the 2016 Financial Statements and (y) based on the information the Audit Committee provided from its internal investigation, RSM had concluded that, in its professional judgment, it could no longer rely on management's representations, which the Company has concluded is a "reportable event" as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
The audit report originally issued by RSM on the 2016 Financial Statements, when previously filed, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. However, as previously disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 7, 2017 (the "August 8-K"), the 2016 Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K originally filed on March 27, 2017 (the "Original 2016 10-K Filing"), including the auditor's report on the 2016 Financial Statements included in the Original 2016 10-K Filing, should no longer be relied upon in light of the restatement of certain of our consolidated financial statements. In connection with the audit of the 2016 Financial Statements and through the date of RSM's dismissal on March 27, 2017, there were: (i) no disagreements between the Company and RSM on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of RSM, would have caused RSM to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in their report on the Company's financial statements for such year, and (ii) no reportable events within the meaning set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. During the period from August 15, 2017, when RSM was re-engaged to reissue its audit report on the restated 2016 Financial Statements until November 21, 2017, there were: (i) no disagreements between the Company and RSM on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of RSM, would have caused RSM to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in their report on the Company's financial statements for such year, and (ii) except as set forth above, no reportable events within the meaning set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
On December 1, 2017, the Chairman of the Audit Committee received a letter from Padgett in which Padgett stated that based on the circumstances described in the August 8-K surrounding the dismissal of BDO as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and the previously disclosed withdrawal of RSM from its engagement by the Audit Committee to reissue its audit report on the restated 2016 Financial Statements, and based on the fact that management at that time was substantially the same as the management in place in 2015, Padgett had concluded that it could not rely on management's representations that would be necessary for Padgett to complete the audit procedures necessary to issue consents to the inclusion of its audit report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the "2015 Financial Statements") in the Company's filings or transactions after the date of the letter. Padgett also stated in its letter that (1) it was not at that time aware of whether any of the circumstances described in the August 8-K with respect to the 2016 Financial Statements could have been applicable to the Company's 2015 Financial Statements, and (2) it had not reached a conclusion as to whether it was necessary for Padgett to withdraw its audit report on the 2015 Financial Statements. The Company has concluded that this is a "reportable event" as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
The audit report originally issued by Padgett on the 2015 Financial Statements, when previously filed, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. In connection with the audit of the 2015 Financial Statements and through the date of Padgett's resignation as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm on October 19, 2016 as a result of the partners of Padgett becoming partners of RSM, there were: (i) no disagreements between the Company and Padgett on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Padgett, would have caused Padgett to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its report on the Company's financial statements for such year, and (ii) no reportable events within the meaning set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. During the period from October 19, 2016 until December 1, 2017, there were: (i) no disagreements between the Company and Padgett on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Padgett, would have caused Padgett to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in its report on the Company's financial statements for such year, and (ii) except as set forth above, no reportable events within the meaning set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
Effective on December 13, 2017, the Audit Committee expanded the initial appointment of Weaver as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the audit of the Company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 to also include serving as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the audit of the 2015 Financial Statements and the 2016 Financial Statements. In connection with the expansion of the initial appointment of Weaver to include serving as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm with respect to the audit of 2015 Financial Statements and the 2016 Financial Statements, the Audit Committee made Weaver aware of the matters discussed by RSM and Padgett in their communications to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote is required to ratify the appointment of Weaver as GlobalSCAPE's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. In the event the stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Board of Directors may reconsider its appointment for this year. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, may, if circumstances dictate, direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year, if the Board of Directors determines that such a change would be in the Company's and its stockholders' best interests.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF WEAVER AND TIDWELL, LLP AS GLOBALSCAPE'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019.

● Providing equity-based incentives for our NEOs to ensure that they are motivated over the long term to respond to GlobalSCAPE's business challenges and opportunities as owners rather than just as employees.
