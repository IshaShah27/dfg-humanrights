LETTER FROM OUR CEO AND CHAIRMAN
Dear Sysco Stockholder,
We are pleased to invite you to attend our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Friday, November 16, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Central Time. The Meeting will be held at the Houstonian Hotel located at 111 North Post Oak Lane, Houston, Texas 77024.
Our stockholder meeting is an opportunity for our Board of Directors and senior leadership to provide an update on key developments at Sysco over the past year and respond directly to your questions. By participating in our stockholder meeting, you play an active role in the future of your company. We encourage you to vote by telephone, internet, or by signing and mailing the attached proxy card.
In fiscal 2018, the solid execution of our customer-first strategy helped us deliver excellent financial results. Sales grew 6.1% to $58.7 billion. Gross profit dollar growth outpaced adjusted operating expense growth, and we grew operating income by 13.4 percent to $2.3 billion.
Our performance in fiscal 2018 contributed to the successful delivery of our 2016-2018 three-year plan financial objectives, including exceeding our target for operating income improvement. Additionally, we built a strong foundation to help us achieve our current 2018-2020 plan goals. We recognize that in order to build upon our recent strong financial performance, we must continue to evolve our business. We recently outlined four strategic priorities, which we believe will serve as the roadmap for additional value creation and acceleration of the current growth of the company.
Sysco lives "At the Heart of Food and Service," with passion and innovation. We look forward to fiscal 2019 and remain committed to meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations, while creating value for our shareholders.
On behalf of our Board of Directors and all of our associates, thank you for your continued trust and support in Sysco.

2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
Voting Matters and Board Recommendations
Business Highlights
For more detail please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Our discussion below of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from: (1) expenses associated with our revised business technology strategy announced in fiscal 2016, as a result of which we incurred costs to convert to a modernized version of our established platform as opposed to completing the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system; (2) professional fees related to our three-year strategic plans; (3) restructuring expenses within our Brakes Group operations; (4) severance charges related to restructuring; and (5) foreign non-income based taxes. In addition, fiscal 2018 results of operations are impacted by business technology transformation initiative costs, facility closure charges, multiemployer pension (MEPP) withdrawal charges and debt extinguishment charges, which are also excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
The non-GAAP financial measures presented also exclude the impact of the following acquisition-related items: (1) intangible amortization expense and (2) integration costs. All acquisition-related costs in fiscal 2018 and 2017 that have been excluded relate to the fiscal 2017 acquisition of Cucina Lux Investments Limited (the Brakes Acquisition), discussed in Note 4, "Acquisitions." The Brakes Acquisition also resulted in non-recurring tax expense in fiscal 2017, primarily from non-deductible transaction costs.
The non-GAAP financial measures presented further exclude certain impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) enacted on December 22, 2017. The impact for fiscal 2018 includes: a provisional estimate of a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and a net benefit from remeasuring Sysco's accrued income taxes, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets due to the changes in tax rates. Other tax-related items impacting results of operations include foreign withholding taxes on repatriated earnings, net of foreign tax credits, and a benefit from contributions made to fund Sysco's tax-qualified United States (U.S.) pension plan (the U.S. Retirement Plan).
The fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 items described above and excluded from our non-GAAP measures are collectively referred to as "Certain Items." In addition, our adjusted return on invested capital performance targets, as measured for purposes of our performance share units and cash performance units, were established prior to the Brakes Acquisition. Accordingly, the results used for determining payouts excluded the Brakes Acquisition to adjust for the accumulation of debt incurred for the Brakes Acquisition that would not have been borrowed absent this acquisition.
More information on the rationale for the use of these measures can be found in our Form 10-K on pages 27-33 and reconciliations to GAAP numbers can be found in Annex I - Non-GAAP Reconciliations.
The overall macroeconomic trends continue to be positive in the U.S., and the underlying economic picture remains encouraging, including a strong employment market. This has resulted in a healthy consumer that is helping to drive a positive trend in restaurant sales. We also see continued growth with local customers, as they increase their reach through flexible menus, innovative concepts and additional delivery options to reach consumers. The U.K market continues to experience acute product inflation in the mid-to-high single digits. Throughout fiscal 2018, we improved our customer experience through enhanced service levels, improved sales retention and higher customer loyalty, enhanced associate engagement through improved workplace safety and improved associate retention through attractive career growth opportunities. These were all key targeted steps towards achieving our initial three-year plan financial objectives.
Comparison of our results from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017:
* See Annex I - "Non-GAAP Reconciliations" for an explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures.

Executive Compensation
Philosophy and Principles (page 45)
Our executive compensation plans directly link a substantial portion of annual pay to Sysco's performance. These plans are designed to deliver highly competitive compensation for superior company performance. Likewise, when company performance falls short of expectations, our variable incentive programs deliver lower levels of compensation. However, the Committee tries to balance pay-for-performance objectives with retention considerations, so that, even during temporary downturns in the economy and the foodservice industry, the programs continue to ensure that qualified, successful, performance-driven employees stay committed to increasing Sysco's long-term value. Furthermore, to attract and retain highly skilled management, our compensation program must remain competitive with those of comparable employers who compete with us for talent.
We use the following key principles as the cornerstone of Sysco's executive compensation philosophy to attract, develop and retain business leaders to drive financial and strategic growth and build long-term stockholder value:

Sysco Corporation  1390 Enclave Parkway  Houston, Texas 77077-2099  October 5, 2018
PROXY STATEMENT
We are providing you with a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and access to these proxy materials, which include this 2018 Proxy Statement, the proxy card for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2018, because our Board of Directors is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "our," "us," the "Company" or "Sysco," as used in this proxy statement, refer to Sysco Corporation. Our Annual Meeting will be held on Friday, November 16, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. at The Houstonian Hotel located at 111 North Post Oak Lane, Houston, Texas 77024.
At the close of business on September 17, 2018, there were 520,689,279 shares of Sysco Corporation common stock ("Common Stock") outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. All of our current directors and executive officers (23 persons) beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, an aggregate of 41,009,622 shares, which was approximately 7.88% of our outstanding Common Stock as of September 17, 2018.
Only owners of record of shares of Common Stock as of the close of business on the record date, September 17, 2018, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at the Annual Meeting or at any adjournments or postponements of the Annual Meeting. Each owner of record is entitled to one vote for each share owned on the record date on each matter presented at the Annual Meeting.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MEETING AND VOTING
A proxy statement is a document that Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") regulations require us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy designating individuals to vote on your behalf. A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote the stock you own. That other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document also is called a proxy or a proxy card. We have designated three of our officers as proxies for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. These three officers are Thomas L. Bené, Joel T. Grade and Russell T. Libby.
In accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, instead of mailing a printed copy of our proxy materials, including our annual report to stockholders, to each stockholder of record, we now generally furnish proxy materials, including our annual report to stockholders, to our stockholders on the Internet. Unless you have previously signed up to receive your materials in paper, you will receive a document entitled Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (which we refer to as the "E-Proxy Notice") and will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials or the annual report to stockholders (unless you specifically request them). Instead, the E-Proxy Notice will instruct you as to how you may use the Internet to access and review all of the important information contained in the proxy materials, including our annual report to stockholders.
The E-Proxy Notice also instructs you as to how you may submit your proxy on the Internet. Instructions for requesting printed proxy materials are included in the E-Proxy Notice. E-Proxy Notices are distributed by mail, unless you previously signed up to receive your proxy materials electronically, in which case it will be emailed to you. Set forth below is a summary of delivery methods.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    10
Receiving Future Proxy Materials Electronically and Receiving the E-Proxy Notice by e-mail: If you previously elected to receive your proxy materials in printed format, but would like to receive an E-Proxy Notice only and use the Internet to access proxy materials, please visit http://enroll.icsdelivery.com/syy for additional information. This would significantly reduce our printing and postage costs and eliminate bulky paper documents from your personal files. To receive your E-Proxy Notice by e-mail, please visit http://enroll.icsdelivery.com/syy for additional information.
These terms describe the manner in which your shares are held. If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's registrar and transfer agent, Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., you are considered a "stockholder of record" with respect to those shares.
If your shares are held through a brokerage account, bank, trust or other nominee as custodian on your behalf, you are considered the "beneficial owner" or "street name holder" of those shares. See questions 5, 6 and 9 below for important information for beneficial owners.
You may vote your shares as follows:
You need to bring documentation showing that you owned Common Stock on the record date, September 17, 2018. You also will need to bring a photo ID to gain admission. Please note that cameras, sound or video recording equipment or other similar equipment, large bags, briefcases or packages may not be allowed in the meeting room. If you are a beneficial owner, bring the notice or voting instruction form you received from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee for admission to the meeting. You also may bring your brokerage statement reflecting your ownership of Common Stock as of September 17, 2018 with you to the meeting. Please note that you will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting without a legal proxy, as described in the response to question 6 below.
You will need to ask your broker, bank or other intermediary to furnish you with a legal proxy. You will need to bring the legal proxy with you to the meeting and hand it in with a signed ballot that will be provided to you at the meeting. You will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting without a legal proxy. If you do not receive the legal proxy in time, you can follow the procedures described in the response to question 5 above to gain admission to the meeting. However, you will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting. Accordingly, we encourage you to vote your shares in advance, even if you intend to attend the meeting. Please note that, if you request a legal proxy, any previously executed proxy will be revoked and your vote will not be counted unless you appear at the meeting and vote in person or legally appoint another proxy to vote on your behalf.

[END TABLE]
Stockholders should specify their choices for each matter on the proxy card. If you vote by proxy, the individuals named on the proxy card (your proxies) will vote your shares in the manner you indicate. If no specific instructions are given, proxies that are signed and returned will be voted:
Proxies will be voted in the discretion of the proxy holders on any other matter that may properly come before the Annual Meeting.
As a beneficial owner, in order to ensure your shares are voted in the way you would like, you must provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee by the deadline provided in the materials you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, whether your shares can be voted by such person depends on the type of item being considered for vote.
Non-Discretionary Items. The election of directors, the proposal to approve the adoption of the Sysco Corporation 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the advisory proposal to approve executive compensation and the stockholder proposal are non-discretionary items and may not be voted on by brokers, banks or other nominees who have not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owners.
Discretionary Items. The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm is a discretionary item. Generally, brokers, banks and other nominees that do not receive voting instructions from beneficial owners may vote on this proposal in their discretion.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    12
You may revoke or change your proxy at any time prior to the completion of voting at the Annual Meeting by:
The last vote that we receive from you will be the vote that is counted.
A quorum is necessary to hold a valid meeting. A quorum will exist if the holders of at least 35% of all the shares entitled to vote at the meeting are present in person or by proxy. All shares voted by proxy are counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum, including those that abstain or as to which the proxies contain broker non-votes as to one or more items.
Sysco's Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines include a majority vote standard for uncontested director elections. Since the number of nominees timely nominated for the Annual Meeting does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, each director to be elected shall be elected if the number of votes cast "for" election of the director exceeds those cast "against." Any incumbent director who is not re-elected will be required to tender his or her resignation promptly following certification of the stockholders' vote. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept or reject the resignation offer, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the recommendation within 120 days following certification of the stockholders' vote and will promptly make a public disclosure of its decision regarding whether to accept the director's resignation offer.
Pursuant to Sysco's Bylaws, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast, either for or against, is required for the approval of:
As an advisory vote, the proposal to approve executive compensation (Item 3) is not binding upon the Company. However, the Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering the Company's executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions.
In light of the stockholder recommendation at Sysco's 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders regarding the frequency of the stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation, it is the current intention of the Sysco Board of Directors to conduct an annual stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation until the next required vote on the frequency of stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation that will occur at our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Broker non-votes will be disregarded with respect to the election of directors and each of the other proposals. Abstentions will be disregarded with respect to the election of directors and all of the other proposals, except the proposal to approve the adoption of the Sysco Corporation 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan. NYSE rules require that the proposal to approve the adoption of the Sysco Corporation 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan receive a majority of the votes cast, including shares voted "for" and "against" and abstentions. Accordingly, abstentions will count as votes "against" with respect to this proposal.
We will appoint one or more Inspectors of Election who will determine the number of shares outstanding, the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the Annual Meeting, the existence of a quorum and whether or not the proxies and ballots are valid and effective.
The Inspector(s) of Election will determine, and retain for a reasonable period, a record of the disposition of any challenges and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, and will count all votes and ballots cast for and against and any abstentions or broker non-votes with respect to all proposals and will determine the results of each vote.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    13
Abstentions and broker non-votes are included in determining whether a quorum is present. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker does not have discretionary voting authority and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. Broker non-votes will be disregarded with respect to the election of directors and each of the other proposals, and abstentions will be disregarded with respect to the election of directors and all other proposals, except the proposal to approve the adoption of the Sysco Corporation 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan, with respect to which abstentions will count as votes "against" the proposal, as described in the response to question 12 above.
We will pay all of the cost of solicitation of proxies including preparing, printing and mailing this proxy statement and the E-Proxy Notice. Solicitation may be made personally or by mail, telephone or electronic data transfer by officers, directors and employees of the Company (who will not receive any additional compensation for any solicitation of proxies).
We will also authorize banks, brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward copies of proxy materials and will reimburse them for their costs in sending the materials. We have retained Georgeson Shareholder Communications to help us solicit proxies from these entities and certain other stockholders, in writing or by telephone, at an estimated fee of $12,000 plus reimbursement for their out-of-pocket expenses.
We do not know of any matter that will be presented at the Annual Meeting other than the election of directors and the other proposals discussed in this proxy statement. However, if any other matter is properly presented at the Annual Meeting, your proxies will vote on such matter in their best judgment.
We will furnish additional copies of our annual report to stockholders, which includes our Annual Report on Form 10-K, without exhibits, for the year ended June 30, 2018, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Form 10-K"), for no charge, upon your written request if you are a record or beneficial owner of Sysco Corporation Common Stock whose proxy we are soliciting in connection with the Annual Meeting.
Please address requests for a copy of the Form 10-K to the Investor Relations Department, Sysco Corporation, 1390 Enclave Parkway, Houston, Texas 77077-2099. The Form 10-K is also available on our website under "Investors— SEC Filings – Annual Reports" at www.sysco.com.
If you share the same last name and address with another Sysco stockholder, you and the other stockholders at your address may receive only one copy of the E-Proxy Notice and any other proxy materials we choose to mail, unless contrary instructions are provided from any stockholder at that address. This is referred to as "householding." If you prefer to receive multiple copies of the E-Proxy Notice and any other proxy materials that we mail, at the same address, additional copies will be provided to you promptly upon written or oral request, and if you are receiving multiple copies of the E-Proxy Notice and other proxy materials, you may request that you receive only one copy. Please address requests for a copy of the E-Proxy Notice and other proxy materials to Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York, 11717, or call Broadridge at (866) 540-7095.
We will announce the preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. The Company will report the final results on our website and in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days following the Annual Meeting.
It is the Board's policy that Directors attend the Annual Meeting, to the extent practicable. All Directors who were in office at that time, attended the annual meeting of stockholders held in November 2017.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    14
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
We believe good corporate governance is critical to achieving business success. The Board has adopted certain documents, referred to herein as our Governance Documents, to provide a general framework for the Company and reflect our commitment to sound governance practices, including:
These Governance Documents outline the functions of the Board, each of the Board's committees, director responsibilities, and various processes and procedures designed to ensure effective and responsive governance.
The Corporate Governance Guidelines comply with the listing standards of the NYSE and include guidelines for determining director independence and qualifications. These guidelines define qualities and characteristics utilized in evaluating if an existing Board member or candidate meets the qualifications for service as a Sysco Board member. Additionally, diversity, skills, experience and time available for service (including consideration of other board service) are all important considerations. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee regularly reviews the Governance Documents and recommends revisions to the Board from time to time to reflect developments in the law and corporate governance practices.
Copies of the Governance Documents can be accessed from the corporate governance section of the Company's website at "Investors—Corporate Governance" at www.sysco.com. These documents will also be provided without charge to any stockholder upon written request to the Corporate Secretary at Sysco Corporation, 1390 Enclave Parkway, Houston, Texas 77077.

SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    15
Board Refreshment
Our Board recognizes the importance of consistent, deliberate Board refreshment and succession planning to ensure that the directors possess a composite set of skills, experience and qualifications necessary for the Board to successfully establish and oversee management's execution of the Company's strategic priorities (see "Director Qualifications" below for a discussion of the key qualifications considered by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee in evaluating candidates). In order to promote thoughtful Board refreshment, in 2016 our Board adopted a Board refreshment plan, pursuant to which the Board has elected an additional five independent, non-employee directors to the Board, as discussed below.
Director Tenure Policy.In July 2016, our Board, upon the recommendation of our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, established our director tenure policy, which provides that no individual who, as of the date of the election to which any nomination relates, will have served as a non-employee director for 15 years will be eligible to be nominated for election or re-election to the Board.
Director Recruitment. Since the adoption of our Board refreshment plan in 2016, our Board has periodically engaged the services of a search firm to assist with identifying and recruiting appropriate director candidates. Several director candidates have been referred by our then current directors and identified by our search firm, and our Board evaluated the skills, experience and qualifications of each candidate in the context of the Board's composition and the Company's strategic priorities. Following consideration of each of these candidates, and in each case upon the unanimous recommendation of our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board expanded the size of the Board and elected a total of five new independent, non-employee directors: Messrs. Brutto, Halverson and Shirley (in September 2016), Ms. Talton (in September 2017) and Mr. Hinshaw (in April 2018).
In accordance with the director tenure policy, Ms. Jackie M. Ward and Mr. Richard G. Tilghman are not standing for re-election at the Annual Meeting, and we expect Mr. Cassaday to retire from the Board at the time of the 2019 annual meeting. As our longest-tenured directors retire from the Board, we will continue our director recruitment efforts to help ensure that the size of the Board remains at an appropriate level.
CEO Succession Plan
Effective January 1, 2018, pursuant to our previously announced CEO succession plan, Thomas L. Bené, our then current President and Chief Operating Officer, succeeded William J. DeLaney as President and CEO and became a member of our Board, filling the vacancy resulting from Mr. DeLaney's transition out of those roles effective December 31, 2017. For discussion of the Transition and Retirement Agreement with Mr. DeLaney, see "Executive Compensation – CEO Succession Compensation Arrangements – Transition and Retirement Agreement with Mr. DeLaney," and for discussion of the compensation adjustments for Mr. Bené in connection with his transition and appointment to President and CEO, see "Executive Compensation – CEO Succession Compensation Arrangements – Compensation Adjustments for Mr. Bené."
Stockholder Engagement
Communicating with stakeholders, whether customers, suppliers, employees or stockholders, has always been an important part of how Sysco does business. Beginning in 2015, in furtherance of these efforts, we began a more formal engagement process with our stockholders regarding matters of corporate governance. This engagement process is incremental to our customary participation at industry and investment community conferences, investor road shows and analyst meetings.
At the direction of our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, senior leaders and subject matter experts from the Company met with representatives at many of our top institutional stockholders to discuss Sysco's governance practices, executive compensation, compliance programs, and other environmental, social, and governance related matters. Management reported regularly to the Board and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee concerning these meetings, including feedback on the concerns and issues raised by our stockholders.
Beginning in fiscal 2016, this engagement program was expanded to include Ms. Ward and Mr. Glasscock, who have each participated in meetings with many of our top institutional stockholders to discuss the same governance and compensation matters described above. Insight gained from engagement discussions remains a key consideration for the Board as it continues to evaluate our corporate governance and executive compensation practices for potential refinement.
We look forward to gaining further insight from our stockholders during future engagements.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    16
Communicating with the Board
Interested parties, including, but not limited to, our stockholders, may communicate with the Chairman of the Board, the independent directors as a group and the individual members of the Board by confidential web submission or by mail. All such correspondence will be delivered to the parties to whom they are addressed. The Board requests that items unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of the Board not be submitted, such as product inquiries and complaints, job inquiries, business solicitations and junk mail. You may access the form to communicate by confidential web submission in the corporate governance section of Sysco's website under "Investors — Corporate Governance—Contact the Board" at www.sysco.com. You can contact any of our directors by mail in care of the Corporate Secretary, Sysco Corporation, 1390 Enclave Parkway, Houston, Texas 77077.
Board Meetings and Committees
During fiscal 2018, the Board held nine meetings, including four regular meetings and five special meetings, and committees of the Board held a total of 27 meetings. Overall attendance at such meetings was approximately 97%. Each director attended 75% or more of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served during fiscal 2018. The Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, a Corporate Social Responsibility Committee, and an Executive Committee. Current copies of the written charters for the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee and the Executive Committee are published on our website under "Investors — Corporate Governance" at www.sysco.com. The current membership and primary responsibilities of the committees are summarized in the following table.

Annual Board Self-Evaluation
The Board conducts an annual self-evaluation to determine whether the Board and its committees are functioning effectively. As part of the evaluation process, each director completes a Board self-evaluation questionnaire developed by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The questionnaire responses are compiled and reviewed by outside legal counsel, which provides a summary of the responses, without attribution to any individual director, to the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. In selected years, the outside legal counsel will also conduct interviews with each director individually. The results of the questionnaires and, if applicable, the interview process are subsequently discussed by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and are then presented to the full Board for review and discussion.
In addition, each Board committee conducts a similar self-evaluation of its performance focused on the committee's key responsibilities. Feedback from the committees' self-evaluations is reviewed by the applicable committee and also presented to the full Board for review and discussion. Key learnings from these Board and committee self-evaluations play an important role in informing the Board's approach to refreshment and succession planning.
Beginning in fiscal 2017, the Board's self-evaluation process was enhanced to include "360 degree" individual director performance reviews, which involved a confidential evaluation of the performance of selected directors by each of his or her fellow directors, key members of senior management and representatives of certain independent, third-party firms that routinely interact with the directors assessed. The feedback from these reviews for fiscal 2018 was compiled and communicated to the directors assessed by the Board's independent, outside legal counsel.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    18
Director Independence
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that at least a majority of our directors meet the criteria for independence that the New York Stock Exchange has established for continued listing, as well as the additional criteria set forth in the Guidelines. Additionally, we require that all members of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee be independent, that all members of the Audit Committee satisfy the additional requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and applicable rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, and that all members of the Compensation Committee satisfy the additional requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.
Under New York Stock Exchange listing standards, to consider a director to be independent, our Board must determine that he or she has no material relationship with Sysco other than as a director. The standards specify the criteria by which the Board must determine whether directors are independent, and contain guidelines for directors and their immediate family members with respect to employment or affiliation with Sysco or its independent registered public accounting firm.
In addition to the NYSE's standards for independence, our Corporate Governance Guidelines contain categorical standards that provide that the following relationships will not impair a director's independence:
The Board of Directors has reviewed all relevant relationships between those individuals who served as a director at any time during fiscal 2018 (and/or who are nominated for election at the Annual Meeting) and Sysco. The relationships reviewed included those described under "Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions," and several relationships that did not automatically make the individual non-independent under the NYSE standards or our Corporate Governance Guidelines, either because of the type of affiliation between the director and the other entity or because the amounts involved did not meet the applicable thresholds.
These additional relationships include the following (for purposes of this section, "Sysco", "we," "us" and "our" include our operating companies):
After reviewing such information, the Board has determined that each of Mr. Brutto, Mr. Cassaday, Dr. Craven, Mr. Frank, Mr. Glasscock, Mr. Halverson, Mr. Hinshaw, Dr. Koerber, Ms. Newcomb, Mr. Peltz, Mr. Shirley, Ms. Talton, Mr. Tilghman and Ms. Ward has no material relationship with Sysco and is independent under the NYSE standards and the categorical standards set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and described above.
The Board also determined that each of Mr. DeLaney and Mr. Bené, who served as an executive officer of the Company during fiscal 2018, is not independent pursuant to the NYSE independence standards due to such service, and that former director Mr. Jonathan Golden, who retired from the Board effective November 17, 2017, is not independent due to his relationship to Arnall Golden Gregory LLP. See "Transactions with Related Persons" below for further discussion.
The Board has also determined that each member of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is independent. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that no independent director who is a member of the Audit, Compensation or Corporate Governance and Nominating Committees may receive any compensation from Sysco, other than in his or her capacity as a non-employee director or committee member. The Board has determined that no non-employee director received any compensation from Sysco at any time since the beginning of fiscal 2018, other than in his or her capacity as a non-employee director, committee member, committee chairman or Chairman of the Board.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    19
Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions
Related Person Transactions Policies and Procedures
The Board has adopted written policies and procedures for review and approval or ratification of transactions with related persons. We subject the following related persons to these policies: directors, director nominees, executive officers, beneficial owners of more than five percent of our stock and any immediate family members of these persons.
We follow the policies and procedures below for any transaction, arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships in which Sysco was or is to be a participant, the amount involved exceeds $100,000, and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. These policies specifically apply without limitation to purchases of goods or services by or from the related person or entities in which the related person has a material interest, indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness, and employment by Sysco of a related person. The Board of Directors has determined that the following do not create a material direct or indirect interest on behalf of the related person, and are, therefore, not related person transactions to which these policies and procedures apply:
Any of our employees, officers or directors who have knowledge of a proposed related person transaction must report the transaction to our chief legal officer. Whenever practicable, before the transaction goes effective or becomes consummated, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors will review and approve the proposed transaction in accordance with the terms of this policy. If the chief legal officer determines that it is not practicable to obtain advance approval of the transaction under the circumstances, the Committee will review and, in its discretion may ratify, the transaction at its next meeting. In addition, the Board of Directors has delegated to the Chair of the Committee the authority to pre-approve or ratify, as applicable, any related person transaction in which the aggregate amount involved is expected to be less than $500,000.
In addition, if a related person transaction is ongoing in nature and the Committee has previously approved it, or the transaction otherwise already exists, the Committee will review the transaction during its first meeting of each fiscal year to:
We will consider a related person transaction approved or ratified if the transaction is authorized by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or the Chair, as applicable, in accordance with the standards described below, after full disclosure of the related person's interests in the transaction. As appropriate for the circumstances, the Committee will review and consider such of the following as it deems necessary or appropriate:
The Committee will review such additional information about the transaction as it in its sole discretion shall deem relevant. The Committee may approve or ratify the transaction only if the Committee determines that, based on its review, the transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, the best interests of Sysco. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, impose such conditions as it deems appropriate on Sysco or the related person when approving a transaction. If the Committee or the Chair, as applicable, does not ratify a related person transaction, we will either rescind or modify the transaction, as the Committee or the Chair, as applicable, directs, as soon as practicable following the failure to ratify the transaction. The Chair will report to the Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting any action that he or she has taken under the authority delegated pursuant to this policy.

Transactions with Related Persons
Mr. Golden, one of our former directors who retired on November 17, 2017, is the sole stockholder of Jonathan Golden, P.C., a partner in the law firm of Arnall Golden Gregory LLP, Atlanta, Georgia, which provided legal services to Sysco during fiscal 2018 and continues to do so. During fiscal 2018, Sysco incurred approximately $1.8 million in legal fees and disbursements related to these services. We believe the amounts were fair and reasonable in view of the level and extent of services rendered. Due to this relationship, Mr. Golden was not considered to be an independent director under the NYSE standards or the categorical standards set forth in Sysco's Corporate Governance Guidelines.
Ms. Twila Day is the wife of William Day, our former Executive Vice President, Merchandising, who retired on August 1, 2017. Ms. Day previously served as Sysco's Vice President and Chief Information Officer from December 2005 until January 2010, when she was promoted to Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer, and served in this position until her departure from Sysco effective June 29, 2013. Following her departure from Sysco, Ms. Day accepted a position as a managing director of the consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal, which has provided consulting services to Sysco since 2004. Sysco and its affiliates purchased approximately $11.7 million in consulting services from this firm in fiscal 2018, although Ms. Day did not personally provide any services to Sysco, nor did she receive any compensation as a result of these services.
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has approved each of the above transactions in accordance with the disclosed policies and procedures.
Risk Oversight
One of the primary oversight functions of the Board is to ensure that Sysco has an appropriate enterprise risk management process in place that is consistent with both the short and long-term goals of the Company. In order to effectively fulfill this oversight role, the Board relies on various individuals and committees within management and among our Board members. See "Board of Directors Matters—Election of Directors at 2018 Annual Meeting (Item 1) —Director Qualifications and Board Succession" and "Board of Directors Matters—Board Composition" below for a description of individual director qualifications, including risk management experience.
Management is responsible for identifying, managing and mitigating enterprise risks, and reports directly to the Audit Committee and the Board on a regular basis with respect to enterprise risk management. As discussed above under "Board Meetings and Committees of the Board," the Audit Committee reviews Sysco's process by which management assesses and manages the Company's exposure to enterprise risk. The Audit Committee also makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the process by which members of the Board and relevant committees will be made aware of the Company's significant risks, including recommendations regarding what committee of the Board would be most appropriate to take responsibility for oversight of management with respect to the most material risks faced by the Company. On an annual basis, management reviews with the Board the key enterprise risks identified in the process, such as strategic, operational, financial, compliance and reputation risks, as well as management's process for addressing and mitigating the potential effects of such risks. Sysco has developed an enhanced enterprise risk management process that includes frequent discussion and prioritization of key risk issues by the executive management team, a deep dive approach to fully understand the risks, creation of an enterprise risk management plan in support of lowering the risk's exposure to the level of management's preferred tolerance, and tracking and monitoring of risk information and management's execution of the plan, all within a governance and reporting cadence.
The Board's committees help oversee the enterprise risk management process within the respective areas of the committees' delegated oversight authority. The Audit Committee is primarily responsible for hiring and evaluating our independent registered public accounting firm, reviewing our internal controls, overseeing our internal audit function, overseeing customer credit risk, reviewing contingent liabilities that may be material to the Company and various regulatory and compliance oversight functions. The Compensation Committee is responsible for ensuring that our executive compensation policies and practices do not incentivize excessive or inappropriate risk-taking by employees. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee monitors risk by ensuring that proper corporate governance standards are maintained, that the Board is comprised of qualified directors, and that qualified individuals are chosen as senior officers. The Chairman of the Board coordinates the flow of information regarding enterprise risk oversight from each respective committee to the independent directors and participates in the review of the agenda for each Board and Committee meeting. As the areas of oversight among committees sometimes overlap, committees may hold joint meetings when appropriate and address certain enterprise risk oversight issues at the full Board level. The Board considers enterprise risk in evaluating the Company's strategy, including specific strategic and emerging risks, and annually reviews and approves corporate goals and capital budgets. The Board also monitors any specific enterprise risks for which it has chosen to retain oversight rather than delegating oversight to one of its committees, such as risks related to cyber-security and succession planning.
Code of Conduct
Our Global Code of Conduct is guided by our values and expectations that we believe are important to delivering exceptional service with the highest degree of integrity. We require all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller, to understand and abide by the Code, as it represents our commitment to continuously deliver excellence with integrity by conducting our business in accordance with the highest standards of moral and ethical behavior.
Our Global Code of Conduct addresses the following, among other topics:
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    21
Our Code, which is reviewed annually by our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, requires strict adherence to all laws and regulations applicable to our business and requires employees to report any violations or suspected violations of the Code. We have published the Global Code of Conduct on our website under "Investors— Corporate Governance" at www.sysco.com. We intend to disclose any future amendments to or waivers of our Code on our website at www.sysco.com under the heading "Investors— Corporate Governance."
Reporting a Concern or Violation
Our Code explains that there are multiple channels for an employee to report a concern, including to his or her manager, a human resource professional, our legal or ethics and compliance department, or to the Sysco Ethics Line. Our Ethics Line is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, worldwide, to receive calls or web submissions from anyone wishing to report a concern or complaint, anonymous or otherwise. Our Ethics Line contact information can be found on our website at www.sysco.com under the heading "About Sysco – The Sysco Story – Code of Conduct."
Any report to any one of our multiple channels for reporting concerns that raises a concern or allegation of impropriety relating to our accounting, internal controls or other financial or audit matters is immediately forwarded to our Executive Vice President, Administration and Corporate Secretary, who is then responsible for reporting such matters, unfiltered, to the Chair of our Audit Committee. All such matters are investigated and responded to in accordance with the procedures established by the Audit Committee to ensure compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
Compensation Consultants
In November 2016, the Compensation Committee retained Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC ("Semler Brossy") as its executive compensation consultant. Retained by and reporting directly to the Compensation Committee, Semler Brossy provided the Committee with assistance in evaluating Sysco's executive compensation programs and policies, and, where appropriate, assisted with the redesign and enhancement of elements of the programs. The scope of Semler Brossy's assignments with regard to fiscal 2018 and 2019 executive compensation included:
Semler Brossy also advised the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee with respect to non-employee director compensation. At the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's request, Semler Brossy provided data regarding the amounts and types of compensation paid to non-employee directors at the companies in Sysco's peer group, and also identified trends in director compensation. All decisions regarding non-employee director compensation are recommended by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and approved by the Board. In addition to providing background information and written materials, Semler Brossy representatives attended meetings at which the Committee Chairmen believed that their expertise would be beneficial to the Committees' discussions. Neither Semler Brossy nor any of its affiliates provided any additional services to Sysco and its affiliates in fiscal 2018, or any such services in fiscal 2019 through the date of the proxy statement, and Sysco does not expect Semler Brossy to provide any such services to Sysco in the future. The Compensation Committee has determined that Semler Brossy is independent from the Company and that no conflicts of interest exist related to Semler Brossy's services provided to the Compensation Committee. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis–How Executive Pay is Established—Committee Oversight."
For a discussion of the role of the CEO and other executive officers in determining or recommending NEO compensation, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – How Executive Pay is Established – Role of CEO and/or Other Executive Officers in Determining NEO Compensation."

BOARD OF DIRECTORS MATTERS
Election of Directors at 2018 Annual Meeting (Item 1)
Election Process
The company's bylaws provide for majority voting in uncontested director elections. Majority voting means that directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast—that is, the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that director. Any incumbent director who is not re-elected in an election in which majority voting applies shall tender his or her resignation promptly following certification of the stockholders' vote. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall consider the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation offer, or whether other action should be taken. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the committee or the decision of the Board with respect to his or her resignation. The Board shall act on the recommendation within 120 days following certification of the stockholders' vote and shall promptly disclose its decision regarding whether to accept the director's resignation offer. In contested elections, where there are more nominees than seats on the Board as of the record date of the meeting at which the election will take place, directors are elected by a plurality vote. This means that the nominees who receive the most votes of all the votes cast for directors will be elected.
Nomination Process
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, which we refer to in this section below as the "Committee," is responsible for identifying and evaluating candidates for election to Sysco's Board of Directors.
Director Candidates Identified by the Board and Management
In identifying candidates for election to the Board, the Committee will determine which of the incumbent directors has an interest in being nominated for re-election at the next meeting of stockholders. The Committee will also identify and evaluate new candidates for election to the Board for the purpose of filling vacancies. The Committee will solicit recommendations for nominees from persons that the Committee believes are likely to be familiar with qualified candidates, including current members of the Board and Sysco's management. The Committee may also determine to engage a professional search firm to assist in identifying qualified candidates. When such a search firm is engaged, the Committee shall set its fees and scope of engagement.
During 2018, in connection with the Board refreshment efforts described above, the Board engaged the services of a search firm to assist with identifying and recruiting appropriate director candidates. Following consideration of director candidates referred by our then-current directors and identified by our search firm, upon the recommendation of our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, in April 2018 our Board unanimously expanded the size of the Board from 13 to 14 directors and elected one new independent, non-employee director: Mr. Hinshaw. The size of the Board will be reduced from 14 to 12 directors, effective at the time of the Annual Meeting, in connection with the expiration of Ms. Ward's and Mr. Tilghman's terms. As our longest-tenured directors retire from the Board pursuant to the director tenure policy, we will continue our director recruitment efforts to help ensure that the size of the Board may be maintained at an appropriate level.
Director Candidates Recommended by Stockholders
The Committee will also consider candidates recommended by stockholders. The Committee will evaluate such recommendations using the same criteria that it uses to evaluate other director candidates. Stockholders can recommend candidates for consideration by the Committee by writing to the Corporate Secretary, 1390 Enclave Parkway, Houston, Texas 77077, and including the following information:
The Committee will consider, in advance of Sysco's next annual meeting of stockholders, those director candidate recommendations that the Committee receives by May 1, 2019.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    23
In addition, if we receive by June 7, 2019, a recommendation of a director candidate from one or more stockholders who have beneficially owned at least five percent of our outstanding common stock for at least one year as of the date the stockholder makes the recommendation, then we will disclose in our next proxy materials relating to the election of directors the identity of the candidate, the identity of the nominating stockholder(s) and whether the Committee determined to nominate such candidate for election to the Board. However, we will not provide this disclosure without first obtaining written consent of such disclosure from both the nominating stockholder and the candidate it is planning to recommend. The Committee will maintain appropriate records regarding its process of identifying and evaluating candidates for election to the Board. The Committee has not received any recommendations for director nominees for election at the 2018 annual stockholders meeting from any Sysco stockholders beneficially owning more than five percent of Sysco's outstanding common stock.
Proxy Access Director Candidates
Our "proxy access" bylaw provisions permit an eligible stockholder (or a group of up to 20 eligible stockholders), who have continuously owned for a period of three years at least 3% of the aggregate of our outstanding common stock, to nominate a number of director nominees equal to 20% (rounded down) of the total number of directors constituting our Board (provided that, if the total number of directors is less than 10, an eligible stockholder or group may nominate up to 2 persons), which nominees will be included in our proxy statement for the relevant annual stockholders meeting if the nominating stockholder(s) and the respective nominee(s) comply with all applicable eligibility, procedural and disclosure requirements set forth in our bylaws.
Evaluation of Director Candidates
In evaluating all incumbent and new director candidates that the Committee determines merit consideration, the Committee will:
In its discretion, the Committee may designate one or more of its members, or the entire Committee, to interview any proposed candidate. Based on all available information and relevant considerations, the Committee will recommend to the full Board for nomination those candidates who, in the judgment of the Committee, are most appropriate for membership on the Board based on each candidate's characteristics, skills and qualifications.
Diversity
As a matter of practice, the Board looks for diversity in nominees such that the individuals possess enhanced perspective and experience through diversity in race, gender, ethnicity, cultural background, age, geographic origin, education, and professional and life experiences. Because we value gender and racial diversity among our Board members, two of our Board nominees are women, including one African American, and two of our Board nominees are from outside the United States.
Director Qualifications and Board Succession
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for reviewing with the Board, on an annual basis, the requisite characteristics, skills and qualifications that directors and director candidates should possess individually and in the broader context of the Board's overall composition and the Company's business and structure. This review includes consideration of diversity, skills, experience, time available and the number of other boards for which the individual serves as a director, and such other criteria as the Committee shall determine to be relevant at the time. The Committee is responsible for developing a succession plan for the Board and making recommendations to the Board regarding director succession.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    24
Key Characteristics of All Nominees
Each director nominee should demonstrate and possess all of the following characteristics:
Director Qualifications
In fiscal 2018, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee surveyed director qualifications, as recently disclosed by the Fortune 100 companies, to validate its previously compiled list of key qualification categories. Subsequently, each director was requested to review this list of qualification categories to identify the relative significance of each category to the ability of the Board, as a whole, to guide management in the achievement of the Company's strategic priorities. The feedback from each of the individual directors was collected, analyzed and reported to the Committee, which utilized this feedback to identify the director qualifications that the Committee has endorsed as most significant for the Board to possess, collectively, and which are described below.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    25
In selecting the director nominees, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board reviewed each of the incumbent directors in light of these qualifications and the Company's strategic priorities, and it concluded that each of the nominees contributed significantly to the Board's collective portfolio of requisite skills, characteristics and qualifications and to the Board's overall composition. The Committee and the Board expect to continue to utilize these qualification criteria in connection with their ongoing Board refreshment efforts to identify additional candidates for future Board service.
The priorities and emphasis of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and of the Board with regard to these qualifications will change from time to time as the Company's strategic priorities and the composition of the Board evolve. Included in the individual biographies below is a discussion of the most significant aspects of each director's background that strengthen the Board's collective qualifications, skills and experience and that the Committee and the Board considered in reaching their conclusion that he or she should continue to serve as a director of Sysco.
Nominees for Election as Directors at the 2018 Annual Meeting
The Board of Directors has nominated the following twelve persons for election as directors to serve for one-year terms or until their successors are elected and qualified:
Ms. Jackie M. Ward and Mr. Richard G. Tilghman are not standing for re-election, and their terms will expire at the Annual Meeting. Each of the nominees is currently serving as a director of Sysco. Each of the nominees has consented to serve if elected. Although management does not contemplate the possibility, in the event that any nominee is not a candidate or is unable to serve as a director at the time of the election, the proxies will vote for any nominee who is designated by the present Board to fill the vacancy.
The Board believes that the combination of the various qualifications, skills and experiences of the nominees for election as directors at the Annual Meeting will contribute to an effective and well-functioning Board. Set forth below is biographical information for each of the nominees for election as a director at the Annual Meeting. Unless otherwise noted, the persons named below have been engaged in the principal occupations shown for the past five years or longer. In addition to the information described below, many of our directors serve as trustees, directors or officers of various non-profit, educational, charitable and philanthropic organizations.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" each of the nominees listed above.

SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    32
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Overview of Non-Employee Director Compensation
The Company uses a combination of cash and stock-based compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on the Board, as described below. Members of the Board who are employees of the Company are not compensated for services on the Board or any of its Committees. We currently pay each non-employee director a base retainer of $100,000 per year. Non-employee directors who serve as committee chairpersons receive annual additional amounts as follows:
Ms. Ward, who will retire as the Chairman of the Board and as a director on the date of the Annual Meeting, received an additional annual retainer of $475,000 for her service as Chairman of the Board, due to her incremental responsibilities, which included:
Ms. Ward's additional annual retainer for service as Chairman of the Board was paid quarterly in the form of "elected shares" that were deferred as described below under "—Deferral of Shares." See footnote 1 to the "Fiscal 2018 Director Compensation" table below for a detailed discussion of the elected shares deferred by Ms. Ward. Mr. Bené, who will succeed Ms. Ward as Chairman of the Board, will not receive additional compensation for his service as Chairman.
Each November, the Board grants approximately $160,000 in time vesting equity incentives to each of the non-employee directors in the form of restricted stock awards. For fiscal 2018, the Board granted approximately $160,000 in restricted stock awards that vest in full on the first anniversary of the grant date. See "Equity-Based Awards to Non-Employee Directors" below for a description of the plan under which these awards were granted, the "Fiscal 2018 Director Compensation" table below for detailed compensation information for fiscal 2018 for each of our non-employee directors and "Stock Ownership—Stock Ownership Guidelines" below for a description of the stock ownership requirements applicable to our non-employee directors. In the event that the Sysco Corporation 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan is approved by stockholders at the Annual Meeting, future grants of equity awards to the non-employee directors, including any restricted stock awards, will be made pursuant to such plan.
Reimbursement of Expenses
All non-employee directors are entitled to receive reimbursements of expenses for all services as a director, including committee participation or special assignments. Reimbursement for non-employee director travel may include reimbursement of a portion of the cost of travel on private aircraft. Specifically, this includes reimbursement for non-commercial air travel in connection with Sysco business, subject to specified maximums, provided that amounts related to the purchase price of an aircraft or fractional interest in an aircraft are not reimbursable and any portion of the reimbursement that relates to insurance, maintenance and other non-incremental costs is limited to a maximum annual amount. Non-employee directors also receive discounts on products carried by the Company and its subsidiaries comparable to the discounts offered to all company employees.
Directors Deferred Compensation Plan
Non-employee directors may defer all or a portion of their annual retainer, including additional fees paid to committee chairpersons and the Chairman of the Board's and/or Lead Director's annual retainer, under the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan. Non-employee directors may choose from a variety of investment options, including Moody's Average Corporate Bond Yield plus 1%, with respect to amounts deferred prior to fiscal 2009. This investment option was reduced to Moody's Average Corporate Bond Yield, without the addition of 1%, for amounts deferred after fiscal 2008. We credit such deferred amounts with investment gains or losses until the non-employee director's retirement from the Board or until the occurrence of certain other events.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    33
Equity-Based Awards to Non-Employee Directors
As of September 17, 2018, the non-employee directors held shares of restricted stock and elected and match shares (as described below), all of which were issued under the 2013 Sysco Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the "2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan." Below is a description of the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan. In the event that the 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan is approved by stockholders, all equity awards to directors thereafter will be made under that plan.
Election to Receive a Portion of the Annual Retainer in Common Stock
Under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, instead of receiving his or her full annual retainer fee in cash, a non-employee director may elect to receive up to 100% of his or her annual retainer fee, including any additional retainer fee paid to the Chairman of the Board and/or Lead Director for his or her service in such capacity and any fees paid to a committee chairman for his or her service in such capacity, in 10% increments, in common stock. If a director makes this election, on the date we make each quarterly payment of the director's annual retainer fee we credit the director's stock account with:
The elected shares and match shares vest as soon as we credit the director's account with them, but we do not issue them until the end of the calendar year. The director may not transfer the match shares, however, until one year after we issue them, or, if deferred, the date that we otherwise would have issued them, provided that certain events will cause this transfer restriction to lapse.
The one year transfer restriction on match shares will lapse if:
Annual Awards of Restricted Stock
Pursuant to the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Board may grant to non-employee directors, among other things, shares of restricted stock, in the amounts and on such terms as it determines, but no such grant may vest earlier than one year following the grant date. A restricted stock award is denominated in shares of common stock and is subject to transfer restrictions and the possibility of forfeiture. In November 2017, we issued restricted stock awards to non-employee directors under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Generally, if a director ceases to serve as a director of Sysco, he or she will forfeit all the unvested restricted stock that he or she holds. However, if the director leaves the board after serving out his or her term, or for any reason after reaching age 71, his or her restricted stock will remain in effect and continue to vest as if the director had remained a director of Sysco. All unvested restricted stock will automatically vest upon the director's death.
Deferral of Shares
A non-employee director may elect to defer receipt of all or any portion of any shares of common stock issued under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, whether such shares are to be issued as a grant of restricted stock, elected shares or match shares. Generally, the receipt of stock may be deferred until the earliest to occur of the death of the non-employee director, the date on which the non-employee director ceases to be a director of the Company, or a change of control of Sysco. All such deferral elections shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Sysco's 2009 Board of Directors Stock Deferral Plan.
Change in Control
Under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the applicable grant agreements, any unvested awards of restricted stock will vest immediately upon the occurrence of a specified change in control.

STOCK OWNERSHIP
Security Ownership of Officers and Directors
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of Sysco's common stock, as of September 17, 2018, by (i) each current director and director nominee, (ii) each named executive officer (as defined under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis"), and (iii) all current directors and executive officers as a group. Unless otherwise indicated, each stockholder identified in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to his or her shares. Fractional shares have been rounded to the nearest whole share.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    38
Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners
The following table sets forth information concerning beneficial ownership of our common stock by persons or groups known to us to be beneficial owners of more than 5% of Sysco's common stock outstanding as of September 17, 2018. The applicable percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 520,689,279 shares outstanding as of September 17, 2018.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
To align the interests of our management with those of our stockholders, Sysco's Board of Directors concluded that our senior officers should have a significant financial stake in Sysco stock. To further that goal, for several years we have maintained stock ownership guidelines for our executives.
Pursuant to these guidelines, upon the end of the five-year period from the date the officer is hired, promoted or otherwise becomes subject to the guidelines, the following senior officers should own, based on their respective positions, a minimum number of shares equal in value to the multiple of each such officer's annual base salary as described in the following table.
Our senior officers have five years to achieve these ownership requirements. The five-year period begins on the date the officer is hired, promoted or otherwise becomes subject to the guidelines. If an individual is promoted to a position that requires the ownership of a greater amount of stock than his or her prior position, the five-year period pertaining to the new position will begin upon the effective date of the hiring or promotion; provided, further, however, that a promoted individual shall continue to comply with the above ownership requirements applicable to his or her prior position at all times subsequent to the promotion.
The shares counted towards these ownership requirements shall include Sysco shares of common stock owned directly by the senior officer, including shares of vested restricted stock held by the officer that may be subject to transfer restrictions or potential clawbacks, shares owned indirectly by the officer through any Sysco employee stock purchase plan, two-thirds of the shares underlying an officer's unvested restricted stock units, two-thirds of the shares of unvested restricted stock held by the officer, and one-quarter of the shares underlying performance share units held by the officer, rounded down to the nearest whole share and assuming satisfaction of all applicable financial performance criteria at the "target" level, and shall not include shares held through any other form of indirect beneficial ownership or shares underlying unexercised options. Equity-based incentive awards are anticipated to provide all senior officers with the opportunity to satisfy these requirements within the specified time frames.
These ownership requirements are set at levels that Sysco believes are reasonable given the senior officers' respective salaries and responsibility levels. In addition, Semler Brossy has reviewed our ownership guidelines and confirmed that they are consistent with the corresponding practices of our peer group.
In connection with the ownership requirements described above, each senior officer of the Company shall retain 25% of the net shares acquired upon exercise of stock options and 100% of the net shares acquired pursuant to the vesting of RSUs and PSUs until the officer's holdings of Company stock equal or exceed the applicable minimum ownership requirement. For these purposes, "net shares" shall mean the shares remaining after disposition of shares necessary to pay the related tax liability and, if applicable, exercise price.
The Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that, after five years of service as a non-employee director, such individuals are expected to continuously own a minimum of 16,500 shares of Sysco common stock. The shares beneficially owned by Trian, as reported above under " – Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners," are credited to Messrs. Frank and Peltz for purposes of our ownership requirements.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    39
We provide the Board of Directors with the status of the officers' and directors' stock ownership at all of the regularly-scheduled meetings to ensure compliance with these holding requirements. As of September 17, 2018, each of the named executive officers and directors were in compliance with the applicable stock ownership guidelines.
Stock Trading Restrictions
Directors and executive officers may only purchase and sell Sysco common stock and exercise stock options pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan adopted during an approved quarterly trading window, subject to limited exceptions, including "net exercises" of stock options that do not involve an open market sale of shares and hardship exemptions. Quarterly trading windows generally open two business days after Sysco issues its quarterly earnings release and typically close around seven weeks after the opening of the window.
The adoption of a 10b5-1 trading plan or other transaction in Sysco stock by such directors and executive officers must be pre-approved by a committee that includes the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Chief Executive Officer and the Company's chief legal officer, following their review of the amount and timing of the proposed transaction and their confirmation that the individual in question does not possess any material inside information about the Company. Trades under a 10b5-1 trading plan may not commence until 30 days after adoption of the plan.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules issued thereunder, our executive officers and directors and any persons holding more than ten percent (10%) of our common stock are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange reports of initial ownership of our common stock and changes in ownership of such common stock. To our knowledge, no person beneficially owns more than 10% of our common stock. Copies of the Section 16 reports filed by our directors and executive officers are required to be furnished to us. Based solely on our review of the copies of the reports furnished to us, or written representations that no reports were required, we believe that, during fiscal 2018, all of our executive officers and directors complied with the Section 16(a) requirements.
EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION
The following table sets forth certain information regarding equity compensation plans as of June 30, 2018.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    40
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
In this section, we provide an overview of our philosophy and objectives of our executive compensation program and describe the material components of our executive compensation program for our fiscal 2018 named executive officers, or "NEOs," whose compensation is set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and other compensation tables contained in this proxy statement:
As explained in further detail below, Mr. DeLaney transitioned out of his roles as CEO and a member of the Board effective December 31, 2017. Since that date, Mr. DeLaney has continued full-time employment with the Company as a consultant and mentor to our current CEO, Mr. Bené, and this transitional period continues through December 31, 2018. For purposes of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the related disclosures that follow under the heading "Executive Compensation" below, the term "Current NEOs" excludes Mr. DeLaney. Except as otherwise noted, the guiding principles, decision-making methodologies, objectives and rationales described in this section applied to Mr. DeLaney's fiscal 2018 compensation as CEO until he transitioned out of that role on December 31, 2017. For information regarding Mr. DeLaney's compensation during the transitional period, see "Executive Compensation – CEO Succession Compensation Arrangements – Transition and Retirement Agreement with Mr. DeLaney."
Executive Summary
Sysco is the global leader in selling, marketing and distributing food products, equipment and supplies to the foodservice industry. As such, our long-term success depends on our ability to attract, engage, incentivize and retain highly talented individuals who are committed to Sysco's vision and strategy. One of the key objectives of our executive compensation program is to link executives' pay to their performance and their advancement of Sysco's overall annual and long-term performance and business strategies. Other objectives include aligning the executives' interests with those of stockholders and encouraging high-performing executives to remain with Sysco over the course of their careers. We believe that Sysco's compensation strategies have been effective in attracting executive talent and promoting performance and retention. We also believe that the amount of compensation for each NEO reflects his extensive management experience, high performance and exceptional service to Sysco and our stockholders.
Business Highlights
For more detail please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Our discussion below of our results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends. Any non-GAAP financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from: (1) expenses associated with our revised business technology strategy announced in fiscal 2016, as a result of which we incurred costs to convert to a modernized version of our established platform as opposed to completing the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system; (2) professional fees related to our three-year strategic plans; (3) restructuring expenses within our Brakes Group operations; (4) severance charges related to restructuring; and (5) foreign non-income based taxes. In addition, fiscal 2018 results of operations are impacted by business technology transformation initiative costs, facility closure charges, multiemployer pension (MEPP) withdrawal charges and debt extinguishment charges, which are also excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.
The non-GAAP financial measures presented also exclude the impact of the following acquisition-related items: (1) intangible amortization expense and (2) integration costs. All acquisition-related costs in fiscal 2018 and 2017 that have been excluded relate to the fiscal 2017 acquisition of Cucina Lux Investments Limited (the Brakes Acquisition), discussed in Note 4, "Acquisitions." The Brakes Acquisition also resulted in non-recurring tax expense in fiscal 2017, primarily from non-deductible transaction costs.
The non-GAAP financial measures presented further exclude certain impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) enacted on December 22, 2017. The impact for fiscal 2018 includes: a provisional estimate of a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and a net benefit from remeasuring Sysco's accrued income taxes, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets due to the changes in tax rates. Other tax-related items impacting results of operations include foreign withholding taxes on repatriated earnings, net of foreign tax credits, and a benefit from contributions made to fund Sysco's tax-qualified United States (U.S.) pension plan (the U.S. Retirement Plan).
The fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 items described above and excluded from our non-GAAP measures are collectively referred to as "Certain Items." In addition, our adjusted return on invested capital performance targets, as measured for purposes of our performance share units and cash performance units, were established prior to the Brakes Acquisition. Accordingly, the results used for determining payouts excluded the Brakes Acquisition to adjust for the accumulation of debt incurred for the Brakes Acquisition that would not have been borrowed absent this acquisition.

The overall macroeconomic trends continue to be positive in the U.S., and the underlying economic picture remains encouraging, including a strong employment market. This has resulted in a healthy consumer that is helping to drive a positive trend in restaurant sales. We also see continued growth with local customers, as they increase their reach through flexible menus, innovative concepts and additional delivery options to reach consumers. The U.K market continues to experience acute product inflation in the mid-to-high single digits. Throughout fiscal 2018, we improved our customer experience through enhanced service levels, improved sales retention and higher customer loyalty, enhanced associate engagement through improved workplace safety and improved associate retention through attractive career growth opportunities. These were all key targeted steps towards achieving our initial three-year plan financial objectives.
Comparison of our results from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017:
Say on Pay – Stockholder Feedback
At last year's Annual Meeting, 96.5% of the shares that were voted with respect to the Company's "Say on Pay" proposal (excluding abstentions) voted "FOR" the proposal. At the same meeting, 91.1% of shares voted indicated a preference for annual Say on Pay advisory votes. In light of these voting results, the Board has decided to include the advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation in its proxy materials on an annual basis until the next required advisory vote on the frequency of the advisory stockholder vote on compensation paid to the Company's NEOs. Further, during the past year, we continued to engage in dialogue with some of our largest stockholders to solicit their feedback and gather information on their views and opinions on various operations and governance issues, including executive compensation practices. After considering the results of the fiscal 2017 "Say on Pay" advisory vote, the Compensation Committee, which we refer to below as the "Committee," determined to continue the emphasis on performance-based compensation for fiscal 2019. The Committee carefully considers feedback from our stockholders regarding our executive compensation program. In addition to the annual "Say on Pay" advisory vote on NEO compensation and the Company's stockholder engagement efforts, stockholders are invited to express their views to the Committee as described under the heading "Corporate Governance–Communicating with the Board."
Our Practices
Below we highlight certain executive compensation practices applicable to our NEOs that we have implemented to drive performance and support the best standards in corporate governance, as well as practices we have not implemented because we do not believe that they would serve our stockholders' long-term interests.

What We Don't Do
How Pay is Tied to Performance
Sysco's executive compensation program directly links the significant majority of an executive's compensation opportunity to Sysco's financial performance through annual and long-term incentives. The Target Compensation Mix charts below describe each of the principal non-retirement compensation elements for the CEO and the other Current NEOs for fiscal 2018 as a percent of total target direct compensation, including base salary with respect to fiscal 2018 and award opportunities related to annual and LTI compensation granted in fiscal 2018 and valued at target levels, and excluding (i) any amounts paid with respect to prior years' incentive award grants or (ii) the value of any retirement benefits. Target compensation set forth for Mr. Bené in the chart below includes the one-time award of RSUs granted in February 2018 in connection with his promotion to Chief Executive Officer. See " – What We Paid and Why – Compensation for NEOs – Long-Term Incentives" below.

SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    43
The Committee has not historically used an exact formula for allocating between fixed and variable, cash and non-cash, or short-term and long-term compensation, allowing it to incorporate flexibility into our annual and long-term compensation programs and adjust for the evolving business environment.
The value of Sysco's stock options, PSUs and RSUs is directly linked to Sysco's stock performance. How we derive the values of the components of Sysco's long-term incentives is discussed under "— How Executive Pay is Established" below. Including the annual incentive award, payment of which is largely dependent on Sysco's financial performance, these performance-linked components constituted approximately 87% and 80%, respectively, of the total target direct compensation of our CEO and the Current NEOs (on average) for the period presented.
Recent Highlights of Our Executive Compensation Program
Sysco is committed to providing and maintaining a competitive executive compensation program. In addition, we continue to address ways in which our pay can be appropriately linked to Company performance. Highlights of Sysco's executive compensation program for fiscal 2018, as established by the Committee, are set forth in the table below. The fiscal 2019 executive compensation program design is substantially consistent with the fiscal 2018 program, excluding (i) the one-time promotional LTI award for Mr. Bené and (ii) the fiscal 2018 Section 162(m) umbrella bonus pool, which imposed maximums on the amounts of the annual incentive awards and which was eliminated for fiscal 2019, as discussed below under " – What We Paid and Why – Compensation for NEOs – Annual Incentive Award – Detailed Information – Limit on Fiscal 2018 Maximum Annual Incentive Award Payments."

Philosophy of Executive Compensation Program
Our executive compensation plans directly link a substantial portion of annual executive compensation to Sysco's performance. These plans are designed to deliver highly competitive compensation for superior company performance. Likewise, when Company performance falls short of expectations, our variable incentive programs deliver lower levels of compensation. However, the Committee tries to balance pay-for-performance objectives with retention considerations, so that, even during temporary downturns in the economy and the foodservice industry, the programs continue to ensure that qualified, successful, performance-driven employees stay committed to increasing Sysco's long-term value. Furthermore, to attract and retain highly skilled management, our compensation program must remain competitive with those of comparable employers who compete with us for talent.
Core Principles
We use the following key principles as the cornerstone of Sysco's executive compensation philosophy to attract, develop and retain business leaders to drive financial and strategic growth and build long-term stockholder value:
Components and Objectives of Executive Compensation Program
The Committee has built the executive compensation program upon a framework that includes the following components and objectives, each of which is described in greater detail later in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The Committee routinely reviews each component of the executive compensation program to see how it affects target total pay levels and generally positions the target total direct compensation levels for our Current NEOs at the median of our peer companies for median performance. The variable, performance-linked components of total direct compensation are structured to reward our Current NEOs at higher levels than the median of our peer companies when superior performance is achieved, while below median performance results in compensation that is below that of the median of our peer companies.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Annual Compensation   Base      Salary   The Committee generally sets base salaries at or below market competitive      levels to provide a fixed, competitive base of cash compensation and to provide enhanced weighting to the incentive- based      components of the overall pay program. The Committee then may adjust the base salaries based on a number of factors, which      may include merit increases, the executive's unique job responsibilities, management experience, individual contributions,      number of years in his or her position and market position of current salary, as described under "What We Paid and Why"      below.•  Annual Compensation   Base      Salary   The Committee generally sets base salaries at or below market competitive      levels to provide a fixed, competitive base of cash compensation and to provide enhanced weighting to the incentive- based      components of the overall pay program.

We pay the annual incentive award in cash in the first quarter of the fiscal year for performance in the prior fiscal year. Payment of the annual incentive award is based on satisfaction of performance criteria that the Committee believes ultimately create stockholder value. Performance metrics for the annual incentive are, in part, based on position and area of responsibility. For fiscal 2018 the NEOs (other than Mr. Bertrand) had targets established based on performance of the Company on a consolidated basis. Metrics for Mr. Bertrand included a performance component based on overall Company performance, as well as a performance component based on the performance of the U.S. Foodservice Operations segment. In addition, for fiscal 2018, 25% of the annual incentive opportunity for each of the NEOs was based on his performance with respect to his SBOs.   For a discussion of the threshold requirements for payment of each component of the annual incentive award for each of the NEOs, see "Executive Compensation – Annual Incentive Awards – Fiscal 2018 MIP Annual Incentive Awards" below.•                 Annual      Incentive Award   The annual incentive award is designed to offer opportunities for cash compensation tied directly to Company performance.

SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    46
How Executive Pay is Established
The Committee, in consultation with management and the Committee's independent compensation consultant, continues to focus on ensuring that our executive compensation programs reinforce our pay for performance philosophy and enhance stockholder value. During fiscal 2018, the Committee utilized Semler Brossy Consulting Group LLC, referred to herein as "Semler Brossy," as its independent compensation consultant. For fiscal 2018, Semler Brossy assisted the Committee in conducting an annual assessment of Sysco's executive compensation, as well as in evaluating their pay relative to the performance and contributions of each NEO over the year. After reviewing competitive studies provided by its independent compensation consultant, the Committee determined that each NEO's then current target compensation provided the executive with an appropriate compensation opportunity. The Committee later determined, based on the Company's fiscal 2018 performance, that each NEO's total fiscal 2018 compensation was generally appropriate in light of overall Company performance and the NEO's personal performance.
In developing Sysco's pay for performance policies, the Committee generally evaluates elements of pay as compared to a compensation peer group, as discussed below. However, the Committee has not historically used a precise formula for allocating between fixed and variable, cash and non-cash, or short-term and long-term compensation, allowing it to incorporate flexibility into our annual and long-term compensation programs and adjust for the evolving business environment.
Committee Oversight
The Committee, which is comprised entirely of independent directors, is responsible for overseeing Sysco's executive compensation program. The Committee determines and approves all compensation of the CEO and Sysco's other senior officers, including the NEOs. Although the Committee meets jointly with the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to discuss both the CEO's personal goals and his performance in achieving such goals in each fiscal year, the Committee is solely responsible for approving all compensation awards and payment levels. The Committee develops and oversees programs designed to compensate our corporate officers, including the NEOs, as well as the presidents and executive vice presidents of our operating companies. The Committee is also authorized to approve all grants of PSUs, stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, cash and other awards to NEOs under our stockholder approved Sysco Corporation 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Further information regarding the Committee's responsibilities is found under "Corporate Governance – Board Meetings and Committees" and in the Committee's Charter, available on the Sysco website at www.sysco.com under "Investors — Corporate Governance –Board of Directors & Committee Composition."
The Committee has several resources and analytical tools it considers in making decisions related to executive compensation. The table that follows discusses the key tools the Committee uses.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    47
Role of CEO and/or Other Executive Officers in Determining NEO Compensation
As described in the table above, each of our current and former CEOs provided recommendations to the Committee for each element of compensation for each of the NEOs other than himself, except that Mr. DeLaney did not provide any recommendations with respect to the fiscal 2018 compensation for Mr. Bené. In forming his recommendations, each CEO was advised by HR as described above. HR assesses the design of, and makes recommendations related to, Sysco's compensation and benefit programs. The CEO also consults with other senior officers of the Company for recommendations related to the appropriate financial and non-financial performance measures used in our incentive programs. In developing recommendations for the Committee, the CEO and HR consult benchmarking analyses and other market data from the Committee's independent compensation consultant and other advisors, as described elsewhere in this proxy statement, and follow the philosophy and pursue the objectives described above under "– Philosophy of Executive Compensation Program."
The Committee, with input from its independent compensation consultant, determines each element of compensation for the CEO. With input from its independent compensation consultant, HR and the CEO, the Committee determines each element of compensation for the other NEOs. The Committee is under no obligation to utilize these recommendations. Executive officers and others may also participate in discussions with the Committee when invited to do so.
Use of Peer Group and Survey Data
Sysco is the largest global distributor of food and food related products primarily to the food service and food-away-from-home industry, and, with the exception of two U.S. public company competitors, the other companies in the foodservice industry are significantly smaller and privately-held. We believe that these smaller, privately-held businesses would not create a satisfactory comparison group due to the greater skill levels and abilities required to manage a public company of Sysco's size, complexity and global operations. Accordingly, the Committee concluded that the most comparable companies with respect to executive pay include (i) two U.S. public company foodservice distribution competitors and (ii) companies in other industries whose business size and complexity are similar to ours and with which we compete for top executive talent. However, due to the lack of a sufficient number of directly comparable public companies, the peer group developed for the executive compensation analysis for our NEOs is not the same peer group that is used in the stock performance graph included in our annual report to stockholders.
The Committee continually evaluates the compensation analysis peer group for appropriateness and, in fiscal year 2018, the Committee modified the peer group based on recommendations by Semler Brossy and input from management. Revenue, market capitalization, and earnings before interest and taxes were used as the primary screening criteria, and the peer companies were selected from among those in the logistics and distribution, consumer products and retail sectors. The peer group utilized by the Committee for executive pay and performance benchmarking for decisions made for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 (through February 2018) was not the same peer group used for all such compensation decisions made after February 2018.
The companies in the peer group for executive pay and performance benchmarking for decisions made for fiscal 2018 (through February 2018) are the following, which we refer to as our "2018 peer group" or "2018 peer companies" throughout this proxy statement:
The companies in the peer group for executive pay and performance benchmarking for decisions made for fiscal 2018 (after February 2018) and fiscal 2019 are the following, which we refer to as our "2019 peer group" or "2019 peer companies" throughout this proxy statement:
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    48
Changes to the peer group for fiscal 2019 served to re-balance the 2019 peer group towards more relevant comparators in a few key areas:
In order to demonstrate the appropriateness of the 2018 peer group selected for benchmarking NEO compensation in connection with the Committee's executive compensation determinations for fiscal 2018, Semler Brossy included in its May 2017 executive compensation study a comparison of Sysco's estimated revenues and market capitalization to the median of the 2018 peer companies, which is set forth below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
For purposes of the Committee's executive compensation decisions for fiscal 2019, Semler Brossy similarly included in its May 2018 executive compensation study the following comparison of Sysco's estimated revenues and market capitalization to the median of the 2019 peer companies:  
[END TABLE]
Peer group compensation data is limited to information that is publicly reported and, to the extent it deems appropriate, the Committee uses it to benchmark the major components of compensation for our NEOs.
Semler Brossy conducted an independent compensation study in May 2017 that compared Sysco's target total direct compensation (as defined below) for the NEOs to the 2018 peer group pay levels. This study was used to benchmark target pay levels and identify prevailing performance criteria. In addition to benchmarking the composition of the incentive opportunities, the Committee also validated Sysco's actual pay and performance alignment using total shareholder return (computed as of December 31, 2016) for one-year and three-year performance measures.
In May 2018, Semler Brossy prepared an updated report comparing the Company's fiscal 2018 target total direct compensation for the Current NEOs to the pay levels of the 2019 peer group, based on the most recent publicly available information regarding the compensation of the 2019 peers' named executive officers. For purposes of comparing Mr. Bené's compensation to the 2019 peer group, Semler Brossy annualized Mr. Bené compensation, based on his CEO base salary and annual incentive and LTI opportunities effective January 1, 2018. Based on the findings from this report, the Committee confirmed that the total targeted compensation for (1) each of Messrs. Libby and Shurts was below the 25th percentile, (2) each of Messrs. Bené and Bertrand was between the 25th and 50th percentile and (3) Mr. Grade was between the 50th and 75th percentile.
In addition, the Committee further reviewed in May 2018 the relationship between actual realizable pay (as defined below) for the NEOs (other than Mr. Bertrand) and the Company's total shareholder return for the three-year period from fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017 and found that actual compensation earned continued to be closely aligned with the Company's relative total shareholder return versus the 2019 peer group.
For purposes of the executive compensation studies referenced herein, with respect to the NEOs:

What We Paid and Why – Compensation for NEOs
Base Salary – Detailed Information
We pay base salaries to attract and retain talented executives and to provide a fixed base of cash compensation. The table below shows the annualized salaries of each NEO at the beginning of fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019, with the effective dates as noted below:
Base Salary – Analysis
Fiscal 2018 Base Salary
For fiscal 2018 base salary determinations, the Committee reviewed, for each NEO: (i) the executive's job responsibilities, management experience, individual contributions, tenure in his position and then-current salary; (ii) an independent compensation study from May 2017 by Semler Brossy that compared Sysco's target total direct compensation for the applicable period to the 2018 peer companies; and (iii) with respect to the compensation adjustments for Messrs. DeLaney and Bené in connection with the CEO succession plan, a compensation study prepared by Semler Brossy in July 2017 that benchmarked the proposed compensation levels against the median of the 2018 peer group. The Committee determined, as recommended by management, that it was appropriate to grant the salary increases for fiscal 2018 described in the table above. Following a comprehensive review of Mr. DeLaney's performance in fiscal 2017 by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Committee, and as provided in the Transition and Retirement Agreement with Mr. DeLaney described below under "Executive Compensation – CEO Succession Compensation Arrangements," the Committee determined that the CEO's base salary would be maintained at its then current level. Also in connection with the CEO succession plan, the Committee approved a salary adjustment for Mr. Bené of 12.5% for the period from September 3, 2017 through December 31, 2017, reflecting his additional job responsibilities associated with his transition to CEO, followed by an increase to $1.1 million on an annualized basis effective January 1, 2018. The Committee, after considering input from the CEO on each of their individual contributions, approved salary adjustments of 8.0% for Mr. Grade, 4.0% for Mr. Bertrand and 2.0% for Messrs. Libby and Shurts. As a result of these changes, based on the May 2017 Semler Brossy compensation study, the fiscal 2018 base salaries of Messrs. DeLaney and Bené were positioned between the 50th and 75th percentile of the 2018 peer group, the fiscal 2018 base salaries of Messrs. Libby and Shurts were positioned between the 25th and 50th percentile of the 2018 peer group and the base salary of Mr. Grade was positioned below the 25th percentile of the 2018 peer group. Based on the Semler Brossy July 2017 compensation study, Mr. Bené's annualized base salary as President and CEO, effective on January 1, 2018, approximated the 25th percentile of the 2018 peer group. Semler Brossy did not include Mr. Bertrand in its May 2017 comparative analysis, given that he was not a named executive officer at such time.
Fiscal 2019 Base Salary
For fiscal 2019 base salary determinations, the Committee again reviewed, for each Current NEO, the executive's job responsibilities, management experience, individual contributions, tenure in his position and then-current salary. The Committee determined that it was appropriate to grant the salary increases for fiscal 2019 described in the table above. Following a comprehensive review of Mr. Bené's performance in fiscal 2018 by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Committee, the compensation levels of the 2019 peer group and Mr. Bené's evaluation by the entire Board, the Committee approved an increase in Mr. Bené's base salary for fiscal 2019 of $100,000, or 9.1%. The Committee, after considering input from the CEO on each of their individual contributions and additional job responsibilities, approved salary adjustments for each of Mr. Grade of 2.2%, Mr. Bertrand of 2.3%, Mr. Libby of 2.1% and Mr. Shurts of 2.0%. The Committee approved these salary increases for annual market adjustments after considering recommendations and information provided by Semler Brossy and management. Following these changes, the fiscal 2019 base salaries of the Current NEOs placed as follows, as compared to the 2019 peer group: (1) Mr. Shurts below the 25th percentile, (2) Mr. Grade approximating the 25th percentile, (3) Messrs. Bené and Libby between the 25th and 50th percentile and (4) Mr. Bertrand between the 50th and 75th percentile.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    50
Annual Incentive Award – Detailed Information
The annual incentive award is designed to offer opportunities for cash compensation tied directly to company performance. In August 2017, the Committee approved, pursuant to authority established by the Sysco Corporation 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Sysco Corporation Fiscal 2018 Management Incentive Program for MIP Bonus-Eligible Participants (the "2018 MIP"). In July 2018, pursuant to the same stockholder approved authority, the Committee approved the Sysco Corporation Fiscal 2019 Management Incentive Program (MIP) For Corporate MIP Bonus-eligible Positions (the "2019 MIP").
Under the terms of the 2018 MIP and the 2019 MIP, we pay the annual incentive award in cash in the first quarter of the fiscal year for annual incentives earned for performance in the prior fiscal year.
Annual Incentive Award for Fiscal 2018
Under the 2018 MIP, each participating NEO's annual incentive opportunity was initially targeted at the following percentages of base salary: 150% for Mr. DeLaney, 125% for Mr. Bené, and 100% for Messrs. Grade, Bertrand, Libby and Shurts. In connection with his promotion, Mr. Bené's target annual incentive opportunity for fiscal 2018 increased from 125% to 150% of his annual base salary, effective for the period from January 1, 2018 through the end of fiscal 2018, resulting in a pro-rated annual incentive award opportunity.
The total annual incentive payment earned by each NEO (other than Mr. Bertrand) under the 2018 MIP was based:
For Mr. Bertrand, the total annual incentive payment earned under the 2018 MIP was based:
Each of the above components for the annual incentive payment was calculated and awarded independently, such that one portion of the award could have been earned even if the threshold level of performance for other measures was not achieved, consistent with the annual incentive calculations in prior years. Each metric based on the Company's financial performance had a possible payout between 0% and 200%, depending on the Company's actual performance relative to the established targets. The individual SBO portion of the annual incentive payment had a possible payout of between 0% and 150%, depending on actual performance relative to the SBOs.
For purposes of the 2018 MIP, actual results included:
In measuring the Company's performance with respect to these financial metrics under the 2018 MIP, the Committee, in its sole discretion, made equitable adjustments in recognition of unusual or non-recurring events. For further discussion of performance factor adjustments, see "Executive Compensation – Annual Incentive Awards – 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan – Performance Factor Adjustments" below. Also see "Executive Compensation – Annual Incentive Awards – Fiscal 2018 MIP Annual Incentive Awards – Calculation of Total Award Earned under 2018 MIP" below for the calculation of each NEO's annual incentive award earned under the 2018 MIP, and see Annex I — Non-GAAP Reconciliations for a reconciliation of these adjusted measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.
Annual Incentive Award Potential for Fiscal 2019
In July 2018, the Committee approved the fiscal 2019 annual incentive award opportunities described below for the Current NEOs under the 2019 MIP, which was adopted by the Committee pursuant to the 2013 Sysco Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan and which contains financial metrics substantively similar to those set forth in the 2018 MIP:
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    51
Limits on Fiscal 2018 Maximum Annual Incentive Award Payments
The Committee established an annual incentive pool limit for fiscal 2018, as set forth in the table below, for each of the CEO, CFO and certain "covered employees" of Sysco (including all of the NEOs) pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), as in effect prior to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"), to help ensure compliance with the deductibility requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code. Under the Tax Act, the exemption for deductibility of performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code has generally been eliminated for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, as a result of which the Committee has discontinued application of the annual incentive pool for fiscal 2019 and future years.
The umbrella structure of the incentive pool limit served only to provide a ceiling on the maximum annual incentive amount that any NEO could have received, and the actual incentive amount paid to each NEO was determined pursuant to the 2018 MIP as described below under "Executive Compensation – Annual Incentive Awards – Fiscal 2018 MIP Annual Incentive Awards."
In addition, under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the maximum dollar amount that may be paid under all cash-based awards granted to any individual for any fiscal year under the Plan is 1% of the Company's earnings before income taxes as publicly disclosed in the "Consolidated Results of Operations" section of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended immediately before the date the applicable award is paid.
Annual Incentive Award – Analysis
Fiscal 2018
The Committee established annual incentive award targets for fiscal 2018 based on the corresponding planned performance for each of those financial measures under Sysco's fiscal 2018 annual operating plan, aligning the annual incentive compensation for the NEO's to the achievement of the financial performance contemplated by the Company's operating plan, as well as by Sysco's initial three-year plan established in fiscal 2016. The financial targets under the initial three-year plan include improving adjusted operating income, and the key strategic levers of this three-year plan included delivering accelerated case growth through a focus on local customers and growing gross profit dollars. Semler Brossy confirmed to the Committee that this approach continued to reflect sound design practices. In light of the foregoing, Sysco's executive management team prepared, and the Committee approved, the various financial performance targets for the fiscal 2018 annual incentive opportunities described above. It was both management's and the Committee's intent to create an annual incentive award that was generally targeted at or above the median annual incentive ranges among companies in the 2018 peer group upon achieving target performance goals, in combination with base salaries targeted below market medians.
The Committee excludes the extraordinary items described below under "Executive Compensation – Annual Incentive Awards – Fiscal 2018 MIP Annual Incentive Awards" because they represent items that generally involve current period costs that management and the Committee believe would not result in benefits until later periods, or vice versa. The Committee believes that the threshold and target levels of performance represented challenging, but reasonably obtainable, Sysco performance, while levels in excess of the target level represented superior and extremely challenging performance.
The Committee also set the target annual incentive award levels for each of the NEOs to ensure that total cash compensation does not significantly exceed the median, unless outstanding performance levels are achieved. The Committee established target annual incentive levels for each of the NEOs for fiscal 2018 that generally provided a target total cash compensation opportunity between the 25th and 50th percentile of the 2018 peer group. At the Committee's request, Semler Brossy validated that the threshold, target and maximum performance expectations and associated payment levels for fiscal 2018, which were targeted at the median annual incentive ranges among companies in the 2018 peer group upon achieving specified performance goals under the fiscal 2018 executive compensation program, would result in payments that are positioned appropriately compared to peers.
Based upon Semler Brossy's May 2017 report for the NEOs other than Mr. Bené, and the July 2017 report with respect to Mr. Bené, target total cash compensation for fiscal 2018 for each of the NEOs (other than Mr. Bertrand) compared as follows with respect to the 2018 peer group: (1) Mr. Grade was positioned below the 25th percentile of the 2018 peer group, (2) Mr. Bené (based on his annualized CEO base salary and target annual incentive award opportunity) approximated the 25th percentile for the CEO position of the 2018 peer group, (3) Mr. Shurts was positioned between the 25th and 50th percentile of the 2018 peer group and (4) Messrs. DeLaney and Libby approximated the median of the 2018 peer group. Semler Brossy did not include Mr. Bertrand in its May 2017 comparative analysis, given that he was not a named executive officer at such time.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    52
The Committee believes that individual goals are extremely important in evaluating the CEO's and other NEOs' respective performance and that they should, therefore, also have an impact on each of their annual incentive opportunities. SBOs provide additional focus on critical strategic objectives that support both financial and non-financial goals. Under the 2018 MIP, the Committee continued the use of individual SBOs in order to align the NEOs' objectives with the key components of Sysco's overall strategy. These individualized SBOs were closely tailored to each NEO's line-of-sight influence. The Committee believes that consideration of individual SBOs further promotes the overall executive compensation pay philosophy by strengthening the link between executive pay and individual performance. Each individual's SBOs for fiscal 2018 were pre-established by the Committee based on the critical components of Sysco's overall strategy as set out by management and the Board. For each SBO, the Committee reviewed and rated each NEO using the following rating and associated payment ranges: significantly below target (0%); below target (50% - 85%); on target (90% - 110%); above target (115% - 125%) and significantly above target (130% - 150%).
Following the Committee's evaluation in July 2018 of each NEO's performance in fiscal 2018 with respect to these individual SBOs, the Committee determined the applicable SBO Performance Factor for each NEO as described in the following table.

[END TABLE]
Fiscal 2019
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Committee established the financial performance targets for fiscal 2019 under the 2019 MIP. For a discussion of each of these financial targets for purposes of calculating each Current NEO's annual incentive opportunity, see " – Annual Incentive Award – Detailed Information – Annual Incentive Award Potential for Fiscal 2019" above. The Committee continues to believe that the threshold and target levels of performance represent challenging, but reasonably obtainable, Sysco performance levels, while levels in excess of the target level represent superior and extremely challenging performance. Semler Brossy reviewed the 2019 MIP relative to Sysco's business strategy and market practices and has indicated that the MIP continues to reflect sound design practices.
Due to changes to Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee did not establish an annual incentive pool limit for fiscal 2019, as it has in previous years for the CEO, CFO and certain "covered employees" of Sysco, as defined in Section 162(m). The pool previously was intended to help ensure compliance with the deductibility requirements of the then-applicable Section 162(m) of the Code. The umbrella structure of the previous incentive pool limit only to impose a ceiling on the annual incentive amount that any NEO could receive, and the actual incentive amount paid to each NEO was always determined pursuant to the applicable MIP, which continues to be true for the 2019 MIP. The maximum annual incentive payout that can be received under the 2019 MIP is described above under "Annual Incentive Award Potential for Fiscal 2019."
Long-term Incentives – Detailed Information
Fiscal 2018
The Committee granted annual long-term incentives in August 2017 for fiscal 2018 (the "Fiscal 2018 LTI Grant"). These long-term incentives were designed to provide our NEOs competitive, longer-term incentive opportunities that are consistent with our peer group and reflect our overall compensation philosophy of aligning pay with performance and the interests of stockholders. The Fiscal 2018 LTI Grant consisted of stock options and PSUs. The targeted aggregate dollar value of the Fiscal 2018 LTI Grant was set by the Committee at 6.5x base salary for Mr. DeLaney, 4.75x base salary for Mr. Bené, 3.5x base salary for Mr. Grade, 3.25x base salary for Mr. Shurts, 3x base salary for Mr. Libby and 2.25x base salary for Mr. Bertrand. The total target value of these long-term incentives for each NEO was allocated among the awards by the Committee as follows: approximately 40% of the target value in stock options and approximately 60% of the target value in PSUs. The options were valued at $7.32 per option using the Black-Scholes pricing model (as of July 14, 2017) and each PSU was valued, using the target number of shares, at $51.35 per share (i.e., the ten trading day average closing price of Sysco common stock immediately preceding the grant date).
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    53
The Committee approved the Fiscal 2018 LTI Grant to each of the NEOs in August 2017 under our stockholder approved 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan requires stock options to be priced at the closing price of our common stock on the business day prior to the grant date, and the stock options are subject to ratable vesting over a three-year period. The maximum term of the stock options under the Fiscal 2018 LTI Grant is ten years. The PSU component of the Fiscal 2018 LTI Grant provides for cliff vesting at the conclusion of the three-year performance period if threshold performance levels are achieved. The Committee grants all stock options and PSUs pursuant to approved equity grant guidelines. These guidelines are more fully described under "Executive Compensation — Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End."
The PSUs issued in connection with the Fiscal 2018 LTI Grant provide the opportunity for participants to receive shares of common stock based on pre-established financial performance targets over a performance period of three fiscal years. The performance criteria for the fiscal 2018 PSUs are based on (i) the Company's earnings per share compound annual growth rate ("EPS CAGR") as compared to projected, target EPS CAGR for the performance period, representing 66.7% of the total incentive opportunity under the PSUs, and (ii) the Company's three-year average adjusted return on invested capital ("ROIC"), as compared to projected, target ROIC for the performance period, representing 33.3% of the total incentive opportunity under the PSUs. Each of EPS CAGR and three-year average ROIC performance measures is assessed independently of the other, such that one portion of the award could be earned even if the threshold level of performance is not achieved for the other measure.
While performance targets for the PSUs are established at commencement for the entire performance period, the Committee retains the authority to adjust the calculation for certain extraordinary items. For fiscal 2018, the Company's ROIC and EPS calculations were negatively adjusted to exclude the impact of Certain Items (defined above under "Business Highlights") and the impact of lower federal income tax rate for the second half of fiscal 2018 resulting from U.S. tax reform. In so doing, the Committee was guided by the principle that management should not be advantaged in evaluation of their performance as a result of the change in the Company's effective tax rate and strategic actions implemented or accelerated due to the revised tax rate.
Each PSU granted to participants represents the right to receive one share of common stock, but the ultimate number of shares of common stock to be earned with respect to a participant's PSUs will be determined at the end of the three-year performance period and could range from 0% to 200% of the target number of PSUs issued to the participant, based on the Company's EPS CAGR and ROIC performance relative to the pre-established targets. If applicable, dividend equivalents accrue during the performance period and are paid either in shares or in cash, in the discretion of the Committee, based on the number of PSUs earned following certification of the Company's performance.
In July 2017, the Committee determined that, in addition to the Fiscal 2018 LTI Grant, Mr. Bené would receive a one-time, promotional long-term incentive award valued at $1.1 million and consisting of restricted stock units that vest in three equal, annual installments. This RSU grant was awarded in February 2018, following Mr. Bené's appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer. This additional award was authorized to account for the fact the earlier Fiscal 2018 LTI Grant to Mr. Bené did not reflect his additional responsibilities upon becoming Chief Executive Officer.
In making this promotional grant, the Committee considered a pro-rata award for the portion of fiscal 2018 during which Mr. Bené would serve as both President and Chief Executive Officer. In selecting RSUs as the form of the promotional award, the Committee reiterated its belief that senior officers beneficially should own shares of common stock of the Company in order to align their individual interests with those of stockholders. As detailed in the Company's share ownership requirements, upon Mr. Bené's promotion to President and Chief Executive Officer, his required level of share ownership rose from a multiple of 4X to a multiple of 7X base salary. The form of award was also selected to further align Mr. Bené's holdings with the heightened ownership requirements within the designated transition period.
For Mr. DeLaney, in recognition of his leadership and for purposes of retention during an orderly transition to Mr. Bené as the new Chief Executive Officer, the Committee in July 2017 approved the terms of his Transition and Retirement Agreement, discussed below under "Executive Compensation – CEO Succession Compensation Arrangements – Transition and Retirement Agreement with Mr. DeLaney."
Fiscal 2019
The Committee granted long-term incentives in August 2018 for fiscal 2019 (the "Fiscal 2019 LTI Grant"). These long-term incentives were designed to provide our Current NEOs with competitive, longer-term incentive opportunities that are consistent with our revised peer group and again reflect our overall compensation philosophy of aligning pay with performance and the interests of stockholders. As in the prior year, the Fiscal 2019 LTI Grant consisted of stock options and PSUs. The targeted aggregate dollar value of the Fiscal 2019 LTI Grant was set by the Committee at 6.25x base salary for Mr. Bené, 3.5x base salary for Mr. Grade, 3.25x base salary for Mr. Shurts and 3x base salary for Messrs. Libby and Bertrand. Mr. DeLaney was not entitled to receive a Fiscal 2019 LTI Grant. The total target value of these long-term incentives for each Current NEO was allocated among the awards by the Committee as follows: approximately 40% of the target value in stock options and approximately 60% of the target value in PSUs. The options were valued at $10.69 per option using the Black-Scholes pricing model (as of July 13, 2018) and each PSU was valued, using the target number of shares, at $73.37 per share (i.e., the ten trading day average closing price of Sysco common stock prior to the grant date).
Long-term Incentives – Analysis
The Committee determined that providing a mix of stock options and PSUs for the Fiscal 2018 LTI Grant was an appropriate continuation of the Company's incentive programs and competitive market practices. PSUs, which are contingent on the successful completion of both performance-based and time-based requirements before any payout occurs, further strengthen the link between individual pay opportunities and Company performance and further enhance the Company's efforts to retain key executives. The performance targets selected by the Committee for the PSUs also incentivize participants to align their efforts with the Company's initial three-year strategic plan. The Committee continued to target long-term incentive opportunities near the median of targeted grant value of long-term incentives awarded by companies in our 2018 peer group.
The Committee believes that the long-term equity mix, including stock options and PSUs, helps to ensure that long-term strategic initiatives are not compromised by having executives focus solely on short-term
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    54
results through the annual incentive award. Such awards also help focus executives on strategies that increase long-term stockholder value. The Committee determined that continuing the same mix of stock options and PSUs, including the structure and relative weighting of the underlying performance metrics, for the Fiscal 2019 LTI Grant was appropriate. Existing executive equity ownership levels are not generally a factor in the Committee's granting of stock options and PSUs.
Retirement/Career Benefits
Retirement Plans – Current Programs – Management Savings Plan
Since January 1, 2013, Sysco has offered a non-qualified, defined contribution savings plan, the Management Savings Plan (the "MSP"), to certain senior leaders, including the NEOs. The MSP allows individual deferrals and employer contributions in excess of IRS 401(k) contribution and compensation limits. Currently, individual contributions to the 401(k) plan are limited by law to $18,500 per year, plus an additional $6,000 in "catch-up" contributions if the participant is at least 50 years of age. The MSP allows eligible participants to defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 90% of their eligible bonus.
In addition, in conjunction with the freeze of accruals in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP") in 2013, certain participants (who would otherwise have incurred a sizable loss of future benefits under the SERP) are eligible for transition contributions. The participants in the MSP direct the investment for both their individual contributions and the Company contributions. The MSP is described in further detail below under "Executive Compensation — Fiscal 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation – About the MSP."
MSP Analysis
The Committee believes that the MSP incentivizes and assists in the retention of key employees by providing them with a supplemental retirement savings vehicle. The MSP is an important, and cost effective, recruitment and retention tool for Sysco, as the companies with which we compete for executive talent typically provide a similar plan to their senior employees.
Retirement Plans – Transition from Legacy Programs
Since 2013, Sysco has moved from a defined benefit towards a defined contribution strategy for future retirement benefit accruals. A defined contribution-based program further aligns Sysco with our peer group, increases flexibility, simplifies the benefit structure, retains key talent and both reduces and stabilizes costs. Since that time, wealth accumulation opportunities for NEOs at Sysco have been further focused on variable annual and long-term incentive plans.
The retirement program changes, however, were expected to result in significant reductions in anticipated benefits for existing participants in the pension plan, the SERP and the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, or "EDCP." In order to help ensure retention of key leaders during the transition from the defined benefit towards a defined contribution strategy, Sysco amended the 401(k) and MSP to partially mitigate the reductions in pension plan benefits by providing that, for a period of ten plan years commencing January 1, 2013, or until an eligible participant ceases employment with Sysco, whichever is earlier, Sysco will credit an automatic employer contribution of three percent (3%) of the participant's gross base salary and bonus into the participant's 401(k) account to the extent permitted under applicable IRS limitations, with the remainder credited to the MSP account of eligible participants (the "Pension Transition Contribution"). Mr. DeLaney is the only NEO eligible to receive the Pension Transition Contribution.
With respect to reductions in the expected value of benefits under the SERP and the EDCP, the cessation of future benefit accruals affected each individual in a different manner. To address concerns over retention, the Committee developed a transition program intended to help ensure that no impacted participant experiences an aggregate reduction of more than 15% - 20% (depending on an individual's prior years of service) in his or her expected retirement benefits under the Company's non-qualified plans as a result of the retirement strategy changes. While Messrs. Bené, Grade and Shurts were not eligible for the SERP or the EDCP, Mr. DeLaney (31%), and Mr. Bertrand (35%) and Mr. Libby (49%) each had a projected reduction in their respective non-qualified benefits in excess of the targeted range.
To mitigate the loss in projected non-qualified retirement benefits, impacted individuals were eligible for transitional compensation opportunities, including supplemental contributions to the MSP, for a period of ten plan years commencing January 1, 2013, or until an eligible employee ceases employment with Sysco, whichever is earlier. Of the NEOs, Messrs. Bertrand and Libby were eligible for a supplemental MSP contribution, made in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Legacy Program – Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
We historically provided annual retirement benefits to all corporate employees and most of our non-union operating company employees under the tax-qualified Sysco Corporation Retirement Plan, a defined benefit program that we refer to as the "pension plan." Since January 1, 2013, most employees no longer accrue additional retirement benefits under the pension plan. However, when the pension plan was the primary retirement vehicle, the Company also maintained a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, or SERP, in order to retain and drive continued performance from certain employees. The Committee utilized the SERP to increase the retirement benefits available to officers whose benefits under the pension plan were limited by law. Of the Current NEOs, Messrs. Bertrand and Libby participate in the SERP.
The SERP was frozen and future accruals under the SERP ceased, effective June 29, 2013. Those SERP participants who retire and are not eligible for immediate commencement of their SERP benefit are
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    55
deemed 100% vested, with benefits payable upon reaching age 65. The earliest an executive can retire and receive any benefits under the SERP is age 55 with a minimum of 15 years of MIP service or age 60 with at least 10 years of MIP service and 20 years of Sysco service. Payments before the age of 65 are adjusted by an early retirement reduction factor. A participating NEO will receive a SERP benefit based on the greater of the accrued benefit determined as of June 29, 2013, the date of the SERP accrual freeze, under the current provisions of the SERP, or the accrued benefit determined as of June 28, 2008 under the prior provisions of the SERP, but with eligibility for immediate benefit payments and related early retirement reduction factors determined as of the relevant separation from service date. The terms of the SERP are more specifically described under "Executive Compensation — Pension Benefits — Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan." The amounts accrued by each participating NEO under the pension plan and the SERP as of July 1, 2018 are set forth under "Executive Compensation — Pension Benefits." Mr. DeLaney will be entitled to receive benefits under the SERP upon his retirement scheduled for the end of calendar 2018, as discussed in further detail below under "Executive Compensation – Pension Benefits."
SERP Analysis
The Committee previously amended the SERP to freeze benefits, stop future accruals and to provide for immediate vesting of accrued benefits in order to achieve the following goals:
Legacy Program – Executive Deferred Compensation Plan
Prior to December 31, 2012, Sysco offered an Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, or EDCP, to provide MIP participants, including Messrs. DeLaney, Libby and Bertrand, the opportunity to save for retirement and accumulate wealth in a tax-efficient manner beyond savings opportunities under Sysco's 401(k) retirement savings plan. Participants were able to defer up to 100% of their base salary and up to 40% of their MIP bonus, or any bonus paid in lieu of or as a replacement for the MIP bonus, to the EDCP. Sysco did not match any base salary deferrals into the EDCP in fiscal 2018, as deferrals are no longer permitted. An executive is always 100% vested in his or her past deferrals and Sysco matches, but any portion of an executive's account attributable to Sysco matches, including associated deemed investment return, and the net investment gain, if any, credited on his or her deferrals, is subject to forfeiture for specified cause or competing against Sysco in certain instances. Participants who have deferred compensation under the EDCP may choose from a variety of investment options. The EDCP is described in further detail under "Executive Compensation — Fiscal 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation – About the EDCP."
EDCP Analysis
For many years, the EDCP served as a recruitment and retention tool for Sysco. In connection with the broader transition in retirement philosophy, beginning in fiscal 2013, a new deferred compensation plan, the MSP, has been utilized to fulfill this objective.
Executive Perquisites & Other Benefits – Detailed Information
We provide benefits for executives that we believe are reasonable, particularly since the cost of these benefits constitutes a very small percentage of each NEO's total compensation. Certain of these benefits are described below.
Sysco's NEOs are generally eligible to participate in Sysco's regular employee benefit programs, which include a 401(k) plan, an employee stock purchase plan, group life insurance and other group welfare benefit plans, and until the changes were made to retirement benefits in fiscal 2013, the defined benefit pension plan. We also provide MIP participants, including the NEOs, with additional life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefits, long-term disability coverage, including disability income coverage, and long-term care insurance, as well as reimbursement for an annual comprehensive wellness examination by a physician of their choice. We believe many of these benefits are required to remain competitive with our competitors for executive talent. Although the executive officers are eligible to participate in Sysco's group medical and dental coverage, we adjust employees' contributions towards the monthly cost of the medical plan according to salary level; therefore, executives pay a higher employee contribution to participate in these welfare plans than do non-executives.
Furthermore, Sysco owns fractional interests in private aircraft that are made available to members of the Board of Directors, executives and other members of management for business use, but these aircraft are not allowed to be used for personal matters.
All employees, including our NEOs, as well as members of our Board, are also entitled to receive discounts on all products carried by Sysco and its subsidiaries.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    56
Executive Compensation Governance and Other Information
Severance and Employment Agreements
None of Sysco's current executive officers, other than Mr. DeLaney, is party to any severance or employment agreements providing for guaranteed severance or other compensation upon termination. See "Executive Compensation – CEO Succession Compensation Arrangements" below for a discussion of the terms of the Transition and Retirement Agreement with Mr. DeLaney. Consistent with our approach of rewarding performance, employment is not guaranteed, and either the Company or the NEO may terminate the employment relationship at any time. In some cases, the Committee or the Board may agree to provide separation payments to departing executives upon their termination to obtain an additional non-compete, non-solicitation and non-disclosure agreement and a release of claims.
Relocation Expenses
To address the Committee's desire for Sysco to comply with best corporate governance and compensation practices, in October 2010, the Committee adopted an executive relocation expense reimbursement policy that applies to all of the NEOs. The reimbursement policy provides that Sysco will not reimburse any of such executives for any loss on the sale of the executive's house sold in connection with the executive's relocation. The reimbursement policy also provides that only certain pre-approved relocation expenses will be eligible for increased payments to cover all applicable taxes on the reimbursed amounts, such as state and federal income taxes, FICA, and Medicare taxes. In addition, the reimbursement policy provides that relocation agreements with any named executive officer include a recoupment provision that requires the executive to reimburse Sysco for all or a part of the reimbursement if his employment is terminated for any reason other than death, disability or change of control of Sysco, or termination without cause or for good reason, within a specified amount of time after receiving the reimbursement.
Benefits Following Change in Control
We currently have no separate severance or similar agreements that would cause an immediate or "single trigger" cash payment obligation solely as a result of a change in control of Sysco. We have included change of control provisions in several of Sysco's benefit plans and agreements, including a prorated pay out of an MIP annual incentive payment through the date of change of control, and 100% vesting of options, PSUs (assuming target achievement) and RSUs upon a change in control. See "Executive Compensation —Quantification of Termination/Change in Control Payments" for a detailed explanation of potential benefits under the various provisions.
For equity-based awards issued from and after November 2013, the Board has established "double-trigger" accelerated vesting under certain change of control scenarios. Under this "double trigger," the vesting of these equity-based awards is only accelerated upon a change in control if, during the period commencing 12 months prior to the change in control and ending 24 months after such change in control, the participant's employment is terminated without "cause" (as defined in the applicable award agreement) or the participant terminates his or her employment for "good reason" (as defined in the applicable award agreement).
The Committee continues to believe that these provisions will preserve executive morale and productivity and encourage retention in the face of the disruptive impact of an actual or rumored change in control of Sysco. The Committee has balanced the impact of these acceleration provisions with corresponding provisions in the MSP, the SERP and/or the EDCP that provide for a reduction in benefits to the extent they are not deductible under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.
Executive Compensation Clawback and Protective Covenants
In the event of a restatement of our financial results, other than a restatement due to a change in accounting policy, it is the Committee's policy that it will review all incentive payments made to MIP participants, including the NEOs, within the 36-month period prior to the restatement on the basis of having met or exceeded specific performance targets. If such incentive payments would have been lower had they been calculated based on the restated results, the Committee will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, seek to recoup any such excess payments for the benefit of Sysco. The MIP annual incentive awards and CPU and PSU grants made by the Committee since fiscal 2011 contain a contractual provision binding the grantee to this recovery right, and the Committee anticipates that future grants will contain similar provisions. The Committee has the sole discretion, subject to applicable law, to determine the form and timing of the clawback, which may include repayment from the MIP participant or an adjustment to the payment of a future incentive. In addition, the executives' benefits under the SERP, EDCP and MSP may be subject to forfeiture or adjustment as a result of any such restatement of financial results. These remedies would be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any actions imposed by law enforcement agencies, regulators or other authorities.
In addition, pursuant to the award agreements governing certain equity-based awards, in order to be eligible to receive an equity-based award, each participant is required to have entered into an agreement (the "Protective Covenants Agreement") protecting the Company's interests and confidential information by restricting certain recipient behavior during, and following termination of, employment. The Protective Covenants Agreement includes, among other things, restrictions on unfair post-employment competitive activities, improper solicitation of Company employees and customers, and the misuse of confidential information. In the event that a participant violates any of the restrictive covenants in the Protective Covenants Agreement, the participant forfeits the benefits
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    57
and proceeds of the related equity awards. The forfeiture of benefits and proceeds has been required with regard to all awards of PSUs and RSUs since November 2013 and awards of stock options since August 2016. In addition to the Protective Covenants Agreements, the terms of the MSP, SERP and EDCP also provide for the forfeiture of certain payments in the event of prohibited conduct following termination of employment with the Company.
Tax Impact on Compensation
Income Deduction Limitations
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally sets a limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation that Sysco may deduct for federal income tax purposes in any given year with respect to the compensation of each of the NEOs. Historically, compensation that qualified as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code could be excluded from this $1 million limit. This exception was repealed with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "TCJA"), effective for taxable years beginning after 2017, unless certain transition relief is available. The Committee's general intent prior to implementation of the TCJA was to structure our executive compensation programs so that payments could qualify as "performance-based compensation." However, the Committee may have decided from time to time to grant compensation that would not (or could not) be able to qualify as "performance-based compensation" if appropriate to achieve the objectives of the compensation program.
With the repeal of the "performance-based compensation" provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code, compensation granted by the Committee may, more frequently, be non-deductible. The Committee believes that the tax deduction limitation should not be permitted to compromise its ability to design and maintain executive compensation arrangements that will attract and retain the executive talent to compete successfully. Accordingly, achieving the desired flexibility in the design and delivery of compensation may result in compensation that, in certain cases, is not deductible for federal income tax purposes, and it is possible that awards intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under the transition relief may not so qualify. Moreover, even if the Committee had intended to grant compensation that qualified as "qualified performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company cannot guarantee that such compensation ultimately will be deductible.
Based on the factors discussed under "What We Paid and Why" above, in fiscal 2018 Sysco paid, and in fiscal 2019 the Committee expects Sysco to pay, certain NEOs a base salary and annual incentive award that, when aggregated with anticipated vesting of RSUs and PSUs, exceeds $1 million in value. The Committee believes that this compensation is necessary in order to maintain the competitiveness of the total compensation package and, as a result, has determined that it is appropriate, even though certain amounts of fiscal 2018 compensation will not be deductible, and the excess of anticipated salary and annual incentive payouts, plus the value of RSUs and PSUs vesting in fiscal 2019 over $1 million, respectively, will not be deductible for federal income tax purposes.
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code deals specifically with non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Although the Company makes no guarantees with respect to exemption from, or compliance with, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, we have designed all of our executive benefit plans with the intention that they are exempt from, or otherwise comply with, the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The following discussion, as well as the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained herein, contains references to target performance levels for our incentive compensation. These targets and goals are discussed in the limited context of Sysco's compensation programs and should not be interpreted as management's expectations or estimates of results or other guidance. We specifically caution stockholders not to apply these statements to other contexts.
Summary Compensation Table
The following table sets forth information with respect to each of the NEOs – each person who served as our Chief Executive Officer during fiscal 2018, our Chief Financial Officer and the three most highly compensated of the other executive officers of Sysco and its subsidiaries employed at the end of fiscal 2018. In determining the most highly compensated executive officers, we excluded the amounts shown under "Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings."
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    59
Active service-based accruals under the pension plan and the SERP ceased when each of those programs was frozen. Therefore, any subsequent changes in the actuarial present value of an NEO's accumulated benefit under the pension plan and/or the SERP would likely be attributable, primarily, to variations in the discount rate or modifications to the actuarial assumptions. To the extent that any such aggregate change in the actuarial present value of an NEO's accumulated benefit under the pension plan and/or the SERP was a decrease, this decrease is not reflected in the amounts shown in the "All Other Compensation" column above or the "Total" column in the table below.
The following table shows, for each NEO, the change in the actuarial present value for each of the pension plan and the SERP, as well as the above-market interest on amounts in the EDCP and MSP for fiscal 2018:
No NEO received any single perquisite or personal benefit with respect to fiscal 2018 with a value greater than $25,000, and no NEO received any other item of compensation with respect to fiscal 2018 required to be disclosed in this column with a value of $10,000 or more.

Annual Incentive Awards
2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan
Pursuant to the Sysco Corporation 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee is authorized to provide key executives, including the NEOs, with equity and cash awards, including the opportunity to earn incentive cash payments through the grant of annual, performance-based incentive awards. The Committee generally grants annual incentive awards in the first quarter of the fiscal year to which the awards relate, and we have historically paid amounts owed under such awards during the first fiscal quarter following the conclusion of the fiscal year corresponding to such awards.
Performance Factors. In connection with granting annual incentive awards, the Committee may determine the performance factors that must be met for the NEO to receive payment with respect to the award, as well as the relative weights of those performance factors. The performance factors established by the Committee may relate to, among other things, the Company's achievement of certain financial, operational or transactional objectives, as well as the individual performance of the NEO.
Performance Factor Adjustments. The 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan allows the Committee, in its sole discretion, after an award has been granted, to make equitable adjustments to the performance factors in recognition of unusual or non-recurring events affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company, in response to changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes in generally accepted accounting principles or practices, or to account for items of gain, loss or expense determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal of a segment of a business. Application of any such equitable adjustments to any performance factors with respect to "covered employees" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, which includes each of the NEOs, is limited to circumstances where the modification of performance factors will not impact the deductibility of the annual incentive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Award Limits. Pursuant to the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, no NEO could have received an aggregate annual incentive award under the 2018 MIP (defined below) in excess of 1% of the Company's earnings before income taxes for fiscal 2018.
Fiscal 2018 MIP Annual Incentive Awards
In August 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the incentive award structure for fiscal 2018 pursuant to the Sysco Corporation Fiscal 2018 Management Incentive Program for MIP Bonus-Eligible Participants (the "2018 MIP"). Under the 2018 MIP, the annual incentive award opportunity for each of the NEO's, other than Mr. Bertrand, was based on the following pre-determined metrics, weighted as indicated below:
The annual incentive award opportunity for Mr. Bertrand, as a foodservice operations leader, was based on the following pre-determined metrics, weighted as indicated below:
Cases are the foodservice industry-defined measure of a unit that is sold to a customer, and "case growth" represents the percentage increase period-over-period in this volume measure.
Fiscal 2018 Financial Performance Targets. For the NEOs other than Mr. Bertrand, the 2018 MIP provided for minimum annual incentive payments upon achieving (i) adjusted operating income of at least $2.46 billion and/or (ii) adjusted gross profit dollar growth of at least 2%. The USCABL total case growth metric functions as a modifier to the annual incentive opportunity with respect to the adjusted gross profit dollar growth component, resulting in higher payment levels when USCABL total case growth is equal to or exceeds 1.0%. The various levels of financial performance required to reach threshold, target and maximum payments are set forth below:
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    62
For Mr. Bertrand, the 2018 MIP provided for minimum annual incentive payments upon one or more of the following: (i) the Company achieving adjusted operating income of at least $2.46 billion; (ii) the U.S. Foodservice Operations segment achieving adjusted operating income growth of at least $2.89 billion; or (iii) the U.S. Foodservice Operations segment achieving adjusted gross profit dollar growth of at least 2.0%. The USBL total case growth metric functions as a modifier to the annual incentive opportunity with respect to the U.S. Foodservice Operations adjusted gross profit dollar growth component, resulting in higher payment levels when USBL total case growth is equal to or exceeds 1.5%. The various levels of financial performance required for Mr. Bertrand to reach threshold, target and maximum payments are set forth below:
Fiscal 2018 Financial Results and Performance Factors. For purposes of the 2018 MIP, actual results included (i) adjusted operating income for the Company of $2.54 billion (exceeding threshold performance level); (ii) adjusted gross profit dollar growth for the Company of 3.9% (exceeding threshold performance level), as modified by USCABL total case growth of 2.6% (exceeding the target performance level); (iii) U.S. Foodservice Operations adjusted operating income of $3.04 billion (exceeding threshold performance level); (iv) U.S. Foodservice Operations adjusted gross profit dollar growth of 4.5% (approximating the target performance level), as modified by USBL total case growth of 3.6% (exceeding the target performance level). See Annex I — Non-GAAP Reconciliations for a reconciliation of these adjusted measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Based on these results, we calculated weighted performance factors for each of the financial performance metrics under the 2018 MIP, as illustrated in the table below:
Calculation of Total Award Earned under 2018 MIP. The total annual incentive award payment for each NEO under the 2018 MIP was calculated as indicated in the table below, with 75% of the target incentive opportunity based on the applicable financial performance metrics and the remaining 25% of the target incentive opportunity based on individual performance with regard to pre-established individual SBOs, which the Committee had the discretion to pay out between 0% - 150% based on its assessment of the NEO's performance, except with regard to Mr. DeLaney's SBOs, which were deemed to have been achieved at the "target" level pursuant to his Transition and Retirement Agreement. The Committee believes the use of individual SBOs further promotes the overall executive compensation pay philosophy to link individual pay to performance. For further discussion of the Committee's evaluation with respect to the individual SBOs of each NEO, other than Mr. DeLaney, as well as the calculation of each such NEO's "Weighted Individual SBO Performance Factor" for purposes of the table below, please see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—What We Paid and Why—Compensation for NEOs—Annual Incentive Award—Analysis" above.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    63
Executive Compensation Clawback Policy. The fiscal 2018 awards are also subject to clawback provisions that provide that, subject to applicable law, all or a portion of the award paid pursuant to the 2018 MIP may be recovered by Sysco if there is a restatement of our financial results, other than a restatement due to a change in accounting policy, within 36 months of the payment of the award and the restatement would result in the payment of a reduced award if the award was recalculated using the restated financial results. The Committee has the sole discretion to determine the form and timing of the repayment. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Executive Compensation Governance and Other Information—Executive Compensation Clawback Policy and Protective Covenants."
Fiscal 2019 Annual Incentive Awards
In July 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the fiscal 2019 annual incentive award opportunities for the eligible NEOs under the Sysco Corporation Fiscal 2019 Management Incentive Program For Corporate MIP Bonus-Eligible Participants, which was adopted by the Committee pursuant to the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan and which is described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—What We Paid and Why—Compensation for NEOs—Annual Incentive Award—Detailed Information— Annual Incentive Award Potential for Fiscal 2019."
Limits on Fiscal 2018 Maximum Annual Incentive Award Payments
The Committee established an annual incentive pool limit for fiscal 2018, as set forth in the table below, for each of the CEO, CFO and certain "covered employees" of Sysco (including all of the NEOs) pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), as in effect prior to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"), to help ensure compliance with the deductibility requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code. Under the Tax Act, the exemption for deductibility of performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code has generally been eliminated for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, as a result of which the Committee has discontinued application of the annual incentive pool for fiscal 2019 and future years.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    64
The umbrella structure of the incentive pool limit served only to provide a ceiling on the maximum annual incentive amount that any NEO could have received, and the actual incentive amount paid to each NEO was determined pursuant to the 2018 MIP as described above.
In addition, under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the maximum dollar amount that may be paid under all cash-based awards granted to any individual for any fiscal year under the Plan is 1% of the Company's earnings before income taxes as publicly disclosed in the "Consolidated Results of Operations" section of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended immediately before the date the applicable award is paid.
Long-Term Incentive Awards
The Company's fiscal year 2018 long-term incentives awarded to certain key employees, including the NEOs, consisted of awards of performance share units ("PSUs") under the Performance Share Unit Agreement For Performance Period FY2018 – FY2020 (the "PSU Agreement") and stock options, which PSUs and stock options were issued pursuant to the Sysco 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The PSU Agreement provides the opportunity for participants to receive shares of Sysco common stock based on pre-established financial performance targets over a performance period of three fiscal years. The PSUs with a performance period beginning in fiscal year 2018 represent 60% of the target long-term incentive opportunity, with stock options representing the remaining 40% of the target long-term incentive opportunity. Stock options granted in fiscal year 2018 vest in 3 equal, annual installments.
Additionally, in recognition of his additional responsibilities following his promotion to President and CEO and in connection with increasing Mr. Bené's stake in the success of the Company, enhancing the alignment of his interests with those of shareholders and aligning his stock holdings with the heightened CEO ownership requirements, Mr. Bené received on February 22, 2018, a one-time, promotional long-term incentive award valued at $1.1 million, which consisted of time-based restricted stock units, which we refer to as "RSUs." For discussion of the compensation adjustments for Mr. Bené in connection with the transition and appointment to CEO, see "Executive Compensation – CEO Succession Compensation Arrangements – Compensation Adjustments for Mr. Bené."
Prior to fiscal year 2017, the Committee had issued cash performance units, which we refer to as "CPUs," to provide certain key employees, including the NEOs, the opportunity to earn cash incentive payments based on pre-established performance criteria over performance periods of at least three years, as well as to provide certain key employees, including the NEOs, the opportunity to earn shares of our common stock over a three-year performance period.
Under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Committee may select performance goals from those specified in the plan and other documents governing the award, based on the performance of Sysco generally or on the performance of subsidiaries or divisions. The Committee establishes the performance goals for each award during the first ninety days of the applicable performance period.
Fiscal 2018 PSU Awards
In August 2017, the Committee approved awards of a long-term incentive, PSUs, to eligible NEOs pursuant to the PSU Agreement, adopted in August 2016 under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Committee has established performance criteria for the PSU Agreement based on (i) the compound annual growth rate in the Company's earnings per share, adjusted for Certain Items ("Adjusted EPS CAGR") as compared to projected, target Adjusted EPS CAGR for the performance period, representing two-thirds (2/3rds) of the total incentive opportunity; and (ii) the Company's three-year average adjusted return on invested capital ("Adjusted ROIC"), as compared to projected, target Adjusted ROIC for the performance period, representing one-third (1/3rd) of the total incentive opportunity. The various levels of financial performance required to reach threshold, target and maximum payments with respect to these criteria are set forth below:
Adjusted EPS CAGR:
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    65
Each PSU granted to participants under the PSU Agreement represents the right to receive one share of common stock, at target levels, but the ultimate number of shares of common stock to be earned with respect to a participant's PSUs will be determined at the end of the three-year performance period and could range from 0% to 200% of the target number of PSUs offered to the participant, based on the Company's Adjusted EPS CAGR and Adjusted ROIC performance relative to the pre-established targets. Dividend equivalents accrue during the performance period and are paid either in shares or in cash, in the discretion of the Committee, based on the number of PSUs earned following certification of the Company's performance.
Benefits upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control – PSUs
Disability. If the executive's employment terminates during a performance period due to disability, the executive will nonetheless receive the specified shares of common stock on the applicable payment date, as if he or she remained employed on that date, which number of shares of common stock will be determined using Sysco's performance for the entire three-year performance period.
Retirement. If the executive's employment terminates during a performance period because the executive experiences a retirement in good standing, and provided that the executive's retirement in good standing occurs on or after a complete fiscal year of the Company following the commencement of the performance period, the executive will be entitled to retain a prorated number of PSUs based on the number of whole fiscal months of employment during the applicable performance period through the retirement date. Payment of shares of common stock with respect to such retained PSUs will be made, to the extent earned, on the applicable payment date as if the executive had remained employed through the end of the performance period.
Death. If the executive's employment terminates during a performance period due to the executive's death, the executive's estate will be paid a cash amount equal to the value of the PSUs, assuming Company financial performance at the target level under the applicable performance criteria and based on the closing price of Sysco common stock on the date of the executive's death.
Change in Control. If a change in control occurs during a performance period and the executive's employment is terminated involuntarily, other than for Cause, during the period commencing 12 months prior to the change in control and ending 24 months after the change in control, the executive's PSUs will be considered vested and the executive will receive the target number of shares of common stock payable with respect to the executive's PSUs for that performance period, as if the target performance levels had been achieved. Absent an involuntary termination without Cause within the period specified in the foregoing sentence, the occurrence of a change in control will not affect the vesting of his or her PSUs.
Other Terminations. If the executive's employment terminates before the end of the performance period for any reason other than those specified above, we will cancel the executive's PSUs, and the executive will not receive any payments with respect to such cancelled awards.
Payment under Fiscal 2016 CPU Awards
In November 2015, the Committee approved the final awards of CPUs to eligible NEOs under Sysco's Fiscal Year 2016 Cash Performance Unit Program, which was adopted by the Committee in August 2015 pursuant to the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Each CPU was assigned a value of $1, and all payments due with respect to these CPUs were made to our participating NEOs in cash in August 2018. The principal financial performance metric for the fiscal 2016 CPU awards was the Company's average adjusted 3-year return on invested capital ("Adjusted ROIC"), as compared to the target Adjusted ROIC established by the Committee on an annual basis, subject to modification based on the Company's relative total shareholder return ("TSR") for the performance period. Target Adjusted ROIC for each of the fiscal years during the performance period was established by the Committee within the first 90 days of each respective fiscal year, and calculations were adjusted for certain extraordinary or non-recurring items. The Company's ROIC performance for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 was adjusted to exclude the impact of Certain Items and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, and the Company's ROIC performance for fiscal 2017 was also adjusted to exclude the impact of debt incurred in fiscal 2017 in connection with the acquisition of the Brakes Group. The Company's ROIC performance for fiscal 2018 was adjusted to exclude the impact of Certain Items and the impact of the lower federal income tax rate for the second half of fiscal 2018 resulting from U.S. tax reform. See Annex I — Non-GAAP Reconciliations for a reconciliation of adjusted ROIC to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
Average Capital Efficiency Performance Factor. For each year during the performance period, the Company's Adjusted ROIC performance was measured against the target Adjusted ROIC, yielding an annual capital efficiency performance factor. For each year in the performance period, the annual capital efficiency performance factor was calculated based on the following:
The sum of the annual capital efficiency performance factors above for each fiscal year in the performance period was then divided by the total number of fiscal years in the performance period, yielding an average capital efficiency performance factor of 120%.
Relative Total Shareholder Return Modifier. The payout under the fiscal 2016 CPU awards was further modified by the Company's relative TSR during the 3-year performance period. In order to compute TSR, the following sum was first calculated:
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    66
TSR was then computed as that sum divided by the closing price of a share of Sysco's common stock, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, on the day immediately preceding the first day of the three-year performance period. Based on the Company's TSR for the performance period, which was in the 89th percentile relative to the S&P 500, the TSR modifier was determined to be 120%.
Calculation of CPU Payout. The cash payout under the fiscal 2016 CPU awards was calculated, as indicated in the table below, by multiplying the number of CPUs held by the NEO by the product of (1) 120% (the average capital efficiency performance factor) and (2) 120% (the relative TSR modifier):
CEO Succession Compensation Arrangements
Transition and Retirement Agreement with Mr. DeLaney
On July 17, 2017, in connection with effecting a smooth and orderly CEO succession, as Mr. DeLaney transitioned out of his roles as CEO and a member of the Board, the Compensation Committee approved, and the Company entered into, a Transition and Retirement Agreement with Mr. DeLaney (the "Agreement"), which provided for, among other things, the following terms and conditions:
The Agreement also provides for the benefits provided to Mr. DeLaney in the event that his employment with the Company is terminated prior to the Separation Date due to death or for "Cause" (as defined in the Agreement). The treatment of Mr. DeLaney's outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, performance share units and cash performance units following his retirement will be determined by the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable award agreements.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    67
Compensation Adjustments for Mr. Bené
In recognition of Mr. Bené's additional responsibilities in connection with his transition to President and Chief Executive Officer, the Committee approved the following compensation adjustments for Mr. Bené:
Effective January 1, 2018, in recognition of Mr. Bené's additional responsibilities in connection with his promotion to President and Chief Executive Officer, the Committee also approved the following further compensation adjustments:
Outstanding Equity Awards at Year-End
Option grants to the NEOs prior to fiscal 2017 under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan and its predecessor, the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the "plans," have generally vested and become exercisable in five equal annual installments, beginning one year after the grant date, and the option grants to NEOs since fiscal 2017 vest and become exercisable in three equal, annual installments, beginning one year after the grant date, in each case to create a long-term incentive for the executives. The RSUs that have been granted pursuant to the plans generally vest one-third per year over three years, and the PSUs issued beginning in fiscal 2017 under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan are subject to cliff vesting following a three-year performance period. The 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan allows the Committee the discretion to grant stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, PSUs, as well as other stock-based awards.
According to the terms of our stock plans, the exercise price of options may not be less than the Fair Market Value on the date of the grant, (a) which is defined in our 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan as the closing sale price during regular trading hours of the stock on the immediately preceding date on the principal securities market in which shares of our common stock are then traded, or, if there were no trades on that date, the closing sale price during regular trading hours of the stock on the first trading day prior to that date, and (b) which is defined in our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan as the closing price of our stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the last business day before the grant date. Our stock plans specifically prohibit repricing of outstanding grants without stockholder approval. The Committee grants all of our stock options and restricted stock units pursuant to our equity grant guidelines.
Pursuant to our equity grant guidelines, the Committee generally makes equity grants during open "trading" windows under our Policy on Trading in Company Securities. The guidelines provide that the Committee should generally make equity grants at a point in time when we have publicly disseminated all material information likely to affect the trading price of Sysco's common stock. Under the guidelines, the Committee will generally not make grants during a period preceding an anticipated event that is likely to cause a substantial increase or a substantial decrease in the trading price of Sysco's common stock, such as an earnings release. If we have grants scheduled to occur when Sysco is in possession of material non-public information, then:

SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    69
Awards pursuant to the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 2007 Stock Incentive Plan
All of the option awards listed above provide that, if the executive's employment terminates as a result of retirement in good standing or disability, the option will remain in effect, vest and be exercisable in accordance with its terms as if the executive remained an employee of Sysco. All unvested options will vest immediately upon the executive's death. Furthermore, the options provide that the executive's estate or designees may exercise the options at any time within three years after his death, but in no event later than the original termination date.
All of the options listed above granted prior to November 2013 provide for the vesting of unvested options upon a change in control. In addition, grants made prior to November 2013 provide that, if the named executive's employment is terminated other than for cause during the 24 month period following a change in control, the outstanding options under the plans will be exercisable to the extent the options were exercisable as of the date of termination for 24 months after employment termination or until the expiration of the stated term of the option, whichever period is shorter.
The options granted since November 2013 provide that, if the Company terminates the executive's employment within 12 months before, or 24 months following, a change in control of the Company, then the option will remain in effect, vest and be exercisable in accordance with its terms as if the executive had remained an employee of Sysco.

Fiscal 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
The following table provides information regarding executive contributions and related company matches, earnings and account balances under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ("EDCP") and the Management Savings Plan ("MSP") for each of the NEOs during fiscal 2018. None of the NEOs made any withdrawals or received any distributions under these plans with respect to fiscal 2018.
About the MSP
In order to provide certain highly compensated employees of the Company with the continued opportunity to build retirement savings on a tax-deferred basis through deferrals and Company contributions, Sysco adopted the MSP, effective November 14, 2012. The MSP is a competitive plan for nonqualified executive retirement benefits and is designed to supplement our 401(k) plan. It allows participants, including the current NEOs, to defer a portion of their salary compensation and up to 90% of their annual incentive award. The MSP also provides for Company contributions to participants' accounts, including non-elective and matching contributions, as well as transition contributions, which are designed to compensate participants for a portion of the value lost as a result of the freezing of Sysco's then-current plans. The MSP allows for deferrals and contributions that would not be permitted under the Company's 401(k) plan due to IRS limits. The following discussion summarizes the material terms of the MSP that are applicable to the NEOs. The definition of "bonus" for purposes of the MSP includes any amounts that are paid as a bonus or annual incentive award to a participant, whether under a long-term incentive plan or otherwise.
Executive Deferrals. Participants may initially elect to defer up to fifty percent (50%) of their annual salary and up to 90% of their annual incentive award under the MSP. A deferral election, once made, is irrevocable for the applicable calendar year (for salary deferrals) or fiscal year (for bonus deferrals). Bonus deferral elections are contingent upon the participant's award qualifying as "performance-based compensation" under Section 409A of the Code.
The Committee retains the discretion to alter the minimum and maximum percentages of awards that may be deferred, but such discretion must be exercised prior to the beginning of the applicable fiscal year for which such award may be earned. Salary deferrals were effective beginning in calendar year 2013, with performance-based annual incentive award deferrals effective beginning in fiscal 2014.
Company Contributions. Sysco will make a matching contribution (determined based on compensation not taken into account under the Company's 401(k) plan), to the account of participants who elect to defer a portion of their compensation under the MSP (the "Company Match"). The Company Match is made on a calendar year basis. The Company Match for the first half of fiscal 2018 was subject to a limit of fifty percent (50%) of the first five percent (5%) of a participant's annual base salary and annual incentive award deferred by the participant. The Company Match was increased to a limit of fifty percent (50%) of the first six percent (6%) for the second half of fiscal 2018.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    71
In addition to the Company Match described above, Sysco will credit an automatic Company contribution equal to three percent (3%) of the participant's annual base salary and bonus, less the amount of a similar Company contribution into the participant's 401(k) account, to the participant's account in the MSP (the "Non-elective Contribution"). The Company will credit this contribution regardless of whether the participant defers any amounts under the MSP or 401(k).
In addition to the contributions described above, for a period of ten years through 2023, or until a participant ceases employment with Sysco, whichever is earlier, Sysco will credit an automatic Company contribution of three percent (3%) of the participant's annual base salary and bonus, less the amount of a similar Company contribution into the participant's 401(k) account, to the MSP account of eligible participants (the "Pension Transition Contribution"). To be eligible to receive the Pension Transition Contribution, a participant must have been accruing benefits under Sysco's pension plan as of December 31, 2012 and have been at least age fifty (50) with fifteen (15) or more years of Sysco service as of that date. The Company will credit this contribution regardless of whether the participant defers any amounts under the MSP or 401(k) so long as he remains employed by Sysco or leaves for retirement, death or disability in such calendar year. Mr. DeLaney is eligible to receive these contributions.
In addition to the contributions described above, the MSP account for Messrs. Bertrand and Libby will be credited annually with an automatic fully vested Company contribution of 2.5% and 10%, respectively, of their annual base salary and annual incentive award for a period of ten years through 2023 (each contribution referred to as a "SERP Transition Contribution") so long as the NEO remains employed by Sysco or leaves for retirement, death or disability in such calendar year.
Investment Options. The portion of a participant's account attributable to salary and bonus deferrals will be deemed invested and reinvested in certain investments, as designated by the participant from a list of available investment options. The investment options include a variety of generally available investment funds. The portion of a participant's account attributable to Sysco company contributions will be deemed invested as directed by the participant.
Vesting of Deferrals and Company Contributions. Participant deferrals, including associated investment earnings and losses, will be fully vested at all times. The Company Match, as adjusted for associated investment earnings and losses, will vest based upon a participant's number of years of service. As of June 30, 2018, all of the NEOs were fully vested with respect to the Company Match. The Non-elective contribution, the Pension Transition Contribution, and the SERP Transition Contribution, as such amounts are adjusted for associated investment earnings and losses, will be fully vested at all times.
Timing and Form of Distributions. Other than elected in-service distributions or deferrals, the participant's vested account may generally only be distributed upon the participant's termination for any reason, including death, disability or retirement. Except with respect to in-service distributions or distributions following a participant's termination (for a reason other than death, disability or retirement), the participant may elect to have his account distributed in:
In-service distributions and distributions following a participant's termination (for a reason other than death, disability or retirement) will be distributed in a lump sum.
Delay of Distributions to NEOs. Distributions to a specified employee, including an NEO, upon the specified employee's or NEO's "separation from service" as defined under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, will be delayed for a period of six months to the extent that making payments during such six-month period would violate Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
Forfeiture. The MSP contains a forfeiture provision whereby participants will forfeit the balance of their accounts attributable to Company contributions, adjusted for deemed investment losses and earnings, and even if such amounts may have previously vested, in the event the Committee finds that the participant engaged in fraudulent or certain other illegal acts while employed by the Company, or impermissibly competes with the Company after termination. Participants also have an obligation to repay any amounts previously distributed to them under the MSP attributable to Company contributions if the Committee finds they engaged in such acts.
Limits on Excess Parachute Payments. The MSP contains cutback provisions that will reduce amounts payable to each NEO by the amount of any payments that cannot be deducted by Sysco under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.
About the EDCP
Sysco maintained the EDCP to provide certain executives the opportunity to defer the receipt of a portion of their annual salaries, bonuses and deemed earnings thereon on a tax-deferred basis. Federal income taxes on all amounts credited under the EDCP will be deferred until payout under current tax law. The EDCP is administered by the Compensation Committee.
Eligibility. All Sysco executives who were participants in the MIP, excluding those whose income was subject to Canadian income tax laws, were eligible to participate. The Committee amended the EDCP, effective in December 2012, to close the EDCP to new participants.
Executive Deferrals. Executives were permitted to defer up to 40% of their bonuses under the MIP and up to 100% of salary. In September 2009, the EDCP was amended to clarify that any bonus paid in lieu of or as a substitute for the MIP bonus in the future was eligible for deferral under the EDCP.
Sysco Matching Credit. Sysco did not match salary deferrals under the EDCP. Sysco provided matching credit of 15% of the first 20% of bonus deferred, resulting in a maximum possible match credit of 3% of an executive's bonus. The Committee was permitted to authorize additional discretionary company contributions, although it did not authorize any from fiscal year 2008 through December 31, 2012, the date on which the EDCP was frozen.
Investment Options. An executive may invest the deferral portion of his or her account among nine investment options, which may be changed as often as daily. Participants are also permitted to direct the investment of company matches under the EDCP.
Vesting. An executive is always 100% vested in his or her deferrals and each Sysco match, but any portion of an executive's account attributable to Sysco matches, including associated deemed investment return, and the net investment gain, if any, credited on his or her deferrals, is subject to forfeiture for specified cause or competing against Sysco in certain instances.
In-Service Distribution Elections and Hardship Withdrawals. Unless an executive has previously made an in-service distribution election, an executive will generally not have access to amounts deferred under the
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    72
EDCP while employed by Sysco unless he or she requests and qualifies for a hardship withdrawal. Such withdrawals are available under very limited circumstances in connection with an unforeseeable emergency.
Distribution Events. We will distribute the vested portion of the amount credited to an executive's EDCP account upon the earlier to occur of the executive's death, disability, retirement or other separation event.
Distributions. Effective January 1, 2009, a participant who terminates employment, other than due to death, disability or a qualifying retirement, will receive a lump sum. A participant may elect the form of distribution of his account in the event of death or disability, or if the participant terminates employment after the earlier of age 60, or age 55 with 10 years of service with the Company.
An executive who has the right to elect the form of payment of his vested account balance may choose annual or quarterly installments over a specified period of up to 20 years, a lump sum or a combination of both. An executive may change his distribution elections prior to separation, subject to limitations in the EDCP required by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
When we pay installments under the EDCP, we will credit the executive's unpaid vested account balance with a fixed investment return during the entire payout period. This fixed return will equal the Moody's Average Corporate Bond Yield for either the six- or twelve-month period ending two months prior to the month of the first installment payment, whichever is higher.
Delay of Distributions to NEOs. Distributions to a specified employee, including a named executive, upon the specified employee or named executive officer's "separation from service" as defined under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code will be delayed for a period of six months to the extent that making payments during such six-month period would violate Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
Forfeiture for Cause or Competition. Any portion of an executive's account attributable to Sysco matches, including associated deemed investment return, and the net investment gain, if any, credited on his deferrals, is subject to forfeiture for specified cause or competition. No such forfeiture can occur, however, for a participant who is discharged (1) during a plan year in which a change in control occurs or (2) during the three plan years thereafter.
Limits on Excess Parachute Payments. The EDCP contains cutback provisions that will reduce amounts payable to each named executive officer by the amount of any payments that cannot be deducted by Sysco under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.
Pension Benefits
Sysco maintains two defined benefit pension plans. One is the Sysco Corporation Retirement Plan, or pension plan, which is intended to be a tax-qualified plan under the Internal Revenue Code. The second is the Sysco Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, or SERP, which is not a tax-qualified plan. The pension plan ceased all non-union participant accruals effective December 31, 2012. In November 2012, the SERP was amended to freeze benefits and stop future accruals, effective June 29, 2013. Participants covered by the SERP as of June 29, 2013 were granted accelerated vesting. For those who retire and are not eligible for immediate commencement of their SERP benefit, they will be deemed 100% vested, with benefits payable upon reaching age 65.
For those who are eligible for a SERP benefit at the time of retirement, an early retirement reduction factor will be used to determine the amount available. As of January 1, 2013, the broad-based, tax-qualified Sysco Corporation Employee's 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) plan") was enhanced to provide a larger benefit going forward. The following table shows the years of credited service for eligibility purposes (e.g., early retirement rights) and the present value of the accrued benefits for each of the NEOs under each of the pension plan and SERP as of July 1, 2018. Mr. Bené is not a participant in either of the Sysco maintained defined benefit plans, and Messrs. Grade and Shurts are not participants in the SERP.
As required by SEC rules, we calculated the participating officers' accrued benefits under the pension plan by assuming that the named executives will remain in service with the Company until age 65, which is the earliest age at which the NEOs can retire without any reduction in benefits. Amounts shown below assume the pension plan benefit will be paid in the form of a life-only annuity with a 5-year guarantee. Amounts for present value purposes assume that 50% will elect the 100% joint-life annuity and 50% will elect a single life-only annuity. Other optional forms of payment are available from the pension plan.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    73
For the SERP, we calculated the participating officers' accrued benefits by assuming that the named executives will remain in service with Sysco until the earliest age they could retire without any reduction in SERP benefits. This date is at age 62.583 for Mr. DeLaney, age 58 for Mr. Bertrand and age 61 for Mr. Libby. These ages differ because the SERP early retirement factors are based on a combination of the participant's age, Sysco service, and/or MIP service. Note that some of these ages may represent the executive's current age as of the 2018 fiscal year-end due to prior attainment of their earliest unreduced date. The amounts shown below and for present value purposes assume the SERP will be paid as a joint-life annuity, reducing to two-thirds upon the death of either the executive or his spouse, with the unreduced payment guaranteed for 10 years; however, members also have the option to elect a life-only annuity with a 10-year guarantee.
We calculated the present value of the accumulated pension plan and SERP benefits based on a 4.28% discount rate for the pension plan and a 4.41% discount rate for the SERP, with a post-retirement mortality assumption based on Mercer's Industry Longevity Experience Study, Consumer Goods and Food & Drink, gender-distinct and no collar, applying the MSS2017 scale for annuitants.
Following are the estimated accrued benefits earned through the fiscal year ending 2018 for the pension plan or SERP, as noted. These annual amounts would be payable at the earliest unreduced retirement age, as described above, if the named executive officer remains in the service of Sysco until such age. Projected benefits that may be earned due to pay and service after the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 are not included in these estimates.
In addition to the above, we provide a temporary Social Security bridge benefit to an executive commencing SERP benefits before age 62, payable until the earlier of age 62 or death. The amount of this monthly benefit for each eligible participating NEO, based on the SERP early retirement assumptions above, is $1,638 for Mr. Bertrand and $1,586 for Mr. Libby.
Pension Plan
The pension plan, which is intended to be tax-qualified, is funded through an irrevocable tax-exempt trust and covered approximately 40,051 participants as of January 1, 2018. In general, a participant's accrued benefit is equal to 1.5% times the participant's average monthly eligible earnings for each year or partial year of service with Sysco or a subsidiary. As previously noted above, as of January 1, 2013, non-union employees no longer earn additional retirement benefits under the pension plan, so earnings and service after December 31, 2012, were not taken into account for determining non-union participants' accrued benefits under the pension plan. The accrued benefit under the pension plan is expressed in the form of a monthly annuity for the participant's life, beginning at age 65, the plan's normal retirement age, and with payments guaranteed for five years. If the participant remains with Sysco until at least age 55 with 10 years of service, the participant is entitled to early retirement payments. In such case, we reduce the benefit 6.67% per year for the first 5 years prior to normal retirement age and an additional 3.33% per year for years prior to age 60. Employees vest in the pension plan after five years of service, and the amendment to freeze benefit accruals under the pension plan after December 31, 2012 did not impact service determination for vesting purposes.
Benefits provided under the pension plan are based on compensation up to a limit, which is $275,000 for calendar year 2018, under the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, annual benefits provided under the pension plan may not exceed a limit, which is $220,000 for calendar year 2018, under the Internal Revenue Code.
Elements Included in Benefit Formula. Compensation included in the pension plan's benefit calculation is generally earned income excluding deferred bonuses.
Policy Regarding Extra Years of Credited Service. Generally, we do not credit service in the pension plan beyond the actual number of years an employee participates in the plan. We base the years of credited service for the NEOs only on their service while eligible for participation in the plan.
Benefit Payment Options. Participants may choose their method of payment from several options, including a life annuity option, spousal joint and survivor annuity, Social Security leveling and life annuity options with minimum guaranteed terms. Only de minimis lump sums are available.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    74
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
We maintain a supplemental executive retirement plan, which we refer to as the SERP, for the benefit of 73 eligible executives, as of June 30, 2018, to provide for retirement benefits beyond the amounts available under Sysco's various broad-based US and Canadian pension plans. Messrs. DeLaney, Bertrand and Libby participate in the SERP. It is our intent that the SERP comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code in both form and operation. The SERP is an unsecured obligation of Sysco and is not qualified for tax purposes.
In November 2012, the SERP was amended to freeze benefits and stop future accruals, effective June 29, 2013. Participants covered by the SERP as of June 29, 2013 were granted accelerated vesting. For those who retire and are not eligible for immediate commencement of their SERP benefit, they will be deemed 100% vested, with benefits payable upon reaching age 65. For those who are eligible for a SERP benefit at the time of retirement, an early retirement reduction factor will be used to determine the amount available.
The SERP was designed to provide, in combination with other retirement benefits, 50% of an executive's final average compensation, provided an executive had at least 20 years of Sysco service, including service with an acquired company. "Other retirement benefits" include Social Security, benefits from the pension plan, and employer contributions under Sysco's 401(k) plan and similar qualified plans of acquired companies. We reduce the gross accrued benefit of 50% of final average compensation by 5% per year for each year of Sysco service including service with an acquired company of less than 20 years. For purposes of this service calculation, Sysco service was frozen effective June 29, 2013. Additionally, final average compensation is determined using the monthly average of a participant's eligible earnings for the last 10 fiscal years prior to June 29, 2013, or the date he ceases to be covered under the SERP, if earlier. With respect to the determination of a participant's accrued benefit as of June 28, 2008, as discussed below, final average compensation is determined using the monthly average of a participant's eligible earnings for the highest 5 of the 10 fiscal years prior to, and including, the fiscal year ended June 28, 2008.
The term "eligible earnings" refers to compensation taken into account for SERP purposes. As discussed below, beginning with fiscal 2009, the portion of a participant's MIP bonus counted as eligible earnings is capped at 150% of the participant's rate of base salary as of the last day of the applicable fiscal year. Eligible earnings for fiscal years prior to fiscal 2009, including eligible earnings for purposes of determining a participant's accrued benefit as of June 28, 2008, as discussed below, are not affected by this plan change. The definition of eligible earnings that places a cap on the MIP bonus for fiscal years after fiscal 2008 will be used in all benefit calculations except for certain death benefit calculations and a participant's accrued benefit as of June 28, 2008, as discussed below.
A SERP participant will receive a SERP benefit equal to the greater of:
Under the SERP, Sysco has the ability to cause the forfeiture of any remaining SERP payments to a participant who was not discharged for "cause," but who, after termination, was determined by the Compensation Committee to have engaged in behavior while employed that would have constituted grounds for a discharge for "cause." For this purpose, termination for "cause" includes termination for fraud or embezzlement. Sysco also has the ability to cause a forfeiture of any remaining SERP payments to a participant if the participant violates certain non-competition covenants. These non-competition covenants are applicable for the year following termination and to the entire period over which any SERP benefits are to be paid.
Participants covered by the SERP as of June 29, 2013 are 100% vested. For those who are eligible for early payment at retirement, their benefits may be reduced by an early retirement factor. The early retirement factor is based upon age and MIP participation service and/or Sysco service. The early retirement factor is 50% when participants reach the earlier of age 60 with 10 years of MIP participation service and 20 years of Sysco service or age 55 with 15 years of MIP participation service. The early retirement factor increases with additional years of age and/or MIP participation service or Sysco service.
A participant with at least 20 years of Sysco service (including service with companies acquired by Sysco) can retire with unreduced benefits when the early retirement factor is 100%. The participant generally attains an early retirement factor of 100% on the earliest of:
Upon the occurrence of a change in control, the early retirement factor will become 100% for each participant. However, the criteria for determining whether a participant is eligible for early payment remains unchanged (i.e., the enhancement on the early retirement factor only impacts participants who otherwise meet the early payment criteria upon retirement). Notwithstanding this, the SERP contains cutback provisions that will reduce amounts payable to each participant by the amount of any payments that cannot be deducted by Sysco under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.
We pay the SERP benefit as a monthly life annuity with a guaranteed minimum period of 10 years if the participant is not married at the time payments commence. If the participant is married at the time payments commence, the participant has the option to elect a joint life annuity whereby the participant and spouse are entitled to a monthly annuity for life with a guaranteed minimum period of 10 years, and generally, on the participant's or spouse's death, the survivor is entitled to receive a monthly annuity for life with each payment equal to two-thirds of each payment made to the couple. The benefit payable upon the death of a vested, terminated participant who did not meet the early payment criteria as of his or her date of death reflects a reduction of 5/9ths of 1% for each of the first 120 months prior to age 65 and an actuarial reduction for the difference between age 55 and the executive's age at death.
We provide a temporary Social Security bridge benefit to an executive commencing SERP benefits before age 62, payable until the earlier of age 62 or death.
Elements of Compensation included in Benefit Formula. Compensation generally includes base pay, the MIP bonus or any bonus paid in lieu of or as a substitute for the MIP bonus (although this is limited to 150% of the annual rate of base salary for fiscal 2009 and later years), the fiscal 2007 supplemental performance bonus, and stock matches under the 2005 Management Incentive Plan and predecessor plans with respect to fiscal 2005 and prior fiscal years. Compensation earned after June 29, 2013 is not applicable to the SERP.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    75
Funding Status. Sysco's obligations under the SERP are partially funded by a rabbi trust holding life insurance and an interest in certain real property occupied by Sysco. Sysco's obligations under the SERP are maintained as a book reserve account. In the event of Sysco's bankruptcy or insolvency, however, the life insurance, the real property interest, and any other assets held by the rabbi trust become subject to the claims of Sysco's general creditors.
Lump Sum Availability. Retirement benefits may not be paid as a lump sum.
Delay of Distributions to NEOs. Distributions to an NEO upon the NEO's "separation from service" as defined under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code will be delayed for a period of six months to the extent that making payments during such six-month period would violate Section 409A.
In November 2012, the Committee amended the SERP to provide that benefit accruals for all participants were frozen as of June 29, 2013. Subsequent to June 29, 2013, the frozen SERP benefits continue to be payable pursuant to the terms of the SERP, as amended.
Also effective June 29, 2013, all SERP participants vested in their then accrued benefit. However, an early retirement reduction factor has been added to apply in the case of an employee who retires before age 65 who would not have been fully vested at his retirement date under the SERP prior to the amendment. The early retirement factor mirrors the benefit reduction that would have occurred as a result of the application of the vesting formula if the participant had taken early retirement under the SERP as it existed prior to its amendment. These changes do not alter the benefit commencement or other payment schedules for any SERP participant.
In addition, the age threshold previously applicable to the SERP death benefit was removed, effective June 29, 2013. As a result, if an active participant dies, the participant's beneficiary will be entitled to a monthly annuity actuarially equivalent to the greater of: (i) an annual payment equal to 25% of the participant's three-year final average compensation for ten years certain, or (ii) the participant's vested accrued benefit as of his date of death, reduced by an actuarial reduction factor to take into account age at death prior to normal retirement age of 65.
CEO Pay Ratio
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the ratio of the annual total compensation, calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K (the "Annual Total Compensation") of our CEO, Thomas L. Bené and the Annual Total Compensation of our median employee (the "Median Employee").
For fiscal 2018, our last completed fiscal year:
Methodology
We believe our CEO pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the applicable rules of the SEC. Our methodology and process is described below:
Determined Employee Population. We began with our global employee population of 67,865 associates as of May 1, 2018, including full-time, part-time, and seasonal or temporary workers, employed by the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries, but excluding our CEO. As permitted by SEC rules, under the 5% "De Minimis Exception," we excluded 1,245 non-U.S. employees, representing 1.8% of our total workforce. Employees from the following countries were excluded: Bahamas (371), Costa Rica (706), Panama (60) and Spain (108). Prior to applying the de minimis exception, our total employee population as of May 1, 2018, consisted of 44,997 employees in the U.S. and 22,928 employees outside the U.S. After excluding the employees in these countries pursuant to the de minimis exception, our employee population as of May 1, 2018, consisted of 66,680 employees, including 44,997 employees in the U.S. (67.5%) and 21,683 employees outside the U.S. (32.5%).
Identified the Median Employee. We collected the payroll data of all employees globally, except for the employees in the excluded countries identified above, who were employed on a full-time, part-time, temporary or seasonal basis as of May 1, 2018.
To identify our Median Employee, we used total taxable earnings paid to our employees in the most recently completed taxable year in their respective jurisdictions as our consistently applied compensation measure, as permitted by SEC rules. This included base salary, overtime pay, annual incentive awards and vested long-term incentive awards.
We annualized the compensation of permanent, full-time and part-time employees who were hired by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries after the beginning of the most recently completed taxable year in their respective jurisdictions. We applied an exchange rate as of May 1, 2018, to convert all international currencies into U.S. dollars.
Using this methodology, we determined that the Median Employee was a non-exempt, full time employee located in the U.S.
Calculated CEO Pay Ratio. We calculated our Median Employee's Annual Total Compensation for fiscal 2018 in accordance with the SEC's requirements governing preparation of the Summary Compensation Table, provided that we included in such total the estimated value of the Median Employee's health and welfare benefits, resulting in Annual Total Compensation of $71,543. We calculated our CEO's Annualized Total Compensation using the same approach, including the estimated value of his health and welfare benefits, and we adjusted our CEO's compensation by annualizing his salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation to reflect the amounts our CEO would have received if serving in that capacity for all of fiscal 2018. We then divided the CEO's Annualized Total Compensation by the Median Employee's Annual Total Compensation to calculate the pay ratio presented in the table above.
The CEO pay ratio disclosure presented above is a reasonable estimate. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use different methodologies, exemptions, estimates and assumptions, our pay ratio disclosure may not be comparable to the pay ratios reported by other companies.

Quantification of Termination/Change in Control Payments
We have entered into certain agreements and maintain certain plans that will require us to provide compensation for the NEOs in the event of specified terminations of their employment or upon a change in control of Sysco. We have listed the amount of compensation we would be required to pay to each named executive officer in each situation in the tables below. Amounts included in the tables are estimates and are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon the events discussed below, any actual amounts we pay or distribute may differ materially. Factors that could affect these amounts include the timing during the year of any such event, the amount of future bonuses, the value of our stock on the date of the change in control and the ages and life expectancy of each executive and his spouse. The amounts shown in the tables below assume that the event that triggered the payment occurred on June 30, 2018. All amounts shown represent total payments, except as otherwise noted. We expect to time the payment of all amounts shown to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

Compensation Risk Analysis
The Compensation Committee oversees the Company's executive compensation program and regularly reviews the program against Sysco's strategic goals, industry practices and emerging trends in order to ensure alignment with stockholder interests. The Committee believes that Sysco's performance-based bonus and equity programs provide executives with incentives to create long-term stockholder value.
In 2010, the Committee expanded its review of compensation programs across the Sysco enterprise to monitor whether the program components encourage or otherwise promote the taking of inappropriate or unacceptable risks that could threaten the Company's long-term value. In August 2018, at the Committee's request, Semler Brossy reviewed management's assessment of Sysco's fiscal 2018 enterprise-wide compensation programs and the associated risks. Management's assessment placed particular emphasis on identifying employees who have both significant compensation risk in the variability of their compensation and also the ability to expose the Company to significant business risk. The Committee primarily focused on the compensation for the senior executives of Sysco Corporation and its operating companies, as these are the employees whose actions have the greatest potential to expose the Company to significant business risk, although the review addressed all forms and levels of variable and other compensation applicable to the broader employee population that the Committee believed could reasonably provide employees with incentives to undertake risky behavior on behalf of Sysco. Having completed this review, the Committee concluded that Sysco's long-standing practices are designed to effectively promote the creation of long-term value, discourage behavior that leads to excessive risk, and mitigate the material risks associated with executive and other compensation programs.
These practices with respect to fiscal 2018 included the following:
Based on its most recent review, management and the Committee do not believe that the compensation policies and practices of Sysco create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

VOTE TO APPROVE THE ADOPTION OF THE SYSCO CORPORATION 2018 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN (ITEM 2)
On September 13, 2018, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee (the "Committee"), the Board approved the adoption of the Sysco Corporation 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Incentive Plan" or "Plan"), subject to stockholder approval. If approved by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting, the Omnibus Incentive Plan will become effective on November 16, 2018. If approved, the Omnibus Incentive Plan would be a successor to the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, and no additional awards would be made after November 15, 2018 under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The Omnibus Incentive Plan is a key pay-for-performance component of the Company's compensation program and the Company's primary vehicle for granting equity-based compensation to its employees and directors. The Company believes that the proposed Omnibus Incentive Plan is necessary in order to allow Sysco to continue to utilize equity awards and performance awards, including cash awards, to retain and attract the services of key individuals essential to Sysco's long-term growth and financial success and to further align their interests with those of Sysco's stockholders. Sysco relies on equity awards, primarily Options and performance-based Restricted Stock Units, or Performance Share Units, to encourage strong performance of key individuals and believes that equity incentives are necessary for Sysco to remain competitive and to retain and attract highly qualified individuals upon whom, in large measure, the future growth and success of Sysco depend.
In recommending to the Board the Omnibus Incentive Plan for which stockholder approval is being sought, the Committee received advice from compensation advisors, including its independent compensation consultant, Semler Brossy, who evaluated the Omnibus Incentive Plan, including an evaluation under proposed various models for structuring the Omnibus Incentive Plan.
Stockholder approval of the Omnibus Incentive Plan is being sought in order to (i) meet NYSE listing requirements; (ii) establish a limit on annual compensation of non-employee directors; (iii) allow for incentive stock options to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and (iv) establish a tax-qualified French sub-plan.
Determination of the Number of Shares Available for Awards under the 2018 Plan
If the Omnibus Incentive Plan is approved by our stockholders, subject to adjustments described in the Omnibus Incentive Plan, 51,500,000 shares of our common stock will be available for issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, of which up to 17,500,000 may be subject to Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units (including Performance Share Units) and Other Stock-Based Awards and of which up to 51,500,000 may be subject to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, or SARs.
The following factors were taken into account by the Committee and the Board in approving the proposed Omnibus Incentive Plan:
Dilution Analysis
As of August 31, 2018, the Company's capital structure consisted of 520,854,504 shares of common stock outstanding, 24,355,429 shares remained available for grant of awards under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 22,382,432 shares were subject to outstanding awards under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2007 Sysco Corporation Stock Incentive Plan ("2007 Stock Incentive Plan"). No awards have been permitted under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan since November 15, 2013. As of November 16, 2018, if the Omnibus Incentive Plan is approved, no additional awards will be granted under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan and any shares subject to awards thereunder that are forfeited or cancelled, or that terminate or expire without distribution of shares, will not be available for issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan.
Any shares remaining available for issuance under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, but not subject to previously outstanding awards as of November 16, 2018, would cease to be authorized for issuance upon the effective date of the Omnibus Incentive Plan. As of August 31, 2018, 24,355,429 shares were available for issuance under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, of which up to 10,700,027 shares may be issued as Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units (including Performance Share Units) and Other Stock-Based Awards, with the entire authorized amount available for issuance as Options or SARs. Accordingly, if approved, the Omnibus Incentive Plan would authorize approximately 27,144,571 additional shares, as compared to the current authorized number of shares remaining available for under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The entire authorized number of shares would be available for issuance, as Options and SARs, of which up to approximately 6,799,973 additional shares would be available for issuance as Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units (including Performance Share Units) and Other Stock-Based Awards. As of August 31, 2018, the closing price of Sysco common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $74.82 per share.
The table below shows our potential dilution (referred to as "overhang") levels based on our fully diluted shares of common stock and our request for 51,500,000 shares to be available for awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. The 51,500,000 shares represent 8.66% of the fully diluted shares of our common stock, including all shares that will be authorized under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, as described in the table below. The Committee and the Board believe that this number of shares of common stock under the Omnibus Incentive Plan represents a reasonable amount of potential equity dilution, which will allow the Company to continue awarding equity awards, and that equity awards are an important component of the Company's equity compensation program.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    81
Burn Rate
In setting the amount of the shares requested under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Committee also considered the historical amounts of equity awards granted by the Company in the past three fiscal years, as well as possible future needs under alternative, performance-based forms of award. In fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company granted equity awards representing a total of approximately 5,629,633 shares, 6,466,314 shares and 5,625,653, respectively. Consequently, the Company's three-year average burn rate was 1.1%.
The Committee and the Board intend to continue to consider the Company's equity expenditures in a manner that effectively attracts, retains and motivates individuals to achieve long-term value creation in line with the interests of our stockholders.
The historical burn rate and the potential dilution described above may not be indicative of what the actual amounts will be in the future.
The Omnibus Incentive Plan does not contemplate the amount or timing of specific equity awards. Awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan will be granted at the discretion of the Committee and are, therefore, not currently determinable. The potential dilution is a forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements are not facts, and actual results may differ materially because of factors such as those identified in reports the Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, without limitation, the Committee's discretion in determining the number of grantees and the size of the grants, as well as the potential impact significant corporate events, such as mergers, and of additional future share issuances outside the Omnibus Incentive Plan.

[END TABLE]
Purpose of the Omnibus Incentive Plan
The purpose of the Omnibus Incentive Plan is to promote the interests of the Company and its stockholders by providing executive officers, other key employees, non-employee directors, and key advisors of the Company and its defined subsidiaries with appropriate incentives and rewards to encourage them to enter into and remain in their positions with the Company and to acquire a proprietary interest in the long-term success of the Company, as well as to reward the performance of these individuals in fulfilling their personal responsibilities for long-range and annual achievements.
The Company believes strongly that our annual incentive program and our equity compensation programs and emphasis on employee stock ownership have been integral to our past success and will be important to our ability to achieve consistently superior performance in the years ahead.
Administration of the Omnibus Incentive Plan
Unless otherwise determined by the Board, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") administers the Omnibus Incentive Plan. The Committee is composed solely of "non-employee directors" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and "independent directors" within the meaning of NYSE listing standards.
The Committee has the power, in its discretion, to grant awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, to select the individuals to whom awards are granted, to determine the terms of the grants, to interpret the provisions of the Omnibus Incentive Plan and to otherwise administer the Plan. Except as prohibited by applicable law or stock exchange rules, the Committee may delegate all or any of its responsibilities and powers under the Omnibus Incentive Plan to one or more of its members, including, without limitation, the power to designate participants and determine the amount, timing and term of awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. In no event, however, shall the Committee have the power to accelerate the payment or vesting of any award, other than in the event of death, disability, or a change in control of the Company, as described in the Plan.
The Plan provides that members of the Committee shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss or expense resulting from claims and litigation arising from actions related to the Plan.

Adjustments to Shares Subject to the Omnibus Incentive Plan
If any shares of common stock subject to an award are forfeited or cancelled, or if an award terminates or expires without a distribution of shares to the grantee, the shares of common stock with respect to such award shall, to the extent of any such forfeiture or cancellation, again be available for awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan; provided, however, that with respect to Options or SARs that are settled in common stock, the aggregate number of shares of common stock subject to the Option or SAR grant shall be counted against the shares available for issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan as one share for every share subject thereto, regardless of the number of shares used to settle the Option or SAR upon exercise. Also, shares of stock will not again be available if such shares are surrendered or withheld as payment of either the exercise price of an award and/or withholding taxes with respect to an award. Awards that are settled solely in cash will not reduce the number of shares of stock available for awards. If shares are repurchased on the open market with proceeds of the exercise price of Options, such shares may not again be made available for awards under the Plan.
If the Company undergoes a recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, stock dividend, combination, subdivision or another similar transaction affecting the common stock, or if the Company makes an extraordinary dividend or distribution (including, without limitation, to implement a spinoff), then, subject to any required action by stockholders, the number and kind of shares available under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, and the various award grant limitations contained in the Omnibus Incentive Plan, will be automatically adjusted accordingly. In addition, subject to any required stockholder action, the number and kind of shares covered by outstanding awards, the price per share of outstanding awards shall be automatically proportionately adjusted to reflect such an event. In the event of any such transaction described above in this paragraph, subject to any required stockholder action, the applicable Performance Goals with respect to outstanding awards may be adjusted in a manner the Committee deems equitable and appropriate.
If the Company experiences a Change in Control (defined below) where the Company is not the surviving entity (or survives only as a subsidiary of another entity), except as described below, all outstanding awards that are not exercised or paid at the time of the Change in Control will be assumed by, or replaced with awards that have comparable terms by, the surviving entity (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving entity), and shall vest as described under "Vesting for Certain Terminations of Employment in Connection with a Change in Control" below. In the event that the surviving entity (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving entity) does not assume or replace awards with grants that have comparable terms, outstanding Options and SARs will accelerate and become fully exercisable and the restrictions on other outstanding awards shall immediately lapse and have no further effect, provided that, if the vesting of any such awards is based, in whole or in part, on performance, such awards shall vest assuming that the applicable performance goals were attained at the target level of performance for the applicable performance period.
If there is a Change in Control and all outstanding awards are not assumed by, or replaced with grants that have comparable terms by, the surviving entity (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving entity), the Committee may take any of the following actions without the consent of any grantee:
Such surrender, termination or payment shall take place as of the date of the Change in Control or such other date as the Committee may specify.
Eligibility and Participation
Eligibility to participate in the Omnibus Incentive Plan is limited to employees, non-employee directors and key advisors of the Company and its defined subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2018, the Company had approximately 67,000 employees, 13 non-employee directors and no key advisors. In the fiscal 2018 grant cycle, a total of 1,807 individuals received share based awards under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, and the Company anticipates a similar number of individuals to be recipients of grants annually under the Omnibus Incentive Plan.
Awards
The Committee may grant awards to eligible individuals. The Committee will have complete discretion, subject to the terms of the Plan, to determine the persons to whom awards will be granted, the time or times of grant, and the other terms and conditions of each grant. The awards may be granted with value and payment contingent upon Performance Goals.
All awards granted under the Plan shall include vesting schedules that provide that no portion of the award will vest earlier than one year from the date of grant. However, up to 5% of the shares subject to the aggregate share authorization under the Plan may be granted without regard to such one-year minimum vesting requirement. In addition, for performance based awards for which performance metrics are based on financial performance, no participant will be vested in any portion of the award unless the participant has remained in service for at least the first full fiscal year following the beginning of the performance period.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    84
Performance Goals
Any award that may be granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan also may be granted contingent on achievement of a Performance Goal. Under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, Performance Goals may be based on one or more of the following criteria (or such other criteria as the Committee determines) applied to one or more of the Company, its defined subsidiaries, and/or certain specified affiliates or based upon the Company's adjusted financial statements: (1) return on total stockholder equity; (2) earnings per share of Stock; (3) earnings before any or all of interest, taxes, minority interest, depreciation and amortization; (4) economic profit; (5) sales or revenues; (6) return on assets, capital or investment; (7) market share or other volume based metrics, such as case growth; (8) control of operating or non-operating expenses; (9) reductions in certain costs (including reductions in inventories or accounts receivable or reductions in operating expenses); (10) operating income; (11) implementation or completion of critical projects or processes; (12) operating cash flow; (13) free cash flow; (14) return on capital or increase in pretax earnings; (15) net earnings; (16) margins; (17) market price of the Company's securities; (18) pre-tax earnings or variations of income criteria in varying time periods; (19) economic value added; (20) expense targets; (21) increase in net after-tax earnings per share; (22) working capital targets; (23) enterprise value; (24) safety record; (25) closing of acquisitions or dispositions or other business expansion or contraction; (26) operating income or improvements in operating profit; (27) improvements in certain asset or financial measures (including working capital and the ratio of sales to net working capital); (28) any combination of, or a specified increase in, any of the foregoing; and (29) general comparisons with other peer companies or industry groups or classifications with regard to one or more of the foregoing criteria. The Performance Goals may be based upon the attainment of specified levels of performance under one or more of the criteria described above relative to the performance of other comparable entities. The Committee may designate additional business criteria on which the Performance Goals may be based or adjust, modify or amend the aforementioned business criteria. Performance Goals may include a threshold level of performance below which no award will be earned, a level of performance at which the target amount of an award will be earned and a level of performance at which the maximum amount of the award will be earned. The Committee in its sole discretion has the authority to make equitable adjustments to the Performance Goals in recognition of unusual or non-recurring events.
Exercise Price and Vesting of Awards
The Committee determines the exercise price with respect to each Option at the time of grant. The Option exercise price per share of common stock may not be less than 100% of the fair market value per share of the common stock underlying the Option on the date of grant, and no Option may be repriced in violation of the repricing limitations discussed in "Amendment and Termination" below. For purposes of determining the Option exercise price, fair market value is defined as the closing price on the NYSE on the first business day prior to the date of grant. The Committee may determine at the time of grant the terms under which Options and SARs shall vest and become exercisable. However, no Option or SAR may have a term in excess of 10 years, and, except as described below, all Options and SARs are subject to a minimum one-year vesting schedule from the date of grant; provided, however, that at the time of the grant of an Option or SAR, the Committee may place restrictions on the exercisability or vesting of the Option or SAR that shall lapse, in whole or in part, only upon the attainment of Performance Goals; provided that such Performance Goals shall relate to periods of performance of at least one fiscal year. The foregoing notwithstanding, up to five percent (5%) of the shares of Stock subject to the authorized limit may be granted without regard to the foregoing minimum vesting requirement.
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs)
An Option is a right to receive stock after paying the Option exercise price. A SAR is the right to receive stock, cash, or other property equal in value to the difference between the grant price of the SAR and the market price of the Company's stock on the exercise date. The Committee determines the exercise price with respect to each Option and the grant price with respect to each SAR at the time of grant. The Option exercise price and SAR grant price per share of common stock may not be less than 100% of the fair market value per share of the common stock underlying the Option or SAR on the date of grant, and no Option or SAR may be repriced in violation of the repricing limitations discussed in "Amendment and Termination" below. For purposes of determining the Option exercise price and the SAR grant price, fair market value is defined as the closing price on the NYSE on the first business day prior to the date of grant.
The Committee may determine at the time of grant the terms under which Options and SARs shall vest and become exercisable, subject to the minimum vesting requirement described above under "Awards." However, no Option or SAR may have a term in excess of 10 years. At the time of the grant of an Option or SAR, the Committee may place restrictions on the exercisability or vesting of the Option or SAR that shall lapse, in whole or in part, only upon the attainment of Performance Goals.
For Options, notice of exercise must be accompanied by a payment equal to the applicable Option exercise price plus all withholding taxes due, such amount to be paid in cash or by tendering, either by actual delivery of shares or by attestation, unrestricted shares of common stock that are acceptable to the Committee, such shares to be valued at fair market value as of the day the shares are tendered, or paid in any combination of cash and shares, as determined by the Committee. To the extent permitted by applicable law, a participant may elect to pay the exercise price through the contemporaneous sale by a third party broker of shares of common stock acquired upon exercise yielding net sales proceeds equal to the exercise price and any withholding tax due and the remission of those sale proceeds to the Company. In addition, to the extent permitted by the Committee's policies, a participant may elect to pay the exercise price and all withholding taxes due through the withholding by the Company of shares of Stock subject to the Option equal in value to the aggregate amount of the exercise price and such taxes, such withheld shares to be valued at fair market value as of the date of such Option exercise.
SARs may be granted independently or in tandem with an Option at the time of grant of the related Option. A SAR granted in tandem with an Option shall be exercisable only to the extent the underlying Option is exercisable. A SAR confers on the grantee a right to receive an amount with respect
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    85
to each share of common stock subject thereto, upon exercise thereof, equal to the excess of (A) the fair market value of one share of common stock on the date of exercise over (B) the grant price of the SAR (which, in the case of a SAR granted in tandem with an Option, shall be equal to the exercise price of the underlying Option, and which, in the case of any other SAR, shall be such price as the Committee may determine, but in no event shall be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant of such SAR).
Transferability of Awards
Except as otherwise provided by the Committee, Options, SARs and any unvested other awards may not be transferred, except by will or applicable laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may any such award be transferred to a third party for consideration at any time.
Termination of Options and Other Awards
Options and SARs shall be exercisable during such periods as may be established by the Committee. Except as discussed below under "Vesting for Certain Terminations of Employment in Connection with a Change in Control," Options and SARs will expire on the earlier to occur of the expiration date of the Option or 90 days after the severance of an Option holder's employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, if, before the expiration of an Option or SAR, a holder's employment terminates as a result of retirement in good standing or disability under the established rules of the Company then in effect, the Option or SAR will remain in effect, vest and be exercisable in accordance with its terms. Upon the death of an employee while employed by the Company or its subsidiaries, Options, to the extent then exercisable, shall remain exercisable by the executors or administrators of his or her estate for up to three years following the date of death, but in no event later than the original expiration date of the Option or SAR. However, no Option or SAR may be exercised more than 10 years from the date of grant. To the extent not exercised by the applicable deadline, the Option or SAR will terminate.
With respect to all other awards, any unvested awards shall immediately vest, and all restrictions pertaining to such other awards shall lapse and have no further effect, upon the holder's death or disability under the established rules of the Company then in effect, except as otherwise provided by the Committee at grant of the award.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units, Including Performance Share Units
Restricted Stock is common stock that the Company grants subject to transfer restrictions and vesting criteria. A Restricted Stock Unit, including Performance Share Units, is a right to receive stock or cash equal to the value of a share of stock at the end of a specified period that the Company grants subject to transfer restrictions and vesting criteria. The grant of these awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan are subject to such terms, conditions and restrictions as the Committee determines consistent with the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, subject to the minimum vesting requirements described under "Awards" above.
At the time of grant, the Committee may place restrictions on Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units that shall lapse, in whole or in part, only upon the attainment of Performance Goals; provided that such Performance Goals shall relate to periods of performance of at least one fiscal year. Except to the extent restricted under the award agreement relating to the Restricted Stock, a grantee granted Restricted Stock shall have all of the rights of a stockholder, including the right to vote Restricted Stock and the right to receive accrued dividends, subject to forfeiture risks and vesting conditions to the same extent as the Restricted Stock with respect to which such dividends have been declared.
Unless otherwise provided in an award agreement, upon the vesting of a Restricted Stock Unit (including a Performance Share Unit), there shall be delivered to the grantee, within 30 days of the date on which such award (or any portion thereof) vests, the number of shares of common stock equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units (or Performance Share Units) becoming so vested.
An award of Restricted Stock Units (including Performance Share Units) may provide the grantee with the right to receive dividend equivalent payments with respect to stock subject to the award, which payments shall accrue and be credited to an account for the grantee and subject to forfeiture risks and vesting conditions to the same extent as the underlying Restricted Stock Units (including Performance Share Units), and may be settled in cash or stock, on the same schedule that the underlying Restricted Stock Units (including Performance Share Units) vest and are settled. Any such settlements and any such crediting of dividend equivalents shall be made subject to the transfer restrictions, forfeiture risks, vesting and conditions of the underlying Restricted Stock Units (including Performance Share Units) or such other conditions, restrictions and contingencies as the Committee shall establish at the time of grant of the Restricted Stock Units (including Performance Share Units), including a requirement that such credited amounts are reinvested in stock equivalents, provided that all such conditions, restrictions and contingencies shall comply with the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. Options and SARs may not be granted with the right to receive dividend equivalent payments.
Other Stock-Based Awards
The Omnibus Incentive Plan also allows the Committee to grant "Other Stock-Based Awards," which means a right or other interest that may be denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on, or related to, common stock. This includes, without limitation, (i) unrestricted stock awarded as a bonus or upon the attainment of Performance Goals, or otherwise, as permitted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan and (ii) a right to acquire stock from the Company containing the terms and conditions prescribed by the Committee. Subject
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    86
to the minimum vesting requirements described under "Awards" above, at the time of the grant of Other Stock-Based Awards, the Committee may place restrictions on the payout or vesting of such Other Stock-Based Awards that shall lapse, in whole or in part, only upon the attainment of Performance Goals; provided that such Performance Goals shall relate to periods of performance of at least one fiscal year. Other Stock-Based Awards may not be granted with the right to receive dividend equivalent payments.
Cash Awards
The Company may grant cash awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. The cash awards may be subject to the achievement of certain Performance Goals.
Awards to Employees Subject to Taxation Outside of the United States
Awards may be granted to grantees who are foreign nationals or who are employed outside the United States, or both, on such terms and conditions different from those specified in the Omnibus Incentive Plan as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable to further the purpose of the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Such different terms and conditions may be reflected in addenda to the Plan or in the applicable award agreement. However, no such different terms or conditions shall be employed if such terms or conditions constitute, or in effect result in, an increase in the aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan or a change in the group of eligible grantees.
Forfeiture
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Omnibus Incentive Plan and except as discussed under "Vesting for Certain Terminations of Employment in Connection with a Change in Control" below, if the Committee finds by a majority vote that: (i) the participant, before or after termination of his or her relationship with the Company or any of its defined subsidiaries for any reason, (a) committed fraud, embezzlement, theft, a felony, or proven dishonesty in the course of his employment and that such act damaged the Company or any of its defined subsidiaries, or (b) disclosed trade secrets of the Company or any of its defined subsidiaries, or (ii) the participant, before or after termination of his or her employment relationship for any reason, participated, engaged or had a financial or other interest (whether as an employee, officer, director, consultant, contractor, stockholder, owner, or otherwise) in any commercial endeavor that is competitive with the business of the Company or any of its defined subsidiaries in violation of the Sysco Global Code of Conduct (or any successor Code of Conduct or Ethics) as in effect on the date of such participation or other engagement or in such a manner that would have violated the Global Code of Conduct had the participant been employed by the Company or any of its defined subsidiaries at the time of the activity in question, or (iii) violated the compensation, clawback and recoupment policies that may be applicable to the participant, then any outstanding Options and SARs that have not been exercised and any awards other than Options and SARs that have not vested will be forfeited. The decision of the Committee as to the nature of a participant's conduct, the damage done to the Company or any of its defined subsidiaries and the extent of the participant's competitive activity will be final. No decision of the Committee, however, will affect the finality of the discharge of the participant in any manner. The Committee may, in its discretion, include a form of post-employment covenants, non-compete, non-solicitation and/or non-disparagement agreement in any award agreement, and such post-employment covenants, non-compete, non-solicitation or non-disparagement agreement may be personalized, in the Committee's discretion, to fit the circumstances of any specific grantee.
Vesting for Certain Terminations of Employment in Connection with a Change in Control
Under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, if (A) a Change in Control occurs and (B) during the period commencing on the date that is 12 months prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control and ending on the date that is 24 months following the Change in Control, the participant's employment or service with the Company is terminated in a qualifying manner, all outstanding Options and SARs shall vest and become exercisable and all other outstanding awards shall vest and all restrictions pertaining to such other awards shall lapse and have no further effect; provided that any award that vests based on the attainment of Performance Goals shall vest assuming that the Performance Goals were attained at the target level of performance for the applicable performance period. For purposes of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, a Change in Control event includes, but is not limited to, certain acquisitions of 20% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock, certain changes in the identity of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and certain mergers in which the Company's then existing shareholders do not own at least 60% of the outstanding voting securities of the surviving entity. In the event that the employment of a participant who is an employee of the Company or any of its defined subsidiaries is terminated by the Company, other than for cause, as defined below, during the 24-month period following a Change in Control, all of such participant's outstanding Options and SARs may thereafter be exercised by the participant, to the extent that such Options and SARs were exercisable as of the date of such termination of employment, for (x) a period set forth in the applicable award agreement or (y) until expiration of the stated term of such Option or SAR, whichever period is shorter. The forfeiture provisions relating to competition as described in the immediately preceding paragraph shall not apply to any participant who incurs a termination of employment pursuant to the Change in Control provisions in the Plan. For purposes of these provisions, the term "cause" shall mean "cause" as defined in the participant's award agreement or written employment, consulting or other agreement with the Company or a subsidiary, or if not defined in any such agreement,
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    87
"cause" shall mean conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere, by the participant for a felony, dishonesty while performing his employment duties, a participant's willful or deliberate failure to perform his or her duties in any material respect, or a participant's violation of any non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality or other restrictive covenants agreement or code of conduct applicable to the participant.
Tax Withholding
Issuance of shares under the Omnibus Incentive Plan is subject to withholding of all applicable taxes, and the Committee may condition the delivery of any shares or other benefits under the Omnibus Incentive Plan on satisfaction of the applicable withholding obligations. The Committee, in its discretion, and subject to such requirements as the Committee may impose prior to the occurrence of such withholding, may permit such withholding obligations to be satisfied through cash payment by the participant, through the surrender of shares of common stock which the participant already owns, or through the surrender of shares of common stock to which the participant is otherwise entitled under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, but only to the extent of the maximum individual tax rate permitted to be withheld in the applicable tax jurisdiction.
Term of the Omnibus Incentive Plan
Unless earlier terminated by the Board of Directors, the Omnibus Incentive Plan, if approved, will terminate on November 15, 2028. No awards may be granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan subsequent to that date.
Approval of French Sub-Plan
The Omnibus Incentive Plan provides that the Committee has the authority, in its sole discretion, to adopt any local country plans as sub-plans to the Omnibus Incentive Plan as may be deemed necessary or advisable to comply with local laws or regulations, and to design any award to satisfy specific requirements of obtaining a tax benefit.
For France, recent changes to the income tax and social tax treatment of French tax-qualified restricted stock units and French tax-qualified options were implemented. Pursuant to French law, U.S. companies are permitted, but not required, to grant French-qualified restricted stock units and French-qualified options, which may provide for more favorable income tax and social tax treatment for both French employers and their employees than the current non-qualified restricted stock unit awards granted under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The French Sub-Plan, a sub-plan under the Omnibus Incentive Plan and attached to the Omnibus Incentive Plan as Appendix I, is designed to permit the grant of French-qualified restricted stock units and French-qualified options. In addition to the approval of the Board or the Committee, French law requires that the French Sub-Plan must be authorized by stockholders at a meeting after December 31, 2017 in order to realize potential tax benefits to employers and employees in France.
Stockholder approval of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, including the French Sub-Plan, is being requested, in part, in order to enable the Committee to grant French-qualified restricted stock units and French-qualified options under French law. The Committee will not, however, be obligated to grant French-qualified restricted stock units or French-qualified options and may choose, at its discretion, to grant Restricted Stock Units or Options that are not considered French-qualified.
The French Sub-Plan does not increase the number of shares otherwise available for issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan or modify the group of eligible grantees.
Amendment and Termination
The Board may, at any time, amend or terminate the Omnibus Incentive Plan, except that the following actions may not be taken without stockholder approval: (i) any increase in the number of shares that may be issued under the Omnibus Incentive Plan (except by certain adjustments provided under the Omnibus Incentive Plan); (ii) any change in the class of persons eligible to receive incentive stock options under the Omnibus Incentive Plan; (iii) any change in the requirements of the Omnibus Incentive Plan regarding the exercise price of Options or grant price of SARs; (iv) any repricing or cancellation and re-grant of any Option or, if applicable, other award at a lower exercise, base or purchase price, whether in the form of an amendment, cancellation or replacement grant, or a cash-out of underwater Options or any action that provides for awards that contain a so-called "reload" feature under which additional Options or other awards are granted automatically to the grantee upon exercise of the original Option or award; or (v) any other amendment to the Omnibus Incentive Plan that would require approval of the Company's stockholders under applicable law, regulation, rule or stock exchange listing requirement.
U.S Tax Treatment of Awards
The following is a brief description of the material United States federal income tax consequences associated with awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. It is based on existing United States laws and regulations, and there can be no assurance that those laws and regulations will not change in the future. Tax consequences in other countries may vary. This information is not intended as tax advice to anyone, including participants in the Omnibus Incentive Plan.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    88
Stock Options. Neither incentive stock option grants nor non-qualified stock option grants cause any tax consequences to the participant or Sysco at the time of grant. Upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, the excess of the market value of the shares acquired over their exercise price is ordinary income to the participant and is deductible by Sysco. The participant's tax basis for the shares is the market value thereof at the time of exercise. Any gain or loss realized upon a subsequent disposition of the stock will generally constitute capital gain, in connection with which Sysco will not be entitled to a tax deduction.
Upon the exercise of an incentive stock option, the participant will not realize taxable income, but the excess of the fair market value of the stock over the exercise price may give rise to alternative minimum tax. When the stock acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option is subsequently sold, the participant will recognize income equal to the difference between the sales price and the exercise price of the option. If the sale occurs after the expiration of two years from the grant date and one year from the exercise date, the income will constitute long-term capital gain. If the sale occurs prior to that time, the participant will recognize ordinary income to the extent of the lesser of the gain realized upon the sale or the difference between the fair market value of the acquired stock at the time of exercise and the exercise price; any additional gain will constitute capital gain. Sysco will be entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant, but no deduction in connection with any capital gain recognized by the participant. If the participant exercises an incentive stock option more than three months after his or her termination of employment due to retirement or more than twelve months after his or her termination of employment due to permanent disability, he or she is deemed to have exercised a non-qualified stock option.
Stock Appreciation Rights. A participant granted a stock appreciation right under the Omnibus Incentive Plan will not recognize income, and Sysco will not be allowed a tax deduction, at the time the award is granted. When the participant exercises the stock appreciation right, the amount of cash and the fair market value of any shares of stock or other consideration received will be ordinary income to the participant and Sysco will be allowed a corresponding federal income tax deduction at that time. Sysco may be entitled to a tax deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant.
Restricted Stock. Restricted stock is not taxable to a participant at the time of grant, but instead is included in ordinary income (at its then fair market value) when the restrictions lapse. A participant may elect, however, to recognize income at the time of grant, in which case the fair market value of the restricted shares at the time of grant is included in ordinary income and there is no further income recognition when the restrictions lapse. If a participant makes such an election and thereafter forfeits the restricted shares, he or she will be entitled to no tax deduction, capital loss or other tax benefit. Sysco may be entitled to a tax deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant.
A participant's tax basis for restricted shares will be equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant. The participant will recognize capital gain (or loss) on a sale of the restricted stock if the sale price exceeds (or is lower than) such basis. The holding period for restricted shares for purposes of characterizing gain or loss on the sale of any shares as long- or short-term commences at the time the participant recognizes ordinary income pursuant to an award. Sysco is not entitled to a tax deduction corresponding to any capital gain or loss of the participant.
Restricted Stock Units. A participant will not recognize income, and Sysco will not be allowed a tax deduction, at the time a restricted stock unit award is granted. Upon receipt of shares of stock (or the equivalent value in cash or any combination of cash and Sysco common stock) in settlement of a restricted stock unit award, a participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the stock and cash received as of that date (less any amount he or she paid for the stock and cash), and Sysco will be allowed a corresponding federal income tax deduction at that time.
Performance Awards. A participant will not recognize income, and Sysco will not be allowed a tax deduction, at the time a performance award is granted (for example, when the performance goals are established). Upon receipt of stock or cash (or a combination thereof) in settlement of a performance award, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the stock and cash received, and Sysco will be allowed a corresponding federal income tax deduction at that time.
Code Section 409A. If an award is subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 409A (which relates to nonqualified deferred compensation plans), and if the requirements of Section 409A are not met, the taxable events as described above could apply earlier than described, and could result in the imposition of additional taxes and penalties. All awards that comply with the terms of the Omnibus Incentive Plan, however, are intended to be exempt from the application of Code Section 409A or meet the requirements of Section 409A in order to avoid such early taxation and penalties.
Tax Withholding. Sysco has the right to deduct or withhold, or require a participant to remit to Sysco, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state and local taxes (including employment taxes) required by law to be withheld with respect to any exercise, lapse of restriction or other taxable event arising as a result of the Plan. The Committee may, at the time the award is granted or thereafter, require or permit that any such withholding requirement be satisfied, in whole or in part, by delivery of, or withholding from the award, shares having a fair market value on the date of withholding equal to the amount required to be withheld for tax purposes.
Certain Interests of Directors
In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the Omnibus Incentive Plan, stockholders should be aware that members of the Board of Directors have interests that present them with conflicts of interest in connection with this proposal to approve the Omnibus Incentive Plan. For example, directors who are also employees of the Company will be eligible for the grant of awards under the Plan. Currently, only Mr. Bené is both a director and an employee of the Company, and he does not serve on the Committee. In addition, non-employee directors of the Board will also be eligible for grants under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, and it is currently anticipated that a portion of their annual compensation will be awarded pursuant to the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Under the Omnibus Incentive Plan, the maximum grant date value of shares subject to Awards granted to any individual Non-Employee Director during any fiscal year, taken together with any cash fees payable to such Non-Employee Director for services rendered during such fiscal year, shall not exceed $1,500,000 in total value.

Required Vote
The affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast, either for, against or abstain, is required to approve this proposal. Accordingly, abstentions will have the effect of a vote against the proposal. Broker non-votes are not considered to be votes cast for these purposes and, as a result, will not be relevant to the outcome.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" approval of the adoption of the Sysco Corporation 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan.
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (ITEM 3)
Sysco seeks a non-binding vote from its stockholders to approve the compensation paid to our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion. This vote is commonly referred to as a "Say on Pay" vote because it gives stockholders a direct opportunity to express their approval or disapproval to the Company regarding its pay practices.
As discussed in detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, retain and incentivize highly talented individuals who are committed to driving Sysco's vision and strategy. We strive to link executives' pay to their performance and their advancement of Sysco's overall performance and business strategies, while also aligning the executives' interests with those of stockholders. We also aim to encourage high-performing executives to drive long-term results and to remain with Sysco over the course of their careers. We believe that the amount of compensation for each named executive officer reflects their extensive management experience, continued high performance and exceptional service to Sysco and our stockholders.
We invite you to consider the details of our executive compensation as disclosed more fully throughout this proxy statement.
Regardless of the outcome of this "Say on Pay" vote, Sysco welcomes input from its stockholders regarding executive compensation and other matters related to the Company's success generally. We believe in a corporate governance structure that is responsive to stockholder concerns, and we view this vote as a meaningful opportunity to gauge stockholder approval of our executive compensation policies. Given the information provided above and elsewhere in this proxy statement, the Board of Directors asks you to approve the following advisory resolution:
"Resolved, that Sysco's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to Sysco's named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement."
Required Vote
The votes cast for this proposal must exceed the votes cast against it in order for it to be approved. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be relevant to the outcome.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the compensation paid to Sysco's Named Executive Officers.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
Sysco's Audit Committee reports to, and acts on behalf of, the Board of Directors, and is composed of seven directors who each satisfy the independence, financial literacy and other requirements of the New York Stock Exchange listing standards and the U.S. federal securities laws. The role of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in its oversight of:
During fiscal year 2018, the Audit Committee held ten meetings and fulfilled all of its responsibilities as set forth in the committee's charter, including:
As required by its charter, the Audit Committee has also met and held discussions with management and Ernst & Young regarding Sysco's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2018. Management represented to the Audit Committee that Sysco's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements with management and Ernst & Young. The Audit Committee also discussed with Ernst & Young the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, AU Sec. 380), as modified or supplemented. Ernst & Young provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the letter required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526, "Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence", as modified or supplemented, and the Audit Committee discussed with Ernst & Young that firm's independence.
Based on the Audit Committee's discussion with management and Ernst & Young and the Audit Committee's review of the representations of management and Ernst & Young's report, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Sysco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

FEES PAID TO INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The following table presents fees billed for professional audit services rendered by Ernst & Young LLP for the audit of Sysco's annual financial statements for fiscal 2018 and 2017, as well as other services rendered by Ernst & Young LLP during those periods (all of which services were approved by the Audit Committee):
Pre-Approval Policy
It is the Audit Committee's policy to comply with Section 10A(i) of the Exchange Act, which requires the Audit Committee to pre-approve all services, including audit services and permissible audit related, tax and non-audit services, to be provided by Ernst & Young LLP to the Company, subject to an exception for certain permitted, de minimis non-audit services that are approved by the Audit Committee prior to completion of the audit. In February 2003, the Audit Committee adopted procedures authorizing the Audit Committee chairman to approve the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP to provide permitted non-audit services, provided that such pre-approval is reported to the Audit Committee at the next regular meeting and subject to the Committee's authority to withdraw such pre-approval. During fiscal 2018, Ernst & Young did not provide any services prohibited under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    92
RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (ITEM 4)
The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as Sysco's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019. Ernst & Young LLP has served as the Company's independent public registered public accounting firm providing auditing, financial and tax services since their engagement in fiscal 2002. In determining to appoint Ernst & Young, the Audit Committee carefully considered Ernst & Young's past performance for the Company, its independence with respect to the services to be performed and its general reputation for adherence to professional auditing standards.
Although the Company is not required to seek ratification, the Audit Committee and the Board believe it is sound corporate governance to do so. If stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young, the current appointment will stand, but the Audit Committee will consider the stockholders' action in determining whether to appoint Ernst & Young as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2020.
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Required Vote
The votes cast for this proposal must exceed the votes cast against it in order for it to be approved. Accordingly abstentions and broker non-votes will not be relevant to the outcome.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019.
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    93
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL (ITEM 5)
The Teamsters General Fund of 25 Louisiana Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20001, owner of 280 shares of Sysco common stock, has notified us that it intends to present the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. In accordance with applicable proxy regulations, the proposal and supporting statement, for which Sysco accepts no responsibility, are set forth below exactly as they were submitted by the proponent.
RESOLVED: The shareholders ask the board of directors of Sysco Corporation ("Company") to adopt a policy that in the event of a change in control (as defined under any applicable employment agreement, equity incentive plan or other plan), there shall be no acceleration of vesting of any equity award granted to any senior executive, provided, however, that the board's Compensation Committee may provide in an applicable grant or purchase agreement that any unvested award will vest on a partial, pro rata basis up to the time of the senior executive's termination, with such qualifications for an award as the Committee may determine.
For purposes of this Policy, "equity award" means an award granted under an equity incentive plan as defined in Item 402 of the SEC's Regulation S-K, which addresses elements of executive compensation to be disclosed to shareholders. This resolution shall be implemented so as not to affect any contractual rights in existence on the date this proposal is adopted, and it shall apply only to equity awards made under equity incentive plans or plan amendments that shareholders approve after the date of the 2018 annual meeting.
SUPPORTING STATEMENT:
Sysco Corporation allows senior executives to receive an accelerated award of unearned equity under certain conditions after a change of control of the Company. We do not question that some form of severance payments may be appropriate in that situation. We are concerned, however, that current practices at the Company may permit windfall awards that have nothing to do with an executive's performance.
According to last year's proxy statement, a change in control at the end of the 2017 fiscal year could have accelerated the vesting of $34.4 million worth of long-term equity to the Company's five senior executives.
We are unpersuaded by the argument that executives somehow "deserve" to receive unvested awards. To accelerate the vesting of unearned equity on the theory that an executive was denied the opportunity to earn those shares seems inconsistent with a "pay for performance'' philosophy worthy of the name.
We do believe, however, that an affected executive should be eligible to receive an accelerated vesting of equity awards on a pro rata basis as of his or her termination date, with the details of any pro rata award to be determined by the Compensation Committee.
Other major corporations, including: Apple, Chevron, ExxonMobil, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, and Occidental Petroleum, have limitations on accelerated vesting of unearned equity, such as providing pro rata awards or simply forfeiting unearned awards. Research from James Reda & Associates found that over one-third of the largest 200 companies now pro rate, forfeit, or only partially vest performance shares upon a change of control.
We urge you to vote FOR this proposal.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS' STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION OF THE PROPOSAL
The Board unanimously recommends a vote "AGAINST" the stockholder proposal.
The Board believes that the most effective executive compensation program is one that places a heavy emphasis on pay for performance and is designed to align the interests of company executives with those of our stockholders, with the ultimate objective of increasing stockholder value. The Board does not believe that the adoption of a "one-size fits all" policy restricting the Compensation Committee's ability to provide for accelerated vesting and requiring executives to forfeit a portion of their equity awards would be in the best interests of the Company or its stockholders. As discussed more fully below, implementation of this policy would disrupt the alignment of interests between executives and stockholders, particularly in the context of a significant transaction resulting in a change in control of Sysco, unduly limit the Company's ability to attract, retain and incentivize talented executives and impose undue restrictions on the ability of the Compensation Committee to structure our executive compensation program.
Implementing the proposal would disrupt the alignment between executive and stockholder interests during a time of uncertainty.
For equity-based awards issued to date under Sysco's 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Board has provided for "double trigger" accelerated vesting, under which an executive's outstanding equity awards will only fully and immediately vest if (1) a change in control occurs and (2) the executive's employment is terminated by the Company or its subsidiaries without cause (or the executive terminates his or her employment for good reason) within the period commencing 1 year prior to the change in control and ending 2 years after the change in control.
The Board believes that the acceleration of awards in these circumstances appropriately aligns the interests of executives with the interests of stockholders in the context of a change in control transaction. A change in control creates uncertainty surrounding the plans of new ownership and whether, through loss of employment, executives will forfeit their ability to realize value from unvested equity awards. The risk of that loss
SYSCO CORPORATION - 2018 Proxy Statement    94
creates undesirable disincentives for the executives in connection with the consideration, negotiation and implementation of a change in control transaction. The Board believes that our current "double trigger" approach eliminates these disincentives by enabling our executives to remain objective, preserves executive morale and productivity and encourages retention in the face of the disruptive impact of an actual or rumored change in control of Sysco. Retaining key executives while a change in control transaction is pending can be particularly important, since the loss of such executives could adversely affect the Company's business or operations if the transaction is not completed.
Additionally, our Board believes that the retention of executives in the context of a change in control transaction would preserve the value of such transaction for our stockholders, as the prospect of losing valued executives in connection with a change in control could reduce the value of the Company to an acquirer and, consequently, reduce the amount current stockholders would realize in the transaction.
By assuring executives that they would realize the full value of their equity awards if their employment were terminated in connection with a change in control, the current acceleration provisions ensure objective evaluation of change in control transactions, thereby maintaining the proper alignment of the interests of executives and stockholders.
Implementing the proposal would significantly limit Sysco's ability to attract, retain and incentivize talented executives.
The Board believes that it is critical for the Company to offer compensation and benefits that are competitive in the marketplace for talent. Based on recent surveys and studies, a substantial majority of companies fully vest outstanding equity awards upon a termination following a change in control, including many of the companies with which we compete for executive talent. As a result, implementing the policy as outlined in the proposal would place the Company at a competitive disadvantage and significantly jeopardize the objective of our executive compensation program to attract, retain, reward and incentivize exceptional, talented executives who will lead the Company in the successful execution of its strategy, particularly if a change in control transaction were pending or contemplated.
The proponent of this proposal references companies that place limitations on accelerated vesting of unearned equity. The companies referenced are among the largest in the world by market capitalization. Due to their size, it is very unlikely that any of these companies will undergo a change in control. As such, executives and potential executives do not view equity acceleration provisions for these mega-capitalization companies in the same manner as they do for all other companies.
Implementing the proposal would impose undue restrictions on the ability of the Compensation Committee to structure executive compensation.
Our Board believes that the interests of our stockholders are best served by recognizing that the Compensation Committee, comprised of six independent, annually elected directors, is in the best position to determine the terms of our executive compensation arrangements. The Board believes that the Compensation Committee should continue to retain the flexibility to design and administer competitive compensation programs that reflect market conditions. Permitting the Compensation Committee to accelerate vesting of equity awards in accordance with our "double trigger" provision can incentivize management to maximize stockholder value, further aligning the interests of management with our stockholders. Conversely, adopting the rigid policy advanced by the proponent would frustrate the purpose of the Compensation Committee and interfere with the objective of our compensation program.
Stockholders have demonstrated their support for our executive compensation program and compensation governance practices.
Our executive compensation program is designed to link executive pay with the interests of our stockholders. Sysco has a robust stockholder engagement program and the Board incorporates stockholder feedback into its decision-making processes. During these conversations, stockholders have indicated their support for our executive compensation program and compensation governance practices. Furthermore, Sysco has consistently received strong support for its executive compensation program in the annual, advisory "say on pay" vote, with 96.5% approval at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, and substantially similar proposals presented at the Company's two most recent annual meetings were rejected by our stockholders.
Required Vote
The votes cast for this proposal must exceed the votes cast against it in order for it to be approved. Accordingly abstentions and broker non-votes will not be relevant to the outcome.
For the reasons described above, the Board unanimously recommends that you vote "AGAINST" this proposal, and, if the proposal is properly presented at the meeting, your proxy will be voted AGAINST the proposal unless you specify otherwise.
