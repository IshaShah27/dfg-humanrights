[END TABLE]
This proxy statement is furnished to holders of common stock of Malvern Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company" or "Malvern Bancorp"), the holding company of Malvern Bank, National Association ("Malvern Bank" or the "Bank"). Our Board of Directors is soliciting proxies to be used at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held at the General Warren, located at 9 Old Lancaster Rd, Malvern, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday, February 26, 2019 at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Time, and any adjournment thereof, for the purposes set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders. This proxy statement is first being mailed to shareholders on or about January 22, 2019. 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Shareholders Meeting to Be Held on February 26, 2019. This proxy statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 as well as driving directions to the annual meeting are available at http://www.proxyvote.com and on our website at http://ir.malvernbancorp.com. 
What is the purpose of the annual meeting? 
At our annual meeting, shareholders will act upon the matters outlined in the Notice of Annual Meeting, consisting of the election of directors, a non-binding resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, an advisory vote on the frequency of the non-binding resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers and the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. 
Who is entitled to vote? 
Only Malvern Bancorp shareholders of record as of the close of business on the record date for the meeting, January 11, 2019, are entitled to vote at the meeting. On the record date, we had 7,774,594 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and no other class of equity securities outstanding. For each issued and outstanding share of common stock you own on the record date, you will be entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted on at the meeting, in person or by proxy. 
How do I submit my proxy?

Have your proxy card in hand when you access the web site and follow the instructions to obtain your records and to create an electronic voting instruction form.

-1- 
VOTE BY MAIL 
Mark, sign and date your proxy card and return it in the postage-paid envelope we have provided or return it to Vote Processing, c/o Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. 
If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, could my broker automatically vote my shares for me? 
Your broker may not vote on the election of directors, the non-binding proposal on compensation of our named executive officers or the advisory vote on the frequency of the non-binding votes to approve the compensation of our named executive officers unless you provide your broker with instructions on how to vote. You should use the voting instruction card provided by the institution that holds your shares to instruct your broker to vote your shares or else your shares will be considered "broker non-votes." 
Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers or nominees as to which voting instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or the persons entitled to vote those shares and the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power under rules applicable to broker-dealers. Under these rules, the proposal to elect directors, the non-binding proposal to approve the compensation of our named executive officers and the advisory vote on the frequency of the non-binding proposal to approve the compensation of our named executive officers are not items on which brokerage firms may vote in their discretion on behalf of their clients if such clients have not furnished voting instructions within ten days of the annual meeting. 
Your broker may vote in his or her discretion on the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm if you do not furnish instructions. 
Can I attend the meeting and vote my shares in person? 
All shareholders are invited to attend the annual meeting. Shareholders of record can vote in person at the annual meeting. If your shares are held in street name, then you are not the shareholder of record and you must ask your broker or other nominee how you can vote at the annual meeting. 
Can I change my vote after I return my proxy card? 
Yes. If you are a shareholder of record, there are three ways you can change your vote or revoke your proxy after you have sent in your proxy form. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• First, you may send a written notice to our Corporate Secretary, Mr. Joseph D. Gangemi, Malvern  Bancorp, Inc., 42 East Lancaster Avenue, Paoli, Pennsylvania 19301, in advance of the meeting stating that you would like to revoke your proxy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Second, you may complete and submit a new proxy card before the annual meeting. Any earlier proxies will be  revoked automatically.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Third, you may attend the annual meeting and vote in person. Any earlier proxy will be  revoked. However, attending the annual meeting without voting in person will not revoke your proxy.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in "street name" and you have instructed a broker or other nominee to vote your shares, you must follow directions from your broker or other nominee to change your vote. 
What constitutes a quorum? 
The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares that are entitled to vote on a particular matter will constitute a quorum. Proxies received but marked as abstentions and broker non-votes will be included in the calculation of the number of votes considered to be present at the meeting. 
-2- 
What are the Board of Directors' recommendations? 
The recommendations of the Board of Directors are set forth under the description of each proposal in this proxy statement. In sum, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the Board's nominees for director described herein, FOR Proposal 2 (the non-binding resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers), FOR Proposal 4 (the ratification of the appointment of Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP ("Baker Tilly") to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019) and, with respect to Proposal 3 (the advisory vote on how often the Company will conduct an advisory vote on executive compensation), FOR an annual vote on executive compensation. 
The proxy solicited hereby, if properly signed and returned to us and not revoked prior to its use, will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If no contrary instructions are given, each proxy signed and received will be voted in the manner recommended by the Board of Directors and, upon the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, in accordance with the best judgment of the persons appointed as proxies. Proxies solicited hereby may be exercised only at the 2019 annual meeting and any adjournment of the annual meeting and will not be used for any other meeting. 
What vote is required to approve each item? 
The election of directors will be determined by a majority of votes cast by shareholders at the annual meeting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal is required to approve the non-binding resolution approving the compensation of our named executive officers and to ratify the appointment of Baker Tilly for fiscal 2019. The vote on Proposal 3 (the advisory vote on the frequency of the non-binding votes on executive compensation) has three possible substantive responses (every year, every two years or every three years), and the response that receives the highest number of votes cast will be the frequency of the vote on the compensation of our named executive officers that has been approved by the shareholders on an advisory basis. Under the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, abstentions and broker "non-votes" are not counted as votes cast.

Our Bylaws provide that our Board will consist of not less than five nor more than fifteen members, as determined from time to time by resolution of the Board. Our Board has set the number of directors, effective as of the 2019 annual meeting, at eight. All of the members of our current Board will stand for re-election this year for a one year term. 
Our Board of Directors has nominated the following eight individuals for election at the 2019 annual meeting, to serve for a one-year term and until their successors are elected and qualified: Howard Kent, Therese Woodman, Julia D. Corelli, Norman Feinstein, Andrew Fish, Cynthia Leitzell, Stephen Scartozzi and Anthony C. Weagley. 
No director or nominee for director is related to any other director or executive officer by blood, marriage or adoption. Shareholders are not permitted to use cumulative voting for the election of directors. Our Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. Kent, Feinstein, Fish, Scartozzi, Mrs. Julia D. Corelli, Mrs. Woodman and Mrs. Leitzell are independent directors, as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards. 
Under our current Bylaws, nominees for director will be elected by a majority of votes cast by shareholders at the 2019 annual meeting. If a nominee for director does not receive at least a majority of the votes cast at the 
-3- 
 2019 annual meeting, he or she is required to tender his or her resignation to the Board, and the Board, after considering the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, will thereafter consider whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. 
Unless otherwise directed, each proxy signed and returned by a shareholder will be voted for the election of the nominees for director as described herein. If any person named as a nominee should be unable or unwilling to stand for election at the time of the 2019 annual meeting, the proxies will nominate and vote for any replacement nominee or nominees recommended by our Board of Directors. At this time, the Board of Directors knows of no reason why any of the nominees named herein may not be able to serve as a director if elected. 
The following tables present information concerning the nominees for director. All nominees listed below are being nominated for a one-year term expiring at the 2020 annual meeting.  
Ages are reflected as of September 30, 2018. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the election of the nominees named in this proxy statement for director.

Director Nominations 
Nominations for director of Malvern Bancorp are made by the full Board of Directors. The Board of Directors considers the recommendations of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in selecting nominees for director. All of our directors participate in the consideration of director nominees and will consider candidates for director suggested by other directors, as well as our management and shareholders. A shareholder who desires to recommend a prospective nominee for the Board should notify our Secretary in writing with whatever supporting material the shareholder considers appropriate. Any shareholder wishing to make a nomination must follow our procedures for shareholder nominations, which are described under "Shareholder Proposals, Nominations and Communications with the Board of Directors." 
The charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee sets forth certain criteria the committee may consider when recommending individuals for nomination as a director including: (a) ensuring 
-6- 
 that the Board of Directors, as a whole, is diverse and consists of individuals with various and relevant career experience, relevant technical skills, industry knowledge and experience, financial expertise (including expertise that could qualify a director as a "financial expert," as that term is defined by the rules of the SEC), local or community ties and (b) minimum individual qualifications, including strength of character, mature judgment, familiarity with our business and industry, independence of thought and an ability to work collegially. The committee also may consider the extent to which the candidate would fill a present need on the Board of Directors. 
Committees and Meetings of the Board of Directors 
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Board of Directors of Malvern Bancorp met 19 times. No director of Malvern Bancorp attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of the total number of Board meetings held during the period for which he or she has been a director and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which he or she served during the periods that he or she served. 
Membership on Certain Board Committees. The Board of Directors of Malvern Bancorp has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The membership of the committees set forth in the following paragraphs is as of the date of this proxy statement. 
Audit Committee. The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee consisting of Mrs. Leitzell (Chair), Mr. Scartozzi, Mrs. Corelli and Mrs. Woodman. The Audit Committee reviews with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the systems of internal control, reviews the annual financial statements, including the Form 10-K, and monitors Malvern Bancorp's adherence in accounting and financial reporting to generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit Committee is comprised of four directors who are independent directors as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board of Directors has determined that Mrs. Leitzell meets the qualifications established for an audit committee financial expert in the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee met 7 times in fiscal 2018. The Audit Committee charter as presently in effect is available on the Company's website, http://ir.malvernbancorp.com. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. It is the responsibility of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to, among other functions, recommend nominees for the consideration of the Board of Directors in selecting nominees for election at the annual meeting. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consists of Mrs. Woodman (Chair), Mr. Kent and Mrs. Leitzell. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met one time in fiscal 2018. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members are independent directors, as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards. The committee's charter is available on our website at http://ir.malvernbancorp.com. 
Compensation Committee. It is the responsibility of the Compensation Committee to set the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer as well as the other named executive officers. The Compensation Committee consists of Messrs. Kent (Chair), Feinstein, Mrs. Corelli and Mrs. Leitzell. The Compensation Committee met three times in fiscal 2018. Each of the members of the Compensation Committee is an independent director as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards. The committee's charter is available on our website at http://ir.malvernbancorp.com. 
Board Leadership Structure and the Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Anthony C. Weagley serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer, Howard Kent serves as Chairman of the Board and Therese Woodman serves as Vice Chair of the Board. The Board of Directors has determined that separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board and President enhances Board independence and oversight. Further, the separation of the Chairman of the Board permits the President and Chief Executive Officer to better focus on his responsibilities of managing the daily operations of Malvern Bancorp, enhancing 
-7- 
 shareholder value and expanding and strengthening our franchise while allowing the Chairman to lead the Board of Directors in its fundamental role of providing independent oversight and advice to management. Mr. Kent is an independent director under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
Risk is inherent with every business, particularly financial institutions. We face a number of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, strategic risk and reputational risk. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks Malvern Bancorp encounters, while the Board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, the Board of Directors has the responsibility to ensure that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. The Board of Directors receives reports on this topic from executive management, other officers of the Company and the Chairpersons of the Audit, ERM/ALCO and Compliance Committees. The Chairman of the Board and independent directors work together to provide strong, independent oversight of Malvern Bancorp's management and affairs through its committees and meetings of independent directors. The Company believes that its Board leadership structure supports this approach to risk management. 
Directors' Attendance at Annual Meetings 
Directors are expected to attend the annual meeting of shareholders absent a valid reason for not doing so. All of our directors attended our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. 
Directors' Compensation 
We do not pay separate compensation to directors for their service on the Board of Directors of Malvern Bancorp. Fees are paid to directors by the Bank only. Each of our directors, other than Mr. Weagley, receives an annual retainer of $25,000. The Bank's Chairman of the Board currently receives an additional annual retainer of $10,000 and the Vice Chair receives an additional annual retainer of $7,500. Our directors, except for our President and Chief Executive Officer, currently receive a fee of $960 for attending regularly scheduled monthly Board meetings of the Bank and for special meetings of the Board beginning with the fourth special Board meeting. The Chair of the Audit Committee and Loan Committee receives an additional retainer of $7,500 per year. Board members receive a fee of $300 for attending committee meetings, except for members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, Mr. Weagley will receive an annual base salary at the rate of $480,816 per year, plus additional annual base compensation of $106,000, of which $37,100 will be paid in cash (as part of the regular payroll process) and the remaining $68,900 will be paid in shares of the Company's common stock. Such amounts, which are collectively referred to as "Annual Base Salary" in the Employment Agreement, may be increased by the Boards of the Company and the Bank. Beginning with April 1, 2019, the stock component will be paid on April 1 of each year, or the next business day thereafter, and the number of 
-12- 
 shares will equal the quotient determined by dividing the stock component amount by the average of the daily closing sales prices of the Company's common stock for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the stock payment date.

He will also be entitled to participate in other employee benefit plans maintained for executives of the Bank. 
If Mr. Weagley's employment is terminated by the Company or the Bank without "Cause" (as defined in the Employment Agreement) (other than for death or disability) or if the Company or the Bank terminate the Employment Agreement by delivering a non-renewal notice, in either case occurring after a "Change in Control" (as defined in the Employment Agreement), or if Mr. Weagley terminates his employment for "Good Reason" (as defined in the Employment Agreement) after a Change in Control, he will be entitled to receive, after signing a release, a lump sum cash payment equal to three years of his Annual Base Salary, in addition to any amounts he has already earned as of the date of termination, and any vesting restrictions on any grants of equity that have been made to him will be waived. 
Upon termination by the Company or the Bank without Cause (other than for death or disability) of if the Company or the Bank terminate the Employment Agreement by delivering a non-renewal notice, in either case occurring absent a Change in Control, or if Mr. Weagley terminates his employment for Good Reason absent a Change in Control, he will be entitled to receive, after signing a release, a lump sum cash payment equal to three years of his Annual Base Salary. 
Mr. Weagley's Employment Agreement also provides that he will be entitled to reimbursement of the premium otherwise payable for COBRA continuation coverage for the 18 months immediately following the date of termination of employment. 
The Employment Agreement contains 12 month post-termination non-compete, non-solicitation of customers and non-solicitation of employees provisions. 
Mr. Gangemi 
On May 23, 2016, the Bank entered into a Change of Control Agreement (a "Change of Control Agreement") with Joseph Gangemi, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and the Bank. 
The Change of Control Agreement provides that if the executive's employment with the Bank ceases within 12 months following the date of a Change of Control (as defined), or during the 90 days immediately preceding a Change of Control, as a result of termination by the Bank without Cause (as defined) or for Good Reason (as defined), then Mr. Gangemi will be entitled to receive any base salary that remains unpaid through the date of termination, any bonus that remains unpaid and which is payable with respect to a fiscal year which ended prior to the effective date of termination, and any expense reimbursement which is due and remains unpaid, plus a lump sum cash payment equal to 100% of the executive's base salary as in effect on the date of termination. 
In addition, if Mr. Gangemi elects to receive continuation coverage under the Bank's group health plan under COBRA, each Change of Control Agreement provides that he will be entitled to reimbursement of the premium otherwise payable for COBRA continuation coverage for the 12 months immediately following the date of termination of employment, to the extent such premium exceeds the monthly amount charged to active similarly-situated employees of the Bank for the same coverage. 
The Change of Control Agreement provides that it is in lieu of, and not in addition to, any other severance plan, fund, agreement or other arrangement maintained by the Bank. Payment of the lump sum cash amounts and 
-13- 
 reimbursement for COBRA premiums described above are conditioned on Mr. Gangemi's execution and delivery of a release. 
In addition, the Change of Control Agreement provides that the amounts and benefits payable to Mr. Gangemi in the circumstances described above will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid causing any of the payments or benefits to be nondeductible under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, unless the executive's after-tax amounts and benefits would be greater without such a reduction. 
On May 25, 2017, Mr. Gangemi and the Bank entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to Mr. Gangemi's Change in Control Agreement. The Amendment increases the severance amount under the change of Control Agreement from 100% of Mr. Gangemi's base salary to 150% of his base salary. 
In exchange for the increase in the severance amount, Mr. Gangemi entered into a Non-Competition,Non-Solicitation, Confidentiality and Cooperation Agreement (the "Restrictive Covenants Agreement") with the Bank, also dated May 25, 2017. Mr. Gangemi's Restrictive Covenants Agreement provides that during the course of his employment with the Bank and for a period of 12 months after his termination of employment with the Bank for any reason (the "Restricted Period"), Mr. Gangemi will not, directly or indirectly, engage, participate or invest in any Competing Business (as defined) in the Competitive Territory (as defined). "Competing Business" is defined as any business engaged in banking or lending activities, or accepting deposits, providing financial services or financial advice, or any other activities in which the Company or the Bank engaged during Mr. Gangemi's employment with the Bank. "Competitive Territory" is defined as any area that is within a 100 mile radius of any branch or office of the Company or the Bank or any of their affiliates that is or was in existence during Mr. Gangemi's employment or any location where the Company, the Bank or any of their respective affiliates had planned to establish a branch or office during the 12 months prior to Mr. Gangemi's termination of employment. The Restrictive Covenants Agreement also contains provisions prohibiting the solicitation of employees and customers of the Company or the Bank or any of their respective affiliates. 
Mr. Boylan 
On May 25, 2017, the Company, the Bank and William J. Boylan entered into an employment agreement (the "Boylan Employment Agreement"), which provides that Mr. Boylan will serve as Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer of the Company and the Bank. The initial term of the Boylan Employment Agreement will expire on May 26, 2019, and the employment period will be deemed to be automatically extended for successive one year periods thereafter, unless at least 60 calendar days prior to the expiration of the initial or any extended term, the Company or the Bank shall give written notice to Mr. Boylan, or Mr. Boylan shall give written notice to the Company or the Bank, of its or his intention not to renew the employment period. 
The Boylan Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Boylan's compensation will include a base salary of $235,000 per annum, subject to review and increase by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") or the Board of Directors of the Bank (the "Bank Board"). Mr. Boylan will also be eligible for such annual bonus as the Company Board or the Bank Board, or an applicable committee thereof, determines in its sole discretion to be appropriate based upon achievement of such performance goals or other factors as such Company Board or Bank Board or committee deems appropriate. 
If Mr. Boylan's employment is terminated by the Company or the Bank without cause (other than due to death or disability) or if the Company or the Bank terminate the Boylan Employment Agreement pursuant to a non-renewal notice, in each case on or after a Change in Control (as defined), or if Mr. Boylan's employment is terminated by him for Good Reason (as defined) on or after a Change in Control, Mr. Boylan will be entitled to receive all unpaid salary and accrued benefits to the termination date, plus, subject to his execution of a mutually satisfactory release, a lump sum cash payment equal to any unpaid annual bonus earned and owed to him for a previous calendar year and any amounts earned by him but unpaid under the Bank's Lender Incentive Plan, plus 
-14- 
 24 months' of his base salary. In addition, Mr. Boylan would become fully vested in all equity-based options and other awards, and he would be entitled to reimbursement for COBRA premiums paid by him for up to 18 months immediately following termination. 
If Mr. Boylan's employment is terminated by the Company or the Bank without Cause (as defined), other than due to death or disability, or if the Company or the Bank terminate the Boylan Employment Agreement pursuant to a non-renewal notice, in each case before a Change in Control, or if Mr. Boylan's employment is terminated by him for Good Reason before a Change in Control, he will be entitled to receive all unpaid salary and accrued benefits to the termination date, plus, subject to his execution of a mutually satisfactory release, his then annual rate of base salary for twelve months, as severance. He would also be entitled to reimbursement for COBRA premiums for up to six months. 
If Mr. Boylan's employment is terminated at any time for Cause or if he resigns without Good Reason, he will be entitled to receive only unpaid salary and accrued benefits to the termination date. 
In connection with executing the Boylan Employment Agreement, Mr. Boylan executed a Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation, Confidentiality and Cooperation Agreement which is comparable to Mr. Gangemi's Restrictive Covenants Agreement.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of Malvern Bancorp's common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by regulation to furnish Malvern Bancorp with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. We know of no person who owns 10% or more of our common stock. 
Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms furnished to us, or written representations from our officers and directors, we believe that all such Section 16(a) reports were timely filed with respect to the fiscal

The SEC's proxy rules require that not less frequently than once every three years, a proxy statement for an annual meeting of shareholders for which the proxy solicitation rules of the SEC require compensation disclosure must also include a separate resolution subject to shareholder vote to approve the compensation of the company's named executive officers disclosed in the proxy statement. The Company's Board of Directors previously determined to submit the non-binding resolution on compensation of our named executive officers to our shareholders on an annual basis. 
The executive officers named in the summary compensation table and deemed to be "named executive officers" are Messrs. Weagley, Gangemi and Boylan. Reference is made to the summary compensation table and disclosures set forth under "Executive Compensation" in this proxy statement. 
The proposal gives shareholders the ability to vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers through the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that the shareholders approve the compensation of the named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement." 
The shareholder vote on this proposal is not binding on Malvern Bancorp or the Board of Directors and cannot be construed as overruling any decision made by the Board of Directors. However, the Board of Directors of Malvern Bancorp will review the voting results on the non-binding resolution and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE NON-BINDING RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

Shareholders of public companies are required to vote, every six years, on an advisory basis, on how often the Company should include in its proxy materials the advisory vote on executive compensation. Shareholders are being asked to indicate, on an advisory basis, how often advisory votes on executive compensation shall be held. The choices available on the attached proxy card, in accordance with SEC rules, are every one year, every two years, every three years, or to abstain. 
The Board has been conducting advisory annual votes on executive compensation, and recommends that shareholders support a frequency of every one year for future non-binding resolutions on compensation of the Company's named executive officers. 
Proposal 3 is advisory, and non-binding on our Board. The Board intends to continue to conduct annual advisory votes on executive compensation, although it will review and consider the results of this vote when determining how frequently future advisory votes on executive compensation will be held.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Malvern Bancorp has appointed Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP ("Baker Tilly"), independent registered public accounting firm, to perform the audit of the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and further directed that the selection of auditors be submitted for ratification by the shareholders at the annual meeting. Baker Tilly audited the Company's fiscal 2018 financial statements. Representatives of Baker Tilly are expected to attend the annual meeting, will be afforded the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
As previously reported, on July 9, 2018, Malvern Bancorp dismissed BDO USA, LLP ("BDO") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, effective on such date. The decision to dismiss BDO was approved by the Audit Committee. 
BDO's reports on the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 did not contain an adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, modification or qualification, except that BDO issued adverse audit reports on the effectiveness of the Company's Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in its Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm as of September 30, 2017 and as of September 30, 2016 due to a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 as disclosed in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2017 filed on December 29, 2017 and Form 10-K/A for the year ended September 30, 2016 filed on December 18, 2017, respectively. 
During the Company's two most recent fiscal years and through the date of BDO's dismissal, the Company and BDO had two "disagreements" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of the SEC's Regulation S-K and the related instructions), related to management's conclusions with respect to the material nature of errors in the Company's income tax account balances and the related impact on the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. While the Company's management and BDO agreed that there was a tax misstatement in the Company's consolidated financial statements for certain stated reporting periods, BDO disagreed with management's conclusions with respect to the material nature of the error and the related impact on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. As the Company has previously disclosed in its periodic reports filed with the SEC, on November 21, 2017, the Company was advised by BDO that BDO had concluded that a material weakness in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting existed, and that BDO's report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 in Item 9A of the Company's fiscal 2016 10-K that the Company' internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2016, should no longer be relied upon. BDO also informed the Company at that time that BDO's audit report on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and for each of the years in the two year period ended September 30, 2016, and BDO's completed interim reviews of the Company's consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the periods ended December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 (collectively, the "Specified Financial Statements"), should no longer be relied upon. The Company restated the Specified Financial Statements, which were included in amendments to the Company's fiscal 2016 10-K and 10-Qs for the first three quarters of fiscal 2017 that the Company filed with the SEC. As stated above, these matters related to the Company's income tax account balances, and had no effect on the Company's cash position, net interest margin, pre-tax income or operating expenses. As a result of the foregoing, management determined that its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2017 was not effective, and BDO agreed. 
-20- 
The Audit Committee discussed the matters described above with BDO. The Company has authorized BDO to respond fully to the inquiries of the Company's successor accountant concerning the subject matter of the disagreement described above. 
Other than as described above, there were no "disagreements" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of the SEC's Regulation S-K and the related instructions) between the Company and BDO or "reportable events" (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of the SEC's Regulation S-K) during the Company's two most recent fiscal years and through the date of BDO's dismissal. 
On July 9, 2018, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of Baker Tilly as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm effective as of July 9, 2018. During the Company's two most recent fiscal years and through the date of this proxy statement, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted with Baker Tilly with respect to: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to the Company nor oral advice was provided to the Company that Baker Tilly concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a reportable event (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
We have been advised by Baker Tilly that neither that firm nor any of its associates has any relationship with Malvern Bancorp or its subsidiaries other than the usual relationship that exists between an independent registered public accounting firm and its clients. 
Audit Fees 
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees paid by us to (i) Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, for professional services rendered by them in connection with the audit of Malvern Bancorp's consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2018 and (ii) BDO, for professional services rendered by them in connection with the audit of Malvern Bancorp's consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2017, respectively as well as the fees paid by us to Baker Tilly and BDO for audit-related services, tax services and all other services rendered by each of them to us during fiscal 2018 (with respect to Baker Tilly) and 2017 (with respect to BDO).

The Audit Committee selects our independent registered public accounting firm and pre-approves all audit services to be provided by it to Malvern Bancorp. The Audit Committee also reviews and pre-approves all audit-

 related and non-audit related services rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with the Audit Committee's charter. In its review of these services and related fees and terms, the Audit Committee considers, among other things, the possible effect of the performance of such services on the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee pre-approves certain audit-related services and certain non-audit related tax services which are specifically described by the Audit Committee on an annual basis and separately approves other individual engagements as necessary. 
Each new engagement of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm was approved in advance by the Audit Committee or its Chair, and none of those engagements made use of the de minimis exception to pre-approval contained in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.
