Letter from the Board of Directors to Our Shareholders 
The Board values this opportunity to share our perspectives regarding the work we undertook for our shareholders during 2018. Our objective is to guide and oversee management in the creation of long-term value through the execution of a sound business strategy, thoughtful succession planning, a commitment to corporate ethics, careful risk oversight, prudent risk management, talent development, and creating societal impact. In pursuit of these objectives, we are pleased to share with you an overview of the Board's priorities and actions during the year. 
BUSINESS STRATEGY 
We believe that an optimal and effective board of directors is informed, active and constructively engaged with management, without undue disruption to the day-to-day business of the Company. Our Board meets regularly to discuss Prudential's strategic direction. Our collective skills and experience in the areas of regulation, business operations, risk management and capital markets, among other areas, enable us to provide critical insights to the Company to help maximize shareholder value. At each Board meeting and during our annual strategy planning session, we engage with Prudential's senior leadership in robust discussions about the Company's overall strategy, priorities for its businesses, and long-term growth opportunities. 
SUCCESSION PLANNING 
The Board collaborates with our executive team to cultivate a deep talent bench and plan for senior leadership succession. In 2018, as part of our succession plan, we made changes among the Company's most visible leadership roles. The appointments of Charlie Lowrey to succeed John Strangfeld as Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Rob Falzon to succeed Mark Grier as Vice Chairman, are the culmination of a multiyear, rigorous succession-planning effort by the Board. This structure is modeled in part after the roles John and Mark established working together over the past decade. We are grateful to John and Mark for their leadership and the contributions both have made to Prudential. John will be leaving the Board on April 5, 2019, and Mark is expected to retire from the Company and leave the Board in August 2019. At that time, Rob Falzon will join the Board. 
CULTIVATING A STRONG ETHICAL CULTURE 
Our Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee has direct oversight for the Company's overall ethical culture and human rights policy. The Board collaborates with management to establish and communicate the right ethical tone which guides our conduct and helps protect the Company's reputation. We know that only by doing business the right way, every day, do we continue to earn our investors' and customers' trust. Our commitment to strong ethical values and doing business the right way is reflected in Ethisphere Institute's naming of Prudential as a 2019 World's Most Ethical Company®. This recognition is bestowed only on organizations that demonstrate a culture of ethics and transparency at every level. 
BOARD RISK OVERSIGHT 
The Board sets standards for managing risk and monitoring the management of those risks within the Company. The Risk Committee is comprised of the chairs of each Board committee, which recognizes the vital role of each committee in risk oversight and enables the directors to more closely coordinate the Board's risk oversight function. The Risk Committee has metrics in place to monitor and review market, insurance, investment, and operational risk. We regularly review the Company's risk profile, including its approach to capital management, its operational footprint, and its investment risks and strategies. The Board considers the breadth of the Company's risk management framework when approving its strategy and risk tolerance, and verifies that strategic plans are commensurate with our ability to identify and manage risk. 
TALENT DEVELOPMENT 
The diversity of experiences, backgrounds and ideas of Prudential's global employees enables us to develop solutions that address the financial needs of our customers. Therefore, recruiting, developing and retaining top diverse industry talent is a key

 priority for the Company. Talent development is discussed at every Board meeting, and once per year, the Board devotes time to discuss talent at each business and functional leadership level across the Company. This engagement gives us rich insight into the Company's pool of talent and its succession plans. 
CREATING POSITIVE SOCIETAL IMPACT 
Prudential was founded on the belief that financial security should be attainable by everyone. Delivering business results and creating societal impact has guided our business model for more than 140 years. By leveraging the full breadth of Prudential's business capabilities, the Company harnesses the power of the capital markets to promote economic opportunity and sustainable growth. To make sure the Company is delivering on its promise of inclusion, the Company has a Corporate Social Responsibility Oversight Committee. The Committee meets three times per year and is comprised of Board members and Prudential senior executives. 
ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH 
As a Board, one of our priorities is listening to and considering the views of our shareholders as we make decisions in the Boardroom. We accomplish this through a robust outreach and engagement program. In 2018, we spoke to investors who represent a majority of our outstanding shares. Topics discussed included Prudential's sustainability and social strategy, Board composition and refreshment, Board leadership structure, succession planning, and our executive compensation program.

[END TABLE]
Item 1–Election of Directors 
Our Board of Directors has nominated 13 directors for election at this Annual Meeting to hold office until the next annual meeting and the election of their successors. All of the nominees are currently directors, except Robert M. Falzon, whose term as a director will commence upon the retirement of Mark B. Grier in August 2019. Each agreed to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected. All of the nominees are expected to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. All directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
We have no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling for good cause to serve if elected. However, if any nominee should become unable for any reason or unwilling for good cause to serve, proxies may be voted for another person nominated as a substitute by the Board, or the Board may reduce the number of directors. 
Director Criteria, Qualifications, Experience and Tenure 
Prudential Financial is a financial services company that offers a variety of products and services, including life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual funds, and investment management. The Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee performs an assessment of the skills and the experience needed to properly oversee the interests of the Company. Generally, the Committee reviews both the short- and long-term strategies of the Company to determine what current and future skills and experience are required of the Board in exercising its oversight function and in the context of the Company's strategic priorities. The Committee then compares those skills to the skills of the current directors and potential director candidates. The Committee conducts targeted efforts to identify and recruit individuals who have the qualifications identified through this process, keeping in mind its commitment to diversity. 
BOARD HIGHLIGHTS 
BOARD DIVERSITY 
While the Company does not have a formal policy on Board diversity,  our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices place great  emphasis on diversity, and the Committee actively considers diversity  in recruitment and nominations of directors and assesses its  effectiveness in this regard when reviewing the composition of the  Board. The current composition of our Board reflects those efforts and  the importance of diversity to the Board.

Corporate Governance 
The Company is committed to good corporate governance, which helps us compete more effectively, sustain our success and build long-term shareholder value. The Company is governed by a Board of Directors and committees of the Board that meet throughout the year. Directors discharge their responsibilities at Board and committee meetings through ongoing communication with each other and with management throughout the year. 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Principles and Practices to provide a framework for the effective governance of the Company. The Corporate Governance Principles and Practices are reviewed regularly and updated as appropriate. The full text of the Corporate Governance Principles and Practices, which includes the definition of independence adopted by the Board, the charters of the Corporate Governance and Business Ethics, Compensation and Audit Committees, the Lead Independent Director Charter, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the Related Party Transaction Approval Policy can be found at www.prudential.com/governance. Copies of these documents also may be obtained from the Chief Governance Officer and Corporate Secretary. 
Governance is a continuing focus at the Company, starting with the Board and extending to management and all employees. Therefore, the Board reviews the Company's policies and business strategies and advises and counsels the CEO and the other executive officers who manage the Company's businesses, including actively overseeing and reviewing, on at least an annual basis, the Company's strategic plans. 
In addition, we solicit feedback from shareholders on corporate governance and executive compensation practices and engage in discussions with various groups and individuals on these matters. 
Process for Selecting Directors 
The Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee screens and recommends candidates for nomination by the full Board. The Company's By-laws provide that the size of the Board may range from 10 to 15 members, reflecting the Board's current view of its optimal size. The Committee is assisted with its recruitment efforts by an independent third-party search firm, which recommends candidates that satisfy the Board's criteria. The search firm also provides research and pertinent information regarding candidates, as requested.

The Board conducted an annual review and affirmatively determined that all of the non-employee directors (Mses. Hund-Mejean, Pianalto and Poon, and Messrs. Baltimore, Casellas, Krapek, Lighte, Paz, Scovanner and Todman) are "independent" as that term is defined in the listing standards of the NYSE and in Prudential's Corporate Governance Principles and Practices. 
Independent Director Meetings 
The independent directors generally meet in an executive session at both the beginning and the end of each regularly scheduled Board meeting, with the Lead Independent Director serving as Chair. 
 COMPREHENSIVE STEPS TO ACHIEVE BOARD EFFECTIVENESS The Board is committed to a rigorous self-evaluation process. Through evaluation, directors review the Board's performance, including areas where the Board feels it functions effectively, and importantly, areas where the Board believes it can improve. 1. Process is Initiated Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee Chair initiates the annual board evaluation process with the help of an independent third-party consultant and our Capitalize Chief Governance officer. 2. Evaluation The evaluation solicits each director's opinion regarding the Board's effectiveness in monitoring and reviewing topics such as The strategic planning process The annual budget process and financial performance Management compensation, performance and ethics Risk strategy and management Succession planning 3. Feedback Analysis Directors are encouraged to speak to the independent third party with specific feedback on individual directors, committees or the Board in general. The independent third party synthesizes the results and comments and may have oral interviews with directors regarding the full Board or any committee on which the director serves. 4. Presentation of Findings In early 2019, the Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Chair, in conjunction with the third party consultant, presents the findings to each Committee, followed by review of the full Board. 5. Follow up Results requiring additional consideration are addressed at subsequent board and committee meetings and reported back to full Board, where appropriate. The Board followed-up on its 2018 self-evaluation by reviewing materials about the competitive and regulatory environment as well as discussing talent at almost every scheduled Board meeting. For 2019, the Board has asked for more information in the following areas: Strategic Planning Technological Trends and Developments Competitive Environment and Industry and Evolving Markets

Board Leadership 
Currently, our Board leadership structure consists of a Lead Independent Director, and until April 5, 2019, a Non-Executive Chairman (who is our former CEO) as well as strong committee chairs. As previously announced, Mr. Lowrey, our CEO, will become Chairman on April 5, 2019. The Board believes that our structure provides independent Board leadership and engagement while providing the benefit of having our CEO, the individual with primary responsibility for managing the Company's day-to-day operations, chair regular Board meetings as key business and strategic issues are discussed. 
The Board regularly reviews its leadership structure, and the Board thoroughly evaluated whether to continue to combine or to split the chair and CEO roles in the months leading up to the Company's recent CEO transition. After considering the perspectives of the independent directors, the views of our significant shareholders, voting results of recent independent chair proposals, academic research, practical experience at peer companies, and benchmarking and performance data, the Board determined that having the former CEO become Non-Executive Chairman, followed by Mr. Lowey as Chairman and CEO was in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board will continue to monitor the appropriateness of this structure. 
In 2018, independent directors and our Chief Governance Officer engaged with shareholders who hold a majority of our shares on their views on our Board leadership structure. Our Lead Independent Director and our chair of the Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee, as well as the full Board, also met with certain of our shareholders in 2018. The discussions and feedback from these meetings have been shared with the Board and will be considered during the Board's annual review of the appropriateness of its leadership structure. 
Under our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices, the independent directors annually elect a Chairman of the Board and, if the individual elected as Chairman of the Board is the CEO, they also elect an independent director to serve as Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director is generally expected to serve for a term of at least one year, but for no more than three years. Mr. Baltimore was elected as Lead Independent Director for his second term in May 2018. The responsibilities and authority of the Lead Independent Director include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Letter from the Lead Independent Director 
As Prudential's lead independent director, it is a privilege to share with you the Board's view on the Company's governance practices that we believe reflect our ongoing commitment to building long-term shareholder value. 
Succession Planning 
Succession planning is paramount to the Board's oversight and is a point of discussion and deliberation at every Board meeting. In September 2018, John Strangfeld announced his retirement ending his 11-year tenure as Prudential's CEO and Chairman. The Board was honored to announce the appointments of Charles Lowrey, former Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, International Businesses, to the role of Chief Executive Officer, and Robert Falzon, former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to the role of Vice Chairman, succeeding Mark Grier. 
These transitions are indicative of the depth and breadth of the firm's talent pool. Charlie and Rob are accomplished business leaders with significant related experience that will shape Prudential's strategic vision and long-term strategy. 
Board Effectiveness 
It is our goal to operate our Board in the most effective manner possible, and we believe a rigorous annual evaluation by an independent third party is an essential component of good governance practices. Every year, the Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee works with an experienced, third-party consultant to complement our internal evaluation efforts by introducing an objective perspective and knowledge of best practices. We believe this approach adds rigor to the process. 
Board Composition and Refreshment 
We believe strong governance begins with an independent, engaged and diverse board – 80% of our independent board members are diverse. With these guiding principles, the Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee screens and recommends Board candidates for nomination with the goal of evolving the composition of our Board in line with the strategic needs of our global customers. 
Using our skills matrix as a guide, individual conversations with directors, and the assistance of an independent search firm, the Committee identifies areas of expertise that would complement and enhance the current Board's skills and experience. Over the past several years, we have added five new Board members. 
Governance Policies and Practices 
We maintain strong governance practices which we believe are important to our shareholders and protect the long-term vitality of the Company. Our accountability to you is illustrated in our policies such as: proxy access, a strong Lead Independent Director role, the right of shareholders to call a special meeting, the annual director elections by majority vote, and a robust clawback policy. My board colleague, Douglas Scovanner, chair of the Audit Committee, and I address these topics in two short videos. You can access the videos from the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.prudential.com/directorvideos. We see these videos as an important component of our ongoing efforts to share information with shareholders. 
On behalf of our shareholders, your Board is committed to maintaining our diligence in overseeing the firm's performance, risk management, and investment in our people and communities. 
Sincerely, 
Thomas J. Baltimore

Why our Board Structure Is Right for Prudential and its Shareholders 
Prudential's Board leadership structure is reviewed by our Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee regularly. Upon John Strangfeld's retirement, the Board again gave careful deliberation to its structure and determined that a combined Chairman-CEO role continues to be in the best interest of our firm and shareholders. As independent directors, we believe the current structure promotes an effective Board that enables us to provide strategic guidance, challenge management's perspectives, and meet with relevant internal and external constituents important to the Company's operational and regulatory initiatives. 
The independent directors annually select an independent member to serve as the Lead Independent Director. As required by the Lead Independent Director Charter, the Lead Independent Director is precluded from serving longer than three consecutive years. 
Charles Lowrey, former executive vice president and chief operating officer of Prudential's International Businesses, was appointed CEO on December 1, 2018. He will be appointed Chairman on April 5, 2019. Charlie's successful leadership of the Company's asset management, U.S. and international businesses enables him to bring a broad perspective of Prudential's operations, a deep understanding of our people, and leadership skills that will serve the Company well as it continues to grow. 
The Board believes a Chairman-CEO structure provides Prudential with a clear and effective leadership role to communicate the Company's business and long-term strategy to its clients, shareholders and the public. The combination also provides for robust and frequent communication between the Board's independent directors and Company management. On behalf of our shareholders, the Board is committed to advancing our momentum in the market. This transition is the result of a thoughtful, phased and long-term approach to succession planning.

Board Risk Oversight 
The Board oversees the Company's risk profile and management's processes for assessing and managing risk, through both the whole Board and through its committees. At least annually, the Board reviews strategic risks and opportunities facing the Company and certain of its businesses. Other important categories of risk are assigned to designated Board committees that report back to the full Board. In general, the committees oversee the following risks: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Audit Committee: insurance risk and operational risks, including model risk, as well as  risks related to financial controls, legal, regulatory and compliance risks, and the overall risk management governance structure and risk management function;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation Committee: the design and operation of the Company's compensation  programs so that they do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee: the Company's overall ethical  culture, political contributions, lobbying expenses and overall political strategy, as well as the Company's environmental risk (which includes climate risk), sustainability and corporate social responsibility to minimize reputational risk and  focus on future sustainability;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Finance Committee: liquidity risk, risks involving our capital management, the  incurrence and repayment of borrowings, the capital structure of the enterprise, funding of benefit plans and statutory insurance reserves;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Investment Committee: investment risk, market risk and the strength of the investment  function; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Risk Committee: the governance of significant risks throughout the Company, the  establishment and ongoing monitoring of our risk profile, risk capacity and risk appetite, and coordination of the risk oversight functions of the other Board committees.  
[END TABLE]
In performing its oversight responsibilities, the Board and its committees review policies and guidelines that senior management uses to manage the Company's exposure to material categories of risk. As these issues sometimes overlap, Board committees hold joint meetings when appropriate and address certain issues at the full Board level. During 2018, the Risk Committee received an update from the Chief Risk Officer on the important strategic issues and risks facing the Company. In addition, the Board and committees review the performance and functioning of the Company's overall risk management function. 
The Risk Committee is comprised of the chairs of each of the other Board committees and Mark Grier, our Vice Chairman, who supervises the Chief Risk Officer of the Company. The principal activities of the Risk Committee are to: oversee the Company's assessment and reporting of material risks by reviewing the metrics used by management to quantify risk, applicable risk limit structures and risk mitigation strategies; review the Company's processes and procedures for risk assessment and risk management, including the related assumptions used across the Company's businesses and material risk types; and receive reports from management on material and emerging risk topics that are reviewed by the Company's internal management committees. 
The Company, under the Board's oversight, is organized to promote a strong risk awareness and management culture. The Chief Risk Officer sits on many management committees and heads an independent enterprise risk management department; the General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer also sit on key management committees and the functions they oversee operate independently of the businesses to separate management and oversight. Employee appraisals evaluate employees with respect to risk and ethics. 
Cybersecurity Risk Oversight 
In addition, the Board oversees the Company's cyber risk management program. In order to respond to the threat of security breaches and cyberattacks, we have developed a program, overseen by the Company's Chief Information Security Officer and our Information Security Office, that is designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and continued availability of all information owned by, or in the care of, the Company. This program also includes a cyber incident response plan that provides controls and procedures for timely and accurate reporting of any material cybersecurity incident. The Audit Committee, which is tasked with oversight of certain risk issues, including cybersecurity, receives periodic reports from the Chief Information Security Officer, the Chief Information Officer and the Head of Operational Risk. The Board and the Audit Committee also periodically receive updates about the results of exercises and response readiness assessments led by outside advisors who provide a third-party independent assessment of our technical program and our internal response preparedness. The Audit Committee regularly briefs the full Board on these matters, and the full Board also receives periodic briefings on cyber threats in order to enhance our directors' literacy on cyber issues.

Executive Compensation Risk Oversight 
We monitor the risks associated with our compensation programs and individual executive compensation decisions on an ongoing basis. Each year, management undertakes a review of the Company's various compensation programs to assess the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices. Management presents these risk assessments to the Compensation Committee. The risk assessments have included a review of the primary design features of the Company's compensation plans, the process to determine compensation pools and awards for employees and an analysis of how those features could directly or indirectly encourage or mitigate risk-taking. As part of the risk assessments, it has been noted that the Company's compensation plans allow for discretionary negative adjustments to the ultimate outcomes, which serves to mitigate risk-taking. 
Moreover, senior management is subject to share ownership and retention policies, and historically a large percentage of senior management compensation has been paid in the form of long-term equity awards. In addition, senior management compensation is paid over a multiple-year cycle, a compensation structure that is intended to align incentives with appropriate risk-taking. The Company's general risk management controls also serve to preclude decision-makers from taking excessive risk to earn the incentives provided under our compensation plans. The Compensation Committee agreed with the conclusion that the identified risks were within our ability to effectively monitor and manage, and that our compensation programs do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking and do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Succession Planning 
The Board is actively engaged and involved in talent management. The Board reviews the Company's "people strategy" in support of its business strategy at least annually and frequently discusses talent issues at its meetings. This includes a detailed discussion of the Company's global leadership bench and succession plans with a focus on key positions at the senior officer level. As a result of this approach, the Board was well positioned to execute on its succession plan in 2018, including the appointment of Mr. Lowrey to succeed Mr. Strangfeld as CEO and Chairman and Mr. Falzon to succeed Mr. Grier as Vice Chairman. 
In addition, the committees of the Board regularly discuss the talent pipeline for specific critical roles. High-potential leaders are given exposure and visibility to Board members through formal presentations and informal events. More broadly, the Board is regularly updated on key talent indicators for the overall workforce, including diversity, recruiting and development programs.

Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions 
The Company has adopted a written Related Party Transaction Approval Policy that applies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to any transaction or series of transactions in which the Company or a subsidiary is a participant;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• when the amount involved exceeds $120,000; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• when a related party (a director or executive officer of the Company, any nominee for director, any shareholder owning an  excess of 5% of the total equity of the Company and any immediate family member of any such person) has a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or trustee or in any similar position or a less than  10% beneficial owner of another entity).  
[END TABLE]
The policy is administered by the Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee. The Committee will consider relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether or not to approve or ratify such a transaction, and will approve or ratify only those transactions that are, in the Committee's judgment, appropriate or desirable under the circumstances. 
In the ordinary course of business, we may from time to time engage in transactions with other corporations or financial institutions whose officers or directors are also directors of Prudential Financial. In all cases, these transactions are conducted on an arm's-length basis. In addition, from time to time executive officers and directors of Prudential Financial may engage in transactions in the ordinary course of business involving services we offer, such as insurance and investment services, on terms similar to those extended to employees of Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries and affiliates generally. The Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee has determined that certain types of transactions do not create or involve a direct or indirect material interest, including (i) any sales of financial services or products to a related party in the ordinary course of business on terms and conditions generally available in the marketplace (or at ordinary employee discounts, if applicable) and in accordance with applicable law and (ii) all business relationships between the Company and a 5% shareholder or a business affiliated with a director, director nominee or immediate family member of a director or director nominee made in the ordinary course of business on terms and conditions generally available in the marketplace and in accordance with applicable law. 
Pursuant to our policy, the Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee determined that there were three transactions that qualified as related party transactions since the beginning of 2018. The brother of Robert M. Falzon, our Vice Chairman, Michael F. Falzon, is our Vice President, Infrastructure Systems Development. In 2018, the total compensation paid to Michael Falzon, including salary, bonus and the grant date value of long-term incentive awards, was approximately $600,000. The son-in-law of Barbara Koster, our Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer, Joshua D. Howard, is an associate in Quantitative Management Associates, a subsidiary of the Company. In 2018, the total compensation paid to Mr. Howard, including salary and bonus, was approximately $165,000. The daughter of Timothy L. Schmidt, our Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, Carley J. Berger, is an associate in the actuarial department. In 2018, the total compensation paid to Ms. Berger, including salary and bonus, was approximately $130,000. In all three cases, the individuals' compensation was similar to the compensation of other employees holding equivalent positions.

Policy on Shareholder Rights Plan 
We do not have a shareholder rights plan. The Board will obtain shareholder approval prior to adopting a future shareholder rights plan unless the Board, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, determines that under the circumstances then existing, it would be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders to adopt a rights plan without prior shareholder approval. If a rights plan is adopted by the Board without prior shareholder approval, the plan must provide that it will expire within one year of adoption unless ratified by shareholders. 
Political Contributions and Lobbying Expenditure Oversight and Disclosure 
The Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee reviews and approves an annual report on political activities, contributions and lobbying expenses. It monitors and evaluates the Company's ongoing political strategy as it relates to overall public policy objectives for the next year and provides guidance to the Board. We provide on our website a description of our oversight process for political contributions and a summary of PAC contributions. We also disclose semiannual information on dues, assessments and contributions of $10,000 or more to trade associations and tax-exempt advocacy groups and a summary of Company policies and procedures for political activity. This disclosure is available at www.prudential.com/governance under the heading "Political Activity & Contributions." 
The 2018 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability ranked Prudential as a Trendsetter company, the highest distinction. This is the fourth consecutive year that Prudential has been recognized for its disclosure, accountability, and political spending oversight. 
Environmental, Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility 
The Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee has oversight of environmental issues and policies. In addition, three of our Board members sit on the Board's Corporate Social Responsibility Oversight Committee. These directors inform the Company's social responsibility efforts in investing for financial and social returns, strategic philanthropy, employee engagement and corporate community involvement. 2018 investments include: 
$273 million in impact investments to non-profits and businesses that seek to create both a financial and social return. $52.5 million in grants to nonprofit organizations through The Prudential Foundation. $24.4 million in corporate contributions to non-profit organizations, including more than $5 million in projects serving U.S. veterans. More than 92,000 volunteer hours by U.S. Prudential employees impacting local communities across the country.

Item 2–Ratification of the Appointment of the 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers" or "PwC") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm ("independent auditor") for 2019. We are not required to have the shareholders ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers as our independent auditor. We nonetheless are doing so because we believe it is a matter of good corporate practice. 
If the shareholders do not ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain PricewaterhouseCoopers, but may nevertheless retain it as the Company's independent auditor. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interest of Prudential Financial and its shareholders. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers will be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement and be available to respond to appropriate questions by shareholders. 
FEES PAID TO PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS 
The following is a summary and description of fees for services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2018 and 2017.

(1)  The aggregate fees for professional services rendered for the integrated audit of the consolidated financial statements of  Prudential Financial and, as required, audits of various domestic and international subsidiaries, the issuance of comfort letters, agreed-upon procedures required by regulation, consents and assistance with review of documents filed with the SEC.   
[END TABLE]

(2)  The aggregate fees for assurance and related services, including internal control and financial compliance reports,  agreed-upon procedures not required by regulation, and accounting consultation on new accounting standards, acquisitions and potential financial reporting requirements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  The aggregate fees for services rendered for tax return preparation, tax advice related to mergers and acquisitions and  other international, federal and state projects, and requests for rulings. In each of 2017 and 2018, tax compliance and preparation fees totaled approximately $2 million and tax advisory fees totaled approximately $1 million.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  The aggregate fees for all other services rendered, including for 2017 fees for business advisory services.   
[END TABLE]
PricewaterhouseCoopers also provides services to domestic and international mutual funds and limited partnerships not consolidated by Prudential Financial, but which are managed by Prudential Financial. PricewaterhouseCoopers identified fees related to audit, audit-related, tax and all other services paid by these entities of $15 million in 2018 and $14 million in 2017. 
The Audit Committee has advised the Board of Directors that in its opinion the non-audit services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers during the most recent fiscal year are compatible with maintaining its independence. 
PwC has been the Company's independent auditor since it became a public company in 2001 and prior to that from 1996.

In determining whether to reappoint the independent auditor, the Audit Committee annually considers several factors, including:

In accordance with SEC rules, independent audit partners are subject to rotation requirements limiting their number of consecutive years of service to our Company to no more than five. The process for selecting the Company's lead audit partner includes Company management and the Audit Committee Chair vetting the independent auditor's candidates. The full Audit Committee is consulted in connection with the final selection of the lead audit partner. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 
The Audit Committee has established a policy requiring its pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditor. The policy identifies the guiding principles that must be considered by the Audit Committee in approving services so that the independent auditor's independence is not impaired; describes the Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other services that may be provided and the non-audit services that may not be performed; and sets forth the pre-approval requirements for all permitted services. The policy provides for the general pre-approval of specific types of Audit, Audit-Related and Tax services and a limited fee estimate range for such services on an annual basis. The policy requires specific pre-approval of all other permitted services. The independent auditor is required to report periodically to the Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided in accordance with their pre-approval and the fees for the services performed to date. The Audit Committee's policy delegates to its Chair the authority to address requests for pre-approval of services with fees up to a maximum of $250,000 between Audit Committee meetings if the Company's Chief Auditor deems it reasonably necessary to begin the services before the next scheduled meeting of the Audit Committee, and the Chair must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee may not delegate to management the Audit Committee's responsibility to pre-approve permitted services of the independent auditor. 
All Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and All Other services described above were approved by the Audit Committee before services were rendered. 
The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers as the Company's Independent Auditor for 2019. 
ENHANCING COMMUNICATION THROUGH AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORTING 
The Center for Audit Quality and a group of nationally recognized U.S. corporate governance and policy organizations jointly released a paper entitled "Enhancing the Audit Committee Report: A Call to Action," which encouraged audit committees of public companies to proactively consider strengthening their public disclosures to more effectively convey the critical work of audit committees to investors and stakeholders. Prudential was featured as an example of a company exhibiting voluntary practices strengthening audit committee disclosures.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
Three independent directors comprise the Audit Committee. The Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. 
In addition, the Board has determined that all of our Audit Committee members, Messrs. Paz and Scovanner and Ms. Hund-Mejean, satisfy the financial expertise requirements of the NYSE and have the requisite experience to be designated an audit committee financial expert as that term is defined by rules of the SEC. 
Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the financial statements of Prudential Financial and for maintaining appropriate accounting and financial reporting policies and practices, and internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Prudential Financial's independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, is responsible for auditing the consolidated financial statements of Prudential Financial and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, as well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). 
In performing its oversight function, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements of Prudential Financial as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting with management and Prudential Financial's independent auditor. The Audit Committee also discussed with Prudential Financial's independent auditor the matters required to be discussed by the independent auditor with the Audit Committee under the rules adopted by the PCAOB. 
The Audit Committee received from the independent auditor the written disclosures and the letters required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent auditor its independence. 
The Audit Committee has discussed with, and received regular status reports from, Prudential Financial's Chief Auditor and independent auditor on the overall scope and plans for their audits of Prudential Financial, including their scope and plans for evaluating the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee meets with the Chief Auditor and the independent auditor, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their respective audits, in addition to private meetings with the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer, General Counsel, Chief Actuary and Chief Compliance Officer. In determining whether to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers as Prudential Financial's independent auditor, the Audit Committee took into consideration a number of factors, including the length of time the firm has been engaged, the firm's independence and objectivity, PwC's capability and expertise in handling the breadth and complexity of Prudential's global operations, including the expertise and capability of the Lead Audit Partner, historical and recent performance, including the extent and quality of PwC's communications with the Audit Committee, the results of a management survey of PwC's overall performance, data related to audit quality and performance, including recent PCAOB inspection reports on the firm, and the appropriateness of PwC's fees, both on an absolute basis and as compared with its peers. 
Based on the reports and discussions described in this report and subject to the limitations on the roles and responsibilities of the Audit Committee referred to above and in its Charter, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements of Prudential Financial and Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

Item 3–Advisory Vote to Approve 
Named Executive Officer Compensation 
The Board is committed to excellence in governance and recognizes our shareholders' interest in our executive compensation program. As a part of that commitment, and in accordance with SEC rules, our shareholders are being asked to approve a non-binding advisory resolution on the compensation of our named executive officers, as reported in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "Say on Pay" proposal, gives shareholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse our 2018 executive compensation program and policies for our named executive officers through the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Prudential approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers set forth in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the related compensation tables and narrative in this Proxy Statement. 
This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather our overall compensation policies and practices relating to our named executive officers. Accordingly, your vote will not directly affect or otherwise limit any existing compensation or award arrangement of any of our named executive officers. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board. The Board will, however, as it has done in prior years, take into account the outcome of the "Say on Pay" vote when considering future compensation arrangements. 
At the 2017 Annual Meeting, shareholders approved, on an advisory basis, holding "Say on Pay" votes annually, and the Board has adopted a policy providing for annual "Say on Pay" votes. Accordingly, the next "Say on Pay" vote will occur in 2020. 
The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the advisory vote to approve our named executive officer compensation.

Item 4–Shareholder Proposal Regarding 
Right to Act by Written Consent 
In accordance with SEC rules, we have set forth below a shareholder proposal, along with the supporting statement of the shareholder proponent. The Company is not responsible for any inaccuracies it may contain. The shareholder proposal is required to be voted on at our Annual Meeting only if properly presented. As explained below, our Board unanimously recommends that you vote "AGAINST" the shareholder proposal. 
John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California, 90278, beneficial owner of 50 shares of Common Stock, is the proponent of the following shareholder proposal. The proponent has advised us that a representative will present the proposal and related supporting statement at the Annual Meeting. 
Right to Act by Written Consent 
Resolved, Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any topic for written consent consistent with applicable law. 
Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. Taking action by written consent in place of a meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle. 
This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 major companies in a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. This proposal topic would have received a vote still higher than 67% at Allstate and Sprint if all shareholders at Allstate and Sprint had access to independent proxy voting advice. More than 100 Fortune 500 companies provide for shareholders to call special meetings and to act by written consent. 
Written consent is a means to elect a director who could focus on the wisdom of stock repurchases: 
Approved share repurchase plan of up to $1.5 Billion of common stock starting January 1, 2018 
Approved share repurchase increase of $500 Million of common stock August 2016 
There is a concern about share repurchases like the above. Stock buybacks can be a sign of short-termism for executives—sometimes boosting share price without boosting the underlying value, profitability, or ingenuity of the company. A dollar spent repurchasing a share is a dollar that cannot be spent on new equipment, an acquisition, entry into a new market or anything else. 
Written consent is a means to elect a director who could focus on avoiding reoccurrences of events like these: 
Putative Class Action Lawsuit over alleged improper charges on universal life policies holders to "cure defaults and/or reinstate lapses," Pruco Life Insurance Company 
May 2018 
Regulator launched investigation over alleged role in Wells Fargo's fraudulent accounts 
December 2017 
Criticism over alleged role in offshore tax havens 
April 2017 
The expectation is that, once this proposal is adopted, shareholders would not need to make use of this right of written consent because its mere existence will act as a guardrail to help ensue that our company is well supervised by the Board of Directors and management. Our Directors and management will want to avoid shareholder action by written consent and will thus be more alert in avoiding poor performance. 
Please vote yes: Right to Act by Written Consent—Proposal 4

           Item 4–Shareholder Proposal Regarding Right to Act by Written Consent 
[END TABLE]
Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Proposal 
Your Board recommends a vote against this proposal because it believes that the written consent process, as required by the proposal, is less transparent and less democratic than a shareholder meeting and deprives shareholders of a forum for discussion or the opportunity for them to make inquiries about proposed actions. Matters that are sufficiently important to require shareholder approval should be communicated in advance so they can be considered and voted upon by all shareholders. This proposal would allow a group of shareholders to take action by written consent without prior communication to all shareholders of the proposed actions or the reasons for the actions. We believe this proposal disenfranchises shareholders who would not have the opportunity to participate in the proposed process. Permitting shareholder action by written consent has the potential to create confusion, and the Board does not believe it is appropriate for a widely held public company. 
Our Board believes that every shareholder should have the opportunity to consider and vote upon shareholder actions. Our shareholders have the right to call a special meeting at a 10% threshold. This right, as well as our established shareholder communication and engagement mechanisms, provides shareholders the opportunity to raise important matters outside the annual meeting process. 
The Company is committed to good corporate governance, which helps us compete more effectively, sustain our success and build long-term shareholder value. The Company has a strong governance structure in place, and the Board's philosophy and policies are responsive to shareholders. In addition to the unrestricted right for shareholders to call special meetings at a 10% threshold, the Company has many other governance provisions in place that empower shareholders, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• no Shareholder Rights Plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an annually elected Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• no supermajority voting provisions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• independent board leadership, including a strong Lead Independent Director and strong committee chairs; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• proxy access.  
[END TABLE]
Requiring that all shareholder business be acted upon at a meeting helps to confirm complete information is presented to shareholders to obtain their approval and is more democratic. The Board believes that the risk of abuse associated with the right to act by written consent, including bypassing procedural protections that offer transparency and advance notice, both of which are afforded with a shareholder meeting, make this proposal not in the best interest of all shareholders. 
In summary, the Board believes the adoption of this proposal is unnecessary because of our commitment to good corporate governance and the right of shareholders to call a special meeting at a 10% threshold. Furthermore, the Board believes that the written consent proposal would circumvent the protections, procedural safeguards and advantages provided to all shareholders by shareholder meetings. 
THEREFORE, YOUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "AGAINST" THIS PROPOSAL.

Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act 
Each Director and executive officer of the Company and any greater than 10% beneficial owner of Common Stock is required to report to the SEC, by a specified date, his or her transactions involving our Common Stock. Based solely on a review of the copies of reports furnished to the Company and written representations that no other reports were required to be filed, the Company believes that for transactions during 2018 all reports required by Section 16(a) were timely filed. Prior to 2018, six reports for Thomas Baltimore, Director, reporting an inadvertent purchase of 65 shares and inadvertent sales of a total of 315 shares were not timely filed due to an oversight by the broker effecting the transactions without any knowledge of Mr. Baltimore.

Compensation of Directors 
The Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee reviews the compensation of our non-employee directors periodically (generally every three years) and recommends changes to the Board when it deems appropriate. 
For December 2018, our Non-Executive Chairman, John Strangfeld, was paid $125,000 for his service on the Board as a non-employee. It is expected that he will receive $375,000 for his service through April 5, 2019. 
The following table describes the components of the non-employee directors' compensation for 2018:

(2)  This is a committee comprised of members of management and the Board. This Committee typically meets on a separate day  following the Board and Board committee meetings. The non-employee directors on this committee currently consist of Mr. Casellas, Ms. Pianalto and Ms. Poon. The Corporate Social Responsibility  Oversight Committee met three times in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  As of December 31, 2018, each of our non-employee directors satisfied this  guideline, with the exception of Ms. Pianalto, and Messrs. Lighte, Paz and Todman, who joined the Board within the last five years, each of whom has six years to satisfy the guideline after he or she joined the Board. For purposes of the stock  ownership guideline, once a non-employee director satisfies his or her stock ownership level, the director will be deemed to continue to satisfy the guideline without regard to fluctuation in the value of the  Common Stock owned by the director.  
[END TABLE]
We maintain a Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "Plan"). Since 2011, 50% of the annual Board and committee retainer has been awarded in restricted stock units that vest after one year (or if earlier, on the date of the next Annual Meeting). A non-employee director can elect to invest the cash portion of his or her retainer and fees and equity retainer upon vesting in accounts under the Plan that replicate investments in either shares of our Common Stock or the Fixed Rate Fund, which accrues interest in the same manner as funds invested in the Fixed Rate Fund offered under the Prudential Employee Savings Plan ("PESP"). As elected by the director, the Plan provides for distributions to commence upon or following termination of Board service or while a director remains on the Board. 
Each director receives dividend equivalents on the restricted stock units contained in his or her deferral account under the Plan, which are equal in value to the dividends paid on our Common Stock. The dividend equivalents credited to the account are then reinvested in the form of additional stock units. 
Under our director compensation program, if a non-employee director satisfies the stock ownership guideline, the restricted stock units granted as the annual equity retainer are payable upon vesting in cash or shares of our Common Stock (at the director's option) and may be deferred beyond vesting at the director's election. If a director does not satisfy the stock ownership guideline, the restricted stock units are automatically deferred until termination of Board service. 
DIRECTOR STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINE 
Each director is expected, within six years of joining the Board, to own Common Stock or deferred stock units that have a value equivalent to six times his or her annual cash retainer.

Consideration of Most Recent "Say on Pay" Vote 
Opportunity for Shareholder Feedback 
The Committee carefully considers feedback from our shareholders regarding our executive compensation program. Shareholders are invited to express their views to the Committee as described under "Communication with Directors" in this Proxy Statement. In addition, the advisory vote on the compensation of the NEOs provides shareholders with an opportunity to communicate their views on our executive compensation program. 
You should read this CD&A in conjunction with the advisory vote that we are conducting on the compensation of the NEOs (see "Item 3—Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation"). This CD&A, as well as the accompanying compensation tables, contains information that is relevant to your voting decision.

Philosophy and Objectives of Our Executive Compensation Program 
The philosophy underlying our executive compensation program is to provide an attractive, flexible, and market-based total compensation program tied to performance and aligned with the interests of our shareholders. Our objective is to recruit and retain the caliber of executive officers and other key employees necessary to deliver sustained high performance to our shareholders, customers, and communities where we have a strong presence. Our executive compensation program is an important component of these overall human resources policies. Equally important, we view compensation practices as a means for communicating our goals and standards of conduct and performance and for motivating and rewarding employees in relation to their achievements. 
Overall, the same principles that govern the compensation of all our salaried employees apply to the compensation of our executive officers. Within this framework, we observe the following principles: 
2018 Incentive Programs 
To create a strong link between our incentive compensation opportunities and our short-term and longer-term objectives, we use two specific programs: our Annual Incentive Program and our Long-Term Incentive Program. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Incentive Program. The Annual Incentive Program is designed to reward strong  financial and operational performance that furthers our short-term strategic objectives. Financial performance is primarily determined based on three equally-weighted performance metrics: (i) EPS achievement relative to our externally disclosed  EPS targets; (ii) year-over-year growth in EPS; and (iii) relative ROE as compared to a group of peer companies.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-Term Incentive Program. Our Long-Term Incentive Program consists of three parts  that incent long-term value creation: performance shares and units that reward the achievement of our long-term ROE goals and increases in the market value of our Common Stock (as well as, for awards granted in 2018, increases in our senior  management diversity); book value units that reward increases in book value per share; and stock options that reward increases in the market value of our Common Stock.  
[END TABLE]
ANNUAL COMPENSATION-RELATED RISK EVALUATION 
We monitor the risks associated with our compensation programs, as well as the components of our programs and individual executive compensation decisions, on an ongoing basis. Our compensation risk assessment occurs in two parts: a review of the Company's compensation programs and a review of compensation decisions and payments, with a focus on our senior executives. In January 2019, our Chief Risk Officer presented to the Committee a review of Prudential's compensation programs, including the executive compensation program, to assess the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices. The Committee agreed with the review's findings that these risks were within our ability to effectively monitor and manage and that these compensation programs do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking and do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Also, in June 2018, our Chief Risk Officer presented a study of the payouts under the compensation programs. The Committee agreed with the study's findings that our compensation practices, including payouts, adhere to best market practices and do not encourage undue or excessive risk-taking.

Our programs are designed to align the interests of our executives with the interests of our shareholders and to link the drivers of short-term and long-term value creation with our executive compensation. 
*The image above is a graphical representation of the components and drivers of total direct compensation. The illustration represents the average target total direct compensation values for our NEOs. 
**Represents Book Value Performance Program (11%) and 30% mandatory deferral of Annual Incentive Awards (equates to 10.8% of target total direct compensation). 
Our Annual Incentive Program and Long-Term Incentive Program share one common performance measure: our relative ROE, that is, our ROE as compared to the ROE of the North American Life Insurance subset of our peer group. The Committee believes that our relative ROE is a core value proposition for our shareholders and, accordingly, that relative ROE performance over both the short term and long term merits inclusion as a performance measure in each of our incentive programs.

How We Make Compensation Decisions 
Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Committee is responsible to our Board for overseeing the development and administration of our compensation and benefits policies and programs. The Committee, which consists of three independent directors, is responsible for the review and approval of all aspects of our executive compensation program. Among its duties, the Committee is responsible for formulating the compensation recommendations for our CEO and approving all compensation recommendations for our officers at the senior vice president level and above, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annual review and approval of incentive program design, goals and objectives for alignment with our compensation and  business strategies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• evaluation of individual performance results in light of these goals and objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• evaluation of the competitiveness of each executive officer's total compensation package; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approval of any changes to the total compensation package, including, but not limited to, base salary, annual and long-term  incentive award opportunities, payouts, and retention programs.  
[END TABLE]
Following review and discussion, the Committee submits its recommendations for compensation for these executive officers to the independent members of our Board for approval. 
The Committee is supported in its work by our Chief Human Resources Officer, his staff, and the Committee's executive Compensation Consultant, as described below. 
The Committee's charter, which sets out its duties and responsibilities and addresses other matters, can be found on our website at www.prudential.com/governance. 
Role of the Chief Executive Officer 
Within the framework of the compensation programs approved by the Committee and based on management's review of market competitive positions, each year our CEO recommends the level of base salary increase (if any), the annual incentive award, and the long-term incentive award value for our officers at the senior vice president level and above, including the other NEOs. These recommendations are based upon an assessment of each executive officer's performance, the performance of the individual's respective business or function, and retention considerations. The Committee reviews our CEO's recommendations and approves any compensation changes affecting our executive officers as it determines in its sole discretion. Given our recent leadership transition, our former CEO and our current CEO made joint recommendations for compensation paid in respect of 2018. 
Our CEO does not play any role with respect to any matter affecting his own compensation and is not present when the Committee discusses and formulates his compensation recommendation.

Role of the Compensation Consultant 
The Committee has retained Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. as its executive Compensation Consultant. The Compensation Consultant reports directly to the Committee, and the Committee may replace the Compensation Consultant or hire additional consultants at any time. A representative of the Compensation Consultant attends meetings of the Committee, as requested, and communicates with the Committee Chair between meetings. 
The Compensation Consultant provides various executive compensation services to the Committee pursuant to a written consulting agreement with the Committee. Generally, these services include advising the Committee on the principal aspects of our executive compensation program and evolving industry practices and providing market information and analysis regarding the competitiveness of our program design and our award values in relationship to performance. 
During 2018, the Compensation Consultant performed the following specific services: 
The Compensation Consultant provided no services to management during 2018. 
The Committee retains sole authority to hire the Compensation Consultant, approve its compensation, determine the nature and scope of its services, evaluate its performance, and terminate its engagement. 
The total amount of fees paid to the Compensation Consultant for services to the Committee in 2018 was $214,961. The Compensation Consultant received no other fees or compensation from us, except for $3,400 to participate in a general industry survey of long-term compensation. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of the Compensation Consultant pursuant to the listing standards of the NYSE and SEC rules and concluded that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent the Compensation Consultant from serving as an independent consultant to the Compensation Committee.

Compensation Peer Group 
The Committee uses compensation data compiled from a group of peer companies in the insurance, asset management, and other diversified financial services industries generally selected from the Standard & Poor's 500 Financials Index (the "Peer Group"). The Committee periodically reviews and updates the Peer Group, as necessary, upon recommendation of the Compensation Consultant. We believe the Peer Group represents the industries with which we currently compete for executive talent, and also includes our principal business competitors. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Although included within the broad financial services sector, we exclude from the  Peer Group companies such as property and casualty insurers and investment banking firms that predominantly offer different products, have substantially different business models and with whom we have less direct competition for executive  talent.   For 2018, the Peer Group consisted of the following 20  companies:

The Committee relies on various sources of compensation information to ascertain the competitive market for our executive officers, including the NEOs. 
To assess the competitiveness of our executive compensation program, we analyze Peer Group compensation data obtained from peer company proxy materials as well as compensation and benefits survey data provided by national compensation consulting firms, such as Willis Towers Watson, McLagan Partners, and Mercer. As part of this process, we measure actual pay levels within each compensation component and in the aggregate. We also review the mix of our compensation components with respect to fixed versus variable, short term versus long term, and cash versus equity-based pay. This information is then presented to the Committee for its review and use. 
The Committee generally compares the compensation of each NEO in relation to each of the 25th, the 50th and the 75th percentiles of the Peer Group for similar positions. In addition, the Committee takes into account various factors such as our performance within the Peer Group, the unique characteristics of the individual's position, and any succession and retention considerations. In general, compensation levels for an executive officer who is new to a position tend to be at the lower end of the competitive range, while seasoned executive officers with strong performance who are viewed as critical to retain would be positioned at the higher end of the competitive range. For example, due to their promotions in December 2018, Messrs. Lowrey's and Tanji's target total direct compensation is at or below the Peer Group median for their respective positions. 
Generally, differences in the levels of total direct compensation among the NEOs are primarily driven by the scope of their responsibilities, differences in the competitive market pay range for similar positions, and considerations of internal equity.

[END TABLE]
The following discussion contains information regarding certain performance measures and goals. These measures and goals are disclosed in the limited context of our executive compensation program. Shareholders should not apply these performance measures and goals to other contexts. 
FORMULAIC FRAMEWORK FOR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS 
Awards under each of our incentive programs are funded at the level determined by our financial results relative to pre-established targets and performance relative to peer companies under formulas for each incentive program. The Board believes it generally should exercise limited or no discretion to increase our NEOs' formula-based awards. For the annual incentive program, the formula uses three equally weighted performance metrics, in each case based on after-tax adjusted operating income: (i) EPS relative to our externally disclosed EPS targets; (ii) year-over-year growth in EPS; and (iii) relative ROE as compared to the North American Life Insurance subset of our Peer Group. Similarly, under our performance shares program, payments are determined based on our average ROE results over the three-year performance period, as compared to both a performance scale set at the start of the period and the ROE results of the North American Life Insurance subset of our Peer Group over that period, giving equal weight to each. The Book Value Performance Program tracks our adjusted book value per share. Adjusted book value per share excludes the impact on attributed equity of accumulated other comprehensive income and of foreign currency exchange rate remeasurement included in net income or loss, as described in Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. 
To more accurately reflect the operating performance of our business, the Committee has approved a pre-determined framework of adjustments to our reported financial results for incentive program purposes. Generally, these adjustments are made to exclude one-time or unusual items and external factors that are inconsistent with the assumptions reflected in our financial plans. The standard adjustments to reported financial results under our formulaic framework may vary from year to year and may have either a favorable or unfavorable impact on the funding of the Annual Incentive Award Pool and may affect other performance measures, such as the calculation of adjusted book value per share under our Book Value Performance Program. 
Standard adjustments to reported financial results are made:

Direct Compensation Components 
Annually, the Compensation Committee reviews the competitive analysis of total direct compensation for the NEOs. Based on this evaluation, the Committee may selectively adjust the base salary, annual incentive award target, and long-term target amounts of the NEOs. In determining any adjustments, the Committee takes into account the following factors: level of experience and impact in the role; changes in market data; and compensation positioning overall and by component. Executives new to their current roles are positioned towards the lower end of their competitive range while executives with more experience are generally positioned at the higher end of the range. 
BASE SALARY 
Base salary is the principal fixed component of the total direct compensation of our executive officers, including the NEOs, and is determined by considering the relative importance of the position, the competitive marketplace, and the individual's performance and contributions. Base salaries are reviewed annually and, typically, are increased infrequently and then mostly at the time of a change in position or assumption of new responsibilities. 
SALARY DECISIONS 
In connection with the succession planning changes in 2018, the Committee made the following salary decisions effective as of December 1, 2018: Mr. Lowrey's salary was increased to $1,200,000; Mr. Tanji's salary was increased to $600,000; Mr. Falzon's salary was increased to $1,000,000; and Mr. Sleyster's salary was increased to $700,000. 
Annual Incentive Awards 
At least once a year, the Committee reviews the Annual Incentive Program and makes changes as needed. The Committee approved the 2018 Annual Incentive Program for our most senior executives, including the NEOs, on the following terms and conditions. 
TARGET AWARD OPPORTUNITIES 
The target and maximum annual incentive award opportunities for each of the NEOs for 2018 were as follows:

Each year, the Committee establishes an annual Performance Factor that is the primary driver in determining the amount of the annual incentive awards for our NEOs. 
For 2018, we used the following process to determine this Performance Factor: 
Establish Initial Performance Factor 
Consistent with the formulaic framework for our Annual Incentive Program, the Committee established an Initial Performance Factor based on the following three financial metrics, giving equal weight to each (i.e., each metric is weighted one-third): 
The Initial Performance Factor was applied to the target annual incentive award opportunity for each NEO to determine that NEO's annual incentive funding. 
For purposes of the 2018 Annual Incentive Program, EPS and ROE were calculated as follows: 
For more information regarding our 2018 annual measures of EPS, AOI and ROE, as well as adjusted book value, see Appendix A to this Proxy Statement.

We applied our preset formulaic framework to our January 2019 estimate of our 2018 reported AOI, EPS, and ROE. 
Standard Adjustments 
We make standard adjustments to estimated AOI, EPS, and ROE under our formulaic framework that may vary from year to year and may have either a favorable or unfavorable impact on the funding of the Annual Incentive Award Pool. For 2018, these standard adjustments resulted in the following changes to EPS: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 EPS (January Estimate)     $  11.68    
 Market Unlockings        + 0.11    
 Actuarial Assumptions        + 0.31    
 M&A Adjustments        + 0.03    
 Adjustments for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act        - 0.66    
 Non-Coupon  Investments/Prepayment Fee and Call Premium Income        + 0.15    
 EPS (Annual Incentive Program)     $  11.62    
[END TABLE]
The market unlockings adjusted our reported results for our Individual Annuities, Individual Life and International Insurance businesses to exclude the impact of actual market performance relative to our plan assumption. The adjustment for 2018 market unlockings increased EPS under the Annual Incentive Program by approximately $0.11. 
Annually, based on Company-specific data, industry data, and the current long-term economic outlook, we update our actuarial assumptions on long-term market returns and customer behavioral expectations (e.g., mortality, morbidity, and lapses). These updates and related refinements result in a cumulative revaluation of our reserves and the carrying values of our deferred acquisition costs. While GAAP requires these updates to be reported in the current period, they are not representative of annual performance since they relate to outcomes in both prior and future years. For these reasons, they are excluded from EPS under the Annual Incentive Program (regardless of whether they are positive or negative). In 2018, the adjustments to account for these updates increased EPS under the Annual Incentive Program by approximately $0.31. 
Our EPS guidance for 2018 included a full year of earnings attributable to our Pramerica of Italy and Pramerica of Poland operations. However, we classified those businesses as divested and run-off businesses in 2018 upon the signing of definitive agreements to sell them, and earnings from those operations were excluded from EPS at that time. As a result, we increased EPS under the Annual Incentive Program by approximately $0.03 to add back earnings from those operations. 
As the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was uncertain at the time we issued our EPS guidance for 2018, we did not assume any impacts from the Tax Act in our guidance range. As a result, we have excluded the impact of the Tax Act on earnings when calculating EPS under the Annual Incentive 
 Program. This adjustment resulted in a decrease to EPS under the Annual Incentive Program of approximately $0.66. 
Finally, we limit earnings volatility from specified classes of non-coupon investments and prepayment fee and call premium income by excluding these earnings that are outside of a range of -10% to +10% from that assumed in our EPS guidance range. For 2018, this adjustment increased EPS under the Annual Incentive Program by approximately $0.15 as these earnings fell below our EPS guidance expectations by more than 10%. 
In the aggregate, these standard adjustments under our preset formulaic framework had a net negative effect of $0.06 to EPS under the Annual Incentive Program. 
Step 1: Establish EPS Target Factor 
The following table depicts the EPS scale target range for 2018. This target range is aligned to our publicly disclosed EPS guidance range. Our adjusted EPS for 2018 of $11.62 per share of Common Stock corresponds to an EPS Target Factor of 1.034. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      2018 EPS(1)            EPS Target Factor(2)        
      2018 EPS(1)            EPS Target Factor(2)        
        $14.89 or above              1.50       
       $11.70              1.05

        $11.20              0.95       
        $8.02 or below              0.50       
(1)  Determined on an AOI basis, subject to certain adjustments.  
(2)  The EPS Target Factor is interpolated on a straight-line basis between the EPS data points.  
[END TABLE]
Step 2: Establish EPS Growth Factor 
Our adjusted EPS for 2018 was $11.62 per share of Common Stock, an increase of $0.54 per share from our adjusted EPS of $11.08 for 2017. This corresponds to an EPS Growth Factor of 1.049. 
Step 3: Establish Relative ROE Factor 
Our adjusted ROE for 2018 was 13.5%, which is 0.2 percentage points lower than the median 2018 ROE for the North American Life Insurance subset of the Peer Group. This corresponds to a Relative ROE Factor of 0.983 based on the scale depicted below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      3%          1.25      
      2%          1.17

      -3%          0.75      
(1)  Determined on an AOI basis, subject to certain adjustments as discussed above.  
(2)  The Relative ROE Factor is interpolated on a straight-line basis between the ROE +/- Peer Median data points.

Step 4: Determine Final Performance Factor. 
Weighting each of the EPS Target Factor (1.034), the EPS Growth Factor (1.049), and the Relative ROE Factor (0.983) by one-third, we arrived at an Initial Performance Factor of 1.022. 
Once the Initial Performance Factor is determined, the Board believes it generally should not exercise meaningful discretion to increase the Performance Factor for strategic or other considerations. For the last four years, the Committee has not made any discretionary adjustments based on these considerations. 
Based on the foregoing, the Final Performance Factor for 2018 was determined to be 1.022. This factor was then applied to the target award opportunity for each NEO to determine that NEO's annual incentive award, with minor adjustments primarily due to rounding. 
The following table summarizes the calculation of the Final Performance Factor.

Annual Incentive Award Decisions for 2018 
The principal driver of the actual annual incentive awards for the NEOs is the Final Performance Factor. The Committee also considers individual performance and contributions in determining final awards. 
At the beginning of 2018, Mr. Strangfeld discussed with the Committee, and each other NEO discussed with his manager, the key factors for determining awards under our Annual Incentive Program and the NEO's expected contributions to that performance.

Long-Term Incentive Program 
We provide a long-term incentive opportunity to motivate and reward our executive officers for their contributions toward achieving our business objectives by tying these incentives to the performance of our Common Stock and book value over the long term, to further reinforce the link between the interests of our executive officers and our shareholders, and to motivate our executive officers to improve our multiyear financial performance. 
TARGET AWARD OPPORTUNITIES 
In February 2019, the Committee established a target long-term award opportunity for each of the NEOs (other than Mr. Strangfeld). To set these long-term award targets, the Committee considered: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a competitive market analysis of the NEO's total compensation and the portion of total compensation provided as  long-term incentives, relative to similar roles at companies in our compensation peer group;  
• the NEO's individual performance and his or her expected future contributions;  
• the NEO's level of experience in his or her role; and  
• retention considerations.  
[END TABLE]
The specific long-term target award opportunity for each NEO (other than Mr. Strangfeld) is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Named Executive Officers     Target Long-Term Award Opportunity   
Named Executive Officers     Target Long-Term Award Opportunity   
[END TABLE]
Our practice is to grant long-term incentive awards annually in the form of a balanced mix of performance shares and units, stock options, and book value units to our officers at the level of senior vice president and above, including the NEOs, in amounts that are consistent with competitive practice. 
The mix of long-term incentives granted in 2019 to the NEOs is shown in the table below: 
Long-term incentive awards may also be granted when an individual is promoted to a senior executive position to recognize the increase in the scope of his or her role and responsibilities. From time to time, we may make special awards in the form of restricted stock units to recognize major milestones, or selective awards in situations involving a leadership transition. 
In addition, for all long-term incentive awards granted prior to 2019, the total payout amount to any NEO subject, or who would have otherwise been subject, to Section 162(m) may not exceed 0.4% of the highest pre-tax AOI reported for any of the three fiscal years ended prior to the year of payment, provided that there is positive AOI in at least one fiscal year during which the award is outstanding for at least 276 days of that year.

PERFORMANCE SHARES AND UNITS 
Performance shares and units align the majority of our long-term incentive values to: (i) the achievement of our ROE objective and (ii) our relative ROE performance as compared to our life insurer peers, in each case over a three-year performance period. Award payouts generally range from 0% to 125% of the target number of shares and units. For the February 2016 awards with respect to the 2016 to 2018 performance period, the preliminary payout was based on the average ROE achievement over the three-year performance period relative to the goals set at the start of the period as established by the Committee, subject to a relative performance modifier. The modifier provides a balance between absolute performance and performance relative to the North American Life Insurance subset of the Peer Group and is based on the Company's three-year performance in ROE, book value per share growth and EPS growth. The modifier increased or decreased the award payment by up to 10% within the 0% to 125% range. 
For the remaining awards, the preliminary payout is based on two equally weighted financial metrics: (i) average ROE achievement over the three-year performance period relative to the goals set at the start of the period as established by the Committee and (ii) average ROE achievement over the three-year performance period relative to the median ROE results over this period of the North American Life Insurance subset of the Peer Group. This methodology for the performance shares and units program further solidifies the balance between absolute performance and performance relative to our life insurer peers. Accordingly, the use of a relative performance modifier was eliminated starting with the February 2017 awards. 
In addition, the February 2018 awards with respect to the 2018 to 2020 performance period granted to officers at the senior vice president level and above and equivalents (including the NEOs) are subject to a modifier that can increase (or decrease) the payout by up to 10% based on the achievement of our diversity and inclusion goals over the three-year performance period. 
Performance unit awards are denominated in share equivalents and have the same value as the performance share awards on the award payment date. Dividend equivalents are paid retroactively on the final number of performance shares and units paid out, up to the target number of shares and units. 
ROE is determined using after-tax AOI divided by adjusted book value. The ROE figures are also subject to standard adjustments as part of our formulaic framework. 
While the program allows the Committee to make a discretionary adjustment by up to 15% of the earned shares and units based on quantitative and qualitative factors, the Committee has rarely exercised discretion and did not exercise discretion for the 2016 awards that paid out in February 2019. 
STOCK OPTIONS 
Stock options provide value based solely on stock price appreciation. Stock options are granted with a maximum term of 10 years. One-third of the option grants vest on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. The exercise price is based on the closing market price of a share of our Common Stock on the NYSE on the date of grant. 
BOOK VALUE PERFORMANCE PROGRAM 
The Book Value Performance Program is intended to link the incentive payments to adjusted book value per share—a key metric in valuing insurance companies, banks, and investment firms that is closely followed by investors. We calculate adjusted book value per share by dividing our adjusted book value by the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding. Our calculations of adjusted book value and adjusted book value per share, as described in Appendix A to this Proxy Statement, exclude certain balance sheet items that are not, and may never be, reflected in the income statement. Unlike the financial measures based on AOI that are used in other aspects of our executive compensation program, the adjusted book value per share metric takes into consideration realized gains and losses in our investment portfolio. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 has had a beneficial impact on our adjusted book value due to the remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the reduction in the U.S. tax rate. The Committee excludes this benefit from the calculation of adjusted book value per share for purposes of valuing the book value units that were granted prior to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARD DECISIONS FOR 2018 
In connection with the retirement of John R. Strangfeld as CEO, in November 2018, the Committee granted a long-term incentive award to Mr. Strangfeld for the 2018 performance year of $10 million to reward performance and long-term value creation. The award is equal to the target long-term incentive award opportunity established by the Committee for Mr. Strangfeld for 2018. In approving this award, the Committee considered a number of factors, including Mr. Strangfeld's nearly full year of service in 2018, his long service as a high performing CEO, his agreement to remain on the Board through a transition period ending on April 5, 2019 and his key role in supporting a smooth leadership succession, which the Committee and the Board believe will drive continued value creation. 
In February 2019, the Committee granted long-term incentive awards to each of the NEOs other than Mr. Strangfeld. The award amount was based upon the competitive analysis of long-term incentive compensation and total direct compensation for each of the NEOs. To determine the amount of the specific long-term incentive award for each NEO, the Committee considered each individual's performance during 2018 and market data for the comparable executive officer position at the companies in the Peer Group, as well as his or her potential future contributions to the Company, the current value of prior year long-term incentive awards and retention considerations. 
These awards, including Mr. Strangfeld's award, were granted in the form of performance shares (30%), performance units (30%), stock options (20%), and book value units (20%) under the Book Value Performance Program (in addition to the mandatory deferral of 30% of each NEO's annual incentive award under this program). With respect to the NEOs (other than Mr. Strangfeld, whose award is discussed below), the Committee determined that this long-term incentive mix would appropriately reward the NEOs for their 2018 performance, motivate them to work towards achieving our long-term objectives, further reinforce the link between their interests and the interests of our shareholders, and provide a balanced portfolio composed of performance shares and units (which provide value based upon attainment of specific performance goals and performance relative to peers), stock options (which provide value based solely on stock price appreciation) and book value units (which provide value based on changes in our adjusted book value per share).

[END TABLE]
Performance Goals 
The Performance Shares and Units Program aligns long-term compensation to the achievement of our multiyear ROE goals and our relative performance as compared to our North American life insurer peers. Under the 2017-2019 program, our target ROE objective was 12%. Based on updated multiyear ROE projections that consider the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the target ROE objective under the 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 programs was increased to 12.5%. As indicated in the previous table, the threshold level of ROE performance to earn any award, and the ROE achievement required to earn a maximum award, have been aligned to these changes in our multiyear ROE goals. 
For awards granted for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance periods, the Committee excluded the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from the calculation of the Company's ROE for 2017 and 2018 and expects to similarly exclude this impact from the ROE calculations for 2019. 
2016-2018 Performance Period 
In February 2019, the NEOs received payouts with respect to the performance share and unit awards that were granted in February 2016 for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2018. These awards were paid at 1.142 times the target number of shares and units initially awarded based on our average ROE relative to our ROE targets for the three-year performance period, and adjusted for the relative performance modifier.

TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION 
The following table illustrates the Committee's perspective on the total direct compensation (base salary, annual incentive award, and long-term incentives) of the NEOs for the 2017 and 2018 performance years. This table is not a substitute for the compensation tables required by the SEC and included under "Executive Compensation" contained in this Proxy Statement. However, we believe it provides a more accurate picture of how the Committee viewed its compensation actions for the NEOs based on our performance for each of these two years:

CEO REALIZED AND REALIZABLE PAY ANALYSIS 
The total compensation of our NEOs as reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table is calculated in accordance with SEC rules. Under these rules, we are required to show the grant date fair value of equity and equity-based awards, even though the ability of our executive officers to realize value from such awards is contingent on the achievement of certain performance conditions (including, in the case of stock options, the sustained increase in our stock price). For each of our executives serving as CEO during 2018, the accompanying chart compares his total compensation, as measured based on actual compensation received (or, with regard to pending awards, realizable pay based on the applicable performance elements and stock value at a relatively current time), to the amounts reported for him in the Summary Compensation Table for the periods shown. 
The chart illustrates that our executive compensation program is designed so that the amount of compensation that our CEO actually receives, or is expected to receive, may be higher or lower than the amount we are required to report in the Summary Compensation Table, depending on the performance of our Common Stock and our performance relative to our key financial objectives. It demonstrates the strong alignment of the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders.

           Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[END TABLE]
Post-Employment Compensation 
Retirement Plans 
We view retirement benefits as a key component of our executive compensation program because they encourage long-term service. Accordingly, we offer our employees, including the NEOs, a comprehensive benefits program that provides the opportunity to accumulate adequate retirement income. This program includes both defined benefit and defined contribution plans, as well as two supplemental retirement plans which allow highly compensated employees (that is, employees whose compensation exceeds the limits established by the Internal Revenue Code for covered compensation and benefit levels) to receive the same benefits they would have earned but for these limitations. Further, we sponsor three supplemental executive retirement plans ("SERPs") for certain eligible executive officers, including the NEOs, to offset the potential loss or forfeiture of retirement benefits under certain limited circumstances or to provide additional benefits to certain key executives. For descriptions of these plans, including their titles, see "Pension Benefits." 
We also maintain the Prudential Insurance Company of America Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan"). We offer this plan to our executive officers, including the NEOs, as a competitive practice. For a description of this plan, see "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
Periodically, we compare the competitiveness of our benefits programs for our employees, including retirement benefits, against other employers with whom we broadly compete for talent. It is our objective to provide our employees with a benefits package that is at or around the median of the competitive market when compared to other employers. 
Severance and Change in Control Arrangements 
Our Board has adopted a policy prohibiting us from entering into any severance or change in control agreement with any of our executive officers, including the NEOs, that provides for payments and benefits that exceed 2.99 times the sum of the executive officer's base salary and most recently earned cash bonus, without shareholder approval or ratification. We do not provide excise tax payments, reimbursements, or "gross-ups" to any of our executive officers. 
While our other executive officers are eligible for severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination of employment without "cause," neither our former CEO nor our current CEO is a participant in the severance program (discussed below) providing this benefit. 
To enable us to offer competitive total compensation packages to our executive officers, as well as to promote the ongoing retention of these individuals when considering potential transactions that may create uncertainty as to their future employment with us, we offer certain post-employment payments and benefits to our executive officers, including the NEOs, upon the occurrence of several specified events. These payments and benefits are provided under two separate programs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Prudential Severance Plan for Senior Executives (the "Severance Plan"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Prudential Financial Executive Change in Control Severance Program.  
[END TABLE]
We have not entered into individual employment agreements with our NEOs. Instead, the rights of our NEOs with respect to post-employment compensation upon specific events, including death, disability, severance or retirement, or a change in control of the Company, are covered by these two programs. 
We use plans, rather than individually negotiated agreements, to provide severance and change in control payments and benefits for several reasons. First, a "plan" approach provides us with the flexibility to change the terms of these arrangements from time to time. An employment agreement would require that the affected NEO consent to any changes. Second, this approach is more transparent, both internally and externally. Internal transparency eliminates the need to negotiate severance or other employment separation payments and benefits on a case-by-case basis. In addition, it assures each of our NEOs that the severance payments and benefits he receives are comparable to one another. 
As previously noted, our executive officers, including the NEOs, except for our CEO, are eligible for severance payments and benefits in the event of an involuntary termination of employment without "cause." These executive officers and our CEO are also eligible for "double trigger" severance payments and benefits in the event of an involuntary termination of employment without "cause" or a termination of employment with "good reason" in connection with a change in control of the Company. Our equity awards are also designed to be "double trigger," so long as such awards are allowed to continue in effect following any change in control transaction on substantially equivalent terms and conditions to those applicable prior to such transaction.

The payment of these awards at target achievement rewards the executive officer for his or her expected performance prior to the change in control transaction. 
For detailed information on the estimated potential payments and benefits payable to the NEOs in the event of their termination of employment, including following a change in control of the Company, see "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
We generally do not provide our executive officers, including the NEOs, with perquisites or other personal benefits, except for the use of Company aircraft, Company-provided cars and drivers, executive physicals and, in the case of our CEO and Vice Chairman, security services. These items are provided because we believe that they serve a necessary business purpose and represent an immaterial element of our executive compensation program. The cost allocated to the personal use of Company-provided cars and drivers, including commuting expenses, the cost of the executive physicals, and the incremental cost associated with the security services, to the extent not reimbursed to us, are reported in the Summary Compensation Table. Our executive officers, including the NEOs, are required to reimburse us for the incremental cost of any personal use of Company aircraft. 
We do not provide tax reimbursements or any other tax payments with respect to perquisites, including excise tax "gross-ups," to any of our executive officers. 
Perquisites and other personal benefits represent an immaterial element of our executive compensation program. 
Other Compensation Related Policies 
In addition to the other components of our executive compensation program, we maintain the policies described below. These policies are consistent with evolving best practices and help confirm that our executive compensation program does not encourage our executive officers to engage in behaviors that are beyond our ability to effectively identify and manage risk. 
Clawback Policy 
Our clawback policy covers all executive officers (including the NEOs), applies to all incentive-based compensation (including stock options and other equity awards) paid to or in respect of an executive officer, and includes separate triggers for material financial restatements and improper conduct (including failure to report). The policy provides that if (i) the Company is required to undertake a material restatement of any financial statements filed with the SEC or (ii) an executive officer engages in improper conduct that either has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a significant adverse reputational or economic impact on the Company or any of its affiliates or divisions, then the Board may, in its sole discretion, after evaluating the associated costs and benefits, seek to recover all or any portion of the incentive-based compensation paid to any such executive officer during the three-year period preceding the restatement, or the occurrence of the improper conduct, as the case may be. 
The policy also requires us to disclose to our shareholders, not later than the filing of the next proxy statement, the action taken by the Board, or the Board's decision not to take action, with regard to compensation recovery following the occurrence of a material restatement or improper conduct, so long as such event has been previously disclosed in our SEC filings. 
For purposes of the policy, a "restatement" means any material restatement (occurring after the effective date of the policy) of any of the Company's financial statements that have been filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. "Improper conduct" means willful misconduct (including, but not limited to, fraud, bribery or other illegal acts) or gross negligence, which, in either case, includes any failure to report properly, or to take appropriate remedial action with respect to, such misconduct or gross negligence by another person. 
Other Long-Term Compensation Recovery Policies 
We maintain a "resignation notice period" requirement as part of the terms and conditions of all long-term incentive awards granted to certain designated grades of executives, including the NEOs. The requirement is applicable to awards granted in 2015 and subsequent years. The requirement is intended to reduce the adverse and disruptive effect of a sudden voluntary departure

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
           Compensation Discussion and Analysis

[END TABLE]
 of an executive subject to the requirement, and requires him or her to provide notice for a specified period prior to the effective date of a voluntary resignation, or otherwise risk forfeiting his or her outstanding long-term incentive awards. 
The terms and conditions of long-term incentive awards also provide for forfeiture in the event a recipient violates applicable non-solicitation or non-competition agreements. 
Process for Approving Long-Term Incentive Awards 
The Committee approves long-term incentive awards (including stock options, book value units, performance shares, performance units and restricted stock units) on an annual basis at its regularly scheduled February meeting. 
The Committee has delegated authority to management to approve long-term incentive awards for new hires, promotions, and retention purposes within specified limits to employees below the level of senior vice president. The Committee approves any long-term incentive awards to newly hired or promoted senior executives. From time to time, the Committee may make special long-term incentive awards to recognize major milestones or in situations involving a leadership transition. For example, in November 2018, the Committee granted a long-term incentive award to Mr. Strangfeld upon his retirement as CEO in respect of the 2018 performance year. 
Under the terms of our 2016 Omnibus Plan, which was approved by shareholders in 2016, stock options are required to be priced at the fair market value of our Common Stock on the date of grant, which is based on the closing market price of our Common Stock on the date of grant. Beginning in February 2019, the number of shares of our Common Stock subject to a stock option grant to an individual is determined by dividing the compensation value of the grant by the fair value of each stock option based on the closing market price of our Common Stock on the NYSE on the grant date. Beginning in February 2019, the number of performance shares and units or restricted stock units awarded to an individual is determined by a formula that divides the compensation value of the award by the closing market price of our Common Stock on the NYSE on the grant date. Previously, the fair value of stock options and the number of performance shares and units and restricted stock units awarded was based on the average closing market price of our Common Stock on the NYSE for the final 20-day trading period in the month prior to the grant date. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
We have adopted stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers to encourage them to build their ownership position in our Common Stock over time by direct market purchases, making investments available through the PESP and the Deferred Compensation Plan, and retaining shares they earn under their long-term incentive awards. The guidelines are framed in terms of stock value as a percentage of base salary as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Position    Stock Value as a Percentage of Base Salary   
Position    Stock Value as a Percentage of Base Salary   
   Chief Executive Officer               700%          
   Chief Executive Officer               700%          
   Chief Executive Officer               700%          
   Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President               300%          
   Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President               300%          
   Vice Chairman and Executive Vice President               300%          
   Senior Vice President               200%          
   Senior Vice President               200%          
   Senior Vice President               200%          
[END TABLE]
Each of the NEOs meets his individual stock ownership level, with the exception of Messrs. Lowrey and Tanji due to their promotions as of December 1, 2018. Under the current stock ownership guidelines, once an executive officer attains his or her individual ownership level, he or she will remain in compliance with the guidelines despite future changes in our stock price and base salary, as long as his or her holdings do not decline below the number of shares at the time the stock ownership guidelines were met. 
Stock Retention Requirements 
We have adopted stock retention requirements for our executive officers. Each executive officer is required to retain 50% of the net shares (after payment of the applicable exercise price (if any), fees, and taxes) acquired upon the exercise of stock options or the payment or vesting of any performance shares and restricted stock units. The executive officer is required to hold such shares until the later of one year following the date of acquisition of such shares (even if this one-year holding period extends beyond termination of employment) or the date that he or she satisfies our stock ownership guidelines.

Prohibition of Derivatives Trading, and Hedging and Pledging of Our Securities 
Our Board has adopted a policy prohibiting all employees, including the NEOs, and members of the Board from engaging in any hedging transactions with respect to any of our equity securities held by them, which includes the purchase of any financial instrument (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds) designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of such equity securities. 
Our Board has also adopted a policy prohibiting our Section 16 officers and members of the Board from pledging, or using as collateral, our securities to secure personal loans or other obligations, which includes holding shares of our Common Stock in a margin account. 
POLICY ON RULE 10b5-1 TRADING PLANS 
We have a policy governing the use by executive officers of pre-established trading plans for sales of our Common Stock and exercises of stock options for shares of our Common Stock. We believe our Rule 10b5-1 policy reflects best practice and is effective in complying with legal requirements. Under the policy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All Rule 10b5-1 trading plans must be  pre-cleared by our law and compliance departments.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A trading plan may be entered into, modified or terminated only during an open trading window and while not in possession of  material non-public information.    
[END TABLE]

• No trade may occur for the first 30 days after the trading plan is established. No modification or termination of a plan may  affect any trade scheduled to occur within 30 days.    
[END TABLE]
DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits a publicly held corporation's ability to take a tax deduction for compensation paid to certain executive officers ("covered employees") in excess of $1 million. Prior to 2018, certain performance-based compensation was exempt from the $1 million deduction limit. This performance-based exception was repealed for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to covered employees in excess of $1 million after 2017 is not tax deductible, unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. The Company intends to avail itself of this transition relief, to the extent applicable, for compensation paid pursuant to written, binding contracts that were in effect on November 2, 2017. Notwithstanding changes to the tax deductibility requirements of Section 162(m), the Committee continues to believe that a significant portion of our executive officers' compensation should be tied to measures of performance of our businesses. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this Proxy Statement. Based on its review and these discussions, the Compensation Committee has recommended to our Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

2018 CEO Pay Ratio 
In accordance with SEC rules, for 2018, we determined the annual total compensation of our median compensated employee and present a comparison of that annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our CEO. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The 2018 annual total compensation of our CEO was $26,634,837. This reflects a combination of the total compensation of  Messrs. Lowrey and Strangfeld for the period they each served as CEO in 2018.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The 2018 annual total compensation of our median compensated employee was $104,092.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Accordingly, the ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our median  compensated employee for 2018 was 256 to 1*.    
[END TABLE]
*This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of the SEC's Regulation S-K.

 Determining the Median Compensated Employee      Jurisdictions Excluded from Employee Population (number of employees estimated as of October 1, 2017)   
 To calculate the 2018 CEO pay ratio, we used the same median compensated employee that we used for purposes of calculating the 2017 CEO pay  ratio, as there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact the CEO pay ratio.   As described more completely in our 2018 Proxy Statement, to determine this median compensated employee:      We collected compensation data  for all employees as of October 1, 2017, excluding employees in countries that, in the aggregate, comprise less than 5% of our global employee population (considered de minimis under SEC rules). We also excluded from this  population independent contractors and other individuals classified as non-employees in their respective jurisdictions based on our employment and payroll tax records;      We included data for employees in  the following six countries, comprising 95.6% of our global employee population: the United States, Japan, Ireland, Taiwan, Brazil, and Korea. This excludes approximately 2,000 employees from 14 jurisdictions, as shown in the table on the right. As  of October 1, 2017, Prudential had an aggregate of 44,857 employees, of which 18,311 were U.S. employees and 26,546 were non-U.S. employees.

• We used "Total Cash Pay" as our compensation measure, which, for these purposes, included base salary, short-term  incentive payments (e.g., payments under our Annual Incentive Program), cash commissions and other similar payments. We annualized Total Cash Pay for permanent employees hired during the period and did not make any cost-of-living adjustments.  
[END TABLE]
Our "median compensated employee" is an individual who earned Total Cash Pay at the midpoint, that is, the point at which half of the global employee population earned more Total Cash Pay and half of the global employee population earned less Total Cash Pay.

Determining 2018 Annual Total Compensation 
We determined 2018 annual total compensation for our median compensated employee by obtaining compensation data for this employee for 2018 consistent with the methodology we use to calculate total compensation for 2018 as it appears in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. Accordingly, it includes base salary earned and paid from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, non-equity incentive plan payments made for the performance period January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, equity incentives and options awards granted during the fiscal year, and other compensation earned and/or paid in 2018, such as Company contributions to retirement savings plans. In addition, for purposes of calculating the CEO pay ratio, SEC rules permit us to include in annual total compensation any compensation and benefits made available to employees broadly, such as medical and dental benefits. We elected to include amounts representing employer medical and dental contributions in determining the 2018 annual total compensation of our median employee. 
Messrs. Lowrey and Strangfeld each served as CEO in 2018. For purposes of the 2018 CEO pay ratio, we calculated our CEO's annual total compensation for 2018 by adding Mr. Strangfeld's annual total compensation as reflected in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table (but excluding the amount he received for service as a non-employee Director in December 2018) to Mr. Lowrey's salary as CEO starting December 1, 2018. We also included an amount representing their pro-rata portions of employer medical and dental contributions. 
The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and apply various assumptions and, as a result, the pay ratio reported by us may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies.

(2)  The amounts reported in the Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards columns represent  performance shares and performance units awarded to the NEOs under the Omnibus Plan in 2018. Performance share and performance unit awards are granted for a three-year performance period with payout determined at the end of the period based on our  performance against our ROE goals. The ROE goals for the 2018 grant are within a range of 10% and 14%.

(3)  The amounts reported in the All Other Option Awards column represent the number of stock options granted to each  NEO under the Omnibus Plan in 2018. These stock options vest one-third each year on the anniversary of the grant date. These stock options expire 10 years from their respective grant date. The exercise price for the February 13, 2018 and  November 30, 2018 grants of stock options is the closing price of our Common Stock on the grant dates of February 13, 2018 ($106.89 per share) and November 30, 2018 ($93.76), respectively.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  The amounts in the Grant Date Fair Value column have been calculated in the case of performance shares and  performance units as the target number of performance shares and performance units multiplied by the closing price of our Common Stock on the grant date of February 13, 2018 ($106.89 per share) and November 30, 2018 ($93.76), respectively.   
[END TABLE]
For stock options, the grant date fair values are hypothetical values developed under a binomial option pricing model, which is a complex, mathematical formula to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant. The binomial option pricing model is a flexible, lattice-based valuation model that takes into consideration transferability, fixed estimate of volatility, and expected life of the options. As such, the amounts reported in the table are hypothetical values and may not reflect the actual economic value the NEO would realize upon exercise. 
We made the following assumptions when calculating the grant date fair value of the stock option grants: exercise price is equal to our share price on the grant date, and for the grants of February 13, 2018, 5.49 year life expected for each option, expected dividend yield is 2.88%, risk-free rate of return of 2.59%, and expected price volatility of 35.39%.

Pension Benefits 
The following table provides information on the defined benefit retirement plans in which the NEOs participate, including the present value of accumulated benefits as of December 31, 2018, except as noted, payable for each of the NEOs under each of these plans determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in our consolidated financial statements; namely, the RP 2014 generational mortality table with white collar adjustments and an adjustment to reflect recent Prudential-specific experience and an interest discount rate of 4.30%. Cash Balance Formula accounts are assumed to grow with interest based on assumed 30-year Treasury Rate, but not less than 4.25%, and PSI Cash Balance Formula accounts are assumed to grow with interest at 5.00% until commencement of pension benefits. No additional earnings or service after December 31, 2018 are included in the calculation of the accumulated benefits.

The Merged Retirement Plan 
Our wholly owned subsidiary, The Prudential Insurance Company of America, sponsors our tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plan, The Prudential Merged Retirement Plan (the "Merged Retirement Plan"), which is available to our executive officers, including the NEOs, and other salaried U.S. employees. The Merged Retirement Plan has two formulas under which participants may have their retirement benefits for ongoing service determined: the "Traditional Pension Formula" or the "Cash Balance Formula." In addition, employees who previously worked for Prudential Securities Incorporated also have retirement benefits for their service with Prudential Securities Incorporated under a third component of the Merged Retirement Plan: the "PSI Cash Balance Formula." 
TRADITIONAL PENSION FORMULA 
Under the Traditional Pension Formula, employees are fully vested in their accrued benefits. These benefits (which are subject to Internal Revenue Code limits) are determined using the following formula, which is based on Average Eligible Earnings (as defined) and years of Credited Service (as defined): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1.35% x Average Eligible Earnings up to Covered Compensation + 2.00% x Average Eligible Earnings in excess of Covered  Compensation) × Years of Credited Service up to  25 years + (0.75% x Average Eligible Earnings up to  Covered Compensation + 1.00% x Average  Eligible Earnings in excess of Covered Compensation) × Years of Credited Service for the next 13 years + 1.00% x Average Eligible Earnings × Years of Credited Service in excess of 38 years

 (1.35% x Average Eligible Earnings up to Covered Compensation + 2.00% x Average Eligible Earnings in excess of Covered  Compensation) × Years of Credited Service up to  25 years + (0.75% x Average Eligible Earnings up to  Covered Compensation + 1.00% x Average  Eligible Earnings in excess of Covered Compensation) × Years of Credited Service for the next 13 years + 1.00% x Average Eligible Earnings × Years of Credited Service in excess of 38 years

 (1.35% x Average Eligible Earnings up to Covered Compensation + 2.00% x Average Eligible Earnings in excess of Covered  Compensation) × Years of Credited Service up to  25 years + (0.75% x Average Eligible Earnings up to  Covered Compensation + 1.00% x Average  Eligible Earnings in excess of Covered Compensation) × Years of Credited Service for the next 13 years + 1.00% x Average Eligible Earnings × Years of Credited Service in excess of 38 years

[END TABLE]
For a separation from service in 2018, Average Eligible Earnings are determined by taking the average of earnings (base salary plus annual incentive payment) over the period beginning January 1, 2011, and ending on the date of separation after dropping the lowest two years of earnings in that period. Under the Traditional Pension Formula, the starting point for the averaging period is moved forward two years on January 1 of every even calendar year. "Covered Compensation" for a year is the average of the Social Security wage bases for the 35 years ending in the year the participant will reach Social Security normal retirement age. Benefits are payable as early as age 55 (with a reduction in benefits) as a single life annuity if not married or an actuarially equivalent 50% joint and survivor annuity if married. 
Generally, a participant's benefit will be determined as the greater of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the benefit as determined above calculated at the time of separation from service;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the benefit as determined above calculated as of January 1, 2002, plus all or a portion of the Supplemental Retirement  Plan benefit calculated as of January 1, 2002; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the Supplemental Retirement Plan benefit is to be paid in the form of an annuity, the benefit as determined above  calculated as of January 1, 2012 (including any adjustment in the benefit on January 1, 2002 as described in the previous bullet), plus all or a portion of the Supplemental Retirement Plan benefit calculated as of January 1, 2012.  (Messrs. Strangfeld and Pelletier each elected to receive their Supplemental Retirement Plan benefit in the form of a lump sum; consequently, this provision does not apply to them.)  
[END TABLE]
Additional benefits are provided to participants who are eligible to retire upon separation from service. A participant is eligible to retire if he or she separates from service either: (a) after attainment of age 55 (with 10 years of vesting service) or age 65 or (b) due to an involuntary termination (other than for cause or exhausting short-term disability benefits) after attainment of age 50 (with 20 years of continuous service). 
If a participant is eligible to retire, he or she is eligible for survivor benefits (with no actuarial reduction), a lesser (or no) reduction in benefit for benefit commencement before age 65, and an additional benefit paid to age 65.

The benefits reported in the Pension Benefits Table above are assumed to commence in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity on the later of January 1, 2019 and the date the participant is eligible for an unreduced benefit, i.e., the earlier of (i) the first of the month on or following the later of attainment of age 60 and 30 years of service and (ii) the first of the month on or following attainment of age 65 ("Normal Retirement Date"). 
CASH BALANCE FORMULA 
The Cash Balance Formula was added to the Merged Retirement Plan in 2001 for employees hired on or after January 1, 2001, except employees of Prudential Securities Incorporated. At that time, we offered a one-time conversion election for the current Merged Retirement Plan participants with benefits under the Traditional Pension Formula to opt to have their individual retirement benefits determined under the Cash Balance Formula. Participants who made this election to use the Cash Balance Formula are fully vested in their Cash Balance Formula benefit. Otherwise, participants are generally vested in their Cash Balance Formula benefit after three years of service. 
Cash Balance Formula benefits (which are subject to Internal Revenue Code limits) are computed using a cash balance methodology that provides for credits to be made to a hypothetical account that is allocated basic credits equal to 2% to 14% (depending on age and service) of base salary and annual incentive payments. Interest credits are made to the hypothetical account each month using an interest rate set each year based on the average yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury securities (constant maturities) for October of the prior year, with a minimum rate of 4.25%. The rate in effect for 2018 was 4.25%. 
Active participants on June 30, 2003 received an additional credit equal to his or her Supplemental Retirement Plan Cash Balance Formula benefit determined as of January 1, 2002, if any. Active participants on June 30, 2012 received an additional credit of no more than his or her Supplemental Retirement Plan Cash Balance Formula benefit determined as of April 1, 2012, if any. 
Benefits are payable at any time after separation of service as a lump sum amount (based on the account balance) or an actuarially equivalent single life annuity; 50%, 75%, or 100% joint and survivor annuity; or 50% contingent annuity. Employees who made the one-time conversion election to use the Cash Balance Formula (specifically, Messrs. Tanji, Falzon, Grier and Sleyster) have a frozen "Grandfathered Benefit" determined as the accrued benefit under the Traditional Pension Formula as of January 1, 2002. The value of the Grandfathered Benefit, and early retirement subsidies on this benefit, if applicable, are included in determining the payable benefit. 
As reported in the Pension Benefits Table, cash balance accounts are assumed to grow with interest until, and benefits will commence on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for Messrs. Strangfeld and Pelletier (whose Cash Balance Formula benefits are due only to the Demutualization Credit), the  same date benefits are assumed to commence under the Traditional Pension Formula; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for Messrs. Lowrey, Tanji, Falzon, Grier and Sleyster, the participant's Normal Retirement Date.  
[END TABLE]
Benefits are assumed to commence in a form that is based on a value comparison between a lump sum and a 50% joint and survivor annuity. 
PSI CASH BALANCE FORMULA 
The PSI Cash Balance Formula applies only to employees who previously worked for Prudential Securities Incorporated. At this time, all participants are fully vested in their PSI Cash Balance Formula benefit. Messrs. Tanji, Falzon and Pelletier are the only NEOs with a benefit under this formula. 
PSI Cash Balance Formula benefits (which are subject to Internal Revenue Code limits) are computed using a cash balance methodology that provides for credits to be made to a hypothetical account. Prior to January 1, 2004, the hypothetical accounts were allocated basic credits equal to 1.7% to 7% (depending on age and service) of eligible earnings. Since then, interest credits only have been made to the hypothetical account each month using an interest rate set each year, with a minimum rate of 5.00%. The rate in effect for 2018 was 5.00%. 
Benefits are payable at any time after separation of service as a lump sum amount (based on the account balance) or an actuarially equivalent single life annuity; 50%, 75%, or 100% joint and survivor annuity; 50% or 100% contingent annuity; or single life annuity with five or 10 years guaranteed.

As reported in the Pension Benefits Table, PSI Cash Balance accounts are assumed to grow with interest until, and benefits will commence on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for Messrs. Tanji and Falzon, the participant's Normal Retirement Date; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for Mr. Pelletier, the same date benefits are assumed to commence under the Traditional Pension Formula.   
[END TABLE]
Benefits are assumed to commence with 90% of participants electing a lump sum and 10% electing a 50% joint and survivor annuity. 
The Supplemental Retirement Plan and SERPs 
The Supplemental Retirement Plan is a non-qualified retirement plan designed to complement the Merged Retirement Plan by providing benefits to all participants of the Merged Retirement Plan, including the NEOs, who are prohibited from receiving additional benefits under the Merged Retirement Plan because of Internal Revenue Code limits. Benefits under the Supplemental Retirement Plan are generally payable at the earlier of six months after separation from service and age 65. Under a special rule applicable to the Supplemental Retirement Plan, benefits are required to begin to be paid to a home office participant following attainment of age 65, regardless of whether he or she has separated from service. 
The Prudential Insurance Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the PFI Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (collectively, the "Prudential SERPs") provide "Early Retirement Benefits" to certain eligible executives, including the NEOs, subject to the approval of our Board and the Committee. Early Retirement Benefits are designed to recognize the service and contributions of eligible executives who are involuntarily terminated by exempting them from the reduction factor for early retirement between the ages of 55 and 65, a reduction of up to 50%, which would otherwise be applicable under the Traditional Pension Formula and the Grandfathered Benefit under the Cash Balance Formula of the Merged Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan. Benefits under the Prudential SERPs are generally payable at the earlier of six months after separation from service and age 65. 
No NEO is currently eligible for benefits under the Early Retirement Benefits provision. Upon an involuntary termination of employment, Messrs. Lowrey, Strangfeld, Tanji, Grier, and Pelletier will not be eligible for benefits under the Early Retirement Benefits provision due to a variety of factors; Messrs. Falzon and Sleyster are potentially eligible for benefits under the Early Retirement Benefits provision. However, were Mr. Falzon or Mr. Sleyster to qualify for Early Retirement Benefits, only the Grandfathered Benefit portion of their benefits would not be subject to reduction. 
In 2008, the NEOs (with the exception of Mr. Lowrey) were permitted to make an irrevocable election regarding the form of payment for their pension benefits and each NEO (with the exception of Mr. Falzon and Mr. Sleyster) elected to receive his Supplemental Retirement Plan and Prudential SERPs benefits, if any, in a lump sum. 
The Prudential Securities Incorporated Supplemental Retirement Plan for Executives ("PSI SERP") was designed to make it more attractive to certain key executives to remain employees of Prudential Securities Incorporated and its subsidiaries. Mr. Pelletier is the only NEO that is accruing benefits under the PSI SERP. Mr. Pelletier's PSI SERP benefit will be paid as an annuity upon separation from service, irrespective of age. The PSI SERP benefit is determined as a target benefit, less the benefit payable from the PSI Cash Balance Formula and an estimated Social Security retirement benefit. The target benefit is 60% of an employee's average salary times a ratio of service to 30 years. Mr. Pelletier stopped accruing service credit under this plan upon his transfer to Prudential from Prudential Securities Incorporated. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, benefits reported in the Pension Benefits Table are assumed to commence in the form of payment elected for this benefit, either an annuity or a lump sum, and at the same time as under the Merged Retirement Plan benefit to be consistent with assumptions used in the Company's financial statements.

[END TABLE]
SESP 
The SESP is a non-qualified profit-sharing plan designed to provide benefits in excess of amounts permitted to be contributed under the PESP. It allows employees, including the NEOs, to elect to defer from 1% to 4% of their eligible earnings paid after the Code limit is exceeded in the year ($275,000 in 2018) to a hypothetical recordkeeping account on a pre-tax basis through payroll deduction. We match 100% of an employee's deferrals. Eligible earnings for the NEOs under the SESP are limited to base salary only. Interest is earned on a participant's account at the same rate as the Fixed Rate Fund under the PESP. This rate is generally set quarterly within a calendar year, and the rate in effect for each quarter of 2018 was 3.50%. A participant's account is distributed to the employee six months after the participant's separation from service. 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
The Deferred Compensation Plan is a non-qualified, unfunded plan that provides certain designated executives in the United States, including the NEOs, with the ability to defer taxation on up to 85% of their annual cash incentive awards. Deferrals may be invested in notional funds that generally mirror the PESP fund offerings, including shares of our Common Stock.

Potential Payments upon 
Termination or Change in Control 
The following table presents, for each of the NEOs, the estimated payments and benefits that would have been payable as of the end of 2018 in the event of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• voluntary termination of employment;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• involuntary termination of employment without cause;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• separation due to disability; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• separation due to death.  
[END TABLE]
Consistent with SEC requirements, these estimated amounts have been calculated as if the NEO's employment had been terminated as of December 31, 2018, the last business day of 2018, and using the closing market price of our Common Stock on December 31, 2018 ($81.55 per share). 
Retirement eligibility differs according to the employment separation event. The following table assumes that benefits are paid in an annuity form and commence on January 1, 2019, unless stated otherwise. The table also assumes Board approval of various payments and Prudential SERP Early Retirement Benefits, as applicable, for all NEOs. 
The following items have been excluded from the table: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The benefits the NEOs would be entitled to receive under the SESP and the Deferred Compensation Plan (these benefits are  disclosed in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table contained in this Proxy Statement).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Additional payments to the NEOs under the PESP, The Prudential Welfare Benefits Plan and The Prudential Retiree Welfare  Benefits Plan (plans providing, among other things, life insurance, disability insurance, medical insurance and/or dental insurance), which do not discriminate in scope, terms, or operation in favor of the NEOs and are generally available to all  salaried employees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The effects of an involuntary termination of employment for cause, which will result in a forfeiture of all outstanding  vested and unvested performance shares, performance units, book value units, restricted stock units, and stock options, and for Mr. Pelletier, potential forfeiture of the benefit under the PSI SERP. The NEOs will receive no additional payments  in the event of a termination of employment for cause.  
[END TABLE]
The amounts reported in the following table are hypothetical amounts based on the disclosure of compensation information about the NEOs. Actual payments and benefits will depend on the circumstances and timing of any termination of employment or other triggering event.

General Information About The Meeting 
Voting Instructions and Information 
Who Can Vote 
You are entitled to vote your Common Stock if our records show that you held your shares as of the record date of March 15, 2019. At the close of business on that date, a total of 408,333,715 shares of Common Stock were outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote at this Annual Meeting. Your voting instructions are confidential and will not be disclosed to persons other than those recording the vote, except if you make a written comment on the proxy card, otherwise communicate your vote to management, as may be required in accordance with the appropriate legal process, or as authorized by you. 
Voting Your Proxy 
If your Common Stock is held through a broker, bank or other nominee (held in street name), you will receive instructions from such entity that you must follow in order to have your shares voted. If you want to vote in person, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, bring it to the meeting, and submit it with your vote. 
If you hold your shares in your own name as a holder of record with our transfer agent, Computershare, you may instruct the proxies how to vote by following the instructions listed on the Notice of Internet Availability or the proxy card to vote online, or by signing, dating and mailing the proxy card in the postage-paid envelope. Of course, you can always come to the meeting and vote your shares in person. 
Whichever method you select to transmit your instructions, the proxies will vote your shares in accordance with those instructions. Except as discussed below with respect to shares held in certain Company plans, if you sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors: FOR each director nominee, FOR ratification of the appointment of the independent auditor, FOR the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation, and AGAINST the shareholder proposal regarding the Right to Act by Written Consent. 
Special Voting Instructions for Plan Shares 
If you are a participant in The Prudential Employee Savings Plan ("PESP") and your account is invested in the PFI Common Stock Fund, you may instruct the PESP Trustee how to vote the shares of Common Stock credited to your PESP account and held in the Fund on March 13, 2019. The PESP Trustee, the shareholder of record, will vote these shares in accordance with your instructions or, if you do not provide voting instructions, in the same proportion as the PESP Trustee votes the shares for which it received timely voting instructions subject to the terms of the PESP plan document, its trust agreement and applicable law. If you hold shares of Common Stock through your participation in the international portion of the Prudential Stock Purchase Plan, the Prudential International Stock Purchase Plan, or the international portion of the Associates Grants (covering vested shares of Prudential Financial, Inc. Common Stock) under the Prudential Financial, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Plan"), on March 15, 2019, those shares will be voted by the Plan administrator in accordance with your instructions or, if you do not provide voting instructions, in accordance with the Board of Directors' recommendation subject to the terms of the Plan and applicable law. 
Matters to be Presented 
We are not aware of any matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting other than those described in this Proxy Statement. If any matters not described in this Proxy Statement are properly presented at the meeting, the proxies will use their own judgment to determine how to vote your shares. If the meeting is adjourned or postponed, the proxies can vote your shares at the adjournment or postponement as well. 
Revoking Your Proxy 
If you hold your shares in street name, you must follow the instructions of your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your voting instructions. If you are a holder of record and wish to revoke your proxy instructions, you must deliver later-dated proxy

 instructions, advise the Chief Governance Officer and Corporate Secretary in writing before the proxies vote your shares at the Annual Meeting, or attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person. 
Quorum 
A quorum is required to transact business at our Annual Meeting. Shareholders of record holding shares of stock constituting 50% of the shares entitled to be cast shall constitute a quorum. If you have returned valid proxy instructions or attend the meeting in person, your shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether there is a quorum, even if you abstain from voting on some or all matters introduced at the meeting. In addition, broker non-votes will be treated as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. 
Voting Requirements 
You may either vote for, against or abstain on each of the proposals. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast is required to approve each proposal. Broker non-votes and abstentions will have no impact, as they are not counted as votes cast. 
Although the advisory vote in Item 3 is non-binding, as provided by law, our Board will review the results of the vote and, consistent with our commitment to shareholder engagement, will take the results into account in making a determination concerning our named executive officer compensation. If you hold your shares in street name, and you do not submit voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, your broker, bank or other nominee will not be permitted to vote your shares in their discretion on the election of directors, the advisory vote to approve executive compensation, or the shareholder proposal regarding the right to act by written consent, but may still be permitted to vote your shares in their discretion on the ratification of the independent auditor. 
Election of Directors 
At the meeting, each nominee must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her election in order to be elected. If an incumbent nominee is not elected by the requisite vote, he or she must tender his or her resignation, and the Board, through a process managed by the Corporate Governance and Business Ethics Committee, will decide whether to accept the resignation. 
BOARD RECOMMENDATIONS 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote "FOR" each of the Director Nominees, "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of the Independent Auditor, 
"FOR" the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation and "AGAINST" 
the shareholder proposal regarding the Right to Act by Written Consent 
Cost of Proxy Solicitation 
We are providing these proxy materials in connection with the solicitation by the Company's Board of Directors of proxies to be voted at our Annual Meeting. We will pay the cost of this proxy solicitation. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, we expect that a number of our employees will solicit shareholders personally, electronically and by telephone. None of these employees will receive any additional compensation for doing this. We have retained Georgeson, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $25,000 plus reimbursement of expenses. We will, on request, reimburse brokers, banks and other nominees for their expenses in sending proxy materials to their customers who are beneficial owners and obtaining their voting instructions. 
Attending the Annual Meeting 
If you attend the Annual Meeting, you will be asked to present valid, government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license. If you are a holder of record, the top half of your proxy card or your Notice of Internet Availability is your admission ticket. If you hold your shares in street name, you will need proof of ownership to be admitted to the meeting. A recent brokerage

 statement or a letter from your bank or broker are examples of proof of ownership. If you want to vote your shares held in street name in person, you must get a legal proxy in your name from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares, and submit it with your vote. 
Attendance at the Annual Meeting is limited to shareholders of Prudential as of the record date. Each shareholder may appoint only one proxy holder or representative to attend the Annual Meeting on his or her behalf. 
Submission of Shareholder Proposals and Director Nominations 
Proposals and Director Nominations for Inclusion in the Proxy Statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting 
In order to submit shareholder proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders for inclusion in our Proxy Statement pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8, materials must be received by the Chief Governance Officer and Corporate Secretary at the Company's principal office in Newark, NJ (see below), no later than the close of business on November 29, 2019. 
We have adopted proxy access, which permits a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning 3% or more of the Company's outstanding capital stock for at least three years, to submit director nominees for up to 20% of the Board for inclusion in our Proxy Statement if the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) meet the requirements in our By-laws. Notice of director nominations submitted under these proxy access By-law provisions must be received no earlier than December 16, 2019 and no later than January 15, 2020. However, if the 2020 Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before or after the first anniversary of the date of this year's Annual Meeting, such notice must be received no later than the close of business on the 10th day following the earlier of the day on which notice of the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the meeting date was made. 
Proposals submitted for inclusion in our Proxy Statement must comply with all of the requirements of SEC Rule 14a-8, and director nominations submitted pursuant to the proxy access provisions of our By-laws must comply with all of the requirements of our By-laws, a copy of which may be obtained at no cost from the Chief Governance Officer and Corporate Secretary. As the rules of the SEC and our By-laws make clear, simply submitting a proposal or nomination does not guarantee its inclusion. 
Other Proposals or Director Nominations for Presentation at the 2020 Annual Meeting 
Our By-laws also establish an advance notice procedure with regard to director nominations and shareholder proposals that are not submitted for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, but that a shareholder instead wishes to present directly at an Annual Meeting. To be properly brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting, a notice of the nomination or the matter the shareholder wishes to present at the meeting must be delivered to the Chief Governance Officer and Corporate Secretary at the Company's principal office (see below) not less than 120 or more than 150 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of this year's Annual Meeting. As a result, any notice given by or on behalf of a shareholder pursuant to these provisions of the Company's By-laws (and not pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8) must be received no earlier than December 16, 2019 and no later than January 15, 2020. However, if the 2020 Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before or after the first anniversary of the date of this year's Annual Meeting, such notice must be received no later than the close of business on the 10th day following the earlier of the day on which notice of the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the meeting date was made. All director nominations and shareholder proposals must comply with the requirements of the Company's By-laws. The Chairman may refuse to acknowledge or introduce any such matter at the 2020 Annual Meeting if notice of the matter is not received within the applicable deadlines or does not comply with the Company's By-laws. If a shareholder does not meet these deadlines, or does not satisfy the requirements of Rule 14a-4 of the Exchange Act, the persons named as proxies will be allowed to use their discretionary voting authority when and if the matter is raised at the 2020 Annual Meeting. 
All proposals and director nominations should be addressed to: Margaret M. Foran, Chief Governance Officer, Senior Vice President and Corporate Secretary, Prudential Financial, Inc., 751 Broad Street, Newark, NJ 07102. 
Eliminating Duplicative Proxy Materials 
A single Proxy Statement and Annual Report, along with individual proxy cards, or individual Notices of Internet Availability, will be delivered in one envelope to multiple shareholders having the same last name and address and to individuals with more than one account registered at Computershare with the same address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected shareholder.

APPENDIX A - Non-GAAP Measures 
Adjusted operating income ("AOI") and operating return on average equity are non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Adjusted book value is a non-GAAP measure of financial position. We use earnings per share based on AOI, operating return on average equity, and adjusted book value as performance measures in our incentive compensation programs. Also, we believe that our use of these non-GAAP measures helps investors understand and evaluate the Company's results of operations and financial position by providing measures that are primarily attributable to our business operations separate from the portion attributable to external and potentially volatile capital and currency market conditions. 
Adjusted Operating Income 
Adjusted operating income excludes "Realized investment gains (losses), net," as adjusted, and related charges and adjustments. A significant element of realized investment gains and losses are impairments and credit-related and interest rate-related gains and losses. Impairments and losses from sales of credit-impaired securities, the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles, can vary considerably across periods. The timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses, such as interest rate-related gains or losses, is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities as well as our tax and capital profile. 
Realized investment gains (losses) within certain of our businesses for which such gains (losses) are a principal source of earnings, and those associated with terminating hedges of foreign currency earnings and current period yield adjustments are included in adjusted operating income. Adjusted operating income generally excludes realized investment gains and losses from products that contain embedded derivatives, and from associated derivative portfolios that are part of an asset/liability management program related to the risk of those products. However, the effectiveness of our hedging program will ultimately be reflected in adjusted operating income over time. Adjusted operating income also excludes gains and losses from changes in value of certain assets and liabilities relating to foreign currency exchange movements that have been economically hedged or considered part of our capital funding strategies for our international subsidiaries, as well as gains and losses on certain investments that are designated as trading. Additionally, adjusted operating income excludes the changes in fair value of equity securities that are recorded in net income beginning on January 1, 2018 as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-01. 
Adjusted operating income also excludes investment gains and losses on assets supporting experience-rated contractholder liabilities and changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to asset value changes, because these recorded changes in asset and liability values are expected to ultimately accrue to contractholders. In addition, adjusted operating income excludes the results of divested and run-off businesses, which are not relevant to our ongoing operations. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, which is presented as a separate component of net income under GAAP, are also excluded from adjusted operating income. The tax effect associated with pre-tax adjusted operating income is based on applicable Internal Revenue Service and foreign tax regulations inclusive of pertinent adjustments.

Return on average equity (based on net income) was 8.2% and 16.0% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

GENDER PAY EQUITY STATEMENT Prudentials Total Rewards is integral to our employee value proposition. This package includes compensation, as well as programs and resources available to our employees. All roles in our U.S. organization are reviewed against market and benchmarking data. Our compensation structure and benefits package enables Prudential to recruit and promote talent within the context of an individuals background, experience and performance. PRUDENTIAL IS COMMITTED TO PAY EQUITY. THE COMPANYS POLICIES AND PRACTICES ADDRESS PAY DISCRIMINATION THROUGHOUT THE EMPLOYEES CAREER Recruiting Existing Employees Reduce likelihood that U.S. compensation decisions are perpetuating discriminatory pay practices of former employers. Nationally, Prudential removed compensation inquiries from its employment applications; and Stopped considering compensation history when establishing starting pay for new employees, except as required by law. Guided by independent legal counsel, Prudential conducts a review of its U.S. compensation practices to protect against systemic race/ethnicity and gender biased patterns, and takes action as warranted. Employees can raise issues regarding pay equity with the Ethics Office, Human Resources or their manager. These practices go beyond simple compliance with the laws of a limited number of states and cities. Pay discrimination concerns are promptly and thoroughly investigated by trained professionals dedicated to reviewing unlawful discrimination claims. This integrated approach ensures that we proactively review pay equity on an ongoing basis, and that we satisfy our heightened obligations as a federal contractor. As part of our annual human resources strategy update, our Board reviews the status of our pay practices and the broad range of our diversity and inclusion efforts. 
PRUDENTIAL IS HELPING INCREASE FINANCIAL WELLNESS FOR ALL Americans are facing daunting financial challenges requiring innovative solutions and collaboration among public, private and nonprofit sectors that reconnect the rewards of work with the ability to build wealth. Prudential cites these statistics in its white paper "Increasing Financial Security with Workplace Emergency Savings": 63 percent of Americans can't afford a $500 emergency and 31 percent of employees would consider retirement plan loans or withdrawals to cover those [unexpected] expenses. Prudential, a leader in the national dialogue to improve policies and practices enabling financial stability, mobility and prosperity for all, is doubling down on financial wellness. People achieve financial wellness when they adopt behaviors that help them manage day-to-day finances, realize financial goals, and protect against financial risks. 63% of Americans don't have enough savings to meet a $500 emergency* Prudential collaborated with Prosperity Now, a nonprofit organization that works to ensure everyone has a clear path to financial stability, wealth and prosperity, to design a solution to increase emergency savings by using payroll deductions to fund after-tax retirement contributions. Prudential Retirement(R) is now offering an in-plan, after-tax emergency savings feature to plan sponsors as part of their holistic workplace financial wellness package, which is inclusive and accessible to both low and high-income earners addressing the needs of American workers across all income brackets. The plan's unique feature enables participants to access funds with lower withdrawal fees and tax consequences versus pre-tax transactions helping them address emergencies. Eligible employees at Prudential have the opportunity to accumulate after-tax savings in the Prudential Employees Savings Plan (PESP). At a crucial time for many, Prudential is working hard to create realistic and accessible financial solutions to make people's lives better in an ever-changing world. We do this because we believe that companies can and should do more than generate profits we should help drive progress.* McGrath, Maggie; Forbes.com, "63% of Americans Don't Have Enough Savings to Cover a $500 Emergency," 2016 PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER WITH 10% POST-CONSUMER WASTE.

FAQ — Internet Availability of Proxy Materials 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued rules requiring public companies to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Make proxy materials (such as the Annual Report and Proxy Statement) available on the internet   
• Notify shareholders how and where to access those materials online  
[END TABLE]
These rules allow companies to give shareholders more options for reviewing important proxy materials. Information can be made available to shareholders more quickly and conveniently—online documents are easily searchable, enabling shareholders to quickly find the information they need to make informed voting decisions. 
The SEC also allows companies to send a one-page Notice to holders with instructions on how to access the materials online, rather than sending a full set of materials. Our reasons for choosing the notice-only option are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adopt more sustainable practices and be more environmentally responsible—by shrinking our carbon footprint  through reductions in ink and paper used in printing and fuel used in shipping  
• Increase shareholder value—by reducing print and mail costs  
[END TABLE]
Please refer to the information below to learn more and to find out what your options are as a shareholder to view materials and vote. 
What is on the one-page Notice? 
The Notice contains simple instructions on how to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Access and view the proxy materials online  
• Vote your shares online  
• Request a free set of printed materials  
• Change delivery preferences for future proxy mailings   
[END TABLE]
DO retain the Notice for future reference 
DO NOT mark your vote on the Notice and return it; the Notice is not a proxy card or ballot 
If I received only a one-page Notice, how do I vote my shares? 
To vote your shares, follow the instructions on the Notice to vote online. If you request a paper copy of the proxy materials, you'll receive a proxy card with voting instructions. You may also vote your shares in person by bringing the Notice with you and attending the meeting. 
If I received only a one-page Notice, how do I request a full set of printed materials for this meeting or future proxy mailings? 
To request a free set of printed materials for this meeting or for future mailings, refer to the Notice for detailed instructions on how to request a copy via internet, telephone or email. 
If I received a full set of materials, may I request only a one-page Notice for future proxy mailings? 
Our company will make a decision for each meeting whether or not to use the notice-only option, and send notice-only mailings at our discretion. 
Can I elect to receive my proxy materials electronically? 
You may elect to receive materials via email for future mailings. You will receive the materials electronically if our company chooses to offer email delivery in the future. To change your delivery preferences, follow the instructions on the Notice.

Douglas A. Scovanner, Prudential Financial, Inc. Board Member 
Margaret M. Foran, Chief Governance Officer, Senior Vice President, Corporate 
Secretary, Prudential Financial, Inc. 
Margaret Foran 
Hello. I am Margaret Foran, senior vice president, corporate secretary and chief governance officer at Prudential. Thank you for tuning in to watch this short video. 
Joining me is Doug Scovanner, Chairman of Prudential's Audit Committee. 
Doug, thank you very much for taking time to share your insight about Prudential's Board. 
Margaret Foran 
Can you tell me a bit about yourself? 
Douglas Scovanner 
After studying finance in graduate business school, I joined the Ford Motor Company. Over the following thirty-plus years, I held financial leadership positions at the Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola Enterprises, at the Fleming Companies, and finally at Target Corporation. I was Chief Financial Officer of Target for 18 years, as Target Stores grew to be a national retailer. Today, I am the Founder and Managing Member of Comprehensive Financial Strategies, a management consulting firm. 
I have been on the Prudential Board since 2013 and serve on several committees. Currently, I Chair the Audit Committee. 
Margaret Foran 
Can you tell me about the role of the Audit Committee and your role as Chair? 
Douglas Scovanner 
The primary purpose of the Audit Committee is to oversee the Company's financial reporting and related internal controls, and to ensure that the Company's auditor has the qualifications and independence necessary to perform the role successfully. In addition, the Audit Committee approves the report included in the Company's annual proxy statement. 
As Chair, I oversee and take ultimate responsibility for the work of the Audit Committee.  Margaret Foran 
Can you describe the Audit Committee's financial reporting and related internal controls? 
Douglas Scovanner 
The oversight of financial reporting and related internal controls is key to our work. As an example, we engage with management continuously to provide actionable insights to improve financial practices and reporting. 
Margaret Foran 
How would you describe Prudential's Board? 
Douglas Scovanner 
We are collaborative yet direct with each other. We work alongside the senior management team to define Prudential's mission and actively oversee Prudential's long-term strategy. 
If you look at our directors' profiles, you will see that our skills, perspectives, and experiences are extremely diverse. This is a result of a deliberate strategy and our belief that a board with diverse views, perspectives, and backgrounds—a board that reflects our company and our customer base—is better equipped to guide Prudential forward. 
Margaret Foran 
You also sit on the Risk Committee. Can you tell me about the role of the Risk Committee? 
Douglas Scovanner 
Appreciating the value of risk oversight, we created a separate Risk Committee in 2016. The Committee oversees the governance of significant risks throughout the enterprise. We do this by coordinating the risk oversight functions of each Board committee and ensuring that matters are appropriately elevated to the Board. 
Margaret Foran 
How has the board changed since you joined? 
Douglas Scovanner 
Due to our commitment to succession planning and board refreshment, our average director tenure is about seven years. Since I joined five years ago, we have added four directors with   extensive expertise in finance and capital allocation, Asian markets, and global corporate operations. 
Closing Douglas Scovanner 
I hope this gives our investors insight into our Board. I know I speak for the entire Board when I say that it is a privilege to serve as a director and that we are committed to achieving long-term performance and value for Prudential's shareholders. 
Margaret Foran 
Thank you again for your time, Doug.  Video Transcript Delivered For:

Theresa Molloy, Vice President, Prudential Financial, Inc. 
Theresa Molloy 
Hello. I am Theresa Molloy, vice president of corporate governance at Prudential. Thank you for tuning in to watch this short video. 
Joining me is Thomas Baltimore, Prudential's Lead Independent Director. 
Tom, thank you very much for taking time to share your insight about Prudential's Board. 
Theresa Molloy 
Tell me a little about your background. 
Thomas Baltimore 
I joined Prudential's Board in May 2008. Professionally, I have spent nearly my entire career in the hospitality industry. Prior to my current role as chairman and CEO of Park Hotels & Resorts, I was president and CEO of RLJ Lodging Trust, which I co-founded with Robert L. Johnson. Prior to RLJ, I was with Hilton Hotels. I started my hospitality career at Marriott. 
On a personal note, my wife Hillary and I are very involved in a local DC charity called N Street Village, a wonderful organization that empowers homeless and low-income women to attain the highest quality of life by offering them a broad spectrum of services in an atmosphere of dignity and respect.

Talk about your role as Lead Independent Director. 
Thomas Baltimore 
The Lead Independent Director is nominated by our independent peers for a term of one year but can serve up to three. 
At this year's annual meeting, I will start my third and final term.

What are the qualities that make Prudential's Board unique? 
Thomas Baltimore 
I joined Prudential's Board because I share many of the same values that are so important to the company, such as: 
A culture of integrity that cascades throughout the company's global enterprise; a commitment to social responsibility, which is evident here in Newark and communities worldwide, and a commitment to creating products that enhance our ability to bring long-term financial security to our existing and prospective customers. 
Theresa Molloy 
You mentioned culture. How would you describe Prudential's culture? 
Thomas Baltimore 
Our culture is one of our best assets. It is a competitive advantage and vital to the creation and protection of Prudential's long-term value. We spend a great deal of time discussing culture at our board meetings. In addition, senior leaders and their teams present their business strategies to us throughout the year. This exchange of ideas gives directors insight into how employees throughout the organization are aligned with the business model and our values. 
Within this context, I would distill our culture down to our values, our practices and our people. 
Theresa Molloy 
Prudential has been lauded for its governance best practices. Describe some of these practices and why they are important to shareholders.

What is the Board's view on talent management? 
Thomas Baltimore 
Talent management and succession planning are discussed at every board meeting. In September 2018, we announced a leadership transition that was the result of a rigorous, multi-year succession plan strategy. After much deliberation and exploration with a prominent search firm of possible external candidates, the Board reached a unanimous and confident decision to appoint Charlie Lowrey to the role of Chairman and CEO and to appoint Rob Falzon to the role of Vice Chairman. Rob and Charlie are outstanding executives with a long history of accomplishments at Prudential. Together they will continue to unlock the value in our strategic mix of high-quality businesses to put financial security within reach of our growing customer base. 
I hope this gives our investors perspective about our Board. I know I speak for the entire Board when I say that we are committed to working on behalf of our shareholders to achieve long-term performance and value for our company. 
Theresa Molloy – Thank you again for your time Tom.
