PROXY STATEMENT
FOR THE 2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
To Be Held Thursday, November 15, 2018
This Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card (the Proxy) are furnished to the stockholders of Jack Henry & Associates, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company), in connection with the solicitation of Proxies by the Company's Board of Directors for use at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and any adjournment or postponement thereof (the Annual Meeting), to be held at the City of Monett South Park Casino Building, 101 South Lincoln, Monett, Missouri, at 11:00 a.m. local time, on Thursday, November 15, 2018. The mailing of this Proxy Statement, the Proxy, the Notice of Annual Meeting and the accompanying 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders is expected to commence on or about October 5, 2018.
The Board of Directors does not intend to bring any matters before the Annual Meeting except those indicated in the Notice and does not know of any matter which anyone else proposes to present for action at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, however, the persons named in the accompanying form of Proxy, or their duly constituted substitutes, acting at the Annual Meeting, will be deemed authorized to vote or otherwise to act thereon in accordance with their judgment on such matters.
If the enclosed Proxy is properly executed and returned prior to voting at the Annual Meeting, the shares represented thereby will be voted in accordance with the instructions marked thereon.
Any stockholder executing a Proxy retains the power to revoke it at any time prior to the voting of the Proxy. It may be revoked by a stockholder personally appearing at the Annual Meeting and casting a contrary vote, by filing an instrument of revocation with the Secretary of the Company, or by the presentation at the Annual Meeting of a duly executed later dated Proxy.
VOTING
At the 2018 Annual Meeting, Stockholders will consider and vote upon:
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) The election of nine (9) directors to serve until the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; 
(2) Approval, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers; 
(3) To ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019; and 
(4) To transact such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournments thereof. 
[END TABLE]
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on September 21, 2018, the record date for the Annual Meeting, are entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting.
The Company's authorized capital stock currently consists of 250,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share (the Common Stock), and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share (the Preferred Stock). As of September 21, 2018, there were 77,266,476 shares of Common Stock outstanding and no shares of Preferred Stock outstanding. At such date, our executive officers and directors were entitled to vote, or to direct the voting of, shares of Common Stock representing 0.9% of the shares entitled to vote at the 2018 Annual Meeting. Unless otherwise specified, all share numbers and other share data have been adjusted to reflect all prior stock splits.  
All shares represented by Proxy and all Proxies solicited hereunder will be voted in accordance with the specifications made by the stockholders executing such Proxies. If a stockholder does not specify how a Proxy is to be voted, the shares represented thereby will be voted: (1) FOR the election as directors of the nine (9) persons nominated by the Board of Directors; (2) FOR approval of the compensation of our named executive officers; (3) FOR ratification of the selection of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm; and (4) upon other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting, in accordance with the discretion of the persons to whom the Proxy is granted.
Each share of our Common Stock outstanding on the record date will be entitled to one vote on each matter.
In an uncontested election, a Director nominee must be elected by a majority of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, regarding the election of that Director nominee. A "majority of the votes cast" for the purposes of Director elections means that the number of votes cast "For" a Director nominee's election exceeds the number of votes cast as "Withhold" for that Director nominee. If an incumbent Director is not re-elected in an uncontested election and no successor is elected at the same meeting, the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines require that such Director must offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board.
In a contested election, which occurs when the number of Director nominees exceeds the number of open seats on the Board, Director nominees will be elected by a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at the meeting. A "plurality" means that the open seats on the Board will be filled by those Director nominees who received the most affirmative votes, regardless of whether those Director nominees received a majority of the votes cast with respect to their election.
At the Annual Meeting, the election of Directors is considered to be uncontested because we have not been notified of any other nominees as required by our Restated and Amended Bylaws. To be elected, each Director nominee must receive a majority of votes cast regarding that nominee.
The approval of all other matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote. 
Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of Directors. For the purpose of determining whether the stockholders have approved other matters, abstentions are treated as shares present or represented and voting, so abstaining has the same effect as a negative vote. Shares held by brokers that do not have discretionary authority to vote on a particular matter and that have not received voting instructions from their customers are not counted or deemed to be present or represented for the purpose of determining whether stockholders have approved that matter, but they are counted as present for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum at the annual meeting. Please note that banks and brokers that have not received voting instructions from their clients cannot vote on their clients' behalf on "non-routine" proposals.

PROPOSAL 1     ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Procedure
At the meeting, the stockholders will elect nine (9) directors to hold office for one-year terms ending at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or until their successors are elected and qualified. The Board of Directors has nominated the Company's nine (9) current directors for re-election at the Annual Meeting.
The stockholders are entitled to one vote per share on each matter submitted to vote at any meeting of the Stockholders. Unless contrary instructions are given, the persons named in the enclosed Proxy or their substitutes will vote "FOR" the election of the nominees named below.
Each of the nominees has consented to serve as director. However, if any nominee at the time of election is unable to serve or is otherwise unavailable for election, and as a result other nominees are designated by the Board of Directors, the persons named in the enclosed Proxy or their substitutes intend to vote for the election of such designated nominees.
Director Qualifications and Selection
Under the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Governance Committee is charged with the responsibility for determining the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members and are to consider such factors as experience, strength of character, maturity of judgment, technical skills, diversity, and age in assessing the needs of the Board. The Guidelines specify that a majority of the members shall qualify as independent under applicable NASDAQ listing standards. While the term "diversity" is not specifically defined in the Guidelines and there is no formal policy regarding application of the term, it has been the practice of the Governance Committee to apply the term broadly, resulting in Board composition over the years that has reflected diversity in race, sex and age, as well as diversity in business experience and in representation of the markets served by the Company.
While the Company has a nomination policy by which stockholders may recommend to the Governance Committee certain prospective directors for consideration (See "Corporate Governance-Stockholder Recommended Director Candidates," below), to date no such recommendation has ever been received. If such a recommendation is received in the future, it will be evaluated in the same manner as any other recommendation to the Governance Committee. The Governance Committee nomination process varies depending upon the particular expertise and skill set sought by the Committee. The process can be informal, consisting of solicitation of suggestions of possible candidates from other Board members and management, contacting candidates to determine interest level, and in-person interviews to determine "fit." The Governance Committee has also used a more formal process utilizing a recruiting firm to identify candidates, screening of recommendations, followed by telephone and in-person interviews, background checks and Governance Committee evaluation and nomination. The Governance Committee will in the future continue to use a mix of formal and informal processes to identify appropriate candidates for the Board.
The Company's Board has also adopted a "Proxy Access for Director Nominations" bylaw. The proxy access bylaw permits a stockholder, or certain groups of stockholders, meeting the requirements contained in the proxy access bylaw to nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials Director nominees constituting up to two individuals or 20% of the Board (whichever is greater). See "Stockholder Nominated Director Candidates" on page 10 for more information.

The nominees for election as directors of the Company, as well as certain information about them, are as follows:

Director Independence
Seven of the nine nominated directors are independent. Non-employee directors Flanigan, Wilson, Fiegel, Wimsett, Kelly, Miyashiro and Brown qualify as "independent" in accordance with the published listing requirements of NASDAQ. Mr. Prim and Mr. Foss do not qualify as independent because Mr. Prim was an employee of the Company within the prior three years and Mr. Foss is currently an employee of the Company. The NASDAQ rules have both objective and subjective tests for determining who is an "independent director." The objective tests state, for example, that a director is not considered independent if he or she is an employee of the company, has been an employee within the prior three years, or is a partner in or executive officer of an entity to which the company made, or from which the company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipient's consolidated gross revenue for that year. The subjective test states that an independent director must be a person who lacks a relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
The Board of Directors relies upon evaluation of director independence by the Board's Governance Committee. In assessing independence under the subjective test, the Governance Committee took into account the standards in the objective tests and reviewed additional information provided by the directors with regard to each individual's business and personal activities as they may relate to the Company and its management. Based on all the foregoing, as required by NASDAQ rules, the Governance Committee made a subjective determination as to each of Mses. Fiegel, Kelly and Miyashiro and Messrs. Flanigan, Wilson, Wimsett and Brown that no relationship exists, which, in the opinion of the Committee, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Governance Committee has not established categorical standards or guidelines to make these subjective determinations, but considers all relevant facts and circumstances.
In making its independence determinations, the Governance Committee considered transactions occurring since the beginning of its 2015 fiscal year between the Company and entities associated with the independent directors or members of their immediate family. While a customer relationship does exist between the Company and the credit union associated with Ms. Miyashiro, the Governance Committee has determined that, because of the amount involved in relation to the total revenues of the Company and the credit union, the relationship does not impair the independence of this director. The Governance Committee has also determined that the transactions with the credit union were on terms no less favorable to the Company than arrangements with other unaffiliated customers. In all cases and in all years reviewed, the amounts received by the Company from the institution were far less than 1% of the Company's total revenue for the year. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions", below.
In addition to the Board-level standards for director independence, the directors who serve on the Audit Committee each satisfy standards established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") providing that to qualify as "independent" for the purposes of membership, members of audit committees may not accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the Company other than their director compensation.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH 
OF THE NOMINEES FOR ELECTION TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. PROXIES RECEIVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE VOTED FOR THE ELECTION OF EACH NOMINEE UNLESS STOCKHOLDERS SPECIFY IN THEIR PROXY A VOTE OF "WITHHOLD" WITH RESPECT TO A NOMINEE.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Company and its businesses are managed under the direction of the Board of Directors. The Board generally meets a minimum of four times during the year, but has complete access to management throughout the year.

[END TABLE]
Stockholder Recommended Director Candidates
The Board of Directors has also adopted a Nomination Policy with respect to the consideration of director candidates recommended by stockholders. A candidate submission from a stockholder will be considered at any time if the following information is submitted to the Secretary of the Company:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โ The recommending stockholder's name and address, together with the number of shares, length of period held and proof of ownership 
โ Name, age and address of candidate 
โ Detailed resume of candidate, including education, occupation, employment and commitments 
โ Description of arrangements or understandings between the recommending stockholder and the candidate 
โ Statement describing the candidate's reasons for seeking election to the Board and documenting candidate's satisfaction of qualifications described in the Corporate Governance Guidelines 
โ A signed statement from the candidate, confirming willingness to serve 
โ If the recommending stockholder has been a beneficial holder of more than 5% of the Company's stock for more than a year, then it must consent to additional public disclosures by the Company with regard to the nomination 
[END TABLE]
The Secretary of the Company will promptly forward complying nominee recommendation submissions to the Chairman of the Governance Committee. The Governance Committee may consider nominees submitted from a variety of sources including but not limited to stockholder recommendations. If a vacancy arises or the Board decides to expand its membership, the Governance Committee will evaluate potential candidates from all sources and will rank them by order of preference if more than one is identified as properly qualified. A recommendation will be made to the Board by the Governance Committee based upon qualifications, interviews, background checks and the Company's needs.
Stockholder Nominated Director Candidates
The Company's Board has adopted a "Proxy Access for Director Nominations" bylaw. The proxy access bylaw permits a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials Director nominees constituting up to two individuals or 20% of the Board (whichever is greater), provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in Article II, Section 2.12 of our bylaws. See "Stockholder Proposals and Nominations" on page 36 for more information.
Majority Election Policy
The Company's By-Laws and Corporate Governance Guidelines require that a director nominee only be elected if he or she receives a majority vote of the votes cast with respect to his or her election in an uncontested election. Thus, for a nominee to be elected, the number of votes cast "For" must exceed the number of votes cast as "Withheld" for the nominee. If a nominee who is currently serving as a director is not re-elected with a majority of the votes cast, then under the Corporate Governance Guidelines, he or she is required to submit a resignation to the Board. In this event, the  
Governance Committee will consider the tendered resignation and will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board must act on the tendered resignation within 90 days from the date of certification of the election results, and must also promptly disclose its decision and explain its rationale.
Board Leadership Structure
The Board of Directors does not have a fixed policy regarding the separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. These offices have been held by different persons from 2004-2012, but were combined in one person (Mr. Prim) from 2012 to June 30, 2016. Pursuant to the Company's previously announced succession plan, on July 1, 2016 these two offices were again separated when Mr. Prim was appointed Executive Chairman and Mr. Foss was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer. The members of the Board believe that the Company has been well served in the past by both combined Chairman/CEOs and by separate persons in these offices, and believes that the Board should maintain the flexibility to combine or separate these offices in the future if deemed to be in the best interests of the Company.
The Board has adopted a governance guideline providing for a "Lead Director." Under the guideline, when the Chairman is a member of Company management, the independent directors will annually appoint from among themselves a Lead Director. The Lead Director will coordinate the activities of the independent directors, coordinate with the Chairman to set the agenda and schedule for Board meetings, advise on materials distributed to directors, Chair meetings of the Board and stockholders in the absence of the Chairman, call and chair executive sessions of the independent directors, and perform other duties assigned from time to time by the Board.
The Board is committed to strong, independent Board leadership and believes that objective oversight is critical to effective governance. Seven of our nine director nominees are independent, as are all members of the Audit, Compensation and Governance Committees of the Board. Four of the five members of the Risk and Compliance Committee are independent. The independent directors regularly meet in executive session without management directors.
Communication with the Board
Shareholders and all other interested parties wishing to contact our Board of Directors may write to: Board of Directors of Jack Henry & Associates, Inc., Attn: Corporate Secretary, PO Box 807, 663 West Highway 60, Monett, MO 65708. The Corporate Secretary distributes this correspondence to the appropriate member(s) of the Board.
Risk Oversight
Pursuant to the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board performs its risk oversight function primarily through its Risk and Compliance, Audit and Compensation Committees. The Risk and Compliance Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing, monitoring and addressing the Company's enterprise and operational risks. The Risk and Compliance Committee is charged with overseeing the Company's risk management program that measures, prioritizes, monitors and responds to risks. The Audit Committee oversees risks relating to financial statements and reporting, credit, and liquidity risks. The Compensation Committee is charged with oversight of risks in compensation policies and practices. The Board receives regular reports from these committees as well as management, assesses major risks, and reviews with management options for risk mitigation.
Code of Conduct
The members of the Board, as well as the executive officers and all other employees, contractors, vendors and business partners of the Company are subject to and responsible for compliance with the Jack Henry Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct contains policies and practices for the ethical and lawful conduct of our business, as well as procedures for confidential investigation of complaints and discipline of wrongdoers.

The Board of Directors and Its Committees
The Board of Directors held four regular meetings and three special meetings during the last fiscal year. Each director attended at least 75% of all meetings of the Board and all committees on which they served. The independent directors met in four executive sessions without management present during the last fiscal year. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, all the directors attended the Annual Meeting of the Stockholders held on November 9, 2017.
The Governance Committee of the Board has determined that seven of the Board's nine members, Flanigan, Wilson, Fiegel, Wimsett, Kelly, Miyashiro and Brown are independent directors under applicable NASDAQ standards.
The Board has adopted Stock Ownership Guidelines establishing stock ownership goals applicable to directors as well as senior management of the Company. Each non-employee director of the Company is expected to own Company shares having a value of at least five times the annual director cash retainer. Under the terms of the guidelines, new directors should be in compliance with this standard within five years after joining the Board. For this purpose, in addition to shares held outright, directors may include shares held in trust for immediate family members as well as the "in-the-money" value of any vested stock options and all restricted stock. As measured on June 30, 2018, all directors on such date were following these guidelines.
The Board of Directors has the following four standing committees, each of which operates under a written charter adopted by the Board:

[BEGIN TABLE]
(2) Includes amounts deferred pursuant to the Company's Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan. 
[END TABLE]
A director who is employed by the Company does not receive any separate compensation for service on the Board of Directors. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, each non-employee director received annual retainer compensation of
$40,000 per year plus $3,500 for attending each in-person Board meeting and $1,500 for each telephone Board meeting. The annual retainer is paid following the Annual Meeting of the Stockholders with respect to the period running from the Annual Meeting in November to the next Annual Meeting. Each non-employee director was also reimbursed for out-of- pocket expenses incurred in attending all Board and committee meetings.
The Lead Director (currently Mr. Flanigan) is compensated with an additional annual retainer amount of $15,000.
Equity compensation is paid annually to the non-employee directors in the form of restricted stock units. These restricted stock units are issued under the Company's 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. For fiscal 2018, the annual grant amount paid to each non-employee director was 1,196 restricted stock units, granted on the third business day following the date of the 2017 Annual Meeting. In July 2018, Mr. Prim was granted 366 restricted stock units upon transitioning to a non-employee director, representing a prorated portion of the remaining director term from July 1, 2018 through the the date of this year's Annual Meeting. The stock unit restrictions on the director grants will lapse on November 14, 2018.
In the year ended June 30, 2018, the chair of the Audit Committee received an annual retainer of $15,000 and the chairpersons of the Compensation, Governance and Risk and Compliance committees each received an annual retainer of $10,000. In-person meeting fees of the committees, paid to all attending committee members, were $2,000 per meeting for the Audit Committee and $1,500 per meeting for all other Board committees. The telephone meeting fee paid to all attending committee members for all committees was $1,000 per meeting. In addition, Board members may be paid a "Board Service Fee" of $1,000 per day for service to the Company in support of Board or committee functions on days when there is no scheduled meeting.
In fiscal 2018, the directors listed above were not eligible to participate in any non-equity incentive plan compensation from the Company or any pension plan of the Company. Non-employee directors are eligible for and may elect to participate in the Company's Non-Employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan. In fiscal 2018, only the restricted stock unit awards to non-employee directors were eligible for deferral and only two of the non-employee directors elected deferral of their awards. Deferred amounts are maintained by the Company in bookkeeping accounts. Stock awards that are deferred are deemed invested in the Company's common stock, and dividends paid on deferred equity awards are invested in a Federal Rate fund. The deferred amounts are unsecured obligations of the Company.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Director Shruti S. Miyashiro is President and Chief Executive Officer of Orange County's Credit Union of Santa Ana, CA. Orange County's Credit Union is a customer of the Company and during the year ended June 30, 2018, it paid $1,180,178 to the Company, primarily for software maintenance and implementation services. The Audit Committee has reviewed the transactions with the credit union and has concluded that they were on terms no less favorable to the Company than arrangements with other unaffiliated customers. The Governance Committee also considered the transactions and concluded that Ms. Miyashiro is an independent director despite the customer relationship.
The Board of Directors has adopted a written policy that requires all related party transactions to be reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee of the Board. The Audit Committee is charged with determining whether a related party transaction is in the best interests of, or not inconsistent with the interests of, the Company and its stockholders. In making this determination, the Audit Committee will consider such factors as whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable to the Company than terms generally available to unaffiliated third parties and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. No director may participate in any discussion, approval or ratification of any transaction in which he or she has an interest, except for the purpose of providing information concerning the transaction. For transactions in which the aggregate amount is less than $200,000, the Chairman of the Audit Committee has been delegated the authority to pre-approve related party transactions, subject to later review by the full committee. At least annually, ongoing related party transactions will be reviewed to assess continued compliance with the policy.  
For purposes of the Related Party Transaction Policy, a related party transaction is a transaction or relationship in which the aggregate amount involved will be or may exceed $100,000 in any calendar year, involves the Company as a participant, and in which any related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or less than 10% beneficial owner of the other entity). A related party is any executive officer, director, or more than 5% beneficial owner of the Company or any immediate family member of such persons.
The policy also contains standing pre-approvals of certain transactions that are not believed to pose any material risk to the Company even if the aggregate amount exceeds $100,000 in a calendar year, including: employment arrangements with executive officers, director compensation, transactions involving competitive bids, certain banking-related services, and certain Company charitable contributions. Standing approval is also provided for transactions with another company where the related party's only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive officer), director or beneficial owner of less than 10% of that entity's shares, if the aggregate amount does not exceed $1,000,000 or 2% of that entity's annual revenues.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
The Company is required to identify any director, officer or greater than ten percent beneficial owner who failed to timely file with the SEC a report required under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 relating to ownership and changes in ownership of the Company's Common Stock. The required reports consist of initial statements on Form 3, statements of changes on Form 4 and annual statements on Form 5. To the Company's knowledge, based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, the Company believes that during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 all required Section 16(a) filings were filed timely.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors is currently composed of four independent directors. The Board has determined that Audit Committee member Matthew C. Flanigan is an "audit committee financial expert" under relevant SEC standards because of his extensive accounting and financial experience. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee believe that the Audit Committee's current members satisfy all NASDAQ and Securities and Exchange Commission rules that govern audit committee composition.
The Audit Committee operates under a written Charter adopted by the Board of Directors. The Charter requires the Audit Committee to oversee and retain the independent registered public accounting firm, pre-approve the services and fees of the independent registered public accounting firm, regularly consider critical accounting policies of the Company, review and approve material related party transactions, receive reports from the Company's Director of Internal Audit and General Manager of Enterprise Risk Management, and establish procedures for receipt and handling of complaints and anonymous submissions regarding accounting or auditing matters. The Charter also contains the commitment of the Board of Directors to provide funding and support for the operation of the Audit Committee, including funding for independent counsel for the Committee if the need arises.
The role of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its oversight of the Company's financial reporting process. Management has the primary duty for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal controls. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing the Company's financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the Company's audited financial statements. The Audit Committee also has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard 16 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). In addition, the Audit Committee has received from the independent registered public accounting firm the written disclosures and letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered accounting firm its independence.  
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee meets with the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. These meetings without management present are held at least once each year, and one such meeting was held in the fiscal year just ended.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the Company's audited financial statements be included in the Company's 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
You will have the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on Jack Henry's executive compensation at this year's Annual Meeting (our "say on pay" vote), included as Proposal 2 in this proxy statement (page 34). We encourage you to review this section prior to casting your "say on pay" advisory vote.
At the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders held in November 2017, over 99% of the votes cast on say-on-pay at that meeting were voted in favor of the proposal. The Compensation Committee believes this vote strongly affirms the stockholders' support of the Company's approach to executive compensation, and the Committee did not change its basic approach to compensation of the Named Executives in fiscal 2018. The Compensation Committee believes that stockholder input on executive compensation is crucial and will continue to consider the outcome of the Company's say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions for the Named Executives.
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis is designed to provide information regarding the philosophy and objectives underlying our compensation policies, the processes we follow in setting compensation, the components we utilize in compensating our top executives, and the resulting compensation outcomes. This discussion is focused on the "Named Executives" as of June 30, 2018: President and Chief Executive Officer David Foss, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Kevin Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer Mark Forbis, and General Counsel and Secretary Craig Morgan. Specific information about the compensation of the Named Executives is set forth in the Summary Compensation Table and other compensation tables beginning on page 29, which should be read in conjunction with this discussion.
Executive Summary
Fiscal 2018 was another successful year for Jack Henry and our stockholders. Total shareholder return was 103% for the three-year period ending on June 30, 2018 and 25% for the one-year period ending on the same date, using the average closing price of the last ten calendar days of the fiscal year. We increased annual operating income in fiscal year 2018 by 9.1%. The compensation decisions made by the Committee recognized these absolute and relative outcomes, and reflect a clear expression of the principle of pay for performance which is at the center of our decisions regarding executive compensation. In broad terms, the fiscal year 2018 executive compensation program implemented this pay for performance principle with the following elements of compensation:

In the aggregate, the relative portions of these three primary elements that made up the pay mix for Messrs. Foss, Williams, Forbis and Morgan in fiscal year 2018 are represented graphically in the following chart:
The fiscal 2018 pay mix established by the Compensation Committee in July of 2017 clearly focused on performance-based pay, and particularly emphasized long-term performance by the Company. The pay mix was intended to ensure that the Named Executives remained highly focused on the long-term success of the Company.
As part of the previously announced transition of duties from Mr. Prim to Mr. Foss, the Compensation Committee determined that Mr. Prim's salary would remain at $310,000 after it had been previously been reduced by half in April of 2017.  The Compensation Committee also decided not to award Mr. Prim an annual incentive cash bonus or to award additional long-term incentive compensation.  The remainder of the Compensation Discussion & Analysis will omit discussion of Mr. Prim's compensation. Except as otherwise specifically indicated, where the discussion below refers to "Named Executives," it refers to the four Named Executives who were serving the Company as executive officers at the end of fiscal 2018 (Messrs. Foss, Williams, Forbis and Morgan), and not to Mr. Prim.
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
Jack Henry's compensation philosophy is to offer compensation programs to our executives that:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Attract and retain highly qualified and motivated executives; 
โข Encourage esprit de corps and reward outstanding performance; 
โข Focus executives on achieving consistent earnings growth; 
โข Encourage continuation of the Company's entrepreneurial spirit; and 
โข Reward the creation of stockholder value. 
[END TABLE]
In meeting these objectives, the Compensation Committee strives for the interests of management and stockholders to be the same - the maximization of stockholder value. To this end, the key financial performance measures are operating income and total shareholder return. Both measures emphasize a focus on revenue growth, operating efficiencies to yield strong margins and returns to shareholders in excess of our peers.
The Compensation Committee designs and maintains compensation programs consistent with our executive compensation philosophy to achieve the following objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข To attract, retain and motivate highly qualified executives by offering compensation programs that are competitive with programs offered by companies in our Compensation Peer Group. 
โข To link performance and executive pay by tying bonus amounts to achievement of key objectives under the Company's annual business plans, as well as specific individual performance goals. 
โข To reward competitive performance in comparison with peers in our industry. 
โข To reward the creation of long-term stockholder value through long-term incentive compensation awards and encourage significant stock ownership by top management to further align executive interests to those of our stockholders. 
[END TABLE]
In pursuit of these objectives, the Compensation Committee believes that the compensation packages provided to the Named Executives should include both cash and equity-based compensation, with an emphasis on performance-based pay:

Process for Establishing Compensation
The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for making decisions regarding the compensation of the Named Executives. In conducting annual performance reviews and determining appropriate compensation levels for the Named  
Executives the Compensation Committee meets and deliberates outside the presence of the Named Executives and other members of the executive management team. With respect to the compensation levels for other Named Executives, the Compensation Committee considers input and recommendations from the President and Chief Executive Officer. Performance reviews of the Named Executives are based on objective and subjective evaluations of individual performance as well as their performance in the preceding fiscal year in achieving Company performance objectives. While our President and Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations concerning salary adjustments, cash bonus programs and award amounts for the other Named Executives, the Compensation Committee exercises its discretion and sole authority to set the compensation of each of the Named Executives.
In designing compensation programs and determining compensation levels for the Named Executives for fiscal year 2018 (ending June 30, 2018), the Compensation Committee was assisted by an independent compensation consultant firm. The Compensation Committee engaged Willis Towers Watson ("WTW"), a global human resources consulting firm, to serve as its independent advisor and compensation consultant with respect to fiscal 2018. The Chairman of the Compensation Committee worked directly with WTW to determine the scope of the work needed to assist the Committee in its decision-making processes. The engagement of the consulting firm included provision of benchmark comparative data for the Named Executives with respect to base salaries, annual cash bonuses, long term incentives, and comparative data regarding severance. WTW was also engaged to provide analysis and advice to the Compensation Committee with respect to the compensation of the Company's independent directors. WTW did not provide any other consultation or services to the Company or management. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of WTW and determined that no conflict of interest exists under the rules established by the SEC. The Compensation Committee reviews the independence of its advisors annually.
Mr. Morgan was designated a Section 16 reporting officer and an executive officer in August 2017.  Due to the timing of this designation, Mr. Morgan's compensation information was not included in the analysis and advice portion of the engagement with WTW.  Mr. Foss determined Mr. Morgan's compensation in connection with such designation.  The salary decision was based on time in the position, amount of assigned responsibility, and reference to compensation examples of comparable positions.  Mr. Morgan's annual cash bonus target and long term incentive compensation were set at the rate for general manager-level management within the Company.  The Compensation Committee approved the compensation decisions for Mr. Morgan made by Mr. Foss.  In the following discussion of compensation, references to Mr. Morgan's compensation will be based on this separate decision making process.
In making compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee compared each element of total direct compensation against a peer group of publicly traded companies in the software, payments and data processing industries against which the Compensation Committee believes we compete in the market for executive talent. We collectively refer to this group as the "Compensation Peer Group." In selecting companies for the Compensation Peer Group, the Compensation Committee has considered multiple criteria, including industry, annual revenue and market capitalization. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Peer Group was comprised of the following companies:
[BEGIN TABLE]
ACI Worldwide, Inc. Bottomline Technologies, Inc. Broadridge Financial Solutions 
Cardtronics Convergys Corporation Corelogic 
DST Systems, Inc. Euronet Worldwide, Inc. Fair Isaac Corporation 
Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. Fiserv, Inc. Global Payments, Inc. 
Square, Inc. SS&C Technologies Holdings Total Systems Services, Inc. 
Tyler Technologies, Inc. Verifone Systems WEX 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Peer Group is reviewed annually and, as appropriate, updated by the Compensation Committee to make sure that members of the group are consistent with the Company's industry and financial scope and comparable in terms of size and labor pool. For comparison purposes, Jack Henry's annual revenues were moderately below the median revenues of the members of the Compensation Peer Group, but Jack Henry's market capitalization was moderately above the median of the group.  DST Systems Inc., which was included in the peer group at the beginning of fiscal 2018, was acquired in April 2018 and is no longer a public company.  As a result, DST Systems, Inc. has been removed from the peer group.  
To benchmark each element of total compensation for our Named Executives, WTW provided data from two key sources: (1) an executive compensation survey reflective of our industry and the general industry and (2) public filings for the companies in our Compensation Peer Group. In reviewing compensation survey data, the Compensation Committee considered data for software companies with annual revenues similar to the Company. Sources of data for compensation surveys and analysis include surveys for our Compensation Peer Group and the software industry, in addition to proxy statements and other public filings by companies in our Compensation Peer Group.
In setting fiscal 2018 compensation, the Compensation Committee considered benchmarks for total cash compensation (i.e., base salary and annual cash incentives) and approved target bonus levels for the Named Executives which combined with the salaries approach the 50th percentile of the Compensation Peer Group. In targeting total cash compensation and long-term incentive compensation at or near the 50th percentile, the Compensation Committee recognized that there are certain limitations in the market data available for the Compensation Peer Group. Thus, in addition to considering levels of compensation suggested by market data, the Compensation Committee also considered other relevant factors including performance against pre-identified objectives under business plans for the preceding fiscal year, individual performance reviews, change in job duties, geographic location and internal equity for compensation levels among our executives.
The allocation between cash, non-cash, short-term and long-term incentive compensation is measured against the practices of our Compensation Peer Group and reflects the Compensation Committee's determination of the appropriate compensation mix among base pay, annual cash incentives and long-term equity incentives to encourage retention and performance. Actual cash and equity incentive awards are determined by the performance of the Company and the individual, depending on the type of award, compared to established goals. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, the elements of the compensation mix included:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Base salary, designed to attract and retain executives; 
โข Annual cash incentive bonus compensation, designed to focus on business, financial and individual objectives established by the Board for the year; 
โข Long-term incentive compensation consisting of performance shares which are earned by achieving levels of total shareholder return compared to our Compensation Peer Group, designed to focus executives on the long-term success of the Company as reflected in the market price of the Company's stock; and 
โข Broad-based employee benefits programs. 
[END TABLE]
Base Salary
In July of 2017, the Compensation Committee considered competitive data provided by WTW. Based on this data as well as individual and corporate performance and changes in executive duties, the Committee increased the base salaries of the President and Chief Executive Officer by 16.7%, Chief Financial Officer by 3.3%, and the Chief Technology Officer by 10.8%, effective October 1, 2017.  As discussed above under "Process for Establishing Compensation", Mr. Foss approved an increase for the General Counsel of 31.1%, effective October 1, 2017, from the initial salary that was set when Mr. Morgan started in the General Counsel position in November 2016.
Although the Compensation Committee believes that competitive base salaries are necessary to attract and retain a highly qualified and effective executive team, it also believes that a significant portion of executive compensation should be based on pay-for-performance.
Annual Incentive Cash Bonuses
It is our practice to provide Named Executives with the opportunity to earn annual incentive cash bonus compensation through programs that reward attainment of key objectives under corporate annual business plans. The objectives that underlie our annual incentive compensation programs may vary between fiscal years and between the Named Executives, but generally include objectives that reward attainment of targeted earnings as well as individual performance goals. In setting the fiscal 2018 bonus amounts a Named Executive is eligible to earn for achieving specified objectives, the Compensation Committee targeted bonus and total cash compensation levels at or near the 50th percentile of the Compensation Peer Group and published survey data. Bonus opportunities for achieving objectives are generally established as a percentage of an executive's base salary and the percentages increase with job scope and complexity.  
Executives have the opportunity to earn reduced bonus amounts if a minimum level (threshold) of performance against an objective is achieved and can also earn increased bonus amounts for performance in excess of the level of targeted performance.
The decision as to whether to offer an annual incentive cash bonus program to Named Executives for any fiscal year, the type and funding of any program offered, and the objectives that underlie any program, are subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee and its assessment of general and industry specific conditions existing during the applicable period. In determining the amount of bonus that a Named Executive is eligible to earn under a bonus program, the Compensation Committee may also exercise negative discretion to reduce an award based on its assessment of the executive's contribution and accountability for the objectives that are the subject of the bonus, the internal equity of the executive's bonus opportunity as compared to bonus opportunities for our other executives, and any other factors the Compensation Committee considers relevant.
To provide an appropriate structure for cash bonus incentives, the Company's stockholders previously approved the 2017 Annual Incentive Plan. Cash bonus incentives for fiscal year 2018 were structured under the 2017 Annual Incentive Plan.
The fiscal 2018 incentive cash bonus plan established for the Named Executives was based 75% upon achievement of the Company's annual budget operating income target. The fiscal 2018 annual incentive plan provided that no bonus was payable unless the Company's performance on the operating income measurement was at or above the threshold for achievement. The operating income target was established from the annual budget of the Company as approved by the Board, and excluded from consideration the effect on operating income of an election to implement a voluntary early departure incentive plan for associates. The annual budget was developed by management with input from the Board of Directors in a thorough process that builds upon departmental forecasts and considers historical performance, industry dynamics, and macro-economic trends.
The other 25% of each of the participating Named Executive's incentive cash bonus in fiscal 2018 was determined by achievement of individual performance goals set for the officers by the Compensation Committee. These goals varied from individual to individual and included both objective and subjective measures of performance. The individual performance goals were intended to align the individual officers with the Company's business strategies and objectives in each officer's sphere of duties and control. Examples include achievement of specified customer and employee satisfaction ratings, implementation of programs and systems, process and control improvements, completion of development projects, and meeting specified financial goals. These individual goals are keys to financial and business success for Jack Henry and thus contribute to producing income and shareholder returns over the long-term. Grading of performance on the individual performance goals was in some cases "achieved" or "not achieved" and in other cases on a sliding scale, such as from fail to below target, at target and above target, and thus some potential individual performance bonus amounts varied from zero to target and above target.
The 2018 plan provided for bonuses of 100% of base compensation for the Chief Executive Officer, 80% of base compensation for the Chief Financial Officer, 50% of base compensation for the Chief Technology Officer, and 30% of base compensation for the General Counsel, at pre-determined performance targets. The operating income component of the annual bonus for the participating Named Executives ranged from a threshold of 90% of budgeted operating income to a target at 100% and to a maximum at 110%. Bonus payouts for operating income achievement ranged from 50% of target at threshold performance to as much as 200% of targeted bonus at maximum performance. Bonus payouts for achieving individual performance goals varied from 0 to 100% and in a few instances, could range to a maximum of 125% as to specific scalable goals. The overall bonus percentages and ranges were determined primarily by reference to comparative compensation data provided to the Compensation Committee by its independent advisor. The maximum bonus was intended to be payable only upon truly superior performance. The Compensation Committee intended for this bonus plan to provide a strong incentive for management to meet and exceed budgetary income and individual performance goals in fiscal 2018. 
The Company performed well in fiscal 2018. After excluding the effect of an election to implement the voluntary early departure incentive plan for associates described above, the Company produced operating income of $396.5 million, approximately 101.98% of budgeted operating income of $388.8 million. The resulting payout was 107.9% of target of the portion of the participating Named Executives' bonus determined by operating income.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation
We believe that equity awards have been instrumental in building Jack Henry & Associates, in retaining talent, and in encouraging management to take the long-term view with regard to strategic decisions they face. Equity awards also help focus executive and employee attention on managing the Company from the perspective of an owner with an equity stake in the business. Since the adoption of the Company's Restricted Stock Plan in 2005 and continuing under the Company's 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee has had the authority to grant restricted stock awards of various types and to determine the terms of the restrictions on granted shares. Starting in fiscal 2013, long-term incentive compensation was granted to the Named Executives in the form of performance shares.
Grants may be made annually in the future, but future grants will continue to be discretionary and amounts may fluctuate based upon the Compensation Committee's evaluation of performance from year to year. In determining the level of award for a Named Executive, the Compensation Committee considers relevant factors such as achievement of previously identified objectives, the executive's performance, comparative data from the Compensation Peer Group and other sources, the current equity ownership and equity awards held by the individual executive and the internal equity of the level of award granted to the executive compared to awards granted to other executives. In reviewing the award levels for our Named Executives, the Compensation Committee believes it is appropriate to consider the Company's performance against key objectives under its corporate business plan for the preceding fiscal year, including objectives related to revenue and earnings targets, and whether the Company's performance during the preceding fiscal year benefited stockholders as measured by the market price of the Company's Common Stock. In administering the equity compensation programs, the Compensation Committee monitors the level of dilution that can result from equity awards to executives and other employees and considers the dilutive effect of the Company's aggregate equity awards during any fiscal year.
The specific grants to the Named Executives for fiscal 2018 were structured as performance shares that vest only on achievement of performance goals and thus strongly reflect the principle of pay-for-performance. A grant of performance shares is a contractual right to receive stock and/or cash in the future when vesting conditions are met. The specific grants of performance shares in fiscal 2018 to the Named Executives vest at the end of three years based on total shareholder return in comparison to the Compensation Peer Group over the three-year period. For this purpose, total shareholder return ("TSR") was defined as ending stock price minus beginning stock price (adjusted for splits and similar changes) plus dividends per share paid over the performance period, all divided by the beginning stock price. A target amount of stock was set for each Named Executive that may be earned if TSR at the end of the three-year period is at the 60th percentile in comparison to the Compensation Peer Group. Vesting ranges from 35% of the performance shares at the 25th percentile to the maximum amount of the grant (175% of target) at or above the 75th percentile relative to the Compensation Peer Group. No shares will vest if performance is below the 25th percentile threshold. By setting the target amount at the 60th percentile, the Committee continued to convey that long-term superior performance is expected and remains the goal of this incentive program.
The fiscal 2018 performance share grants to the Named Executives were approved in target dollar amounts with grant date accounting values roughly set at 3.6 times base salary of Mr. Foss, 2.2 times base salary of Mr. Williams, 1.3 times base salary of Mr. Forbis, and 1.1 times the base salary of Mr. Morgan. The fiscal 2018 grant amounts were determined with reference to comparable grants of long-term incentive compensation by other members of the Compensation Peer Group and published survey data, and were roughly targeted at the 50th percentile of the Compensation Peer Group. The fiscal 2018 grant amounts were generally consistent with FY2017 target levels, although Mr. Foss saw an increase of 39%. The 2018 awards were structured to provide incentives for long-term performance and retention and to meet goals for specific accounting treatment. Retention is encouraged by grant terms which immediately forfeit all awards that have not vested or are still restricted in the event that the grantee's employment with the Company is terminated for any reason other than in the event of death, incapacity, retirement or in connection with any change in control.
The use of performance shares allows for flexibility in addressing the orderly retirement of grantees. The performance shares contain terms which allow for the pro-rata vesting of awards upon retirement based on full months of service following the date grant. For this purpose, retirement is defined as termination with the stated purpose of retirement after 30 years of service to the Company, after the age of 57 and 15 years of service, or after the age of 62 and 5 years of service. With respect to a retirement during the term, at the end of the three-year term of the grant, the award will be calculated and a pro-rata portion will be settled to the grantee based on completed full months of service. For example, if an eligible grantee retires 18 months after the grant date, he would be credited with 18 months of service and would be entitled to one-half of any amount that vests on performance measured at the end of the three-year grant. Death or incapacity of a grantee is addressed in the same manner, with pro-rata vesting based on completed months of service. Upon a change in control of the Company, the target number of performance shares vest and will be settled, regardless of the performance measures achieved.
The Compensation Committee notes that the Company produced an admirable total shareholder return of 107.5% over the three year period ending June 30, 2018. As to performance shares issued to the Named Executives in fiscal 2016 that vested based on three year TSR performance, the Company's performance in comparison with the Compensation Peer Group over those three years was at the 81st percentile, well above the 63rd percentile target that was established in fiscal 2015, and thus 175% of the Named Executive's target shares vested. This result is in keeping with the Company's pay for superior performance principle.
Deferred Compensation Plan
Under the Company's non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan adopted in September of 2014, our Named Executives may voluntarily defer a portion of their compensation to one or more future years. While the plan allows the Company to offer deferral of all types of compensation, including salary, bonus and equity grants, to date the Company has only offered a program to defer receipt of equity compensation upon vesting of performance shares. Amounts deferred are deemed invested in investments selected by the participant from a limited number of choices. The Deferred Compensation  
Plan is intended to promote retention by providing a long-term savings opportunity on a tax-efficient basis. None of the Named Executives participated in the Deferred Compensation Plan in fiscal 2018.
Termination Benefits Agreements
Each of the Named Executives has entered into a Termination Benefits Agreement with the Company that is discussed in this Proxy Statement under the caption "Agreements with Executive Officers and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control." These agreements reflect the concern of the Board of Directors that any future threatened or actual change in control such as an acquisition or merger could cause disruption and harm to the Company in the event of the resulting loss of any of its key executives. The Termination Benefits Agreements are intended to provide a measure of incentive and security to the executives through the resolution of the threat or through a change in control.
The Compensation Committee believes that such agreements should not include provisions that would obligate an acquirer of the Company to make large cash payouts to our Named Executives simply because a change of control has occurred. Because of this concern, the occurrence of a change of control event alone will not trigger any cash payment obligations to our Named Executives under their respective Termination Benefits Agreements. Payment obligations only arise in the event the Named Executive's employment is terminated or is deemed to be terminated without "Cause" (as defined in the agreements) within the period commencing 90 days prior to and for two years following a change in control for the Named Executives. The Company does not provide, nor has it ever provided, excise tax gross-up payments to any employee in the event of a change in control and termination.
Payment obligations under the Termination Benefits Agreements with the Named Executives are two times the current annual base salary plus target bonus, payable 50% in twelve equal monthly installments and 50% in a lump sum at the end of the monthly installments. Health and other benefits are also continued for 18 months for the Named Executives, and all stock options, performance shares and restricted stock awards become fully vested. The benefits provided were determined primarily by reference to comparative data provided to the Compensation Committee by its independent advisor and, at least in relation to base salary, are consistent with the prior agreements which they replaced. The benefits are believed by the Compensation Committee to be sufficient to provide the desired incentive and security to retain crucial personnel in a time of disruption.
The Termination Benefits Agreements have no set term and will continue until terminated by agreement of both the parties. The agreements specify that they do not confer on the executives any right to continued employment and shall not interfere with the right of the Company to terminate the executives at any time.
Broad-Based Benefits Programs
The Company offers certain broad-based benefits programs including benefits such as health, dental, disability and life insurance, health care savings accounts, employee stock purchase plan, paid vacation time and company matching contributions to a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan. Benefits are provided to all employees in accordance with practices within the marketplace and are a necessary element of compensation in attracting and retaining employees. There are no additional benefits programs for our Named Executives.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Board of Directors has established stock ownership guidelines for the Named Executives, other members of management and the non-employee directors of the Company. These guidelines provide for each covered individual to hold a number of shares of the Company's Common Stock with an aggregate market value that equates to a specified multiple of the employee's base salary or, in the case of directors, of their annual base retainer. The guidelines are four times base salary for the the Chief Executive Officer, three times base salary for the Chief Financial Officer, one time base salary for the Vice Presidents and General Managers, including the General Counsel, and five times the annual base retainer for directors. The value of each person's share holdings for purposes of the guidelines includes all unrestricted and restricted shares held, all Company shares held in the person's retirement accounts, all shares held in trust for the person's immediate family members, and the in-the-money value of all Company stock options held. Unvested restricted stock units and performance shares are not counted for purposes of measuring compliance with the stock ownership guidelines. The Compensation Committee recognizes that executive officers or employees who were recently promoted to executive officer positions and newly elected directors may require some period of time to achieve the guideline amounts. The guidelines, therefore, contemplate a five-year transition period for acquiring a number of shares with the specified market value. The guidelines also require that until the applicable ownership level is achieved, the individual should retain and hold 75% of all shares received from vesting of shares or exercise of options, net of shares sold to pay taxes. The Compensation Committee will continue to monitor the compliance of each executive and director with the guidelines. As measured on June 30, 2018, all covered individuals on such date were following these guidelines.
Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy
The Board of Directors has adopted a formal policy for the recoupment of incentive compensation paid to executive officers after the policy's effective date in the event the Company is required to restate its financial statements due to material non- compliance with financial reporting requirements. The recoupment policy is administered by the Compensation Committee.
Tax Deductibility and Executive Compensation
Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") on December 22, 2017, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") generally disallowed a tax deduction to publicly held companies for compensation paid to certain executive officers in excess of $1 million per officer in any year that did not qualify as performance based. In evaluating the annual compensation plan with respect to fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the potential tax deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code and sought to qualify certain elements of these applicable executives' compensation as performance-based while also delivering competitive levels and forms of compensation. The TCJA repealed the performance-based exception under 162(m) of the Code. As a result, subject to certain exceptions, the $1 million dollar deduction limit now applies to all compensation paid to anyone serving as the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer at any time during the taxable year and the top three other highest compensated executive officers serving at fiscal year end. The new rules generally apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, but do not apply to remuneration provided pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017, that is not modified in any material respect after that date.
The Compensation Committee believes that it is in our best interests to maintain flexibility in the administration of the compensation program. In order to retain the flexibility to compensate the Company's management in the manner best promoting the Compensation Committee's policy objectives, the Compensation Committee does not require that all compensation be deductible. Accordingly, certain payments may be subject to the $1 million deductibility limitation of Section 162(m) of the Code. The Compensation will continue to evaluate the impacts of the TCJA and the Company's policy objectives to ensure that the Company's compensation program is administered in a manner that serves the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
COMPENSATION AND RISK
Under its charter, the Compensation Committee is charged with review of risks related to the Company's compensation policies and practices. In 2018, the Compensation Committee directed the Company's Human Resources Department to conduct a compensation risk assessment and to report to the Committee. The assessment reviewed design features, characteristics and performance metrics used in compensating all employees of the Company, including salaries, sales incentives, incentive bonus plans and long-term equity incentive compensation awards. The Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed the report and concluded that the Company's compensation programs, policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. This conclusion was based on a number of factors, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข The compensation levels and practices are judged to be uncomplicated and fair. 
โข Compensation of our employees is generally competitive with relevant labor markets. 
โข Benefits are offered to all eligible employees on non-discriminatory bases and no material perquisites are offered solely to executives or management. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Incentive bonuses are determined largely on total Company financial performance, and are capped at reasonable levels. 
โข Long-term equity incentive awards to executives generally vest upon achievement of objective performance standards over a number of years, and thus do not encourage short-term focus. 
โข Compensation of executive and senior managers is balanced between salary, benefits, annual cash incentive bonuses and long-term equity incentive awards, resulting in appropriate balancing of short and long-term interests and goals. 
โข Executives and senior managers are subject to stock ownership guidelines which align their interests with those of the stockholders. 
โข The Company has adopted a recoupment policy providing for the clawback of executive compensation in the event of financial restatements.

Pay Ratio Disclosure
Our compensation and benefits philosophy and the overall structure of our compensation and benefit programs are broadly similar across the organization to encourage and reward all employees who contribute to our success.  We strive to ensure  the pay of every Jack Henry employee reflects the level of their job impact and responsibilities and is competitive within our peer group.  Compensation rates are benchmarked and set to be market-competitive in the location in which the jobs are performed.  Our ongoing commitment to pay equity is critical to our success in supporting a diverse workforce with opportunities for all employees to grow, develop, and contribute.  We employ over 6,300 people in the U.S. at 39 Company locations with 20% of our Associates working from remote locations.
Under rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, JHA is required to calculate and disclose the total compensation paid to its median paid employee, as well as the ratio of the total compensation paid to the median employee as compared to the total compensation paid to David Foss, our Chief Executive Officer, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
To determine the median employee, we identified our employee population as of June 30, 2018.  This population consisted of 6,387 employees.  We are required to identify the median employee using a "consistently applied compensation measure" ("CACM").  We chose a CACM of calculating the actual base salary earnings (or base wages for hourly employees, which is exclusive of overtime wages) during the fiscal year across the employee population, excluding our Chief Executive Officer.  We believe actual base salary earnings (or base wages for hourly employees, which is exclusive of overtime wages) is a reasonable basis on which to identify the median employee because those employees who receive cash incentive compensation, commissions, equity awards, or overtime pay represent a relatively small portion of our employee population.
After identifying our median employee based on the actual base salary earnings, we then calculated the annual total compensation for this employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement.  Based on this calculation, this median employee's annual total compensation for fiscal 2018 was $68,516.  The annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer for fiscal 2018 (as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table on page 29) was $3,918,826, resulting in a pay ratio of 57 to one.

Additional Information Regarding Summary Compensation and Grants of Plan-Based Awards
The annual base salaries of the Named Executives were evaluated in fiscal 2018 in relation to competitive data, changes in job duties and individual and corporate performance. The annual base salary of Mr. Foss was increased 16.7% to $700,000. Mr. Williams was increased 3.3% to $465,000, Mr. Forbis was increased 10.8% to $360,000 and Mr. Morgan was increased 31.1% to $295,000 on October 1, 2017. No change was made to the annual base salary of Mr. Prim for fiscal 2018.
For the year ended June 30, 2018, the Named Executives other than Mr. Prim had the opportunity to earn cash incentive bonuses under the Company's annual incentive cash bonus plan. As set forth in greater detail in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Annual Incentive Cash Bonuses" above, the performance goals for the participating Named Executives were based on achieving operating income targets established in the Company's annual budget and the achievement of individual performance goals ("IPGs"). The incentive plan set performance targets, thresholds for minimum performance, maximums for superior performance and required that for any bonus to be paid, the minimum threshold of operating income had to be achieved. For the year ended June 30, 2018, actual operating income was 102.0% of budgeted operating income, and with calculated IPG performances, the resulting payouts to the Named Executives were 105.5% of target for Mr. Foss, 107.0% for Mr. Williams, 97.2% for Mr. Forbis and 105.9% for Mr. Morgan.
On September 20, 2017, the Company entered into performance share agreements with each of the Named Executives, with the threshold, target and maximum share amounts listed in the above table. The performance share agreements entered into with each of the above Named Executives in fiscal year 2018 are identical except for the number of shares. All agreements settle three years following the grant date based upon the performance of the Company in comparison to the Compensation Peer Group in producing total shareholder return over the three year period. Amounts may be settled in Common Stock of the Company or cash or any combination thereof. Comparative performance in total shareholder return at less than the 25th percentile will result in no settlement. The target award is earned with total shareholder return at the 60th  percentile in comparison to the Compensation Peer Group and the maximum amount is earned with performance at the 75th percentile or higher.

(3) The performance shares vest three years from the date of grant based on achievement of total shareholder returns in comparison with other members of the Compensation Peer Group.

Agreements with Executive Officers and Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
The Company has no employment contracts with any of its executive officers.
The Company has entered into Termination Benefits Agreements with each of Messrs. Foss, Williams, Forbis and Morgan. Under these agreements, change in control is defined as an acquisition of 20% or more of the stock of the Company, termination of service of a majority of the members of the Board during any two year period for reasons other than death, disability or retirement, approval by the stockholders of liquidation of the Company or sale of 50% or more of its assets, or approval by the stockholders of a merger or consolidation if the Company stockholders own less than 50% of the combined voting power of the resulting corporation. The Termination Benefits Agreements provide a cash payment severance benefit equal to 200% of the executive's annual salary plus target bonus then in effect, with half payable in 12 monthly installments and half in a lump sum at the end of such 12 months. In addition, all outstanding stock options and performance shares will fully vest, all restrictions on restricted stock will lapse and the terminated executive will receive a welfare benefit consisting of payments equal to COBRA health insurance premiums and continuation of coverage under the Company's life insurance, disability, and dental plans for 18 months or until the executive becomes eligible for comparable benefits under a subsequent employer's arrangements. The termination benefits will be paid upon any termination of the executive during the 90 days prior to and the two years following any change in control unless the termination occurs by reason of the executive's death, disability, or if the termination is for cause. The termination benefits will also be paid if the executive terminates his employment after a change in control for good reason, such as a material diminution in authority, duties or responsibilities, a forced move, or a material diminution in annual salary. The Termination Benefits Agreements have no set term and will continue until terminated by agreement of both the parties.
The table below reflects the cash severance benefit payments and estimated welfare benefit payments that would be paid under the Termination Benefits Agreements as if the triggering events occurred on June 30, 2018, the last day of the last completed fiscal year. The table also shows the value as of June 30, 2018 of (1) all issued restricted stock units and performance shares with respect to which restrictions would lapse upon a change in control and termination, based on the closing market price of our common stock on June 29, 2018 (the last trading day of fiscal 2018) and (2) for Mr. Foss, the intrinsic value of 31,685 stock options that would become exercisable upon a change in control and termination (calculated as the difference between the closing market price of our common stock on June 29, 2018 (the last trading day of fiscal 2018) and the exercise price for such options.

PROPOSAL 2
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
As required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, we include in this proxy statement this proposal for a non- binding stockholder vote on compensation of the officers named in the Summary Compensation Table on page 29. We currently conduct annual advisory votes on executive compensation, and we expect to conduct the next advisory vote at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. With this year's "say on pay" proposal you can elect to endorse or not endorse our executive compensation programs and policies and the compensation we paid our Named Executives in fiscal 2018.
The say on pay vote is advisory and not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors. However, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors value the opinions of our stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future decisions regarding executive compensation.
As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Compensation Committee has designed the executive compensation program to focus the executives on achieving consistent earnings growth, encourage continuation of the Company's entrepreneurial spirit, attract and retain highly qualified and motivated executives, reward the creation of stockholder value, encourage esprit de corps and reward outstanding performance. In designing the overall executive compensation program, the Company's Compensation Committee strives for the interests of management and stockholders to be the same - the maximization of stockholder value.  
Our executive compensation package for Named Executives includes both cash and equity-based compensation, with an emphasis on performance-based pay. The Compensation Committee each year reviews and updates our executive compensation program to ensure they achieve the desired goals.
The Board of Directors believes that the compensation of the Named Executives is appropriate and effective in achieving the Company's objectives. Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Named Executives, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and related narrative disclosure, is hereby approved."
Approval of the advisory vote on executive compensation requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present at the meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote. For purposes of determining the vote regarding this proposal, abstentions will have the same impact as a no vote. Unless you specify otherwise in your proxy, the persons you have appointed will vote your shares "For" approval of the above-described resolution.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVES. PROXIES RECEIVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE VOTED FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVES UNLESS STOCKHOLDERS SPECIFY IN THEIR PROXY A VOTE OF "AGAINST" OR "ABSTAIN".
PROPOSAL 3
RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, performed an audit of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2018. The Audit Committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year, and the committee is presenting this selection to stockholders for ratification. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and to be available to respond to appropriate questions.
If prior to the Annual Meeting PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP declines to act as our independent registered public accountant or the Audit Committee decides not to use PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP as our independent registered public accountant, the Audit Committee will appoint another independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee will present any new independent registered public accounting firm for the stockholders to ratify at the Annual Meeting. If the stockholders do not ratify the engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP at the Annual Meeting, then the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP. Even if the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.
To ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, a majority of the shares present and entitled to vote must vote to approve. For purposes of determining the vote regarding this proposal, abstentions will have the same impact as a no vote. Unless you specify otherwise in your proxy, the persons you have appointed will vote your shares "For" ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has in its Charter expressed its policy governing the engagement of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for audit and non-audit services. Under the terms of the Charter, the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve all audit, audit related and non-audit services performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. All non-audit services for fiscal 2018 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Audit Committee reviews with management and the independent registered public accounting firm the types of services that are likely to be required throughout the year. Those services are comprised of four categories: audit services, audit-related services, tax services and all other permissible services. The independent registered public accounting firm provides documentation for each proposed specific service to be provided. At that time, the Audit Committee pre-approves a list of specific services that may be provided within each of these categories, and sets fee limits for each specific service or project. Management is then authorized to engage the independent registered public accounting firm to perform the pre-approved services as needed throughout the year, subject to providing the Audit Committee with regular updates. The Audit Committee reviews all billings submitted by the independent registered public accounting firm on a regular basis to ensure that their services do not exceed pre-defined limits. The Audit Committee or its Chairman reviews and approves in advance, on a case-by-case basis, all other projects, services and fees to be performed by or paid to the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also approves in advance any fees for pre- approved services that exceed the pre-established limits, as described above.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED ACCOUNTING FIRM. PROXIES RECEIVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL BE VOTED FOR THE RATIFICATION UNLESS STOCKHOLDERS SPECIFY IN THEIR PROXY A VOTE OF "AGAINST" OR "ABSTAIN".
