ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON DECEMBER 14, 2018 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
COMPANY OVERVIEW 
MSG Networks Inc., incorporated on July 29, 2009, is a Delaware corporation with principal executive offices at 11 Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, NY, 10001.

Our Class A Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the symbol "MSGN." As a result, we are subject to certain of the NYSE corporate governance listing standards. 
MSG Networks was formerly known as "The Madison Square Garden Company." We changed our name to MSG Networks Inc. on September 30, 2015 (the "MSG Distribution Date") in connection with the distribution of all of the outstanding common stock of MSG Spinco, Inc. (now known as The Madison Square Garden Company and referred to herein as "MSG") to our stockholders (the "MSG Distribution"). Pursuant to the MSG Distribution, MSG acquired the entertainment and sports businesses previously owned and operated by the Company through its MSG Entertainment and MSG Sports business segments, including the arenas and other venues previously owned, leased or operated by the Company as well as the Company's interests in various joint ventures. 
PROXY STATEMENT MATERIALS 
These proxy materials are provided in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday, December 14, 2018, at the J.P. Morgan Club at the Madison Square Garden Arena, which is located at located on Seventh Avenue between West 31st Street and West 33rd Street, New York, NY. 
This Proxy Statement is being sent to stockholders on or about October 25, 2018. Unless otherwise indicated, references to "2018," the "2018 fiscal year" and the "year ended June 30, 2018" refer to the Company's fiscal year ended on June 30, 2018. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT OUR ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
Who may vote at the annual meeting? 
Holders of our Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class A Common Stock") and holders of our Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Class B Common Stock," together with Class A Common Stock, collectively, "Company Stock") as recorded in our stock register at the close of business on October 16, 2018, may vote at the meeting. On 
 October 16, 2018, there were 61,234,541 shares of Class A Common Stock and 13,588,555 shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding. Each share of Class A Common Stock has one vote per share and holders will be voting for the election of three candidates to the Board. Each share of Class B Common Stock has ten votes per share and holders will be voting for the election of nine candidates to the Board. As a result of their ownership of all of the shares of our Class B   Common Stock, members of the Charles F. Dolan family and certain related family entities, have the power to elect all of the directors to be elected by the holders of our Class B Common Stock, and to approve Proposal 2 regardless of how other shares are voted. 
Why did I receive a Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a full set of proxy materials? 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the Company has elected to provide access to its proxy materials by Internet. Accordingly, the Company has sent a Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to our stockholders. All stockholders have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or request to receive a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials by Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. In addition, stockholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically. If you previously chose to receive proxy materials electronically, you will continue to receive access to these materials via email unless you otherwise elect. The Company encourages stockholders who have not already done so to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials on the Internet to help reduce the cost and the environmental impact of the annual meeting. 
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in street name? 
Stockholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you are considered a stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and the Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials was sent directly to you by the Company. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will also receive a proxy card. 
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, then you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and the Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials was forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the annual meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization how to vote the shares held in your account. If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a voting instruction form from that organization. 
What votes need to be present to hold the annual meeting? 
In order to carry on the business of the annual meeting, we need a majority of the votes represented by the outstanding shares eligible to vote on October 16, 2018 to be present, in person or by proxy. This is known as a "quorum." If voting on a particular action is by class, a majority of the votes represented by the outstanding shares of such class constitutes a quorum for such action. Abstentions and broker non-votes (described below) are considered present for purposes of determining a quorum. 
How do I vote? 
You may vote in advance of the annual meeting by telephone, Internet or mail by following the instructions provided on the Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. If you choose to vote by mail, please sign, date and return the proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. You may also vote in person or by legal proxy at the meeting. Even if you plan to attend the annual meeting in person, the Board strongly recommends that you submit a proxy to vote your shares in advance so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the annual meeting.  Can my broker vote my shares without instructions from me? 
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, you must instruct them how to vote your shares. Please use the voting instruction form provided to you by your brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization to direct them how to vote your shares. If you do not provide votinginstructions, your shares will not be voted on the election of directors or any other proposal on which the brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is called a "broker non-vote." In these cases, the brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization can register your shares as being present at the annual meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum but will not be able to vote on those matters for which specific authorization is required under applicable rules. 
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, your brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization has discretionary voting authority under applicable rules to vote your shares on the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as the Company's independent auditors (Proposal 2), even if the brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization does not receive voting instructions from you. However, your brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization does not have discretionary authority to vote on the election of directors (Proposal 1) without instructions from you, in which case a broker non-vote will occur and your shares will not be voted on these matters. 
What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals? 
Election of directors by the holders of our Class A Common Stock requires the affirmative vote of the plurality of votes cast by holders of our Class A Common Stock. Election of directors by the holders of our Class B Common Stock requires the affirmative vote of the plurality of votes cast by holders of our Class B Common Stock. Approval of Proposal 2 requires the favorable vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of our Class A Common Stock and the holders of our Class B Common Stock, voting together as a single class. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the proposals because abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast. As a result of their ownership of all of the shares of our Class B Common Stock, members of the Charles F. Dolan family and certain related family entities have the power to elect all of the directors to be elected by the holders of our Class B Common Stock and to approve Proposal 2 regardless of how other shares are voted. 
Can I change my vote after I have voted? 
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the final vote at the annual meeting. You may change your vote prior to the annual meeting by:  If your shares are held of record by a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, you should follow the instructions they provide in order to change your vote. 
How will my shares be voted at the annual meeting if I submit a proxy card? 
The proxy materials, including the proxy card, are being solicited on behalf of the Board. The Company representatives appointed by the Board (the persons named on the proxy card, or, if applicable, their substitutes) will vote your shares as you instruct. If you sign your proxy card and return it without indicating how you would like to vote your shares, your shares will be voted as the Board recommends, which is: 
Who participates in and pays for this solicitation? 
The Company will bear the expense of preparing, printing and mailing this proxy statement and the accompanying materials. Solicitation of individual stockholders may be made by mail, personal interviews, telephone, facsimile, electronic delivery or other telecommunications by our executive officers and regular employees who will receive no additional compensation for such activities. 
We have retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist with the solicitation of proxies for a fee estimated not to exceed $20,000, plus reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, we will reimburse brokers and other nominees for their expenses in forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners. 
How do I attend the 2018 annual meeting in person and what identification must I show? 
An admission ticket will be required if you plan to attend the annual meeting in person. Without an admission ticket, you will not be able to attend the annual meeting. To be admitted to the 2018 annual meeting, you must have been a stockholder at the close of business on the record date of October 16, 2018 or be the legal proxy holder or qualified representative of such stockholder. You must bring with you your admission ticket and a valid government-issued photo identification card (federal, state or local), such as a driver's license or passport. Persons without an admission ticket and proper identification will be denied admission to the annual meeting. Registration will begin at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the annual meeting date. 
Your proxy card is not an admission ticket. To obtain an admission ticket, go to www.proxyvote.com or call 1-844-318-0137 (toll-free) or 925-331-6070 (international). You will need to enter your 16-digit control number, which can be found on your Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, voting instruction form or proxy card. You may also request an admission ticket by calling the telephone number on your voting instruction form or proxy card. The deadline to obtain an admission ticket is 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 4, 2018. If you have questions about admission to the annual meeting, please call 1-844-318-0137 (toll-free) or 925-331-6070 (international). 
Please note that you will need your admission ticket to be admitted to the meeting whether you vote before or at the meeting, and regardless of whether you are a registered or beneficial stockholder. If you are attending the meeting as a proxy or qualified representative for a stockholder, you will need to bring your legal proxy or authorization letter in addition to your admission ticket and government-issued photo identification card.  Stockholders must provide advance written notice to the Company if they intend to have a legal proxy (other than the persons appointed as proxies on the Company's proxy card) or a qualified representative attend the annual meeting on their behalf. The notice must include the name and address of the legal proxy or qualified representative and must be received by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on December 4, 2018 in order to allow enough time for the issuance of an admission ticket to such person. For further details, see "Other — Advance Notice of Proxy Holders and Qualified Representatives." 
Please note that cameras, video and audio recording equipment and other similar electronic devices, as well as large bags (including backpacks, handbags and briefcases) and packages will need to be checked at the door. Additionally, the Company may impose additional restrictions on items that must be checked at the door as well as on the conduct of the meeting. To ensure the safety of all persons, attendees and bags may also be subject to security inspections. 
Requests for admission tickets will be processed in the order received. Please note that seating is limited, and requests for tickets will be handled on a first-come, first-served basis. 
What is "householding" and how does it affect me? 
Stockholders of record who have the same address and last name and do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials may receive only one copy of this Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (the "2018 Form 10-K") unless we are notified that one or more of these stockholders wishes to receive individual copies. This "householding" procedure will reduce our printing costs and postage fees. 
Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. If you are eligible for householding, but you and other stockholders of record with whom you share an address currently receive multiple copies of this Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and any accompanying documents, or if you hold MSG Networks stock in more than one account, and, in either case, you wish to receive only a single copy of each of these documents for your household, please contact Broadridge Householding Department, by calling their toll free number, 1-866-540-7095, or by writing to: Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. 
If you participate in householding and wish to receive a separate copy of this Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and any accompanying documents, or if you do not wish to continue to participate in householding and prefer to receive separate copies of these documents in the future, please contact Broadridge Householding Department as indicated above. You will be removed from the householding program within 30 days of receipt of your instructions, at which time you will then be sent separate copies of the documents. 
If you are a beneficial owner, you can request information about householding from your broker, bank or other holder of record. 
How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials? 
This Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement, the proxy card and the Company's 2018 Form 10-K, along with instructions on how to obtain an admission ticket, which is required to attend the annual meeting in person, are available at www.proxyvote.com. 
In accordance with the SEC rules, we are using the Internet as our primary means of furnishing proxy materials to our stockholders. Consequently, most of our stockholders will not receive paper copies of our proxy materials. Instead we are sending these stockholders a Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials with instructions for accessing the proxy materials, including our   proxy statement and 2018 Form 10-K, and voting by Internet. The Notice of Annual Meeting and Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also provides information on how our stockholders may obtain paper copies of our proxy materials if they so choose. This makes the proxy distribution process more efficient and less costly, and helps conserve natural resources. If you previously elected to receive our proxy materials electronically, these materials will continue to be sent via email unless you change your election. 
If you receive paper copies of our proxy materials and would like to sign up for electronic delivery via email or the Internet, please follow the instructions to vote by Internet at www.proxyvote.com and, when prompted, indicate that you agree to receive or access stockholder communications electronically in future years.  BOARD AND GOVERNANCE PRACTICES 
OVERVIEW 
The following section provides an overview of our Board and corporate governance practices. We have taken several actions to be responsive to stockholder feedback, including expanding our stockholder outreach efforts and enhancing our proxy disclosure to provide greater transparency to our stockholders. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES 
Our Board has adopted the Governance Guidelines and other practices to promote the functioning of the Board and its committees to serve the best interests of all our stockholders. The Governance Guidelines provide a framework for our governance practices, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Annual election of directors, with all directors serving one-year terms   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Board composition to include a broad range of skills, experience, industry knowledge, diversity of opinion and  contacts relevant to the Companys business that serves the interests of the holders of both our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Board self-assessments conducted at least annually to assess the mix of skills and experience that directors  bring to the Board to facilitate an effective oversight function  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Robust director nomination criteria to ensure a diversity of viewpoints, background and expertise in the  boardroom  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Regular executive sessions of independent directors   
✓  Independent Board committees, with each of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee comprised 100% of  independent directors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  Restricted stock units subject to holding requirement through the end of service on the Board   
[END TABLE]
Our Governance Guidelines set forth our practices and policies with respect to Board composition and selection, Board meetings, executive sessions of the Board, Board committees, the expectations we have of our directors, selection of the Executive Chairman and the President and Chief Executive Officer, management succession, Board and executive compensation, and Board self-assessment requirements. The full text of our Governance Guidelines may be viewed at our corporate website at www.msgnetworks.com under Investors — Corporate Governance. A copy may be obtained by writing to MSG Networks Inc., 11 Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, NY 10001; Attention: Corporate Secretary. 
STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
Fostering long-term relationships with our stockholders is a priority for the Company. Engagement helps us gain insight into the issues most important to our stockholders, informing Board discussions and allowing us to consider investors' views on a range of topics including corporate governance and executive compensation matters. 
We regularly engage with stockholders, and during each of the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years, we have engaged with holders of over 75% of our Class A Common Stock concerning our Board, governance and executive compensation practices, with the specific goal of seeking stockholder feedback. We greatly value the views of our stockholders, and we look forward to continuing this dialogue.  BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
Our Board has chosen to separate the roles of Executive Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes that this is the optimal leadership structure as it recognizes both Mr. James L. Dolan's senior executive role with the Company as well as his leadership position on the Company's Board while the Company is also able to benefit from the experience of its President and Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Andrea Greenberg, with responsibility for day-to-day management of the Company. 
BOARD SELF-ASSESSMENT 
The Board conducts an annual self-assessment to determine whether the Board and its committees are functioning effectively. Among other things, the Board's self-assessment seeks input from the directors on whether they have the tools and access necessary to perform their oversight function as well as suggestions for improvement of the Board's functioning. In addition, our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee each conducts its own annual self-assessment, which includes an assessment of the adequacy of their performance as compared to their respective charters. 
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS OF NON-MANAGEMENT AND INDEPENDENT BOARD MEMBERS 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, either our directors who are not also executive officers of our Company (the "non-management directors") or our directors who are independent under the NYSE rules are required to meet regularly in executive sessions with no members of management present. If non- management directors who are not independent participate in these executive sessions, the independent directors under the NYSE rules are required to meet separately in executive sessions at least once each year. 
RISK OVERSIGHT 
Our Board believes that risk oversight is an important Board responsibility. The Audit Committee takes the lead on behalf of the Board in this risk oversight role. The Audit Committee discusses guidelines and policies governing the process by which the Company's management assesses and manages the Company's exposure to risk, and discusses the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Compensation Committee considers the Company's exposure to risk in establishing and implementing our executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee, with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, reviewed the level of risk incentivized by the Company's executive compensation program as well as incentive programs below the executive level. Based on this assessment and the executive compensation program's emphasis on long-term performance, its close connection to Company-wide performance and its equity-based component designed to align the executive officers' compensation with the Company's long-term strategy and growth, the Compensation Committee determined that our executive compensation program does not create incentives for excessive risk-taking that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  COMMUNICATING WITH OUR DIRECTORS 
Our Board has adopted policies designed to allow our stockholders and other interested parties to communicate with our directors. Any interested party who wishes to communicate directly with the Board or any director or the non-management directors as a group should send communications in writing to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, MSG Networks Inc., 11 Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, NY 10001. 
Any person, whether or not an employee, who has a concern with respect to our accounting, internal accounting controls, auditing issues or other matters, may, in a confidential or anonymous manner, communicate those concerns to our Audit Committee by contacting the MSG Networks Integrity Hotline, which is operated by a third-party service provider, at 1-844-761-0392.
CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS 
Our Board has adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics for our directors, officers and employees. A portion of this Code of Conduct and Ethics also serves as a code of conduct and ethics for our senior financial officers, including our principal accounting officer and controller. Among other things, our Code of Conduct and Ethics covers conflicts of interest, disclosure responsibilities, legal compliance, reporting and compliance with the Code of Conduct and Ethics, confidentiality, corporate opportunities, fair dealing, protection and proper use of Company assets and equal employment opportunity and harassment. The full text of the Code of Conduct and Ethics is available on our website at www.msgnetworks.com. In addition, a copy may be obtained by writing to MSG Networks Inc., 11 Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, NY 10001; Attention: Corporate Secretary. 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
As a "controlled company" we have the right to elect not to comply with the corporate governance rules of the NYSE requiring: (i) a majority of independent directors on our Board, (ii) an independent corporate governance and nominating committee, and (iii) an independent compensation committee. Because of our status as a "controlled company" we have elected not to maintain a majority of independent directors on our Board or to have a corporate governance and nominating committee. We elect to maintain an independent compensation committee. 
Our Board elected not to comply with the requirement for a majority of independent directors on our Board because of our voting structure. Under the terms of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended ("Certificate of Incorporation"), the holders of the Company's Class B Common Stock have the right to elect up to 75% of the members of our 
 Board and there is no requirement that any of those directors be independent or be chosen independently. 
However, our Board has determined that each of the Class A director nominees is "independent" within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and the SEC: Joseph J. Lhota, Joel M. Litvin and John L. Sykes. In reaching its determination, the Board considered following:  DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS 
As permitted under the NYSE rules, we do not have a nominating committee and believe it is appropriate not to have one because of our stockholder voting structure. The Board nonetheless has established a nomination mechanism in our Corporate Governance Guidelines for the selection of nominees for election as directors by the holders of our Class A Common Stock ("Class A Directors") and by the holders of our Class B Common Stock ("Class B Directors"), as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       of the independent Class A Directors then in office.  
[END TABLE]
Our Certificate of Incorporation provides holders of the Company's Class B Common Stock the right to elect up to 75% of the members of our Board and holders of our Class A Common Stock the right to elect 25% of the members of our Board. 
DIRECTOR SELECTION 
Our Board believes that each director nominee should be evaluated based on the skills needed on the Board and his or her individual merits, taking into account, among other matters, the factors set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines under "Board Composition" and "Selection of Directors." Those factors include: 
The Class A Directors evaluate and recommend Class A Director candidates to the Board for nomination as Class A Directors and suggest individuals for the Board to explore in more depth. The Board also considers Class A Director nominees recommended by our stockholders. Nominees recommended by our stockholders are given consideration in the same manner as other nominees. Stockholders who wish to submit nominees for consideration by the Board for election at our 2018 annual meeting of our stockholders may do so by submitting in writing such nominees' names, in compliance with the procedures and along with other information required by the Company's Amended By-laws. See "Other Matters — Stockholder Proposals for 2019 Annual Meeting." 
The Class B Directors will consult from time to time with one or more of the holders of our Class B Common Stock to ensure that all Class B Director nominees recommended to the Board are individuals who will make a meaningful contribution as Board members and will be individuals likely to receive the approving vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B Common Stock. The Class B Directors do not intend to consider unsolicited suggestions of nominees by holders of our Class A Common Stock. We believe that this is appropriate in light of the voting provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation which provides the holders of our Class B Common Stock the exclusive right to elect our Class B Directors.  BOARD MEETINGS 
The Board met four times during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and all of the directors who were on the Board during such time attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and, as applicable, the committees of the Board on which he or she served. 
We encourage our directors to attend annual meetings of our stockholders and believe that attendance at annual meetings is equally as important as attendance at Board and committee meetings. All of the incumbent directors, except one, attended the 2017 annual stockholders' meeting. 
COMMITTEES 
Our board has two standing committees comprised solely of independent directors: the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. 
Audit Committee 
The primary purposes and responsibilities of our Audit Committee are to: 
Our Board has determined that each member of our Audit Committee is "independent" within the meaning of the rules of both the NYSE and the SEC, and that each has not participated in the preparation of the financial statements of the Company or any current subsidiary of the Company at any time during the past three years and is able to read and understand fundamental   financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. Our Board has also determined that Mr. Lhota is an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of the rules of the SEC. 
Our Board has established a procedure whereby complaints or concerns with respect to accounting, internal controls, auditing and other matters may be submitted to the Audit Committee. This procedure is described under "Board and Governance Practices — Communicating with Our Directors." 
The text of our Audit Committee charter is available on our website at www.msgnetworks.com under Investors — Corporate Governance. A copy may be obtained by writing to MSG Networks Inc., Corporate Secretary, 11 Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, NY 10001. 
Compensation Committee 
The primary purposes and responsibilities of our Compensation Committee are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       approve their compensation based upon that evaluation;  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews the performance of the Senior Employees, evaluates their performance in light of those goals and objectives and, either as a committee or together with any other independent directors (as directed   by the Board) determines and approves the Senior Employees' compensation level based on this evaluation. In determining the long-term incentive component of our Chief Executive Officer's compensation, the Compensation Committee considers, among other factors, the Company's performance and relative stockholder return, the value of similar incentive awards to Chief Executive Officers at comparable companies and the awards given to the Chief Executive Officer in past years. As discussed above, our Board has determined that each member of our Compensation Committee is "independent" under the rules of the NYSE. 
The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, delegate a portion of its duties and responsibilities to one or more subcommittees of the Compensation Committee. For example, the Compensation Committee may delegate the approval of certain transactions to a subcommittee consisting solely of members of the Compensation Committee who are (i) "non-employee directors" for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, and (ii) "outside directors" for the purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code ("Section 162(m)"). The Compensation Committee has delegated the approval of certain Section 162(m)-related compensation decisions relating to granting, and determining the level of performance under, performance-based compensation to a subcommittee comprised of Messrs. Litvin and Sykes. The Compensation Committee may also engage outside compensation consultants to assist in the performance of its duties and responsibilities. 
The text of our Compensation Committee charter is available on our website at www.msgnetworks.com. A copy may be obtained by writing to MSG Networks Inc., Corporate Secretary, 11 Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, NY 10001. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
Messrs. Lhota, Litvin and Sykes serve as members of the Compensation Committee. Neither Mr. Litvin nor Mr. Sykes is a current or a former executive officer or employee of the Company. Mr. Lhota was an employee of the Company from June 2, 2010 to November 9, 2011. 
Independent Committee 
In addition to standing committees, the Company has adopted a policy whereby a committee of our Board consisting entirely of independent directors (an "Independent Committee") will review and approve or take such other action as it may deem appropriate with respect to transactions involving the Company and its subsidiaries in which any director, executive officer, greater than 5% stockholder of the Company or any other "related person" (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K adopted by the SEC) has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. This approval requirement covers any transaction that meets the related party disclosure requirements of the SEC as set forth in Item 404, which currently apply to transactions (or any series of similar transactions) in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000. 
Our Board has also adopted a special approval policy for transactions with MSG and AMC Networks Inc. ("AMC Networks") and their respective subsidiaries whether or not such transactions qualify as "related party" transactions described above. Under this policy, the Independent Committee oversees approval of all transactions and arrangements between the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and each of MSG and its subsidiaries and AMC Networks and its subsidiaries, on the other hand, in which the amount exceeds $120,000. To simplify the administration of the approval process under this policy, the Independent Committee may, where appropriate, establish guidelines for certain of these transactions.  Currently, and throughout our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, our Audit Committee (which consisted solely of Class A Directors) served as the Independent Committee under the above policies. For a further discussion of the scope of these policies, see "Related Party Transaction Approval Policy." 
Other Committee Matters 
Our Amended By-Laws permit the Board to form an Executive Committee of the Board which would have the power to exercise all of the powers and authority of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Company, except as limited by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our Board has not formed an Executive Committee, although it could do so in the future. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The following table describes the components of our non-management directors' compensation program in effect during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018:

The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company's financial reporting, internal controls, and audit functions. As set forth in the charter of the Audit Committee, management of the Company is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Company's financial statements, the Company's accounting and financial reporting principles, and the Company's internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The Company's Internal Audit function is provided to the Company by the Internal Audit Department of MSG through an agreement with MSG. The Internal Audit function provides the Audit Committee and management an independent review function, including reviewing and evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness, and quality of the Company's system of internal controls. 
The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG, is responsible for auditing the Company's financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and expressing an opinion on the conformity of the consolidated financial statements to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and KPMG the audited financial statements and its evaluation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee discussed with KPMG the matters required to be discussed pursuant to PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16 (Communications with Audit Committees). The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Audit Committee regarding independence, and the Audit Committee discussed with KPMG the firm's independence. All audit and non-audit services performed by KPMG must be specifically approved by the Audit Committee or by its Chairman (and subject to ratification by the full committee). 
As part of its responsibilities for oversight of the risk management process, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company's risk assessment and risk management framework, including discussions of individual risk areas as well as a summary of the overall process. 
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's Internal Audit function and KPMG, the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Audit Committee met with the head of the Internal Audit Department of MSG (who oversees the provision of internal audit services to the Company under an agreement with MSG) and representatives of KPMG, in regular and executive sessions, to discuss the results of their examinations related to the Company, the evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting and compliance programs. 
Based upon the reports, reviews and discussions described in this report, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's 2018 Form 10-K that was filed with the SEC.

John L. Sykes  LETTER FROM THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE 
Dear Fellow Stockholder, 
We thank you for your continued support of MSG Networks. We wish to share with you how the Compensation Committee continues to evolve our executive compensation program and practices to support our long-term strategic goals and drive stockholder value creation. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews our compensation structure against the following four over-arching principles that we believe are core to pay and performance alignment and appropriately motivate our executive officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A significant portion of each executive officer's compensation opportunity should be at risk based on  Company and stock performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentives should generally comprise a greater proportion of total compensation than short-term  incentives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity compensation should be a meaningful component of total compensation in order to establish a direct  alignment of interests between executive officers and our stockholders; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We should attract, retain, motivate and reward the best talent in a competitive industry.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee also seeks to include the input of our stockholders in the regular evaluation of our programs. During the 2018 fiscal year, management of the Company engaged with holders of over 75% of our Class A Common Stock to discuss our Board, governance and compensation practices, with the specific goal of seeking stockholder feedback. 
Further detail on our compensation program is included in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis that follows. We are committed to maintaining a compensation structure that aligns pay with performance and effectively motivates our executive officers to continue driving long-term value creation for our stockholders. We welcome continued stockholder feedback on our executive compensation practices.

During each of the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years, we have engaged with holders of over 75% of our Class A Common Stock concerning our Board, governance and executive compensation practices, with the specific goal of seeking stockholder feedback. 
In direct response to our stockholder feedback and the Compensation Committee's regular review of our programs, and in consultation with the compensation consultant, during the 2017 fiscal year we made several enhancements that we believe further align our compensation practices with our long-term strategy and the interests of our stockholders. Such enhancements include the improvement of disclosures regarding incentive program design, goal achievement against targets, and the alignment of incentive payouts with sustained Company performance, as well as the adoption of an anti-pledging policy. 
We value the views of our stockholders, and we look forward to continuing this dialogue to inform the Compensation Committee's ongoing review of the program. 
Executive Compensation Program Objectives and Philosophy 
The Company competes for talent among a wide array of media and entertainment companies. Our executive officers have substantial and meaningful professional experience in the industry in which the Company operates. 
The Company places great importance on its ability to attract, retain, motivate and reward experienced executive officers who can drive our business objectives and achieve strong financial and operational performance as well as long-term value creation. The Compensation Committee has designed executive compensation policies and programs that are consistent with, explicitly linked to, and supportive of, the strategic objectives of growing the Company's businesses and maximizing long-term stockholder value. Our Compensation Committee has designed a program that reflects four key overarching executive compensation principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
A significant portion of compensation opportunities should be at risk.      The majority of executive compensation is at risk and based on stockholder returns as well as  the Companys performance against predetermined financial performance targets. 
Long-term performance incentives should generally outweigh short-term performance incentives.      Incentive compensation focuses more heavily on long-term rather than short-term accomplishments  and results. 
Executive officers should be aligned with our stockholders through equity compensation.      Equity-based compensation comprises a substantial portion of executive compensation, ensuring  alignment with stockholder interests. 
The compensation structure should enable the Company to attract, retain, motivate and reward the best talent.      The overall executive compensation program is competitive, equitable and thoughtfully structured  so as to attract, retain, motivate and reward talent.     The Compensation Committee focuses on total direct compensation, as well as individual  compensation elements when providing competitive compensation opportunities.

[END TABLE]
 In designing the executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee seeks to fulfill these objectives by maintaining appropriate balances between (1) short-term and long-term compensation, (2) cash and equity compensation, and (3) performance-based and time-based vesting of compensation. 
Elements of Compensation 
The Company compensates its NEOs through base salary, annual incentive awards, long-term incentive awards, perquisites and benefit programs. Our annual and long-term incentive programs provide performance-based incentives for our NEOs tied to key financial and strategic measures that drive long-term stockholder value and reward sustained achievement of the 
 Company's key financial goals. The Company considers Company revenue and AOI to be the key measures of its operating performance. As such, our Compensation Committee has incorporated these performance measures into our annual incentive awards and long-term incentive performance equity awards, along with other specific strategic and operating measures. The Company's long-term incentive program also includes restricted stock units and time-vesting stock options whose value is tied to the performance of the market value of the Company's Class A Common Stock. 
The table below summarizes the current elements of our compensation program and how each element supports the Company's compensation objectives:

Sound Compensation Governance Practices 
The Company's executive compensation program is overseen by the wholly independent 
 Compensation Committee, with the support of an independent compensation consultant. We maintain a compensation program with strong governance features, including: 
COMPENSATION PROGRAM PRACTICES AND POLICIES 
The following discussion describes the practices and policies implemented by the Compensation Committee during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. For the 2018 fiscal year, compensation for the NEOs was subject to employment agreements approved by the Company's Compensation Committee. Information concerning the Company's current employment agreements with each NEO is set forth below under "Executive Compensation Tables — Employment Agreements." 
In the Company's most recent advisory "say-on-pay" proposal, which was held in 2017, a substantial majority of stockholders (including a majority of holders of our Class A Common   Stock) voted to approve on an advisory basis the Company's executive compensation. The Compensation Committee considered the results of this vote, as well as the Company's ongoing discussions with stockholders, in its assessment and development of the compensation program. These factors, among other considerations, contributed to our decision to adopt an anti-pledging policy and enhance our disclosure related to our compensation practices during the 2017 fiscal year. 
Role of the Compensation Committee 
Our Compensation Committee administers our executive compensation program. The responsibilities of the Compensation Committee are set forth in its charter. Among other responsibilities, the Compensation Committee (1) establishes our general compensation philosophy and, in consultation with management, oversees the development and implementation of compensation programs; (2) reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our executive officers who are required to file reports with the SEC under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, evaluates their performance in light of those goals and objectives, and determines and approves their respective compensation level based on this evaluation; (3) oversees the activities of the committee or committees administering our retirement and benefit plans; and (4) administers our stockholder-approved compensation plans. For more information about the Compensation Committee, please see "Board and Governance Practices — Committees — Compensation Committee." 
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee has authority under its charter to engage outside consultants to assist in the performance of its duties and responsibilities. Our Compensation Committee utilizes the services of ClearBridge Compensation 
 Group LLC (the "compensation consultant"), an independent compensation consultant, to assist in determining whether the elements of our executive compensation program are reasonable and consistent with our objectives. 
The compensation consultant reports directly to the Compensation Committee and, at the request of the Compensation Committee, the compensation consultant meets with members of management from time to time for the purpose of gathering information on management proposals and recommendations to be presented to the Compensation Committee. 
The services provided by the compensation consultant to the Compensation Committee during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 included:  During the 2018 fiscal year, the compensation consultant provided no services to the Company other than those provided to the Compensation Committee. 
The Compensation Committee charter requires the Compensation Committee to consider the NYSE independence factors before receiving advice from an advisor, despite the fact that such independence rules are not applicable to controlled companies. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Compensation Committee concluded that the compensation consultant satisfies the independence requirements of the NYSE rules. In addition, the Compensation Committee believes that the compensation consultant's work did not raise any conflicts of interest during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. In reaching this conclusion, the Compensation Committee considered the same rules regarding advisor independence. 
Role of Executive Officers in Determining Compensation 
The Compensation Committee reviews the performance and compensation of the Executive Chairman and the President and Chief Executive Officer and, following discussions with the compensation consultant, establishes each of their compensation. Senior management of the Company assists the Compensation Committee and the compensation consultant as described in this Compensation Discussion & Analysis, and provides to the Compensation Committee, either directly or through the compensation consultant, management's recommendations on the compensation for executive officers other than the Executive Chairman and the President and Chief Executive Officer. Other members of management provide support to the Compensation Committee as needed. Based upon a review of performance and historical compensation, recommendations and information from members of management, and discussions with the compensation consultant, the 
 Compensation Committee determines and approves compensation for the executive officers. 
Performance Objectives 
As described below under "— Elements of Our Compensation Program," performance-based incentive compensation is an important element of the Company's executive compensation program. 
Generally, the Compensation Committee has historically based the performance objectives for the Company's incentive compensation on Company revenues and AOI. The Company considers these performance objectives to be key measures of the Company's operating performance. 
The Company defines AOI, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as operating income (loss) before (i) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment and intangible assets, (ii) share-based compensation expense or benefit, (iii) restructuring charges or credits and (iv) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses. Because it is based on operating income (loss), AOI also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items. At the time of grant of an award, the performance measures used may contemplate certain potential future adjustments and exclusions. 
Tally Sheets 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed tally sheets prepared by the compensation consultant, setting forth all components of compensation payable, and the benefits accruing, to the NEOs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, including all cash compensation, benefits, perquisites and the current value of outstanding equity-based awards. The tally sheets also set forth potential payouts to the NEOs upon various termination scenarios.  Determining Compensation Levels; Benchmarking 
As part of the Compensation Committee's review of the total compensation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the compensation consultant assisted the Compensation Committee in: (1) determining if a peer group should be used for comparative purposes, (2) assessing executive compensation in light of internal and external considerations and (3) reviewing the Company's equity and cash-based executive incentive programs, taking into account evolving market trends. The Compensation Committee, in consultation with the compensation consultant considered broad market data (industry-related and general industry data) and multiple broad-based compensation surveys in order to appropriately assess compensation levels. 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the compensation consultant, determined not to utilize a peer group or target positioning in determining compensation given the limited number of comparable publicly-traded companies. 
Besides the market data listed above, the Compensation Committee considered internal information (historical compensation, job responsibility, experience, parity among executive officers, contractual commitments and attraction and retention of talent) to determine compensation. 
ELEMENTS OF OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
Our executive compensation philosophy is reflected in the principal elements of our executive compensation program, each of which is important to the Company's goal of attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding highly-qualified executive officers. The compensation program included the following key elements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018: base salary, annual cash incentives, long-term incentives, retirement, health and welfare and other benefits, which are generally provided to all other eligible employees, and additional executive officer benefits, including post-termination compensation under certain circumstances and certain perquisites, each as described below. 
A significant percentage of total direct compensation is allocated to incentive compensation in accordance with the Compensation Committee's philosophy. The Compensation Committee reviews historical Company compensation, other information provided by the compensation consultant and other factors, such as experience, performance, length of service and contractual commitments, to determine the appropriate level and mix of compensation for executive officers. The allocation between cash and equity compensation and between short-term and long-term compensation is designed to provide a variety of fixed and at-risk compensation that is related to the achievement of the Company's short-term and long-term objectives. 
The compensation program and philosophies discussed in this proxy statement reflect only compensation that is paid by the Company for services rendered to the Company. Mr. Dolan is also employed by MSG as its Executive Chairman and Mr. Burian is also employed by MSG as its Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary. Messrs. Dolan and Burian receive separate compensation from MSG with respect to such employment. For more information regarding the respective compensation of Messrs. Dolan and Burian by MSG, see MSG's Definitive Proxy Statement, filed with the SEC on October 25, 2018.  Base Salaries 
Our Compensation Committee is responsible for setting the base salaries of the executive officers, which are intended to compensate them for the day-to-day services that they perform for the Company. Base salaries for these executive officers have been set at levels that are intended to reflect the competitive marketplace in attracting and retaining quality executive officers. The employment agreements between the Company and the NEOs contain a base salary level. For information regarding these base salary levels, please see "Executive Compensation Tables — Employment Agreements" below. The Compensation Committee reviews the salaries of the executive officers at least annually. The Compensation Committee may adjust base salaries for executive officers over time, based on their performance and experience and in accordance with the terms of their employment agreements. 
The base salaries paid by the Company to each of Mr. Dolan, Ms. Greenberg, Messrs. Richter and Burian, and Ms. Darino-Gorski in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were as follows: $1,000,000, $974,615, $692,050, $309,000, and $369,036, respectively. See footnote 1 to "Executive Compensation Tables — Summary Compensation Table" for additional information regarding the base salaries paid during the Company's fiscal year. Effective September 1, 2018, annual base salaries of Ms. Greenberg, Messrs. Richter and Burian, and Ms. Darino-Gorski were increased to $1,200,000, $750,000, $360,000 and $400,000, respectively. The base salary for Mr. Dolan is $1,000,000 and did not change from the prior year. The Compensation Committee determined salaries for NEOs after evaluation of Company and individual performance, market pay levels, the range of increases generally provided to the Company's employees and, to the extent appropriate, management's recommendations. 
Annual Cash Incentives 
Overview 
Annual cash incentives in the 2018 fiscal year were determined by performance against goals: under the Management Performance Incentive Plan ("MPIP") for the purpose of determining the final annual incentive payouts, and under the Cash Incentive Plan ("CIP") for the purpose of achieving tax deductibility pursuant to the performance compensation exemption under Section 162(m) as in effect prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See "Compensation Discussion & Analysis — Tax Deductibility of Compensation" for a discussion of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the Company's compensation program. 
This annual incentive is designed to link executive compensation directly to the Company's performance by providing incentives and rewards based upon business performance during the applicable fiscal year, while preserving   the tax deductibility of awards under Section 162(m) where possible. 
Target Award Opportunities 
Each employee eligible for an annual incentive award is assigned a target award equal to a percentage of that employee's base salary earned during the applicable fiscal year. The target annual incentive awards are based upon the applicable employee's position, grade level, responsibilities, and historical and expected future contributions to the Company. In addition, each employment agreement between the Company and each of the NEOs contains a minimum target annual incentive award level. See "Executive Compensation Tables — Employment Agreements" below. The Compensation 
 Committee, in its sole discretion and subject to the terms of employment agreements, may revise target annual incentive award levels for the executive officers. 
Annual Incentive Payouts 
The below table summarizes each NEO's target annual incentive opportunity and the Compensation Committee's determination of actual 2018 fiscal year annual incentive payouts. Consistent with prior years' practice, payouts earned under the CIP were reduced so that the actual 2018 fiscal year annual incentive payouts were in line with calculated payouts under the MPIP. The annual incentive payouts are described in more detail below.

(1)  Upon achievement of the Section 162(m)-compliant performance threshold, each participant is eligible to  receive payment of an incentive bonus equal to the lesser of $10 million and two times the NEO's target annual incentive award.   
[END TABLE]
MPIP 
Overview 
MPIP awards to all eligible employees are conditioned upon the satisfaction of predetermined financial and strategic objectives, weighted at 80% and 20%, respectively. Final MPIP results are calculated based on performance achievement against these predetermined goals.  Performance Targets & Achievement Levels 
Financial Component (80%): For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the MPIP financial performance objectives included rigorous Company revenue and AOI targets, with potential payouts under this component ranging from 0-200% of target. The level of payout is determined based on the extent to which the Company's annual financial performance exceeded or missed the predetermined targets, as outlined below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Financial Metrics (Weighting)     2018 Fiscal Year Payout  Result 
 Financial Metrics (Weighting)     2018 Fiscal Year Payout  Result 
 Company  Revenue (30%)    100.4% of target 
 Company  AOI (70%)    126.1% of target 
[END TABLE]
Strategic Component (20%): For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the MPIP also included a performance component that measures achievement against strategic objectives set at the beginning of the year. 
Management establishes three strategic goals with up to 13 discrete metrics under each individual goal, which are reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. Each strategic goal is assigned a weight at the beginning of the year and the level of achievement of each goal is evaluated on a four-point scale. The strategic component for NEO payouts is calculated based on the extent to which the objectives are achieved or missed in the fiscal year. 
Based on the Company's performance against the predetermined metrics, the payout result of the strategic component of the MPIP was achieved at 159.0% of target. 
MPIP Payout: As a result of the level of achievement of the financial and strategic objectives, as discussed above, the MPIP paid out at 126.5% of the target level. 
CIP 
Overview 
While the MPIP is used to determine annual incentive amounts, NEOs receive annual incentive awards under the CIP to preserve tax deductibility where possible. 
Performance Targets & Achievements 
For the 2018 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee used Company AOI as the financial measure for CIP funding, with no awards payable under the plan if an AOI threshold for the Company of $251.8 million was not achieved. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, our Company AOI was $336.5 million, and the CIP bonus pool was funded. The Compensation Committee used negative discretion to bring CIP payout levels down to the same level as payouts calculated under the MPIP (i.e., 126.5% of the target level). 
Long-term Incentives 
Long-term incentives represent a substantial portion of our executive officers' annual total direct compensation. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, our long-term incentive programs were comprised of performance stock units and restricted stock units (for all NEOs excluding the Executive Chairman), and performance stock options and time-based stock options (for the Executive Chairman). 
The Committee believes this equity mix:  The following table summarizes our 2018 fiscal year long-term incentive awards for all NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 All NEOs excluding the Executive Chairman 
 Executive Chairman only 
[END TABLE]
For the 2018 fiscal year, Mr. Dolan did not receive restricted stock units and performance stock units, and instead received time-based stock options and performance stock options as contemplated by his employment agreement. Half of the stock options are subject to performance-based vesting conditions, with the same performance conditions that are used for performance stock units; half of the stock options are subject to time-based vesting, with the same vesting schedule that is used for restricted stock units. The Compensation Committee views stock options as inherently performance based because our stock price needs to increase for Mr. Dolan to recognize value, and therefore the Compensation Committee believes that Mr. Dolan's long-term incentive award structure furthers our goal of establishing strong alignment with our stockholders.  Additional information regarding long-term incentive awards granted to NEOs during the 2018 fiscal year is set forth in the "Summary Compensation Table" and the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table under "Executive Compensation Tables" below. 
Effective September 1, 2018, the target annual long-term incentive opportunities of Ms. Greenberg and Messrs. Richter and Burian were increased to $3,400,000, $1,200,000 and $600,000, respectively. These increases reflect each of Ms. Greenberg and Messrs. Richter and Burian's role and performance, as well as his or her competitive market positioning and internal considerations. 
Performance Stock Units 
Performance stock units are intended to align our executive officers' interests with those of our stockholders, with a focus on long-term financial results. Under our executive compensation program for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, performance stock units were granted to executive officers and certain other members of management (other than Mr. Dolan) pursuant to the 2010 Employee Stock Plan, as amended (the "Employee Stock Plan"). With respect to NEOs, the performance stock units also were designed to achieve tax deductibility pursuant to the performance compensation exemption under Section 162(m) where possible. 
2018 Fiscal Year Grants 
In September 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the following awards of performance stock units to the NEOs (with the exception of Mr. Dolan, who was awarded performance-based stock options, as described below) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (for the 2018-2020 fiscal year performance period):

Performance stock units are structured to be settled at the end of the three-year performance period, to the extent the applicable pre-determined financial performance goals are met. 
Target Setting 
For the 2018 fiscal year performance stock units granted in September 2017 for the 2018-2020 fiscal year performance period, the Compensation Committee selected total Company revenue and AOI as the two financial metrics. Goals were set at the beginning of the fiscal year based on the Company's five-year strategic plan, which is subject to review by the Board in connection with its approval of the annual budget. The Company's five-year strategic plan is confidential and disclosure of those targets could provide information that could lead to competitive harm, and for this reason the three-year performance stock unit financial performance targets are not disclosed; however, the Compensation Committee seeks to make target goals ambitious, while threshold goals are expected to be achievable. The Company intends to disclose the Company revenue and AOI payout results as a percentage of target as well as the resulting payout for the 2018-2020 fiscal year performance stock units as a percentage of target after the end of the performance period.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Financial Measures (Weighting)     Threshold Performance     Maximum Performance 
 Financial Measures (Weighting)     Threshold Performance     Maximum Performance 
[END TABLE]
The performance stock unit payout opportunity ranges from 0 to 110% of target, based on performance and subject to continued employment. At the threshold performance level, 90% of the target performance stock units would pay out, and at or above the maximum performance level, 110% of the target performance stock units would pay out. If the Company exceeds threshold levels but does not achieve the targeted rates, or if the Company achieves or exceeds one target but not both, the award provides for partial payments. No performance stock units pay out if the Company fails to achieve both threshold levels of performance. 
Restricted Stock Units 
Restricted stock units serve to align executive officers' interests with those of our stockholders and promote the retention of employees, including the NEOs. 
In September 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the following awards of restricted stock units to the NEOs (with the exception of Mr. Dolan) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 pursuant to the Company's Employee Stock Plan:

[END TABLE]
Restricted stock units vest ratably on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant subject to continued employment, and include a performance threshold designed to achieve tax deductibility pursuant to the performance compensation exemption under Section 162(m) for eligible NEOs. 
For the 2018 fiscal year restricted stock units, the Section 162(m) performance objectives required the AOI of the Company in any of the fiscal years ending on June 30, 2018, June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2020 to exceed 75% of the 2017 fiscal year AOI of the Company. 
On August 28, 2018, the Compensation Committee certified the achievement of the performance objectives for the awards held by NEOs, based on AOI of the Company for the 2018 fiscal year ($336.5 million) exceeding 75% of the AOI of the Company for the 2017 fiscal year ($251.8 million). 
Stock Options 
Stock options establish a close alignment with stock price performance and with our stockholders' interests. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, Mr. Dolan received:  The performance conditions and vesting schedules for the performance stock options are identical to those for the performance stock units. The vesting schedule for the time-based stock options is identical to that of the restricted stock units; however, the time-based stock options do not have a separate Section 162(m) performance objective given that time-based stock options are not required to have performance objectives in order to achieve tax deductibility pursuant to the performance compensation exemption under Section 162(m). See "— Performance Stock Units" and "— Restricted Stock Units" above for additional information. 
In September 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the following stock option awards to Mr. Dolan for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 pursuant to the Company's Employee Stock Plan:

2016 Fiscal Year Performance Stock Unit Awards 
In August 2018, the Compensation Committee certified the Company's achievement of the revenue and AOI performance objectives, weighted at 50% each, for the performance stock units that were granted in September 2015 and equitably adjusted in October 2015 following the MSG Distribution (except for Mr. Richter, whose awards were granted in October 2015 when he joined the Company). Based upon the Company's level of achievement of revenue and AOI over the October 1, 2015 through June 30, 2018 performance period against the targets set for the fiscal year 2016 performance stock units, the 
 Company revenue and AOI performance results as a percentage of target performance were 101.0% and 107.5%, respectively, and the resulting payout for the fiscal year 2016 performance stock units was 101.0% of target, which was settled in September 2018. 
Hedging and Pledging Policies 
The Company's Insider Trading Policy prohibits all directors and employees (including NEOs) from (i) engaging in short sales or other "hedging" transactions and (ii) placing securities in margin accounts or otherwise pledging Company securities. 
Holding Requirements 
Under our executive compensation program for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, annual restricted stock unit awards to NEOs vest ratably on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant and annual performance stock unit awards to NEOs cliff-vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, in each case, so long as the recipient is continuously employed by the Company until the applicable vesting date (and subject to the performance conditions described above and any applicable terms of their employment agreement). With respect to our non-management directors, and as discussed above under "— Director Compensation," 
 compensation includes annual awards of restricted stock units. Pursuant to the award agreements, directors' restricted stock units are settled in shares of Company stock (or, in the Compensation Committee's discretion, cash) on the first business day following 90 days after service on the Board ceases (other than in the event of a director's death, where the restricted stock units are settled immediately). One effect of the cliff and three-year ratable vesting (with respect to our NEOs and eligible employees) and the holding requirements (with respect to our non-management directors) is to require each of our non-management directors, NEOs and eligible employees to maintain significant holdings of Company securities at all times.  BENEFITS 
Benefits offered to executive officers generally provide for retirement income and serve as a safety net against hardships that can arise from illness, disability or death. The executive officers are generally eligible to participate in the same health and welfare benefit plans made available to the other benefits-eligible employees of the Company, including, for example, medical, dental, vision, life insurance and disability coverage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Messrs. Dolan and Burian do not participate in certain Company benefit plans, including the Company's medical, dental and vision plans, as they receive such benefits from MSG. 
Defined Benefit Plans 
Prior to the MSG Distribution, the Company sponsored the MSG Holdings, L.P. Cash Balance Pension Plan (the "Cash Balance Pension Plan"), a tax-qualified defined benefit plan, for participating employees, including certain executive officers. At the time of the MSG Distribution, the Cash Balance Pension Plan was transferred to MSG, but eligible employees of the Company received a full year of credit under the Cash Balance Pension Plan for the 2015 calendar year. Effective March 1, 2011, the Company merged the Madison Square Garden, L.P. Retirement Plan (the "Postretirement Plan"), a frozen defined benefit pension plan, into the Cash Balance Pension Plan. Under the MSGN Holdings, L.P. Excess Cash Balance Plan (the "Excess Plan"), a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, the Company provided additional benefits to employees, including certain of the executive officers, who were restricted by the applicable IRS annual compensation limitation. Each of the Cash Balance Pension Plan and Excess Plan were frozen to new participants and future benefit accruals effective as of December 31, 2015. 
More information regarding the Cash Balance Pension Plan, the Excess Plan, and the Postretirement Plan is provided in the Pension 
 Benefits table under "Executive Compensation Tables" below. 
Defined Contribution Plans 
Prior to the MSG Distribution, the Company sponsored the MSG Holdings, L.P. 401(k) Savings Plan (the "MSG Savings Plan"), a tax-qualified retirement savings plan, for participating employees, including executive officers. As of the MSG Distribution, the MSG Savings Plan was transferred to MSG, renamed The Madison Square Garden 401(k) Savings Plan, and amended to be a multiple employer plan to which the Company contributes as a participating employer. Under the MSG Savings Plan, participants may contribute into their plan accounts a percentage of their eligible pay on a before-tax basis as well as a percentage of their eligible pay on an after-tax basis. The MSG Savings Plan provides (a) an immediately vested matching contribution equal to 100% of the first 4% of eligible pay contributed by participating employees and (b) a discretionary non-elective contribution by the Company. In March 2018, the Company provided a discretionary non-elective contribution with regards to the 2017 calendar year equal to 2% of eligible pay. 
In addition, the Company offers the MSGN Holdings, L.P. Excess Savings Plan (the "Excess Savings Plan"), a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, to employees, including executive officers, who are restricted by the applicable IRS annual compensation limitation and/or the pre-tax income deferral limitation. More information regarding the Excess Savings Plan is provided in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table under "Executive Compensation Tables" below. 
Matching contributions made by the Company under the MSG Savings Plan and the Excess Savings Plan are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table under "Executive Compensation Tables" below.  PERQUISITES 
The Company provides certain perquisites to executive officers as described below. Additional information concerning perquisites received by each of the NEOs is set forth in the Summary Compensation Table under "Executive Compensation Tables" below. 
Car and Driver 
Mr. Dolan has regular access to a car and driver which he is permitted to use for personal use in addition to business purposes. Mr. Dolan's car and driver are provided by MSG and a portion of such costs are reimbursed by the Company. In addition, certain other executive officers and members of management have had access to cars and drivers on a limited basis for personal use. To the extent employees used a car and driver for personal use without reimbursement to the Company, those employees were imputed compensation for tax purposes. 
Aircraft Arrangements 
The Company has access to certain aircraft through time sharing arrangements with a subsidiary of MSG. Additionally, Mr. Dolan has access to helicopter travel pursuant to arrangements made by MSG for personal travel, which has primarily been for purposes of commutation. The Company and MSG have agreed on an allocation of the costs of such personal helicopter use. See "Transactions with Related Parties — Aircraft Arrangements." 
The Company is typically reimbursed for the incremental costs associated with the personal use of aircraft (other than for commutation). To the extent any executive officer or other employee used any of the aircraft for personal travel without reimbursement to the Company, they were imputed compensation for tax purposes based on the Standard Industry Fare Level rates that are published biannually by the IRS. For compensation reporting purposes, we valued the incremental cost of the personal use of the aircraft based on the variable costs incurred by the Company net of any reimbursements received from executive officers. The incremental cost of the use of the aircraft does not include any costs that would have been incurred by the Company whether or not the personal trip was taken. 
Executive Security 
Mr. Dolan participates in MSG's executive security program. The Company and MSG agreed on an allocation of the costs of such participation in their security program. See "Transactions with Related Parties — Relationship Between Us, MSG and AMC Networks." Because certain of these costs can be viewed as conveying personal benefits to Mr. Dolan, they are reported as perquisites. 
Other 
From time to time certain employees, including the NEOs (and their guests), have access to tickets to events at MSG's venues at no cost, and may also purchase tickets at face value. Attendance at such events is integrally and directly related to the performance of their duties, and, as such, we do not deem the receipt of such tickets to be perquisites. 
POST-TERMINATION COMPENSATION 
We believe that post-termination benefits are integral to the Company's ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers. 
Under certain circumstances, payments or other benefits may be provided to employees upon the termination of their employment with the Company. These may include payments or other benefits upon a termination by the Company without cause, termination by the employee for good reason, other voluntary termination by the employee, retirement, death, disability or   termination following a change in control of the Company or following a going private transaction. With respect to the NEOs, the amounts and terms of such payments and other benefits (including the definition of "cause" and "good reason") are governed by each NEO's employment agreement and any applicable award agreements. Post-termination compensation is discussed in greater detail in "Executive Compensation Tables — Employment Agreements" and "— Termination and Severance" below. 
TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF COMPENSATION 
For fiscal years beginning prior to December 31, 2017, Section 162(m) established a $1 million limit on the amount that a publicly held corporation may deduct for compensation paid to the chief executive officer and the next three most highly paid NEOs (other than the chief financial officer) in a taxable year. This limitation does not apply to any compensation that is "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m), which is defined as compensation paid in connection with certain stock options or that is paid only if the individual's performance meets pre-established objective goals based on performance criteria established under a plan approved by our stockholders. Our short-term and long-term incentive compensation plans have generally been designed to qualify for this exemption from the deduction limitations of Section 162(m) and to be consistent with providing appropriate compensation to executive officers. The 
 Company's stockholders approved an amended CIP at the Company's annual stockholders' meeting on December 11, 2015, and an amended Employee Stock Plan on December 15, 2016. 
The Compensation Committee has delegated the approval of certain Section 162(m)-related compensation decisions relating to granting, and determining the level of performance under, performance-based compensation to a subcommittee comprised of Messrs. Litvin and Sykes. 
As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017, Section 162(m) was modified to remove the "qualified performance-based compensation exemption" from Section 162(m), unless such compensation is "grandfathered" because it is paid pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017 and has not been modified in any material respect on or after such date. 
OTHER AWARDS – MSG DISTRIBUTION 
Employee Restricted Stock Units 
In connection with the MSG Distribution, each holder of an employee restricted stock unit that was granted prior to July 1, 2015 received one MSG restricted stock unit in respect of every three employee restricted stock units owned on the record date (each such MSG restricted stock unit, an "MSG Distribution Unit") and continues to be entitled to a share of our Class A Common Stock (or cash or other property) for each employee restricted stock unit in accordance with the existing award agreement. In connection with the MSG Distribution, each employee restricted stock unit that was granted on or after July 1, 2015 (but prior to the MSG Distribution Date) 
 was adjusted in accordance with its terms, such that (1) each holder who remained employed by the Company following the MSG Distribution continued to hold the employee restricted stock units, with the number of employee restricted stock units adjusted to reflect the MSG Distribution to maintain the value of the employee restricted stock units, and (2) each holder employed by MSG following the MSG Distribution received MSG restricted stock units of the same value as such employee restricted stock units, and the original employee restricted stock units were cancelled. Any holder of employee restricted stock units granted on or after July 1, 2015 (but prior to the MSG Distribution Date), who was employed by both MSG and us   following the MSG Distribution continued to hold our employee restricted stock units, adjusted to reflect the MSG Distribution, and received MSG restricted stock units in connection with the MSG Distribution, so that 30% of the value of the employee's restricted stock units were our employee restricted stock units and 70% of the value of the employee's restricted stock units were MSG restricted stock units.  REPORT OF COMPENSATION COMMITTEE 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion & Analysis set forth above with management. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion & Analysis be included in this proxy statement for filing with the SEC.

[END TABLE]
The Company maintains several benefit plans for our executive officers. The material terms and conditions are discussed below. 
Cash Balance Pension Plan 
Prior to the MSG Distribution, the Company sponsored the Cash Balance Pension Plan, a tax-qualified defined benefit plan that generally covered regular full-time and part-time non-union employees of the Company and certain of its affiliates who completed one year of service. Effective on March 1, 2011, the Postretirement Plan (as described below) was merged into the Cash Balance Pension Plan. The merged plan remains named the Cash Balance Pension Plan, but provides the same benefits that were   previously provided by the two separate plans. As of the MSG Distribution, the Cash Balance Pension Plan was transferred to MSG, and eligible employees of the Company received a full year of credit under the Cash Balance Pension Plan for calendar year 2015. The Cash Balance Pension Plan was frozen to future benefit accruals effective as of December 31, 2015 (though accrued benefits continue to earn interest credits). 
A notional account is maintained for each participant under the Cash Balance Pension Plan. 
While benefit accruals were frozen as of December 31, 2015, participants continue to earn monthly interest credits based on the average of the annual rate of interest on the 30-year U.S. Treasury Bonds for the months of September, October and November of the prior year. 
A participant's interest in the Cash Balance Pension Plan is subject to vesting limitations for the first three years of employment. A participant's account also vests in full upon his or her termination due to death, disability or retirement after attaining age 65. Upon retirement or other termination of employment with the Company, the participant may elect a distribution of the vested portion of the cash balance account. Any amounts remaining in the Cash Balance Pension Plan will continue to be credited with interest until the account is paid. The normal form of benefit payment for an unmarried participant is a single life annuity and the normal form of benefit payment for a married participant is a 50% joint and survivor annuity. The participant, with spousal consent if applicable, can waive the normal form and elect a single life annuity or a lump sum. 
Excess Plan 
The Excess Plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that is intended to provide eligible participants, including each of the NEOs (other than Mr. Richter and Ms. Darino-Gorski), with a portion of their overall benefit that they would accrue under the Cash Balance Pension 
 Plan but for Code limits on the amount of "compensation" (as defined in the Cash Balance Pension Plan) that can be taken into account in determining benefits under tax-qualified plans. The Excess Cash Balance Pension Plan was frozen to future benefit accruals effective as of December 31, 2015 (though accrued benefits continue to earn interest credits). 
The Company maintains a notional excess cash balance account for each eligible participant, and for each calendar year, credits these accounts with the portion of the allocation that could not be made on his or her behalf under the Cash Balance Pension Plan due to the compensation limitation. In addition, the Company credits each notional excess cash balance account monthly with interest at the same rate used under the Cash Balance Pension Plan. A participant vests in the excess cash balance account according to the same schedule in the Cash Balance Pension Plan. The excess cash balance account, to the extent vested, is paid in a lump sum to the participant as soon as practicable following his or her retirement or other termination of employment with the Company. 
Postretirement Plan 
The Postretirement Plan is a tax-qualified defined benefit plan covering substantially all of our non-union full-time and eligible part-time employees, including Ms. Darino-Gorski, who were hired prior to January 1, 2001. Effective as of January 1, 2001, membership in the plan was frozen and benefit accruals under the plan continued only for employees who were already active participants in the plan as of December 31, 2000. As of December 31, 2007, the plan was amended to freeze all benefit accruals effective January 1, 2008 and eliminate the ability of participants to earn benefits for future service under this plan. As discussed above, the Postretirement Plan was merged into the Cash Balance Pension Plan, effective March 1, 2011. This merger did not adversely impact any participant in either of the two plans.  The plan provides a benefit at retirement equal to (i) 2% of a participant's final average pay (as defined in the plan) multiplied by years of benefit service up to 20 years; plus (ii) 1% of the participant's final average pay multiplied by years of benefit service (as defined in the plan) in excess of 20 years; minus (iii) 1.25% of the participant's Social Security benefit multiplied by total benefit service up to 40 years. Final average pay is based on the highest average compensation paid during 60 consecutive months out of the last 120 months of benefit service. Compensation means the basic cash remuneration paid to the participant, including annual incentive compensation, commissions and overtime pay, and before deductions for elective deferrals (up to applicable Code limits). 
As a result of plan participants' benefits under the plan being frozen on January 1, 2008, any pay earned and service completed after that date will not be taken into account when determining the amount of a participant's benefit under the plan. Participants will continue to earn eligibility towards early retirement as long as they remain our employees. Normal retirement under the plan is age 65; however, participants who have attained age 55 and completed at least ten years of vesting service may retire prior to age 65 and receive a reduced benefit. 
The normal form of benefit is a single life annuity for an unmarried participant and a 50% joint and survivor annuity for a married participant. The participant, with the spouse's consent if married, may waive the normal form and elect an optional form of payment, including a single life annuity, a 50%, 75% or 100% joint and survivor annuity, a ten-year certain and life annuity, a level income option that integrates with Social Security benefits, and a lump sum payment if the actuarial present value of the benefit does not exceed $10,000. 
The MSG Savings Plan 
Under the MSG Savings Plan, a tax-qualified retirement savings plan, participating employees, including the NEOs (other than Messrs. Dolan and Burian, each of whom participates through MSG), may contribute into their plan accounts a percentage of their eligible pay on a before-tax basis as well as a percentage of their eligible pay on an after-tax basis. Prior to January 1, 2016, the participants had been eligible to receive a matching contribution from the Company of up to 50% of the first 6% of eligible pay contributed by participating employees. Effective January 1, 2016, the MSG Savings Plan was amended to provide (a) a matching contribution equal to 100% of the first 4% of eligible pay contributed by participating employees and (b) a discretionary non-elective contribution by the Company. In March 2018, the Company made a discretionary non-elective contribution to each eligible employee's account equal to 2% of eligible pay with respect to the 2017 calendar year. In connection with the MSG Distribution, the MSG Savings Plan became a multiple employer plan sponsored by MSG, to which we contribute. 
Excess Savings Plan 
The Excess Savings Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan that operates in conjunction with the Company's tax-qualified MSG Savings Plan. An employee is eligible to participate in the Excess Plan for a calendar year if his or her compensation (as defined in the MSG Savings Plan) in the preceding year exceeded (or would have exceeded, if the employee had been employed for the entire year) the IRS limit on the amount of compensation that can be taken into account in determining contributions under tax-qualified retirement plans ($275,000 in calendar year 2018) and he or she makes an election to participate prior to the beginning of the year. An eligible employee whose contributions to the MSG Savings Plan are limited as a result of this compensation limit or as a result of reaching the maximum 401(k) deferral limit ($18,500, or $24,500 if 50 or over, for calendar year 2018) can continue to make pre-tax contributions under the Excess Savings Plan of up to 6% of his or her eligible pay. In addition, the Excess Savings Plan provides for (a) a fully-vested matching   contribution by the Company equal to 100% of the first 4% of eligible pay contributed by participating employees and (b) a discretionary non-elective fully-vested contribution by the Company. In March 2018, the Company made a discretionary non-elective contribution to each eligible employee's account equal to 2% of eligible pay with respect to the 2017 calendar year. Account balances under the Excess Savings Plan are credited monthly with the rate of return earned by the Stable Value Fund offered as an investment alternative under the MSG Savings Plan. Distributions of vested benefits are made in a lump sum as soon as practicable after the participant's termination of employment with the Company.

It is expected that such awards will consist of annual grants of stock option awards with a grant date fair value of not less than $4,800,000. Subject to applicable plan limitations, 50% of the stock option awards will vest in three equal tranches on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date and the remaining 50% will be subject to the performance criteria applicable to the awards to other executives of the Company under the Company's long-term incentive programs, and the stock options will expire not later than seven years and six months after the date of grant. Mr. Dolan generally is not eligible for our standard benefits program while he is employed by MSG; provided that Mr. Dolan will continue to be eligible to participate in the Excess Savings Plan and his full Company base salary will be used to determine Mr. Dolan's benefits under that plan. 
If, on or prior to December 31, 2019, Mr. Dolan's employment is either involuntarily terminated by the Company for any reason other than "cause" (as defined in the agreement), or is terminated by Mr. Dolan for "good reason" (as defined in the agreement) and cause does not then exist (a "Qualifying Termination"), then, subject to Mr. Dolan's execution of a separation agreement, the Company will provide him with the following benefits and rights: (a) a severance payment in an amount determined at the discretion of the Company, but in no event less than two times the sum of Mr. Dolan's annual base salary and annual target bonus; provided that Mr. Dolan will not be entitled to such cash severance payment if Mr. Dolan remains employed by MSG at the time his employment with the Company is terminated, in which case the Company will pay the amount of such severance payment to MSG, (b) any unpaid annual bonus for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which such termination occurred and a prorated annual bonus for the fiscal year in which such termination occurred, (c) each of Mr. Dolan's outstanding unvested long-term cash awards will immediately vest in full and will be payable to Mr. Dolan to the same extent that other similarly situated active executives receive payment, (d) all of the time-based restrictions on   each of Mr. Dolan's outstanding unvested shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units (including restricted stock units subject to performance criteria) will immediately be eliminated and such restricted stock and restricted stock units will be payable or deliverable to Mr. Dolan subject to satisfaction of any applicable performance criteria, and (e) each of Mr. Dolan's outstanding unvested stock options and stock appreciation awards will immediately vest. 
If Mr. Dolan's employment is terminated due to his death or disability, or if after December 31, 2019 there is a Qualifying Termination, then, subject to execution of a separation agreement (other than in the case of death), he or his estate or beneficiary will be provided with the benefits and rights set forth in clauses (c), (d) and (e) above. 
The employment agreement contains certain covenants by Mr. Dolan, including a noncompetition agreement that restricts Mr. Dolan's ability to engage in competitive activities until the first anniversary of a termination of his employment with the Company. The agreement also recognizes that Mr. Dolan will be employed by MSG during his employment with the Company and states that certain actions and circumstances arising from or relating to such dual employment will not be deemed to be a breach of his obligations under the employment agreement or to constitute cause.

The employment agreement contained certain covenants by Ms. Greenberg including a noncompetition agreement that restricted Ms. Greenberg's ability to engage in competitive activities until the first anniversary of a termination of her employment with the Company. 
The Company and Ms. Greenberg entered into a new employment agreement effective September 1, 2018, which supersedes and replaces her prior agreement. The terms of the new employment agreement are substantially similar to the terms of Ms. Greenberg's prior employment agreement, provided that Ms. Greenberg will receive a minimum annual base salary of not less than $1,200,000 and will be eligible, subject to her continued employment and actual grant by the Compensation Committee, to participate in such long-term incentive programs that are made available in the future to similarly situated executives at the Company, with an aggregate target value of not less than $3,400,000.

Lawrence J. Burian 
On September 11, 2015, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Lawrence J. Burian, effective as of the MSG Distribution Date. 
The employment agreement with the Company provides for Mr. Burian's continued employment as the Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of the Company. The employment agreement provides for a minimum annual base salary of not less than $300,000 and a discretionary annual bonus with a target value equal to not less than 150% of Mr. Burian's annual base salary. Mr. Burian will also participate in future long-term incentive programs that are made available to similarly situated executives of the Company, subject to Mr. Burian's continued employment by the Company. It is expected that Mr. Burian will receive one or more long-term awards with an aggregate target value of not less than $450,000. Mr. Burian will be eligible to participate in the Company's standard benefits program, subject to meeting the relevant eligibility requirements, payment of required premiums, and the terms of the plans. 
If Mr. Burian's employment with the Company is terminated on or prior to October 1, 2019 (the "Burian Scheduled Expiration Date") (i) by the Company other than for "cause" (as defined in the agreement), or (ii) by Mr. Burian for "good reason" (as defined in the agreement) and cause does not then exist, then, subject to Mr. Burian's execution of a separation agreement, the Company will provide Mr. Burian with the following benefits and rights: (a) a severance payment in an amount determined at the discretion of the Company, but in no event less than two times the sum of Mr. Burian's annual base salary and annual target bonus; (b) any unpaid annual bonus for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which such termination occurred and a prorated annual bonus for the fiscal year in which such termination occurred; (c) each of Mr. Burian's outstanding long-term cash awards   will immediately vest in full and will be payable to Mr. Burian to the same extent that other similarly situated active executives receive payment; (d) all of the time-based restrictions on each of Mr. Burian's outstanding restricted stock or restricted stock units granted to him under the plans of the Company will immediately be eliminated and will be payable or deliverable to Mr. Burian subject to satisfaction of any applicable performance criteria; and (e) each of Mr. Burian's outstanding stock options under the plans of the Company will immediately vest. 
If Mr. Burian ceases to be an employee of the Company prior to the Burian Scheduled Expiration Date as a result of his death or disability, and at such time cause does not exist, then, subject to execution of a separation agreement (other than in the case of death), he or his estate or beneficiary will be provided with the benefits and rights set forth in (b), (d) and (e) of the preceding paragraph and each of his outstanding long-term cash awards shall immediately vest in full, whether or not subject to performance criteria and will be payable on the 90th day after the termination of his employment; provided, that if any such award is subject to any performance criteria, then (i) if the measurement period for such performance criteria has not yet been fully completed, then the payment amount will be at the target amount for such award, and (ii) if the measurement period for such performance criteria has already been fully completed, then the payment amount of such award will be at the same time and to the same extent that other similarly situated executives receive payment as determined by the Compensation Committee (subject to the satisfaction of the applicable performance criteria). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mr. Burian will not be entitled to the severance payment described in (a) of the second preceding paragraph if Mr. Burian's employment with the Company is terminated without cause or for good reason (other than if cause then exists) prior to the Burian Scheduled Expiration Date and while 
 Mr. Burian remains employed with MSG. If Mr. Burian's employment with MSG is terminated without "cause" or for "good reason" (as those terms are defined in Mr. Burian's employment agreement with MSG) prior to the Burian Scheduled Expiration Date and while Mr. Burian remains employed by the Company, then Mr. Burian's target annual compensation (consisting of his annual base salary, target annual bonus percentage and minimum annual target long-term incentive value) will increase to equal the aggregate target annual compensation to which Mr. Burian was entitled from the Company and from MSG at the time of such MSG termination. We refer to the amount of this increase as the "incremental compensation." Mr. Burian will not receive a severance payment from MSG (the "MSG Severance") on such a termination, which amount will instead be paid by MSG to the Company. 
Additionally, if Mr. Burian's employment with the Company is terminated after the Burian Scheduled Expiration Date and after such MSG termination without cause, for good reason or due to death or disability, then Mr. Burian will be entitled to an additional severance payment from the Company equal to the MSG Severance less the aggregate incremental compensation paid to Mr. Burian by the Company after the MSG termination. 
In the employment agreement, the Company acknowledges that, in addition to Mr. Burian's services pursuant to the agreement, he will simultaneously serve, and is expected to devote a portion of his business time and attention to serving, as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of MSG. The Company recognizes and agrees that Mr. Burian's responsibilities to MSG will preclude him from devoting substantially all of his time and attention to the Company's affairs. The agreement states the Company's recognition that there may be certain potential conflicts of interest and fiduciary duty issues associated with Mr. Burian's dual roles at the Company and MSG, and that none of (i) his dual responsibilities at the Company and   MSG, (ii) his inability to devote substantially all of his time and attention to the Company's affairs, (iii) the actual or potential conflicts of interest and fiduciary duty issues that are waived in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, or (iv) any actions taken, or omitted to be taken, by him in good faith to comply with his duties and responsibilities to the Company in light of his dual responsibilities to the Company and MSG, will be deemed to be a breach by him of his obligations under the employment agreement nor will any of the foregoing constitute cause. 
The employment agreement contains certain covenants by Mr. Burian including a noncompetition agreement that restricts Mr. Burian's ability to engage in competitive activities until the first anniversary of a termination of his employment with the Company. 
The Company and Mr. Burian entered into a new employment agreement effective September 1, 2018, which supersedes and replaces his prior agreement. The terms of the new employment agreement are substantially similar to the terms of Mr. Burian's prior employment agreement, provided that Mr. Burian will receive a minimum annual base salary of not less than $360,000 and will be eligible, subject to his continued employment and actual grant by the Compensation Committee, to participate in such long-term incentive programs that are made available in the future to similarly situated executives at the Company, with an aggregate target value of not less than $600,000. The new agreement with Mr. Burian expires on December 31, 2021.

Ms. Darino-Gorski was eligible to participate in the Company's discretionary annual cash incentive program with an annual target bonus equal to not less than 35% of her annual base salary. Ms. Darino-Gorski was also eligible to participate in future long-term incentive programs that are made available to similarly situated executives of the Company.

If, prior to the third anniversary of the MSG Distribution Date, Ms. Darino-Gorski's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company other than for "cause" (as defined in the agreement), then, subject to Ms. Darino-Gorski's execution of a separation agreement with the Company, the Company would provide her with the following benefits and rights: (a) a severance payment in an amount determined at the discretion of the Company, but in no event less than the sum of Ms. Darino-Gorski's annual base salary and annual target bonus and (b) any unpaid annual bonus for the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which such termination occurred and a prorated annual bonus for the fiscal year in which such termination occurred. 
The employment agreement contained certain covenants by Ms. Darino-Gorski including a noncompetition agreement that restricted Ms. Darino-Gorski's ability to engage in competitive activities until the first anniversary of a termination of her employment with the Company; provided that the noncompetition covenant would not apply following a termination of Ms. Darino-Gorski's employment by the Company other than for cause if Ms. Darino-Gorski waived her entitlement to the severance benefits described above. 
The Company and Ms. Darino-Gorski entered into a new employment agreement effective   September 1, 2018, which supersedes and replaces her prior agreement. The terms of the new employment agreement are substantially similar to the terms of Ms. Darino-Gorski's prior employment agreement, provided that Ms. Darino-Gorski will receive a minimum annual base salary of not less than $400,000, will participate in the Company's discretionary annual bonus program with an annual target bonus opportunity equal to 40% of her base salary and will be eligible, subject to her continued employment and actual grant by the Compensation Committee, to participate in such long-term incentive programs that are made available in the future to similarly situated executives at the Company, with an aggregate target value of not less than $410,000. The new agreement with Ms. Darino-Gorski expires on the third anniversary of its effective date. If Ms. Darino-Gorski's employment terminates during the term of the new agreement either by the Company other than for cause or by Ms. Darino-Gorski for "good reason" (as defined in the agreement) and cause does not then exist, then Ms. Darino-Gorski will be entitled to the severance benefits described above. 
TERMINATION AND SEVERANCE 
This section describes the payments that would be received by our NEOs who were employed by the Company as of June 30, 2018 upon various terminations of employment scenarios. The information under "Separation from the Company" assumes that each NEO was employed by the Company under his or her applicable employment agreement, and his or her employment terminated as of June 30, 2018. This information is presented to illustrate the payments such NEOs would have received from the Company under the various termination scenarios. 
Separation from the Company 
Payments may be made to NEOs upon the termination of their employment with the Company depending upon the circumstances of their termination, which include termination by the Company without cause, termination by the Company with cause, termination by the NEO for good reason, other voluntary termination by the NEO, retirement, death, disability, or termination following a change in control of the Company or following a going private transaction. Certain of these circumstances are addressed in the employment agreements between the Company and each NEO. For a description of termination provisions in the employment agreements with our NEOs, please see "— Employment Agreements" above. In addition, award agreements for long-term incentives also address some of these circumstances. 
Quantification of Termination and Severance 
The following tables set forth a quantification of estimated severance and other benefits payable to the NEOs who were employed by the Company as of June 30, 2018 under various circumstances regarding the termination of their employment. In calculating these severance and other payments, we have taken into consideration or otherwise assumed the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have valued stock options at their intrinsic value equal to the closing market price of Class A Common  Stock of $23.95 on the NYSE on June 29, 2018, less the per share exercise price, multiplied by the

CEO PAY RATIO 
We are providing the following information about the relationship of the median annual total compensation of our employees and the total compensation of Ms. Andrea Greenberg, our Chief Executive Officer and President as of June 30, 2018, pursuant to the SEC's pay ratio disclosure rules set forth in Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K ("Item 402"). The pay ratio is calculated in a manner consistent with the SEC's pay ratio disclosure rules. 
To identify our median employee, we first determined our U.S. employee population as of June 30, 2018 (the Company has no international employees), representing all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees employed by the Company on that date. Using information from our payroll records, we then measured each employee's annual total compensation, consisting of base salary, overtime payments, short and long-term incentives, and sales incentives. Total compensation for full-time employees who were employed for less than the full fiscal year (i.e., full-time employees who were hired during the course of the 2018 fiscal year) was annualized. The Company did not otherwise make any adjustments as permitted under Item 402. 
Once we identified the median employee, we then determined that employee's total compensation, including any perquisites and other benefits, in the same manner that we determined the total compensation of our NEOs for purposes of the Summary Compensation Table above. 
Given the nature of our business, more than half of our employee population consists of part-time, seasonal and temporary employees. These employees, by the nature of their limited hours worked during the year, have relatively low total compensation when compared to full-time employees. Item 402 does not permit annualized or full-time equivalent adjustments to the compensation of these individuals when identifying our median employee or calculating the pay ratio. 
Using these guidelines, our Chief Executive Officer and President had annual total compensation of $5,419,345 and the median-compensated employee, a part-time temporary announcer, had an annual total compensation of $22,351. The resulting ratio was 242:1. 
Because the SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use different methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio provided above may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratio.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US, MSG AND AMC NETWORKS 
As a result of the MSG Distribution, the Company no longer holds a common stock ownership interest in MSG. However, the Company, MSG and AMC Networks continue to be under the control of members of the Charles F. Dolan family and certain related family entities. In connection with the MSG Distribution, the Company and MSG and AMC Networks entered into the agreements described in this section. Certain of the agreements summarized in this section are included as exhibits to our 2018 Form 10-K, and the following summaries of those agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the agreements as filed. Additional information concerning the arrangements between us and each of MSG and AMC Networks is set forth in Note 15 to our financial statements included in our 2018 Form 10-K. 
Distribution Agreement 
On September 11, 2015, we entered into the Distribution Agreement with MSG (the "MSG Distribution Agreement") in connection with the MSG Distribution. 
Under the MSG Distribution Agreement, MSG provided us with indemnities with respect to liabilities, damages, costs and expenses arising out of any of (i) MSG's businesses; (ii) any breach by MSG of its obligations under the MSG Distribution Agreement; and (iii) any untrue statement or omission in MSG's Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the SEC (the "MSG Registration Statement") or in the related Information Statement (the "MSG Information Statement") other than any such statement or omission relating to the Company and our subsidiaries. We provided MSG with indemnities with respect to liabilities, damages, costs and expenses arising out of any of (i) the   Company's businesses (other than businesses of MSG); (ii) certain identified claims or proceedings; (iii) any breach by us of our obligations under the MSG Distribution Agreement; (iv) any untrue statement or omission in the MSG Registration Statement or MSG Information Statement relating to us and our subsidiaries; and (v) indemnification obligations MSG may have to the NBA, the NHL or the Women's National Basketball Association that result from acts or omissions of the Company. 
In the MSG Distribution Agreement we released MSG from any claims we might have arising out of: 
Additionally, in the MSG Distribution Agreement MSG released us from any claims MSG might have arising out of: 
The MSG Distribution Agreement also provides for access to records and information, cooperation in defending litigation, and methods of resolution for certain disputes. 
Tax Disaffiliation Agreement 
On September 11, 2015, we entered into a Tax Disaffiliation Agreement with MSG (the "MSG Tax Disaffiliation Agreement") that governs MSG's and our respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes and tax benefits, the filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax matters following the MSG Distribution. References in this summary description of the MSG Tax Disaffiliation Agreement to the terms "tax" or "taxes" mean taxes as well as any interest, penalties, additions to tax or additional amounts in respect of such taxes. 
MSG and its eligible subsidiaries previously joined with the Company in the filing of certain consolidated, combined and unitary returns for state, local and other applicable tax purposes. However, for periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the MSG Distribution, MSG generally does not join with the Company in the filing of any federal, state, local or other applicable consolidated, combined or unitary tax returns. 
Under the MSG Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, with certain exceptions, we are generally responsible for all of MSG's U.S. federal, state, local and other applicable income taxes for any taxable period or portion of such period ending on or before the MSG Distribution Date. MSG is generally responsible for all taxes that are attributable to it or one of its subsidiaries after the MSG Distribution Date. 
For any tax year, MSG is generally responsible for filing all separate company tax returns that relate to MSG or one of its subsidiaries and that do not also include the Company or any of the Company's subsidiaries. We generally are responsible for filing all separate company tax returns that relate to the Company or the   Company's subsidiaries (other than tax returns that will be filed by MSG), and for filing consolidated, combined or unitary returns that include (i) one or more of the Company and the Company's subsidiaries and (ii) one or more of MSG and MSG's subsidiaries. Where possible, MSG has waived the right to carry back any losses, credits or similar items to periods ending prior to or on the MSG Distribution Date; however, if MSG cannot waive the right, it would be entitled to receive the resulting refund or credit, net of any taxes incurred by the Company with respect to the refund or credit. 
Generally, MSG has the authority to conduct all tax proceedings, including tax audits, relating to taxes or any adjustment to taxes for which MSG is responsible for filing a return under the MSG Tax Disaffiliation Agreement, and we have the authority to conduct all tax proceedings, including tax audits, relating to taxes or any adjustment to taxes for which we are responsible for filing a return under the MSG Tax Disaffiliation Agreement. However, if one party acknowledges a liability to indemnify the other party for a tax to which such proceeding relates, and provides evidence to the other party of its ability to make such payment, the first-mentioned party will have the authority to conduct such proceeding. The MSG Tax Disaffiliation Agreement further provides for cooperation between MSG and the Company with respect to tax matters, the exchange of information and the retention of records that may affect the tax liabilities of the parties to the agreement. 
Finally, the MSG Tax Disaffiliation Agreement requires that none of the Company, MSG or any of their respective subsidiaries take, or fail to take, any action where such action, or failure to act, would be inconsistent with or preclude the MSG Distribution from qualifying as a tax-free transaction to the Company and to its stockholders under Section 355 of the Code, or would otherwise cause holders of the Company's stock receiving MSG stock in the MSG Distribution to be taxed as a result of the MSG Distribution and certain transactions undertaken in connection with the MSG Distribution. Additionally, for the two-year period following the MSG Distribution, the Company and MSG could not engage in certain activities that might jeopardize the tax-free treatment of the MSG Distribution, unless the Company or MSG, as applicable, received consent from the other party or otherwise obtained a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or a legal opinion, in either case reasonably satisfactory to such other party, that the activity would not alter the tax-free status of the MSG Distribution to the other party and its stockholders. Such restricted activities included: 
Moreover, each party must indemnify the other party and its subsidiaries, officers and directors for any taxes resulting from action or failure to act, if such action or failure to act precludes the MSG Distribution from qualifying as a tax-free transaction (including taxes imposed as a result of a violation of the restrictions set forth above).  Services Agreement 
Effective July 1, 2017, we and MSG entered into a Services Agreement under which MSG provides certain management and other services to the Company, including with respect to such areas as information technology, accounts payable, payroll, tax, certain legal functions, human resources, insurance and risk management, investor relations, corporate communications, benefit plan administration and reporting, and internal audit. The Company similarly provides certain services to MSG. The Company and MSG, as parties receiving services under the agreement, agreed to indemnify the party providing services for losses incurred by such party that arise out of or are otherwise in connection with the provision by such party of services under the agreement, except to the extent that such losses result from the providing party's gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of its obligations under the agreement. Similarly, each party providing services under the agreement agreed to indemnify the party receiving services for losses incurred by such party that arise out of or are otherwise in connection with the indemnifying party's provision of services under the agreement if such losses result from the providing party's gross negligence, willful misconduct or breach of its obligations under the agreement. In connection with the expiration of the Services Agreement on June 30, 2018, we entered into an interim agreement with MSG, pursuant to which each party provides the other with the same services on the same terms. We expect to enter into a new services agreement this calendar year which will be retroactive to July 1, 2018. 
Employee Matters Agreement 
We have in place an Employee Matters Agreement (the "MSG Employee Matters Agreement") with MSG that allocates assets, liabilities and responsibilities with respect to certain employee compensation and benefit plans and programs and certain other related matters in connection with the MSG Distribution. MSG 
 employees continued to participate in certain of our health and welfare and other employee benefit plans through December 31, 2015, following which MSG has established its own health and welfare and other employee benefit plans. In connection with the MSG Distribution, the MSG Savings Plan became a multiple employer plan sponsored by MSG, to which we contribute, and MSG assumed the assets and liabilities of the Cash Balance Pension Plan. Following the MSG Distribution Date, we and MSG generally each hold responsibility for our respective employees and compensation plans except for the liability for certain incentive awards held by corporate, advertising and shared employees, the liability of which is split between the Company and MSG in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement. 
Media Rights Agreements 
The media rights agreements between the Company and MSG covering the New York Knicks of the NBA (the "Knicks") and the New York Rangers of the NHL (the "Rangers") provide MSG exclusive media rights to team games in their local markets. Each of the media rights agreements has a stated term of 20 years, with an annual rights fee in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 of $109 million for the Knicks and $32.73 million for the Rangers. The rights fee in each media rights agreement increases annually; for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the rights fee increased to $113.42 million for the Knicks and $34.06 million for the Rangers. The rights fee is also subject to adjustments in certain circumstances, including if MSG does not make available a minimum number of games in any year. We have certain rights to match third-party offers received by the Knicks or Rangers, as the case may be, for the media rights following the term of the agreement. 
Advertising Sales Representation Agreement 
In connection with the MSG Distribution, the Company entered into an Advertising Agreement pursuant to which MSG has the exclusive right   and obligation, for a commission, to sell advertising availabilities of the Company for an initial stated term of seven years, subject to certain termination rights, including MSG's right to terminate if the Company and MSG are no longer affiliates and our right to terminate if certain sales thresholds are not met unless MSG pays us the shortfall. All of our personnel who had previously worked on advertising sales were transferred to MSG. 
Other Arrangements and Agreements with MSG and/or AMC Networks 
Beginning in June 2016, the Company agreed to share certain executive support costs, including office space, executive assistants, security and transportation costs, for the Company's Executive Chairman with MSG, and for the Vice Chairman with MSG and AMC Networks. The Company's portion of such executive support expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was $989,148. See "— Dolan Family Arrangements" below for a description of certain additional office sharing arrangements that include MSG and AMC Networks. The Company is party to an agreement with AMC Networks, pursuant to which AMC Networks provides the Company with certain origination, master control and technical services. The Company has also entered into a number of other commercial and technical arrangements and agreements with MSG and its subsidiaries and AMC Networks and its subsidiaries, none of which are material to the Company. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, these additional commercial and technical arrangements and agreements included, but were not limited to, arrangements for the Company's use of equipment, offices and other premises, provision of transport services and vendor services, access to technology and for use of equipment, offices and other premises. 
In addition, the Company and MSG are party to aircraft and remote office space arrangements described below. See "— Aircraft Arrangements" and "— Dolan Family Arrangements." 
AIRCRAFT ARRANGEMENTS 
The Company has various arrangements with a subsidiary of MSG, pursuant to which the Company has the right to lease on a "time-sharing" basis certain aircraft. The Company is required to pay MSG specified expenses for each flight it elects to utilize, but not exceeding the maximum amount payable under Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") rules. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company paid MSG $8,697 for use of such aircraft during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. In calculating the amounts payable under these agreements, the parties allocate in good faith the treatment of any flight that is for the benefit of both companies. Additionally, the Company and MSG have agreed on an allocation of the costs of certain helicopter use by its shared executive officers. The Company's portion of such expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was $363,026. 
DOLAN FAMILY ARRANGEMENTS 
From time to time, certain services of the Company may be made available to members of the Dolan family and to entities owned by them. It is the policy of the Company to receive reimbursement for the costs of these services. See "Stock Ownership Table" for a description of registration rights agreements among the Dolan family interests and the Company. 
On June 16, 2016, the Company entered into an arrangement with Dolan Family Office, LLC 
 ("DFO LLC"), a company controlled by Charles F. Dolan (a director of the Company), MSG and AMC Networks providing for the sharing of certain expenses associated with executive office space which is available to James L. Dolan, Charles F. Dolan and DFO LLC. The Company's portion of such office space expenses during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was $25,884.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
Our Executive Chairman, James L. Dolan, also serves as the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MSG, our Vice Chairman, Gregg G. Seibert, also serves as Vice Chairman of MSG and AMC Networks, and our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Lawrence J. Burian, also serves as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of MSG. Six of our director nominees (including James L. Dolan) also serve as directors of MSG, and James L. Dolan serves as an executive officer of MSG concurrently with his service on our Board. Six of our director nominees also serve as directors of AMC Networks, and Charles F. Dolan serves as an executive officer of AMC Networks concurrently with his service on our Board. Therefore, these officers and directors may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting the Company, on the one hand, and MSG or AMC Networks, on the other hand. For example, there is the potential for a conflict of interest when we and MSG and/or AMC Networks look at certain acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for more than one of the companies. Also, conflicts may arise if there are issues or disputes under the commercial arrangements that exist between MSG and/or AMC Networks and us. In addition, certain of our officers and directors own MSG and/or AMC Networks stock, restricted stock units and/or performance stock units. These ownership interests could create actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the Company, MSG or AMC Networks. See "Related Party Transaction Approval Policy" below for a discussion of certain procedures we instituted to help ameliorate any such potential conflicts that may arise. 
Our Certificate of Incorporation acknowledges that the Company may have overlapping directors and officers with MSG and AMC Networks and their respective subsidiaries and that the Company may engage in material business transactions with such entities. In our Certificate of Incorporation, the Company has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and provided that in certain circumstances our directors and officers will not have liability to the Company or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to MSG or AMC Networks or any of their respective subsidiaries instead of the Company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to the Company. The Certificate of Incorporation also expressly validates certain contracts, agreements, arrangements and transactions (and amendments, modifications or terminations thereof) between the Company and MSG and AMC Networks and/or any of their respective subsidiaries and provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the actions of the overlapping directors and officers in connection therewith are not breaches of fiduciary duties owed to the Company or its stockholders. 
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION APPROVAL POLICY 
The Company has adopted a written policy whereby an Independent Committee of our Board reviews and approves or takes such other action as it may deem appropriate with respect to transactions involving the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and in which any director, executive officer, greater than 5% stockholder of the Company or any other "related person" (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K adopted by the SEC) has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. This approval requirement covers any transaction that meets the related party disclosure requirements of the SEC as set forth in Item 404, which currently apply to transactions (or any series of similar transactions) in which the amount involved exceeds the dollar   threshold set forth in Item 404 of Regulation S-K adopted by the SEC (currently $120,000). To simplify the administration of the approval process under this policy, the Independent Committee may, where appropriate, establish guidelines for certain of those transactions. The policy does not cover decisions on compensation or benefits or the hiring or retention of any person. The hiring or retention of executive officers is determined by our full Board. Compensation of executive officers is subject to the approval of our Compensation Committee. This policy also does not cover any pro rata distributions to all Company stockholders, including a pro rata distribution of our Class A Common Stock to holders of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock to holders of our Class B Common Stock. No director on the Independent Committee will participate in the consideration of a related party transaction with that director or any related person of that director. 
In addition, our Board has adopted a special approval policy for transactions with MSG and AMC Networks and their respective subsidiaries whether or not such transactions qualify as "related party" transactions described above. Under this policy, the Independent Committee oversees approval of all transactions and arrangements between the Company and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and each of MSG and its subsidiaries and/or AMC Networks and its subsidiaries, on the other hand, in which the amount exceeds the current $120,000 threshold. To simplify the administration of the approval process under this policy, an Independent Committee may, where appropriate, establish guidelines for certain of these transactions. The approval requirement does not apply to the implementation and administration of the intercompany arrangements under the policy but does cover any amendments, modifications, terminations or extensions involving amounts in excess of the current $120,000 threshold, as well as the handling and resolution of any disputes involving amounts in excess of the current $120,000 threshold. Our executive officers and directors who are also senior executives or directors of MSG and/or AMC Networks may participate in the negotiation, execution, amendment, modification, or termination of intercompany arrangements subject to the policy, as well as in any resolution of disputes thereunder, on behalf of any or all of the Company, MSG and/or AMC Networks, as applicable, in each case under the direction or ultimate approval of an Independent Committee or the comparable committee of the board of directors of the Company, MSG and/or AMC Networks, as applicable. 
Currently, and throughout our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, our Audit Committee (which consisted solely of directors elected by the holders of our Class A Common Stock) served as the Independent Committee under the above policies. 
Our related party transaction approval policy cannot be amended or terminated without the prior approval of a majority of the Company's independent directors and by a majority of the directors elected by our Class B Common Stockholders. For purposes of this policy, "independent directors" means those directors who have been determined by our Board to be independent directors for purposes of the NYSE's corporate governance standards. 
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, certain executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. The SEC regulations require the Company to identify anyone who failed to file a required report or filed a late report during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Based solely on a review of reports filed under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, the Company is aware of no such failure, except that The Charles F. Dolan 2009 Revocable Trust did not timely file a Form 3.  STOCK OWNERSHIP TABLE 
The table sets forth certain information as of October 10, 2018 with respect to the beneficial ownership of the Company's Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock by (i) each person the Company believes beneficially holds more than 5% of any class of the outstanding shares of the Company based solely on the Company's review of SEC filings, (ii) each director or director nominee of the Company and (iii) each NEO of the Company.

[END TABLE]
The Dolan family, including trusts for the benefit of members of the Dolan family (collectively, the "Dolan Family Group"), by virtue of their ownership of Class B Common Stock, are able collectively to control stockholder decisions on matters on which holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class, and to elect up to 75% of the Company's Board. Members of the Dolan Family Group are parties to a Stockholders Agreement, which has the effect of causing the voting power of the Class B stockholders to be cast as a block on all matters to be voted on by holders of Class B Common Stock. Under the Stockholders Agreement, the shares of Class B Common Stock owned by members of the Dolan Family Group are to be voted on all matters in accordance with the determination of the Dolan Family Committee, except that the decisions of the Dolan Family Committee are non-binding with respect to the Class B shares owned by certain Dolan family trusts that collectively own approximately 40.5% of the outstanding Class B Common Stock. 
 The Dolan Family Committee consists of Charles F. Dolan and five of his children, James L. Dolan, Thomas C. Dolan, Kathleen M. Dolan, Deborah A. Dolan-Sweeney and Marianne Dolan Weber. The Dolan Family Committee generally acts by a majority vote, except that a going private transaction must be approved by a two-thirds vote and a change in control transaction must be approved by not less than all but one vote. The voting members of the Dolan Family Committee are James L. Dolan, Thomas C. Dolan, Kathleen M. Dolan, Deborah A. Dolan-Sweeney and Marianne Dolan Weber, with each member having one vote other than James L. Dolan, who has two votes. Because James L. Dolan has two votes, he has the ability to block Dolan Family Committee approval of any Company change in control transaction. Shares of Class B Common Stock owned by the Excluded Trusts are to be voted on all matters in accordance with the determination of the Excluded Trusts holding a majority of the Class B Common Stock held by all Excluded Trusts,   except in the case of a vote on a going-private transaction or a change in control transaction, in which case a vote of trusts holding two-thirds of the Class B Common Stock owned by the Excluded Trusts is required. 
Charles F. Dolan, all other holders of Class B Common Stock (other than the Charles F. Dolan Children Trusts), the Dolan Children's Foundation, the Dolan Family Foundation and the Company have entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Dolan Registration Rights Agreement"). Under this agreement, the Company will provide the parties to the Dolan Registration Rights Agreement (the "Dolan Parties") (and, in certain cases, transferees and pledgees of shares of Class B Common Stock owned by these parties) with certain demand and piggy-back registration rights with respect to their shares of Class A Common Stock (including those issued upon conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock). As of October 10, 2018, the Dolan Parties owned approximately 8.1 million shares of Class B Common Stock (the "Dolan Shares"), which represented approximately 59.8% of our Class B Common Stock as well as 1.7 million shares of Class A Common Stock (including options), which represented approximately 2.8% of our Class A Common Stock. Such shares of Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock, collectively, represented 13.2% of our Common Stock and 42.1% of the aggregate voting power of our Common Stock. 
The Charles F. Dolan Children Trusts (the "Children Trusts") and the Company have entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Children Trusts Registration Rights Agreement"). Under this agreement, the Company will provide the Children Trusts (and, in certain cases, transferees and pledgees of shares of Class B Common Stock owned by these parties) with certain demand and piggy-back registration rights with respect to their shares of Class A Common Stock (including those issued upon conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock). As of October 10, 2018, the Children Trusts owned 5,468,695 shares of Class B Common Stock (the "Children Trust Shares"), which represented approximately 40.2% of our Class B Common Stock, as well as 271,228 shares of Class A Common Stock, which represented approximately 0.4% of our Class A Common Stock. Such shares of Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock, collectively, represented approximately 7.7% of our Common Stock and 27.9% of the aggregate voting power of our Common Stock. 
In the Children Trusts Registration Rights Agreement, each Children Trust has agreed that in the case of any sale or disposition of its shares of Class B Common Stock (other than to Charles F. Dolan or other Dolan family interests) by such Children Trust, or of any of the Children Trust Shares by any other Dolan family interest to which such shares of Class B Common Stock are transferred, such stock will be converted to Class A Common Stock. The Dolan Registration Rights Agreement does not include a comparable conversion obligation, and the conversion obligation in the Children Trusts Registration Rights Agreement does not apply to the Dolan Shares. 
The Dolan Registration Rights Agreement and the Children Trusts Registration Rights Agreement are included as exhibits to our 2018 Form 10-K, and the foregoing discussion of those agreements is qualified in its entirety by reference to those agreements as filed.  OTHER MATTERS

October 25, 2018  ANNEX A – RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP AMOUNTS 
ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME 
The Company believes that presenting Adjusted Operating Income ("AOI"), a non-GAAP measure, is meaningful, as it reflects measures considered by the Compensation Committee in making its compensation determinations. The Company defines AOI as operating income before (1) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment and intangible assets, (2) share-based compensation expense or benefit, (3) restructuring charges or credits and (4) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses. Because it is based upon operating income, AOI also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items. The Company believes that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the Company without regard to the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash. The Company believes AOI is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the 
 Company. AOI and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors and analysts to analyze our performance. Internally, the Company uses revenues and AOI measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluates management's effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. AOI should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Since AOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. All dollar amounts included in this Annex A are presented in thousands, except as otherwise noted. 
The following is a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP) to AOI (non-GAAP):
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Operating income    $ 313,158      $ 314,897   
 Share-based compensation expense      13,979        9,931   
 Depreciation and amortization      9,338        10,296   
 Adjusted operating income    $ 336,475      $ 335,124

 Credit facility debt(1)      1,196,250        1,321,250   
 Net debt    $ 990,907      $ 1,180,163   
 Leverage ratio(2)      2.9x        3.5x   
[END TABLE]
A-1 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Represents aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding.   
(2)  Represents net debt divided by annualized AOI, which differs from the covenant calculation contained in the  Company's credit facility.  
[END TABLE]
FREE CASH FLOW 
The Company defines Free Cash Flow ("FCF") as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures. The Company believes that FCF is useful as an indicator of the Company's overall ability to generate liquidity, as the amount of FCF generated in any period is representative of cash that is generated for debt repayment, investment, and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses. The Company also believes that FCF is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors for comparison of the Company's generation of liquidity with other companies in the industry, although the Company's measure of FCF may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. The Company believes the most comparable GAAP financial measure is net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations excludes net cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations. 
The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations (GAAP) to FCF (non-GAAP): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations    $ 210,610   
 Less: Capital expenditures      (3,724)
