Company Goals 
We are committed to driving shareholder return through three key objectives: 
First, we are committed to achieving organic sales growth above gross domestic product growth (or 3% to 5% annually on average) over a long-term business cycle, absent prolonged adverse economic conditions, complemented by growth through strategic acquisitions. 
Second, we continue to focus on improving returns on capital and segment margins through effective cost management and productivity initiatives, including supply chain activities, targeted restructuring activities, strategic pricing, and portfolio management. 
Third, we aim to generate free cash flow as a percentage of sales of approximately 8-12% through strong earnings performance, productivity improvements, and active working capital management. 
We support these goals through (1) alignment of management compensation with financial objectives, (2) well-defined and actively managed mergers and acquisitions ("M&A") processes, and (3) talent development programs.

DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 4 
PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY 
CEO Succession 
On May 1, 2018, Richard J. Tobin became our new President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") following Robert A. Livingston's retirement. Mr. Tobin continues to serve on our Board, which he joined in August 2016. Mr. Livingston resigned as a director concurrent with his retirement. Michael F. Johnston, as independent Chair of the Board, provided continuity of oversight of management through the transition. 
Mr. Tobin's appointment is the result of our Board's active engagement in a thoughtful and comprehensive succession planning process led by our independent Chair and the independent Chair of our Governance and Nominating Committee, who identified talented external leaders and worked with our former CEO to evaluate and develop internal candidates. Ultimately, our Board determined that Mr. Tobin's extensive experience as a public company CEO leading complex global industrial businesses and his expertise in finance and technology made him the best candidate to lead Dover. Our Board was impressed with Mr. Tobin's contributions as a director and is confident that he is the right leader to guide us through the next phase of our evolution. 
Immediately after starting as President and CEO, Mr. Tobin performed an in-depth study of our businesses, making on-site visits, conducting management team reviews, and analyzing the three-year strategic plans for each of our operating companies. As an outgrowth of this review, he identified and began executing on strategic priorities designed to position us to realize our earnings and growth potential, including near-term initiatives to improve our margins through cost rightsizing and footprint consolidation. Mr. Tobin also has articulated our Board's capital allocation priorities and developed a disciplined framework for portfolio enhancement and a balanced operating model for Dover. He has committed to report to shareholders in 2019 on our progress on operational improvements and capital allocation priorities as well as to present a holistic view on portfolio strategy, growth drivers, and areas for reinvestment and to articulate longer term strategic goals for the next evolution of Dover. 
Board Refreshment 
Our Board welcomed H. John Gilbertson, Jr. as a director in August 2018. As a former Managing Director of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ("Goldman Sachs"), Mr. Gilbertson has extensive experience in corporate finance, capital markets, and mergers and acquisitions. The insights he gained as an advisor to clients across a broad range of industries will bring valuable perspective to our Board. Mr. Gilbertson serves on our Audit Committee and Finance Committee. 
Current directors Peter T. Francis and Richard K. Lochridge are not standing for re-election and will retire from the Board effective as of the Annual Meeting. Mr. Francis has been a director since 2007, and Mr. Lochridge has been a director since 1999. The Board expresses its deep gratitude to each of Messrs. Francis and Lochridge for their guidance and significant contributions to Dover during their years of dedicated service on the Board. 
New Finance Committee 
The Board established a new Finance Committee comprised of independent directors in 2018. The Finance Committee assists the Board in overseeing policies, practices, strategies, and risks relating to our financial affairs, including with respect to capital allocation matters such as share repurchases, dividend policy, capital expenditures and M&A, as well as global treasury activities, insured risk management, and tax planning. 
Shareholder Engagement 
In 2018, we continued our focus on regularly engaging with our shareholders. We reached out to holders of over 51% of our shares outstanding, and engaged with governance professionals and/or portfolio managers at investors holding 32% of our shares outstanding. During these discussions, we discussed many topics, including our recent CEO transition, executive compensation program, and Board refreshment practices. Investors continued to express broad support for our governance structures and shared their views on matters related to shareholder rights and our

PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY 
independent, well-qualified Board. Further, investors highlighted the importance of engaging with them in the future on long-term corporate strategy and sustainability initiatives. For more detailed information regarding these discussions, please see "Shareholder Engagement". 
These discussions provide our Board with valuable insights into our shareholders' views. In this proxy statement, we describe the feedback we received, and acted upon, regarding several matters, including our Board's proposals to remove super-majority voting provisions from our charter. We plan to continue to actively engage with our shareholders on a regular basis to better understand and consider their views. 
Management Proposals to Remove Super-Majority Voting Provisions 
Proposals 4 and 5 of this proxy statement request that shareholders approve the removal of the remaining super-majority provisions in our charter. The super-majority voting provisions are limited to (1) amendments to Article 15 of our charter relating to certain share repurchases from "interested stockholders" (defined in our charter as a beneficial holder of 5% or more of our shares, unless held for more than four years) at a per share price in excess of the applicable market price or the ability for shareholders to use cumulative voting in the election of directors once there is a "substantial stockholder" (defined in our charter as a beneficial holder of 40% or more of our shares) (Proposal 4), and (2) amendments to the provision of Article 16 of our charter that prohibits action by written consent of shareholders (Proposal 5). These provisions were originally designed to ensure that the interests of all shareholders were adequately represented in the event any of the actions contemplated by these provisions were to occur. However, the Board is aware that some shareholders oppose super-majority provisions, arguing that super-majority voting provisions may limit the ability of a majority of common shareholders to effect changes they desire. 
Informed in part by engagement with our shareholders, we presented these proposals at our 2017 and 2018 Annual Meetings. The proposals were supported by holders of just over 79% of our outstanding common stock in both 2017 and 2018, a level of support below the required affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of our outstanding shares of common stock. 
Following the 2018 meeting, we sought further shareholder input as our Board considered next steps regarding the remaining super-majority provisions. Shareholders expressed appreciation for our continued efforts to remove the provisions and acknowledged our continued responsiveness to shareholder feedback while facing the high hurdle presented by the current 80% voting requirement in our charter to approve amendments to remove the super-majority provisions. Given our proactive and continued efforts to remove the remaining super-majority provisions over the past several years, a number of investors stated that they would have been supportive if our Board did not present a management proposal to eliminate supermajority provisions in 2018. However, several shareholders continued to express a preference for simple majority voting requirements and encouraged us to put forth another management proposal to remove the remaining super-majority voting provisions in our charter. Shareholder feedback was a factor in the Board's decision to again present these two proposals at the 2019 Annual Meeting in order to continue evolving our governance practices to ensure we operate with a best-in-class governance structure.

PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY 
Executive Compensation 
Our compensation program for executive officers is designed to emphasize performance-based compensation in alignment with our business strategy. 
New CEO Employment Agreement 
In connection with Mr. Tobin's appointment as President and CEO and to ensure a smooth executive transition, our independent directors, after considering market data, advice from our independent compensation consultant, and other factors, including Mr. Tobin's position as a sitting CEO, approved Dover's entry into a three-year employment agreement with Mr. Tobin. In order to offset forfeited compensation and pension benefit from his prior company, Mr. Tobin received a one-time award when he joined Dover, subject to termination and claw-back provisions, comprised of restricted stock units ("RSUs") and internal Total Shareholder Return ("iTSR") performance share units and a make-whole cash payment. 
We sought shareholder feedback on Mr. Tobin's compensation arrangements after his appointment, including his one-time award. Our shareholders indicated they were supportive of the structure because it ensured a smooth transition and the Board's ability to hire a highly qualified candidate.

Proposal 1 — Election of Directors 
Criteria for Director Nominees 
The Board, in part through its delegation to the Governance and Nominating Committee, seeks to recommend qualified individuals to become members of the Board. The Board selects individuals as director nominees who, in the opinion of the Board, demonstrate the highest personal and professional integrity as well as exceptional ability and judgment, who can serve as a sounding board for our CEO on planning and policy, and who will be most effective, in connection with the other nominees to the Board, in collectively serving the long-term interests of all our shareholders. 
Key areas of expertise for director nominees, which are reflected in our current director nominees, include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         ✓  Strategic   M&A            Experience with international acquisitions, post-merger integration, and portfolio restructuring 
         ✓  Strategic   M&A            Experience with international acquisitions, post-merger integration, and portfolio restructuring 
         ✓  Strategic   M&A            Experience with international acquisitions, post-merger integration, and portfolio restructuring 
     ✓  Capital Markets Expertise      Experience with capital markets and complex financing transactions 
     ✓  Deep and Diverse Industry Knowledge      Experience with diversified manufacturing in many of the markets and product areas relevant to Dovers businesses 
     ✓  Risk Management Expertise      Experience evaluating risk management policies and procedures 
     ✓  Audit and Corporate Governance Matters      Experience with assurance and audit, regulation, and financial reporting 
     ✓  Human Capital Management      Experience attracting, developing and retaining talent and building strong cultures 
     ✓  Executive Leadership Experience       Leadership experience as former CEOs and CFOs of global  public companies   
     ✓  Executive Leadership Experience       Leadership experience as former CEOs and CFOs of global  public companies   
[END TABLE]
The Governance and Nominating Committee also considers our current Board composition and the projected retirement date of current directors, as well as such other factors it may deem to be in the best interests of Dover and its shareholders, including a director nominee's leadership and operating experience (particularly as a CEO), financial and investment expertise and strategic planning experience. 
The Board prefers nominees to be independent, but believes it is desirable to have our CEO on the Board as a representative of current management. Given the global reach and broad array of the types of businesses operated by Dover, the Governance and Nominating Committee highly values director nominees with multi-industry and multi-geographic experience. 
Director Nomination Process 
Whenever the Governance and Nominating Committee concludes that a new nominee to our Board is required or advisable, it will consider recommendations from directors, management, shareholders and, if it deems appropriate,

Shareholders who wish to recommend an individual for nomination should send that person's name and supporting information to the Governance and Nominating Committee, care of the Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices, 3005 Highland Parkway, Downers Grove, Illinois, 60515, or through our communications coordinator.

Please see "General Information About the Annual Meeting" for nomination deadlines. 
Proxy Access Shareholder Right 
Following extensive engagement with our shareholders, our Board determined to adopt proxy access in February 2016, permitting a shareholder or group of up to 20 shareholders holding 3% of our outstanding shares of common stock for at least three years to nominate a number of directors constituting the greater of two directors or 20% of the number of directors on our Board, as set forth in detail in our by-laws.

PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
2019 Director Nominees 
There are nine nominees for election to our Board at this Annual Meeting, each to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders or his or her earlier removal, resignation or retirement. All of the nominees currently serve on our Board and are being proposed for re-election by our Board. 
Current directors Peter T. Francis and Richard K. Lochridge are not standing for re-election and will retire from the Board effective as of the Annual Meeting. 
If any nominee for election becomes unavailable or unwilling for good cause to serve as a director before the Annual Meeting, an event which we do not anticipate, the persons named as proxies will vote for a substitute nominee or nominees as may be designated by our Board, or the Board may reduce the number of directors. Directors will be elected by a majority of the votes cast in connection with their election.

Board Leadership Structure 
We believe that having an independent leader of the Board is important to the Board's oversight role and decision-making involving corporate strategy, performance, succession, and other critical matters. Under our current Board 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 22 
PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
 leadership structure, our Board has leadership that is independent from management by way of an independent Chair. Our CEO is also a member of the Board as a management representative. We believe this is important to make information and insight directly available to the directors in their deliberations. In our view, this board leadership structure gives us an appropriate, well-functioning balance between non-management and management directors that combines experience, accountability and effective risk oversight. 
Board, Committee and Individual Director Evaluations 
Our Board and its committees conduct robust annual self-evaluations of their performance. In addition, our Board evaluates one-third of our directors on a rotating individual basis each year with the purpose of assisting each director to be a more effective member of the Board. New directors undergo the evaluation process in each of their first two years on the Board. Our directors believe the rotational nature of our evaluation process enables a more in-depth, comprehensive evaluation for each of our directors. 
Directors' Meetings and Attendance 
During 2018, the Board met 8 times. No director attended less than 75% of the board and standing committee meetings held while he or she was a member of the Board and relevant standing committee. Average board attendance was over 95% in 2018. Our independent directors meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions at least quarterly without management representatives or non-independent directors present. The Chair of the Board presides at these sessions. We expect our directors to attend the Annual Meeting. All directors then on the Board attended the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
Our directors also regularly engage with management and outside subject matter experts outside of formal meetings. Examples include developing agendas and reviewing the content of materials in advance of meetings, calls or in-person meetings with members of management to prepare for meetings, receiving periodic updates from management on significant operational or strategic developments between meetings, and, from time to time, engaging with shareholders. 
Management Meetings and Site Visits 
We encourage our directors to meet with senior managers throughout the enterprise and attend management's strategic planning sessions. When considering businesses to visit, priority goes to those businesses identified as strategically important as well as those that were recently acquired. From time to time, the Board makes on-site visits to our businesses to tour the manufacturing facilities and meet face-to-face with company management and employees. These visits serve as an important tool in the Board's succession planning process for our senior leadership team and enable a deeper understanding of our businesses and our culture. 
Director Orientation and Education 
All new directors participate in our director orientation program. New directors meet in-person with senior corporate and segment leaders to review and discuss our businesses, operations, strategy, end markets, governance and culture. We believe that our on-boarding approach, coupled with participation in regular Board and committee meetings, provides new directors a strong foundation in our businesses and accelerates their effectiveness to fully engage in Board deliberations. 
Our Board also encourages directors to annually participate in continuing director education programs outside of the Boardroom, and we reimburse directors for their expenses associated with this participation. 
Director Independence 
Our Board has determined that each of the current members of the Board, except for Richard J. Tobin, who is our CEO, has no material relationship with Dover and satisfies all the criteria for being "independent" members of our Board. This includes the criteria established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the New 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 23 
PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
 York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") listing standards, as well as our standards for classification as an independent director which are available on our website at www.dovercorporation.com. Our Board makes an annual determination of the independence of each nominee for director prior to his or her nomination for re-election. No director may be deemed independent unless the Board determines that he or she has no material relationship with Dover, directly or as an officer, shareholder or partner of an organization that has a material relationship with Dover. 
Majority Standard for Election of Directors and Mandatory Resignation Policy 
Under our by-laws and corporate governance guidelines, the voting standard in director elections is a majority of the votes cast. Under the majority standard, a director must receive more votes in favor of his or her election than votes against his or her election. Abstentions and broker non-votes do not count as votes cast with respect to a director's election. In contested director elections (where there are more nominees than available seats on the board), the plurality standard will apply. 
For an incumbent director to be nominated for re-election, he or she must submit an irrevocable resignation letter. The resignation will be contingent on the nominee not receiving a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election and on the Board's acceptance of the resignation. If an incumbent director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election, the Governance and Nominating Committee will make a recommendation to our Board concerning the resignation. Our Board will act on the resignation within 90 days following certification of the election results, taking into account the committee's recommendation. The Board will publicly announce its decision and, if the resignation is rejected, the rationale for its decision. 
Governance Guidelines and Code of Ethics 
Our Board long ago adopted written corporate governance guidelines that set forth the responsibilities of our Board and the qualifications and independence of its members and the members of its standing committees. The Board reviews these guidelines at least annually, in light of evolving best practices, shareholder feedback and the evolution of our business. In addition, our Board has a long-standing code of business conduct and ethics setting forth standards applicable to all of our companies and their employees, a code of ethics for our CEO and senior financial officers, and charters for each of its standing committees. All of these documents (referred to collectively as "governance materials") are available on our website at www.dovercorporation.com. 
Procedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions 
We generally do not engage in transactions in which our senior executive officers or directors, any of their immediate family members or any of our 5% shareholders have a material interest. Should a proposed transaction or series of similar transactions involve any such persons and an amount that exceeds $120,000, it would be subject to review and approval by the Governance and Nominating Committee in accordance with a written policy and the procedures adopted by our Board, which are available with the governance materials on our website. 
Under the procedures, management determines whether a proposed transaction requires review under the policy and, if so, presents the transaction to the Governance and Nominating Committee. The Governance and Nominating Committee reviews the relevant facts and circumstances of the transaction and approves or rejects the transaction. If the proposed transaction is immaterial or it is impractical or undesirable to defer the proposed transaction until the next committee meeting, the Chair of the committee decides whether to (i) approve the transaction and report the transaction at the next meeting or (ii) call a special meeting of the committee to review and approve the transaction. Should the proposed transaction involve the CEO or enough members of the Governance and Nominating Committee to prevent a quorum, the disinterested members of the committee will review the transaction and make a recommendation to the Board, and the disinterested members of the Board will then approve or reject the transaction. No director may participate in the review of any transaction in which he or she is a related person.

Communication with Directors 
The Audit Committee has established procedures for (i) the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters ("accounting matters"), and (ii) the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting matters. Such complaints or concerns may be submitted to Dover, care of our Corporate Secretary or through the communications coordinator, an external service provider, by mail, fax, telephone, or via the internet as published on our website. The communications coordinator forwards such communications to Dover without disclosing the identity of the sender if anonymity is requested. 
Shareholders and other interested persons may also communicate with our Board and the non-management directors in any of these same manners. Such communications are forwarded to the Chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee.

Under our LTIP, each non-employee director can elect to defer the receipt of 0%, 50%, or 100% of the equity compensation payable in a year until termination of services as a non-employee director. Shares deferred are converted into deferred stock units representing the right to receive one share of our common stock for each unit held at the end of the deferral period. Dividend equivalents are credited on deferred stock units and will be distributed in cash at the time that shares are distributed in settlement of deferred stock units. Messrs. Francis, Johnston, Spiegel, Tobin, Todd and Wagner and Ms. Graham elected to defer receipt of their 2018 equity compensation and received deferred stock units.

Proposal 2 — Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee has appointed the independent registered public accounting firm of PwC to audit the annual accounts of Dover and its subsidiaries for 2019. PwC has audited the financial statements for the Company since 1995. Representatives of PwC are not expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. 
Although shareholder ratification of PwC's appointment is not required by Dover's by-laws or otherwise, our Board is submitting the ratification of PwC's appointment for the year 2019 to Dover's shareholders. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of PwC, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain PwC as Dover's independent registered public accounting firm for the year 2019 but will not be obligated to terminate the appointment. Even if the shareholders ratify the appointment of PwC, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in Dover's interests. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PWC AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE YEAR 2019. 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 34 
PROPOSAL 2 — RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee is composed of directors who, in the opinion of the Board, are independent and financially literate under NYSE rules and qualify as audit committee financial experts as defined by the SEC. Information concerning the credentials of the Audit Committee members can be found in the section of this proxy statement entitled "Proposal 1 — Election of Directors". 
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board and available on Dover's website. The Audit Committee assists the Board in overseeing the quality and integrity of Dover's financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications, performance and independence of the independent auditors, and the performance of the internal audit function. 
Among other things, the Audit Committee appoints the Company's independent auditors and is directly involved in the selection of the lead audit engagement partner, discusses with the internal audit function and independent auditors the overall scope and plans for their respective audits, reviews the Company's accounting policies and system of internal controls, reviews significant financial transactions, discusses with management and with the Board processes relating to risk management, pre-approves audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditors, and approves all fees paid to the independent auditors for such services. 
For 2018, the Audit Committee engaged the independent registered public accounting firm PwC as Dover's independent auditor. In selecting PwC, the Audit Committee considered, among other things: the experience and qualifications of the lead audit partner and other senior members of the PwC team; PwC's historical performance on Dover's audit and the quality of its communications with the Audit Committee; the results of the most recent internal quality control review or Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") inspection; PwC's independence; its reputation for integrity and competence in the fields of accounting and auditing; the appropriateness of its fees; and its tenure as Dover's independent auditors, including its understanding of the Company's global businesses, accounting policies and practices, and internal control over financial reporting. 
The Audit Committee discussed with PwC the overall scope and plans for the audit of Dover's 2018 financial statements. The Audit Committee met with PwC, with and without management present, to discuss the results of PwC's examination, their assessment of internal controls and the overall quality of financial reporting. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed, with both the management of Dover and PwC, Dover's 2018 audited financial statements, including a discussion of critical accounting policies, the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles followed, the reasonableness of significant judgments reflected in such financial statements and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. The Audit Committee met a total of nine times in 2018 and 2019 to discuss 2018 quarterly and full-year financial results and related disclosures. 
The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the Rule 3526 letter from PwC required by the applicable requirements of PCAOB regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and discussed with PwC its independence, including the impact of any relationships or permitted non-auditing services on PwC's independence. The Audit Committee also discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed under PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301. The Audit Committee has also received written materials addressing PwC's internal control procedures and other matters required by NYSE listing standards. 
Based upon the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended that the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 be included in Dover's Annual Report on Form 10-K.

[END TABLE]
Audit Fees. Audit fees include fees for audit or review services in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards of our consolidated financial statements (including internal control over financial reporting), statutory and subsidiary audits and review of documents filed with the SEC. In 2018 and 2017, audit fees include fees for audit and review services in connection with the spin-off of Apergy from Dover, including associated filings with the SEC. 
Audit-Related Fees. Audit-related fees include fees for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the audit of our financial statements, such as due diligence services pertaining to potential business acquisitions and dispositions and consultations concerning the accounting and disclosure treatment of events and the impact of final or proposed rules and standards. In 2018 and 2017, audit-related fees include fees for services in connection with our adoption of new accounting standards. 
Tax Fees. Tax fees include fees for services that are performed by professional tax staff other than in connection with the audit. These services include tax compliance, consulting and advisory services. 
All Other Fees. Other fees include fees for non-audit services not listed above that do not impair the independence of the auditor and are not prohibited by the SEC or PCAOB. 
Pre-Approval of Services Provided by Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Consistent with its charter and applicable SEC rules, our Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by PwC to us and our subsidiaries. With respect to certain services which PwC has traditionally provided, the Audit Committee has adopted specific pre-approval policies and procedures. In developing these policies and procedures, the Audit Committee considered the need to ensure the independence of PwC while recognizing that, in certain situations, PwC may possess the expertise and be in the best position to advise us and our subsidiaries on issues and matters other than accounting and auditing. 
The policies and procedures adopted by the Audit Committee allow the pre-approval by the Audit Committee of permissible audit-related services, non-audit-related services and tax services. Under the policies and procedures, pre-approval is generally provided for up to one year and any general pre-approval is detailed as to the particular services or category of services and is subject to a specific budget for each of them. The policies and procedures require that any other services be expressly and separately approved by the Audit Committee prior to such services being performed by the independent auditors. In addition, pre-approved services which are expected to exceed the budgeted amount included in a general pre-approval require separate, specific pre-approval. For each proposed service, the independent auditors and management are required to provide detailed information to the Audit Committee at the time of approval. The Audit Committee considers whether each pre-approved service is consistent with the SEC's rules and regulations on auditor independence.

Our compensation programs are designed to support the primary objective of creating sustained, long-term value for our shareholders. To achieve this objective, management is required to execute Dover's strategy, resulting in sustainable revenue and earnings growth. The Compensation Committee believes that a strong pay-for-performance philosophy aligns our executives' goals with long-term value creation for our shareholders. 
Dover Business Overview 
Dover is a diversified global manufacturer delivering innovative equipment and components, specialty systems, consumable supplies, software and digital solutions, and support services through three operating segments: Engineered Systems, Fluids, and Refrigeration & Food Equipment.

Our businesses are aligned in three segments structured around our key end markets and are designed to support focused growth strategies. Our segment structure also allows us to leverage Dover's scale and channel presence while capitalizing on productivity initiatives. 
2018 Company Performance Highlights 
In 2018, we: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Generated consolidated revenue from continuing operations of $7.0 billion, reflecting organic growth of 3.7% for the  year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Delivered diluted EPS from continuing operations of $3.89, compared with EPS of $4.73 for 2017. The decrease was largely  driven by net benefits realized in 2017 from dispositions and the Tax Reform Act.

DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 38 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
While our financial performance was strong in 2018, our EBIT margins were below our expectations. As a result, our NEOs' annual bonuses were lower than those earned for 2017. With respect to long-term compensation, Mr. Spurgeon, President and CEO of Dover Fluids, was the only NEO who received a payout on the performance share award for the 2016-2018 performance period. Based on his business unit's iTSR performance over that period, his payout was below target.     
Components of Compensation Aligned with Company Performance 
In light of the strong support from our shareholders for our compensation program structure and its close alignment with our pay for performance philosophy, our 2018 executive compensation program structure was generally unchanged.

2018 Say-on-Pay Advisory Vote and Shareholder Outreach 
96% Say on Pay support  |  51% Shares Outstanding Contacted  |  32% Shares Engaged 
In 2018, our executive compensation program received 96% approval from our shareholders, which was the same level of support received in 2017, reflecting shareholders' continuing approval of our compensation program. In 2018, we continued our shareholder engagement program. We reached out to holders of over 51% of our outstanding shares and engaged with governance professionals and/or portfolio managers at investors holding approximately 32% of our outstanding shares. In addition to the governance topics detailed earlier in this proxy statement, we had thoughtful discussions with our shareholders regarding our compensation program. Our investors generally told us they believe Dover's pay practices are aligned with our pay-for-performance philosophy. We also sought shareholder feedback on Mr. Tobin's compensation arrangements after his appointment, including his one-time make-whole award. Our shareholders indicated they were supportive of the structure because it ensured a smooth transition and the Board's ability to hire a highly qualified candidate. The Board appreciated the feedback it received, particularly regarding shareholder opinions on Mr. Tobin's compensation arrangements, our metrics and the rigor of our target selection. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider this feedback, as well as the results from future shareholder advisory votes, in its ongoing evaluation of executive compensation programs and practices at Dover.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Executive Compensation Program Peer Grouping 
For assessing executive pay programs and levels, the Compensation Committee selected a group of companies that are similar to Dover in terms of end markets, complexity, revenues and market capitalization. In 2018, with the help of its independent consultant, the Compensation Committee approved changes to the peer group to better match Dover's end markets, complexity, revenue and market capitalization after the spin-off of Apergy. As a result, 3M Company, Weatherford International plc and Pentair plc were removed from the peer group. Corning Incorporated, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. and Snap-on Incorporated were added to the peer group.

DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 44 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Role of Internal Equity in Setting Executive Compensation 
Management and the Compensation Committee consider both market benchmarks (i.e., external equity), as well as the impact each executive role has relative to internal peers (i.e., internal equity) in establishing the executive pay structures used to govern pay. 
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee has the authority and discretion to retain external compensation consultants as it deems appropriate. The Compensation Committee has adopted a policy to ensure the continuing independence and accountability to the committee of any advisor hired to assist the committee in the discharge of its duties. The policy formalizes the independent relationship between the committee's advisor and Dover, while permitting management limited ability to access the advisor's knowledge of Dover for compensation matters. Under the policy, the Compensation Committee will annually review and pre-approve the services that may be provided to management by the independent advisor without further committee approval. Compensation Committee approval is required prior to Dover retaining the independent advisor for any executive compensation services or other consulting services or products above an aggregate annual limit of $50,000. 
Since February 2010, the Compensation Committee has retained Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC ("Semler Brossy") as its advisor. Semler Brossy does no other work for and has no other relationships with Dover. Semler Brossy focuses on executive compensation and does not have departments, groups or affiliates that provide services other than those related to executive compensation and benefits. 
The Compensation Committee looks to its consultant to periodically review and advise regarding the adequacy and appropriateness of our overall executive compensation plans, programs and practices and, from time to time, to answer specific questions raised by the Compensation Committee or management. Compensation decisions are made by, and are the responsibility of, the Compensation Committee and our Board, and may reflect factors and considerations other than the information and recommendations provided by the Compensation Committee's consultant. 
To ensure independence of the compensation consultant, the consultant reports directly to the Chair of the Compensation Committee and works specifically for the Committee solely on compensation and benefits. 
Semler Brossy did not engage in any projects for management in 2018. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Semler Brossy and concluded that its work for the Compensation Committee does not raise any conflict of interest. 
New CEO Compensation and Employment Agreement 
On May 1, 2018, Richard J. Tobin became Dover's President and CEO. Immediately prior to joining Dover, Mr. Tobin was the CEO of CNH. The independent directors, with the support of Semler Brossy, the Compensation Committee's independent consultant, approved Dover's entry into a three-year employment agreement with Mr. Tobin commencing May 1, 2018. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Tobin is entitled to an initial annual base salary of $1.2 million and a target annual bonus equal to 125% of base salary and receipt of an annual equity grant for each of Dover's fiscal years ending during the term of the agreement with a grant date fair value of not less than $7 million. Mr. Tobin's annual bonus for 2018 was guaranteed to be no less than the target annual bonus, pro-rated for the portion of 2018 on and following the commencement of the term.

DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 45 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
In addition, Mr. Tobin received a one-time make-whole equity grant consisting of $6 million in the form of performance shares, having the same performance and vesting terms as our February 2018 iTSR performance share grants to our other employees, and $13 million in the form of RSUs, which vest in five equal installments on December 15th of each calendar year, starting on December 15, 2018 and ending on December 15, 2022. Mr. Tobin also received a one-time make-whole cash payment of $1,000,000, provided that he is obligated to repay this amount if he terminates his employment without good reason or if Dover terminates his employment for cause, as such terms are defined in the employment agreement, prior to May 1, 2019, and he is required to repay a pro-rata portion of this amount if his employment is terminated without good reason or for cause prior to May 1, 2020. 
For a more detailed description of Mr. Tobin's employment agreement, see "CEO Employment Agreement" on page 58. 
Elements of Executive Compensation 
Focus on Variable, Performance-Based Pay 
The pay packages of Dover executives consist predominantly of incentive-based pay, both annual and long-term. The ratio between fixed and variable pay varies by executive level, but for the CEO and his direct reports, including the NEOs, we feel it is appropriate that the vast majority of the pay package should be "at risk" incentive-based pay as shown in the chart below. Additionally, we believe that their incentive pay should be heavily weighted toward long-term performance and tied to share performance, with the annual incentives focused on key short-term drivers and progress on strategy. The CEO chart presented below excludes the one-time sign on cash and equity. 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 46 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Each of the compensation components has a specific role in the overall design of our executive pay program. While the components are designed to be mutually reinforcing, care is taken to minimize overlap between them. The table below shows how each element fits into our overall executive pay program and incentivizes performance over multiple time horizons.

Annual Incentive Plan Compensation 
An annual bonus may be earned each year based on an NEO's performance against both financial objectives tied to the NEO's business unit and individual strategic goals. Each NEO's bonus target amount is determined according to the NEO's business/function complexity, size and overall impact on Dover's results, as well as strategic leadership and managerial responsibility. We believe that balancing the measurement of performance for the annual bonus between financial and strategic objectives is important in mitigating risk and executing on our long-term strategy for value creation. 
For 2018, 60% of the annual bonus of our NEOs other than Mr. Tobin was based on the achievement of financial performance criteria based on revenue and earnings (EBIT for segment executives and earnings from continuing operations for executives at the corporate level) and was subject to a modifier based on the EBIT margin of the NEO's business unit. Financial targets were set at the overall corporate level for corporate NEOs (Tobin, Cerepak, Cabrera and Kloosterboer) and at the segment level for segment NEOs (Spurgeon). Rightsizing and other costs incurred in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 related to our initiative to reduce selling, general and administrative expense were not included in the calculation. 
The other 40% of the annual bonus was based on the achievement of individual strategic objectives designed to create long-term value for our shareholders. The individual strategic objectives were set for our then CEO, Mr. Livingston, by our independent directors at the beginning of the year based on specific strategic initiatives that the Board and management agreed were important to achieve in 2018. These objectives were cascaded to the CEO's direct reports as appropriate based on their responsibilities or business portfolio. The Board monitored progress on the CEO's strategic objectives and, following the end of the year, reviewed the CEO's performance against these objectives when determining his annual bonus. Mr. Tobin's annual bonus for 2018 was based on the terms of his employment agreement and included consideration of his accomplishments in 2018 relating to strategic priorities established in consultation with the Board following his appointment as CEO.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
2018 AIP Financial Results Performance 
The actual bonuses paid to our NEOs for 2018 were lower than those earned for 2017 based on business results, reflecting our pay-for-performance focus. Mr. Livingston, our former CEO, retired on May 1, 2018 and did not receive an AIP bonus for 2018.

2018 AIP Individual Strategic Objective Performance 
Each of the NEOs had unique strategic objectives in keeping with the strategic priorities communicated to our shareholders. Strategic objectives are intended to focus on a limited and measurable set of goals which, if accomplished, will benefit our shareholders over the long term. For NEOs other than Mr. Tobin, these objectives were used to determine 40% of their annual incentive. Similarly, Mr. Tobin's strategic objectives were considered in determining his annual incentive but were not specifically tied to a portion of his 2018 bonus opportunity in keeping with the terms of his employment agreement.

[END TABLE]
Performance Shares & iTSR 
The Compensation Committee believes our iTSR measure focuses executives on key financial and strategic drivers of long-term shareholder value. iTSR, by definition, is a measure of value creation for our business segments and operating companies. The key components of iTSR are EBITDA Growth and Free Cash Flow. Based on rigorous testing over time, the Compensation Committee continues to believe iTSR is: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• highly correlated with long-term shareholder value creation for a multi-industry company such as Dover,   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• highly correlated with the combination of return on invested capital ("ROIC") and organic growth, and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• more effective in driving behaviors than relative TSR because it measures outcomes that are more within management's  control, such as revenue growth (organic and acquisition), and margin improvements.  
[END TABLE]
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 50 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Definition of iTSR. iTSR measures the change in enterprise value over a three-year period. EBITDA is assigned a multiple based on prevailing market multiples among industrial companies. iTSR tracks the change in that EBITDA-based value, along with Free Cash Flow generated during the three-year performance period. The two together work similarly to an external TSR measure: the EBITDA-based value becomes a proxy for share price, and Free Cash Flow becomes a proxy for dividends. Further, EBITDA Growth and Free Cash Flow together focus our business leaders on growing our business, investing in continuing operations, and shaping our portfolio with capital-effective acquisitions and dispositions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• EBITDA Growth — We believe that EBITDA is useful for purposes of evaluating our ongoing operating  profitability as it excludes the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating our operating performance in relation to our competitors.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Free Cash Flow — Free Cash Flow is operating cash flow less capital spending, less cash used for  acquisitions, plus cash received from divestitures. We believe that Free Cash Flow is an important measure of our operating performance as it provides a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory payment  obligations and investment opportunities, such as funding acquisitions, paying dividends, repaying debt and repurchasing our common stock.  
[END TABLE]
Safeguards. Since iTSR is an absolute measure of value creation, we have implemented safeguards to substantially eliminate large payouts resulting solely from economic cycles. Further, payouts under the program are in shares, and our shareholding requirements ensure that executives are exposed to the same stock price changes as our shareholders, including external stock market factors. Dividends are not accrued or paid on performance shares during the performance period. 
Rigorous iTSR Targets, Threshold and Cap Levels. iTSR targets for our Performance Shares are demanding and were rigorously back-tested to confirm that they are set to tie performance share payouts with comparable relative TSR performance levels. Awards are earned three years after the grant, provided iTSR exceeds a threshold level. No payouts will be made unless iTSR equals or exceeds 6%. The payout to any individual may not exceed 500,000 shares. 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 51 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Payouts of performance shares are made on a sliding scale using the following formula: 
Stock Settled Stock Appreciation Rights 
Similar to stock options, SSARs align executive interests with shareholder interests for stock price growth for several years into the future. They focus executives on increasing the stock price over the long term. SSARs give our NEOs the ability to participate in the price appreciation of a set number of shares of Company stock. Once SSARs vest, an NEO may exercise them any time prior to the expiration date. The proceeds from the exercise are paid to the NEO in the form of shares of Dover common stock to encourage continued share ownership and shareholder alignment.

Restricted Stock Units 
RSU grants attract and retain NEOs by providing them some of the benefits associated with stock ownership during the vesting period. Executives do not actually own the shares underlying the units, nor enjoy the benefits of ownership such as dividends and voting, until the vesting conditions are satisfied. Once vested, the NEO receives shares of Dover stock equivalent in number to the vested units and receives a cash amount equal to accrued dividends during the vesting period, net of withholding taxes.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
2019 Changes to our Executive Compensation 
Changes in Salary, Target Bonus, or LTIP grants 
None of our NEOs received a salary, target bonus or LTIP grant increase for 2019. 
Other Benefits 
401(k), Pension Plan and Health & Wellness Plans 
Our executive officers are able to participate in retirement and benefit plans generally available to our employees on the same terms as other employees. Dover and most of our businesses offer a 401(k) plan to substantially all U.S.-based employees and provide a Company matching contribution denominated as a percentage of the amount of salary deferred into the plan by a participant during the course of the year. Some of our U.S.-based employees also participate in a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. Effective December 31, 2013, we closed both our qualified and non-qualified defined benefit retirement plans to new employees. We intend to freeze any future benefit accruals in both plans effective December 31, 2023. All of our U.S.-based employees are offered a health and wellness plan (including health, term life and disability insurance). NEOs do not receive enhanced health and wellness benefits. 
Non-Qualified Retirement Plans 
We offer two non-qualified plans with participation generally limited to individuals whose annual salary and bonus earnings exceed the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") limits applicable to our qualified plans: our PRP and our deferred compensation plan. Participation in the deferred compensation plan is open to employees with an annual salary equal to or greater than $175,000. 
After December 31, 2009, benefits under the PRP before offsets are determined using the benefit calculation and eligibility criteria as under the pension plan, except that IRS limits on compensation and benefits do not apply. Prior to December 31, 2009, the participants in the PRP accrued benefits greater than those offered in the pension plan. Effective January 1, 2010, we modified this plan so that executives subject to IRS compensation limits will accrue future benefits that are substantially the same as benefits under the pension plan. Individuals who participated in the PRP prior to January 1, 2010 will receive benefits calculated under the prior benefit formula through December 31, 2009 and benefits calculated under the lower PRP benefit formula on and after January 1, 2010. Amounts receivable by the executives under the PRP are reduced by any amounts receivable by them under the pension plan, any qualifying profit sharing plan, Company-paid portion of social security benefits, and the amounts of the Company match in the 401(k) plan. 
Effective December 31, 2013, the PRP was closed to new employees. All eligible employees as of December 31, 2013 will continue to earn PRP benefits through December 31, 2023 as long as they remain employed by Dover and its affiliates. Effective December 31, 2023, Dover intends to eliminate any future benefit accruals consistent with the freezing of benefit accruals under the pension plan. 
We offer a deferred compensation plan to allow participants to elect to defer their receipt of some or all of their salary, bonuses and any payout of a cash performance award. The plan permits executive officers to defer receipt of part of their compensation to later periods and facilitates tax planning for the participants. Effective January 1, 2014, the deferred compensation plan was amended to provide for certain matching and additional contributions for participants who do not also participate in the PRP. Our NEOs are participants in the PRP and are not eligible for matching or additional contributions under the deferred compensation plan. Accordingly, we do not consider the deferred compensation plan to play a major role in our compensation program for our NEOs as we do not match any amounts deferred or guarantee any particular return on deferrals. 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 53 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Executive Severance 
All of our NEOs are eligible to participate in our severance plan. Under the plan, if we terminate an NEO's employment without cause (as defined in the severance plan), the NEO will generally be entitled to receive twelve months of salary and healthcare benefits continuation, and a prorated bonus for time worked during the year. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control." 
Senior Executive Change-in-Control Severance Plan 
We have a senior executive CIC severance plan. The CIC severance plan establishes the severance benefits payable to eligible executives if they are involuntarily terminated following a change-in-control. All of our NEOs are eligible to participate in the CIC severance plan. An executive eligible to participate in the CIC severance plan as of the date of a change-in-control will be entitled to receive severance payments under the plan if, within 18 months after the change-in-control, either the executive's employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" or he or she terminates employment for "good reason" (as such terms are defined in the plan). The severance payments and benefits will consist of: a lump sum payment equal to 2.0 times their annual salary and target bonus, and a lump sum payment equal to the cost of Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) health care benefit continuation of the executive and covered family members for twelve months. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control." 
No executive may receive severance benefits under more than one plan or arrangement. Dover does not provide tax gross-ups in the CIC severance plan. 
Other Elements of Compensation 
Clawback Policy 
Currently, our PRP includes clawback provisions for termination for cause and the severance plan and CIC severance plan provide for clawback of benefits for breaches of the plan. Our LTIP provides that awards will be subject to such clawback requirements and policies as may be required by applicable law or Dover policies in effect from time to time. We intend to adopt a broader recovery policy once the SEC issues final rules. 
Anti-hedging and Anti-pledging Policy 
Currently, all employees who receive an award under our LTIP, including all NEOs, are prohibited from hedging or pledging their position in Dover stock. 
Perquisites 
We provide substantially no executive perquisites, nor does the Company own or operate any corporate aircraft. Management and the Compensation Committee believe that providing significant perquisites to executive officers would not be consistent with our overall compensation philosophy. As a result, we do not provide executive officers with social club memberships, company cars or car allowances, financial counseling, or any other perquisites. Executives participate only in programs generally available to Dover employees. 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 54 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Shareholding Guidelines 
We believe that our executives will most effectively pursue the long-term interests of our shareholders if they are shareholders themselves. As a result, share ownership guidelines are in place for all NEOs (subject to exceptions that may be granted by the Compensation Committee for significant personal events or retirement planning). Our policy requires that NEOs hold/retain all equity grants until the share ownership guidelines are met. Based on current share ownership, all NEOs are currently in compliance with the guidelines. 
The Compensation Committee reserves the right to provide a portion of annual bonus in stock for any officer who fails to meet or make satisfactory progress toward satisfying the guidelines. 
Risk Assessment 
In 2018, Dover, with the assistance of Willis Towers Watson, updated the formal risk assessment that was conducted in 2017 for all our incentive compensation programs that have material impact on our financial statements. Willis Towers Watson inventoried incentive compensation programs at the corporate and operating company levels globally and conducted in-depth reviews of financially material plans, identified based on expected spend and income statement accounts tied to the program. The reviews focused on both the plan design features as well as internal risk mitigation controls in place. Based on this 2017 review and the 2018 update, we have concluded that Dover's compensation practices and policies do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The employment agreement provides that in the event Mr. Tobin's employment is terminated by Dover without cause or by Mr. Tobin for good reason, then he will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to one and one half (1.5) times the sum of his base salary and target bonus, a prorated annual bonus for the year of termination, time-vesting of the one-time make-whole equity awards (with performance shares continuing to be subject to performance 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 58 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
 conditions) and a cash payment equal to 18 months' of COBRA premiums, in each case, subject to the execution of a general release and compliance with applicable restrictive covenants. 
The employment agreement contains an 18 month (or, if termination occurs following the third anniversary of the start date, a 12 month) post-termination non-competition and non-solicitation of employees and customers covenants, a confidentiality covenant, a mutual non-disparagement covenant, and an assignment of inventions covenant. 
At the end of the term of the agreement, Mr. Tobin will continue to be employed by Dover as an at-will employee and participate in severance and other benefit plans on the same terms as other executives. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
In 2018, Dover completed the spin-off of Apergy, which reduced its employee headcount significantly from that employed for its 2017 pay ratio calculation. Given this impact, Dover has re-identified the median employee for 2018. As is permitted under SEC rules, to determine our median employee, we chose "base salary" as our consistently applied compensation measure. We estimated annual base salary for hourly workers employed for the entire year using their hourly rate and a reasonable estimate of hours worked for the year. For employees who commenced work during 2018, we annualized their annual base salary. Thirteen countries were excluded (2.7% of the total workforce) under the permissible 5% exclusion when we determined headcount on December 10, 2018, with employee counts as follows: Argentina (28), Austria (3), Costa Rica (17), Czech Republic (42), Dominican Republic (43), Kenya (2), Malaysia (111), Mexico (163), Norway (13), Portugal (12), South Korea (23), Taiwan (24), and Thailand (158). Our headcount was 23,874 employees (11,960 U.S. and 11,914 non-U.S.) and after country exclusions 23,235 employees (11,960 U.S. and 11,275 non-U.S.). A valid statistical sampling methodology was used to estimate the median base salary of our employees. We then produced a sample of employees who were paid within a 5% range of that median and selected an employee from within that group as our median employee. We determined that employee's (Summary Compensation Table) total compensation was $42,889. 
We calculated 2018 annual total compensation for both our median employee and Mr. Tobin using the same methodology that we use to determine our NEOs' annual total compensation for the Summary Compensation Table. Because Mr. Tobin became our CEO during 2018, and was the CEO on the determination date of December 10, 2018, we annualized his 2018 compensation by increasing his salary to the amounts he would have received for a full year of service in 2018, so that his total compensation was $28,354,477, resulting in an estimated ratio of 661:1 for CEO pay to median worker pay. 
Mr. Tobin's compensation in 2018 included a one-time, make-whole equity award and cash payment that will not recur in future years. Without the make-whole award, Mr. Tobin's annualized compensation in 2018 would have been $8,168,700, and would have resulted in an estimated pay ratio of 190:1.

Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018 
All awards listed in the table below have a grant date of May 23, 2018 for Mr. Tobin, and February 9, 2018 for all other executive officers. All equity awards outstanding as of May 9, 2018 were adjusted as a result of the spin-off of Apergy to preserve the value of the awards in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement, dated May 9, 2018, between Dover and Apergy.

(7)  The present value of Ms. Cabrera's PRP benefits assuming age 62 retirement age is $1,073,908.   
[END TABLE]
The amounts shown in the Pension Benefits table above are actuarial present values of the benefits accumulated through December 31, 2018. An actuarial present value is calculated by estimating expected future payments starting at an assumed retirement age, weighting the estimated payments by the estimated probability of surviving to each post-retirement age, and discounting the weighted payments at an assumed discount rate to reflect the time value of money. The actuarial present value represents an estimate of the amount which, if invested today at the assumed discount rate, would be sufficient on an average basis to provide estimated future payments totaling the current accumulated benefit. For purposes of the table, the assumed retirement age for each NEO is 65, the normal retirement age under each plan. Actual benefit present values will vary from these estimates depending on many factors, including an executive's actual retirement age. 
Pension Plan 
We have a pension plan for which Dover employees, and the salaried employees of our participating subsidiaries, were eligible to become participants after they completed one year of service. Benefits under the pension plan for Dover employees, including those for the applicable NEOs, are determined by multiplying a participant's years of 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 65 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
 credited service (up to a maximum of 35 years) by a percentage of their final average compensation, subject to statutory limits applicable to tax-qualified pension plans. Benefits for a number of the participating subsidiaries are determined under different benefit formulae. 
Pension plan participants generally vest in their benefits after five years of employment or, if earlier, upon reaching age 65, which is the normal retirement age under the plan. All NEOs who participate in the pension plan are vested in their pension plan benefits and are eligible to begin receiving reduced benefits if their employment terminates before normal retirement age. 
Effective December 31, 2013, the pension plan is closed to new employees. All pension eligible employees as of December 31, 2013 will continue to earn pension benefits through December 31, 2023 as long as they remain employed by an operating company participating in the plan. It is Dover's present intention to eliminate any future benefit accruals after December 31, 2023. 
Pension Replacement Plan 
We also maintain the PRP, which is a non-qualified plan for tax purposes, to provide benefits to certain employees whose compensation and pension plan benefits are greater than the compensation and benefit limits applicable to tax-qualified pension plans. Prior to January 1, 2010, our plan which provided non-qualified retirement benefits was the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"). Effective January 1, 2010, the SERP was amended to provide reduced benefits that are more consistent with the benefits provided under the pension plan and its name was changed to the PRP. 
Employees are eligible to participate in the PRP if they hold certain positions within Dover, or its subsidiaries, are U.S. taxpayers and earn more than a set percentage above the Internal Revenue Code's compensation limits for tax-qualified pension plans. Dover's CEO may designate other employees as eligible and may revoke the eligibility of participants. 
The formula for determining benefits accrued under the PRP after December 31, 2009, before offsets, is determined using the same benefit formula as under the pension plan, except that the Internal Revenue Code's limits on compensation and benefits applicable to tax-qualified pension plans will not apply. Benefits under the former SERP, before offsets, were determined by multiplying the participant's years of actual service with Dover companies, plus, in limited cases, prior service credit by a percentage of the participant's final average compensation as defined under the plan. 
Benefits payable under the PRP or SERP are reduced by the amount of Company-provided benefits under any other retirement plans, including the pension plan, as well as the Company-paid portion of social security benefits. PRP participants must complete five years of service to vest in their benefits. All NEOs who participate in the PRP are fully vested in their benefits and will commence receiving benefits upon termination of employment. PRP benefits may be forfeited for "cause" (defined as conviction of a felony which places a Dover company at legal or other risk or is expected to cause substantial harm to the business of a Dover company or its relationships with employees, distributors, customers or suppliers). 
Normal retirement age for purposes of the PRP is age 65. Certain employees who were participants on or before March 1, 2010 will be entitled to receive the portion of their benefits that accrued through December 31, 2009 without any reduction due to early retirement if they retire after they reach age 62 and complete 10 years of service. Generally, benefits accrued after December 31, 2009 will be subject to early retirement reduction factors consistent with the reduction factors in the pension plan. 
Effective December 31, 2013, the PRP is closed to new employees. All eligible employees as of December 31, 2013 will continue to earn to their PRP benefits through December 31, 2023 as long as they remain employed by Dover and its affiliates. It is Dover's intention to eliminate any future benefit accruals after December 31, 2023, consistent with the freezing of benefit accruals under the pension plan.

(2)  In 1984-1985, we offered our executive officers an executive deferred income plan ("EDIP").  Mr. Livingston participated in the EDIP, pursuant to which he elected to defer certain income during the period 1985-1988. Because Mr. Livingston reached age 65 and retired in 2018, he was entitled to begin receiving repayment of the  deferred amount, together with interest, beginning in 2018 and continuing thereafter for a period of fifteen years. Accordingly, Mr. Livingston received his first payment of $2,972 following his retirement in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Our deferred compensation plan is a nonqualified plan that permits select key management and highly compensated employees on a U.S. payroll with an annual salary equal to or greater than $175,000 to irrevocably elect to defer a portion of their salary and bonus. The deferred compensation plan provides participants who are not eligible to participate in the Pension Replacement Plan with the same level of matching and other employer contributions that they would have received if certain compensation limits under our Retirement Savings plan did not apply. Our NEOs participate in the Pension Replacement Plan and are therefore not eligible to receive matching and other employer contributions under the deferred compensation plan. As amended, the plan operates similar to an "excess" deferred compensation plan in that it provides for employer contributions on salary and bonuses in excess of the compensation limit permitted under the tax-qualified retirement savings plan. 
Under the amended deferred compensation plan, an eligible participant's account will be credited with matching employer contributions on salary and bonus deferred under the plan each year on or after January 1, 2014, at the same rate as under our retirement savings plan plus additional employer contributions at the same rate that the participant's business unit makes "automatic" contributions under our retirement savings plan each year. 
Amounts deferred under the plan are credited with hypothetical investment earnings based on the participant's investment elections made from among investment options designated under the plan. Participants are 100% vested in all amounts they defer, as adjusted for any earnings and losses on such deferred amounts. Effective as of January 1, 2010, a hypothetical investment option that tracks the value of Dover common stock, including any dividend payments, was added to the plan. This Dover stock unit fund does not actually hold any Dover stock, and 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 67 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
 participants who elect to participate in this option do not own any Dover common stock, or have any voting or other rights associated with the ownership of our common stock. Participants' accounts are credited with the net returns of shares of our common stock equal to the number of stock units held by the participant. All distributions from the stock unit fund will be paid in cash. Balances allocated into the stock unit fund must remain in the stock unit fund for the remainder of the participant's participation in the plan. 
Generally, deferred amounts will be distributed from the plan only on account of retirement at age 65 (or age 55 with 10 years of service), disability or other termination of service, or at a scheduled in-service withdrawal date chosen by the participant. 
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control 
The discussion and tables below describe the payments to which each of the NEOs would be entitled in the event of termination of such executive's employment or a change-in-control. 
In November 2010, Dover adopted an executive severance plan (the "severance plan") and senior executive CIC severance plan. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Other Compensation Programs and Policies" for a description of the plans. The severance plan creates a consistent and transparent severance policy for determining benefits for all similarly-situated executives and formalizes Dover's current executive severance practices. All of our executives, including our NEOs, are eligible to participate in the severance plan. The CIC severance plan likewise establishes a consistent policy regarding double-trigger change-in-control severance payments based on current market practices. The CIC severance plan applies to all executives who are subject to Dover's senior executive shareholding guidelines on the date of a change-in-control (as defined in the plan), including all NEOs. Each of the severance plan and the CIC severance plan gives Dover the right to recover amounts paid to an executive under the plan as required under any clawback policy of Dover as in effect from time to time or under applicable law. 
The 2005 Plan, the LTIP and Dover's other benefit plans each have their own provisions relating to rights and obligations under the plan upon termination. 
The table below shows the aggregate amount of potential payments and other benefits that each NEO would have been entitled to receive if his employment had terminated in certain circumstances, other than as a result of a change-in-control, on December 31, 2018. The amounts shown assume that termination was effective as of December 31, 2018, include amounts earned through such time and are estimates of the amounts which could have been paid out to the executives upon their termination at that time. The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of each executive's separation from our Company. Annual bonuses are discretionary and are therefore omitted from the tables. No NEO was eligible for normal retirement as of December 31, 2018 so we have omitted that column from the table. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Spurgeon is eligible for early retirement under the Rule of 70 (as defined below) under the 2005 Plan and LTIP in respect to all awards granted prior to August 6, 2014, and the Rule of 65 under the LTIP for awards granted on or after August 6, 2014. Mr. Livingston retired as of April 30, 2018, prior to year-end and, accordingly, he is not included in the tables below. Mr. Tobin is obligated to repay the $1,000,000 cash payment he received as part of his one-time make-whole grant if he terminates his employment without good reason or if Dover terminates his employment for cause, as such terms are defined in the employment agreement, prior to May 1, 2019, and he is required to repay a pro-rata portion of this amount if his employment is terminated without good reason or for cause prior to May 1, 2020. For a discussion of the special termination provisions applicable to Mr. Tobin pursuant to his employment agreement, see "CEO Employment Agreement" on page 58. 
Normal retirement is defined as (i) age 65 under the pension plan and PRP (however, as noted in the PRP plan description, Mr. Spurgeon and Ms. Cabrera can receive an unreduced portion of their PRP benefit as of age 62), (ii) age 65 (or 55 with 10 years of service) under the deferred compensation plan, and (iii) age 62 under the LTIP for awards prior to August 6, 2014 and 65 for all grants thereafter. Early retirement is defined in each of the deferred compensation plan, the PRP and the pension plan as described in the applicable plan description above. 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 68 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
With respect to awards under the LTIP, early retirement is defined as termination for any reason other than normal retirement, death, disability or cause, under one of the following circumstances: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The executive has at least 10 years of service with a Dover company, the sum of his or her age and years of service on the  date of termination equals at least 65, and for awards granted on or after August 6, 2014, is at least 55 years old (the "Rule of 65"), and the executive complies with certain notice requirements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The executive has at least 15 years of service with a Dover company, the sum of his or her age and years of service on the  date of termination equals at least 70, and for awards granted on or after August 6, 2014, is at least 60 years old (the "Rule of 70"), and the executive complies with certain notice requirements; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The executive's employment terminates because the company or line of business in which he or she is employed is sold  and the executive remains employed in good standing through the closing date of the sale ("sale of a company").  
[END TABLE]
Any person who takes early or normal retirement under the LTIP is deemed to have expressly agreed that he or she will not compete with us on the following terms: the participant will not compete with us or any of our companies at which he or she was employed within the three years immediately prior to his or her termination, in the geographic areas in which we or that company actively carried on business at the end of the participant's employment, for the period during which such retirement affords him or her enhanced benefits. 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 69 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
If the participant fails to comply with the non-compete provision, he or she forfeits the enhanced benefits referred to above and must return to Dover the economic value previously realized by reason of such benefits.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Mr. Spurgeon is eligible for retirement under the 2005 Plan and early retirement under the LTIP. Accordingly, we  have assumed that he would take early retirement rather than voluntary termination.  
(2)  Dover anticipates allowing anyone eligible for early retirement under the Rule of 65 or the Rule of 70 to take early  retirement in the event of involuntary termination for awards under the LTIP. Accordingly, for Mr. Spurgeon, this column reflects the applicable early retirement treatment of his performance shares, RSUs, and SSARs.  
(3)  A NEO whose employment is terminated by us for cause will forfeit all outstanding cash and equity awards, whether or  not vested or exercisable. The executive will receive a payment of amounts deferred and accrued in the deferred compensation plan and will receive pension plan payments, but will forfeit benefits under the PRP in accordance with the PRP terms.   
(4)  Represents 12 month salary continuation plus an amount equal to the pro rata portion of the annual bonus paid for the  prior year, subject to the Compensation Committee's discretion to reduce the payment amount, or in the case of Mr. Tobin the amount is equal to 1.5 times his annual salary plus the target bonus.  
(5)  Represents payout of the performance share award for the performance period 2016-2018 at the actual performance level  through December 31, 2018. Per his employment agreement, Mr. Tobin's sign on performance shares for 2018-2020 will fully vest subject to performance. Since Mr. Spurgeon is eligible for early retirement under the Rule of 65, the  performance share awards for the three-year performance period 2017-2019 are also included at target. This calculation assumes that the Compensation Committee approves payout for the performance periods for the NEOs.  
(6)  Reflects the value of vested SSARs as of December 31, 2018, which is the difference between the closing price of  $70.95 per share of our common stock on December 31, 2018, and the exercise price of each option and SSAR award multiplied by the number of shares covered by such award. Also includes, for the NEOs eligible for

(7)  Mr. Spurgeon is eligible for early retirement under the Rule of 65, the amount reflects the value of unvested RSUs  as of December 31, 2018 that will vest within the following 24 months. Mr. Tobin is eligible per his employment agreement to fully vest all sign on RSUs, and the amount shown represents the four remaining tranches that vest after 2018.   
(8)  Reflects benefits accrued under the PRP and pension plan as of December 31, 2018.  
(9)  These amounts reflect compensation deferred by the executive and earnings accrued thereon under the deferred  compensation plan as of December 31, 2018; no increase in such benefits would result from the termination event.  
(10)  Under the severance plan, an executive is entitled to a monthly amount equal to the then cost of COBRA health  continuation coverage based on the level of health care coverage in effect on the termination date, if any, for the lesser of 12 months or the period that the executive receives COBRA benefits. Mr. Tobin would receive 18 months per his  employment agreement.  
[END TABLE]
Potential Payments in Connection with a Change-in-Control (Without Termination) 
As discussed below, the payment of severance benefits following a change-in-control is subject to a double-trigger —that is, such benefits are payable only upon certain specified termination events following a change-in-control. However, rights of an executive under the 2005 Plan, the LTIP, the deferred compensation plan, the pension plan, the PRP and other incentive and benefit plans are governed by the terms of those plans and typically are effected by the change-in-control event itself, even if the executive continues to be employed by us or a successor company following the change-in-control. 
All equity awards outstanding as of December 31, 2018 were granted under the 2005 Plan or the LTIP. Under the 2005 Plan, upon a change-in-control, all outstanding options and SSARs will immediately become exercisable in accordance with the terms of the appropriate stock option or SSAR agreement. All outstanding performance share awards immediately vest and become immediately due and payable. The performance periods of all outstanding performance share awards terminate on the last day of the month prior to the month in which the change-in-control occurs. The participant is entitled to a payment, the amount of which is determined in accordance with the plan and the relevant performance share award agreement, which is then prorated based on the portion of the performance period that the participant completed prior to the change-in-control. 
Under the LTIP, upon a change in control of Dover (as defined in the LTIP) and if, within 18 months following the date of the change in control, the participant is either involuntarily terminated other than for cause, death or disability, such that the participant is no longer employed by a Dover company or an event or condition that constitutes "good reason" under the LTIP occurs, and the participant subsequently resigns for good reason within applicable time limits and other applicable requirements under the LTIP: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All options and SSARs immediately vest upon the date of termination and become exercisable in accordance with the terms of  the applicable award agreement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All performance share awards will be deemed to have been earned "at target" as if the performance target had been  achieved and such awards will immediately vest and become immediately due and payable on the date of termination; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All outstanding restrictions, including any performance targets, on restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards will  immediately vest or expire on the date of termination, and be deemed to have been satisfied or earned "at target" as if the performance targets, if any, have been achieved, and the award will become immediately due and payable on the date  of termination.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
In the event of a change in control in which a participant's outstanding awards are impaired in value or rights as determined solely in the discretion of Dover's "continuing directors" (as defined in the plan), are not assumed by a successor corporation or an affiliate thereof, or are not replaced with an award or grant that, solely in the discretion of the Dover's continuing directors, will preserve the existing value of the outstanding awards at the time of the change in control:

• All outstanding performance share awards will immediately vest and become due and payable on the date of the change in  control as follows: the performance period of each such award will terminate on the last day of the month prior to the month in which the change in control occurs and the participant will be entitled to a cash or stock payment, the amount of which  will be determined in accordance with the LTIP and the applicable award agreement prorated based on the number of months in the performance period which have passed prior to the change in control as compared to the total number of months in the  original performance period; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All outstanding restrictions, including any performance targets with respect to any options, SSARs, restricted stock or  restricted stock unit awards will immediately vest or expire on the date of the change in control and be deemed to have been satisfied or earned at "target" as if the performance targets, if any, have been achieved and such awards will  become immediately due and payable on the date of the change in control.  
[END TABLE]
Each person granted an award under the 2005 Plan or LTIP is deemed to agree that, upon a tender or exchange offer, proxy solicitation or other action seeking to effect a change-in-control of Dover, he or she will not voluntarily terminate employment with us or any of our companies and, unless terminated by us, will continue to render services to us until the person seeking to effect a change-in-control of our Company has abandoned, terminated or succeeded in such person's efforts to effect the change-in-control. 
Under the PRP, upon a change-in-control, each participant will become entitled to receive the actuarial value of the participant's benefit accrued through the date of the change-in-control. Under the deferred compensation plan, amounts deferred under the plan will continue to accrue any earnings and will be payable in accordance with the elections made by the executive officer.

Potential Payments upon Termination Following a Change-in-Control 
Under the CIC severance plan, an NEO covered by the plan will be entitled to receive severance payments if, within 18 months after the change-in-control, either his or her employment is terminated by Dover without "cause" or the executive terminates employment for "good reason," as such terms are defined in the plan. The severance payments will consist of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A lump sum payment equal to 2.0 multiplied by the sum of (i) the executive's annual salary on the termination date  or the change-in-control date, whichever is higher, and (ii) his or her target annual incentive bonus for the year in which the termination or the date of the change-in-control occurs, whichever is higher; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A lump sum payment equal to the then cost of COBRA health continuation coverage, based on the level of health care coverage  in effect on the termination date, if any, for one year.  
[END TABLE]
No executive may receive severance benefits under more than one plan or arrangement. If Dover determines that (i) any payment or distribution to an executive in connection with change-in-control, whether under the CIC severance plan or otherwise, would be subject to excise tax as an excess parachute payment under the Internal Revenue Code and (ii) the executive would receive a greater net-after-tax amount by reducing the amount of the severance payment, Dover will reduce the severance payments made under the CIC severance plan to the maximum amount that might be paid (but not less than zero) without the executive becoming subject to the excise tax. The CIC severance plan does not provide any gross-up for excise taxes. 
The following table shows the potential payments and other benefits that each of the NEOs would have been entitled to receive upon involuntary or good reason termination following a change-in-control on December 31, 2018.

Proposal 3 — Advisory Resolution to Approve 
Named Executive Officer Compensation 
Each year, we offer our shareholders an opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory and nonbinding basis, the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act. 
We are asking our shareholders to indicate their support for our NEO compensation as described in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our shareholders the opportunity to express their views on our NEOs' compensation. We believe that Dover's compensation programs are well designed and reinforce our strategic focus on continued revenue and profit growth. Over the past few years, Dover has enacted many changes to its programs that are outlined in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement. We believe these changes have further strengthened the linkage between our compensation programs and the creation of shareholder value. At the 2018 Annual Meeting, 96% of the voting shareholders approved the compensation of the NEOs. 
This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, we ask our shareholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that Dover's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in Dover's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosures." 
The say-on-pay vote is advisory and therefore not binding on Dover, our Compensation Committee or our Board. Our Board and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our shareholders and, to the extent there is any significant vote against the NEO compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our shareholders' concerns and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NEOs, AS 
DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 75 
Management Proposals 
Background of Proposals 4 and 5 
Subject Matter of Vote 
Our Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee believe that adherence to sound corporate governance policies and practices informed by evolving best practices and shareholder feedback is important, and they are committed to ensuring that Dover is governed and managed with the highest standards of responsibility and in the best interests of shareholders. 
To that end, our Board and Governance and Nominating Committee have carefully considered the advantages and disadvantages of Dover's current super-majority voting provisions and, after careful consideration and upon the recommendation by the Governance and Nominating Committee, our Board has adopted, declared advisable and recommends that shareholders approve the amendment and restatement of our charter to eliminate the super-majority voting provisions contained therein, which are limited to the following matters: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Amendments to the charter relating to certain share repurchases from "interested stockholders" (defined in our  charter as a beneficial holder of 5% or more of our shares, unless held for more than four years) or the ability for shareholders to use cumulative voting in the election of directors once there is a "substantial stockholder" (defined in  our charter as a beneficial holder of 40% or more of our shares) (Proposal 4); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Amendments to the charter provision that prohibits action by written consent of shareholders (Proposal 5).   
[END TABLE]
Under Dover's existing governing documents, a majority vote requirement applies to all other matters submitted to a vote (other than the use of plurality voting in the event of a contested election). There are no super-majority provisions in our by-laws and the only super-majority provisions in our charter are described above and subject to Proposals 4 and 5. 
Board Analysis 
These super-majority voting provisions have been part of our charter for many years and were originally designed to ensure that the interests of all shareholders were adequately represented in the event any of the actions contemplated by these provisions were to occur. On the other hand, the Board is aware that some shareholders oppose super-majority provisions, arguing that super-majority voting provisions may limit the ability of holders of a majority of our common stock to effect changes they desire. 
The Board also took into account that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have taken proactive steps to remove super-majority provisions from our governance materials.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  At our 2013 Annual Meeting, a non-binding shareholder proposal requesting  us to take all steps necessary, in compliance with applicable law, to remove super-majority voting requirements from our governance materials received the support of the holders of approximately 62% of our outstanding common stock.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  At our 2014 Annual Meeting, a management proposal to amend our charter to eliminate the super-majority provision  applicable to business combinations with a related person was successful. A management proposal to amend our bylaws to permit shareholders owning at least 25% of our outstanding shares to call special meeting also was  successful.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Also at our 2014 Annual Meeting, two other management proposals to eliminate the remaining super-majority  provisions (in Article 15 and Article 16 of our charter) were supported by holders of just over 76% of our outstanding common stock. The level of support was below the required affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of our common stock  and the proposals did not pass.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  At our 2017 and 2018 Annual Meetings, informed by active shareholder engagement, we presented the  same management proposals to eliminate the only remaining super-majority provisions in our  
[END TABLE]
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 76 
MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Following our 2018 Annual Meeting, we sought further shareholder input as our Board considered next steps with  respect to the removal of the remaining super-majority provisions in our charter.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Shareholders expressed appreciation for our continued efforts to remove the provisions and acknowledged our continued  responsiveness to shareholder feedback while facing the high hurdle presented by the current 80% voting requirement in our charter to approve amendments to remove the super-majority provisions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Given our proactive and continued efforts to remove the remaining super-majority provisions over the past several years,  many investors would have been supportive if our Board did not present a management proposal to eliminate supermajority provisions in 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  However, several shareholders continued to express a preference for simple majority voting requirements and encouraged us  to put forth another management proposal to remove the remaining super-majority voting provisions in our charter.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Board is committed to evolving our governance practices to ensure we continue to operate with a best-in-class governance structure. Recent changes that show this commitment include:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Our 2016 adoption of proxy access, which permits a shareholder or a group of up to 20 shareholders holding 3% or  more of our stock continuously for three years to nominate up to 20% of our Board or two directors, whichever is greater.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Our enhanced shareholder engagement program, through which we reached out to holders of over 51% of our outstanding  shares in 2018 and engaged with governance professionals and portfolio managers holding 32% of our outstanding shares.

  ✓  Our 2014 adoption of a bylaw permitting shareholders owning at least 25% of our outstanding shares to call special  meetings.  
[END TABLE]
Therefore, after careful consideration of the foregoing matters, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee, has determined that it is appropriate to propose the amendment and restatement of the charter to eliminate the super-majority voting provisions and that doing so is in the best interests of Dover and its shareholders. 
You are being provided with an opportunity to vote separately on the removal of each of the super-majority voting provisions currently contained in our charter as described below under Proposals 4 and 5. In accordance with Delaware law, the Board has adopted resolutions approving and declaring advisable the amendment and restatement of our charter and is recommending the removal of both of the super-majority voting provisions to shareholders for approval. Under our charter and Delaware law, approval of each of Proposal 4 and 5 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of our outstanding common stock. 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 77 
Proposal 4 — Approval of Amendments to Article 15 of Our Charter to Eliminate Super- Majority Voting Requirement 
Subject Matter of Vote 
Article FIFTEENTH of our charter ("Article 15") requires that, subject to certain exceptions, any purchases by Dover or its subsidiaries of "voting shares" (defined in our charter as the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors) held by an "interested stockholder" (defined in our charter, among other things, as a beneficial owner of 5% or more of our voting shares that has been such a beneficial owner for less than four years) at a per share price in excess of the applicable market price must be approved by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding voting shares not beneficially owned by the "interested stockholder." In addition, Article 15 provides shareholders with cumulative voting rights in the election of directors if at the time of such election there exists a "substantial stockholder" (defined in our charter as a beneficial owner of 40% or more of our voting shares). As of December 31, 2017, we are not aware of any beneficial owner that holds more than 12% of our outstanding voting shares. 
Subsection (E) of Article 15 currently provides that amendments, alterations, changes or repeals ("Changes") to or of Article 15 must be approved, subject to certain exceptions, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of our outstanding voting shares (the "Article 15 Amendment Provision"). 
On the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee, and based on the careful review of the advantages and disadvantages of the Article 15 Amendment Provision as described in the "Background of Proposals 4 and 5" above, the Board has approved, and recommends that shareholders approve, this Proposal 4 to eliminate the Article 15 Amendment Provision in its entirety. 
If this Proposal 4 is approved by shareholders, future Changes to Article 15 may be effected in accordance with Delaware law and will not be subject to a super-majority voting requirement. If this Proposal 4 is adopted, under Delaware law, future Changes to Article 15 would need to be approved by the Board and by the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the capital stock of Dover outstanding and entitled to vote on the amendment. 
The approval of this Proposal 4 is not conditioned on the approval of any other Proposal. 
This summary of the proposed amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the proposed elimination of the Article 15 Amendment Provision attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement, with deletions indicated by strike outs and additions indicated by underlining. 
Required Vote 
In accordance with Delaware law, our Board has approved and declared advisable the amendment and restatement of our charter, including the elimination of the Article 15 Amendment Provision, and is recommending it to shareholders for approval. Under our charter and Delaware law, approval of Proposal 4 will require the affirmative vote of holders at least 80% of our outstanding shares of common stock. If Proposal 4 is approved, our shareholders will be deemed to have approved an amended and restated certificate of incorporation of Dover incorporating the elimination of the Article 15 Amendment Provision set forth in Appendix A. 
Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of votes against the proposal. If this Proposal 4 is approved by shareholders, the Board has authorized the officers of Dover to file with the Delaware Secretary of State an amended and restated certificate of incorporation incorporating the elimination of the Article 15 Amendment Provision as set forth in Appendix A. The amendment and restatement of our charter will become effective on the date the amended and restated certificate of incorporation is filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later effective date set forth therein). If Proposal 4 is not approved by the requisite vote, the proposed elimination of the Article 15 Amendment Provision of our charter will not be implemented and Dover's current voting requirements contained therein will remain in place. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE AMENDMENT TO ARTICLE 15 OF OUR CHARTER TO ELIMINATE SUPER-MAJORITY VOTING PROVISIONS CONTAINED THEREIN. 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 78 
Proposal 5 — Approval of Amendments to Article 16 of Our Charter to Eliminate Super- Majority Voting Requirement 
Subject Matter of Vote 
The first paragraph of Article SIXTEENTH of our charter ("Article 16") contains a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent. The second paragraph of Article 16 currently provides that Changes to Article 16 must be approved, subject to certain exceptions, by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of our outstanding voting shares (the "Article 16 Amendment Provision"). 
On the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee, and based on the careful review of the advantages and disadvantages of the Article 16 Amendment Provision as described in the "Background of Proposals 4 and 5" above, the Board has approved, and recommends that shareholders approve, this Proposal 5 to eliminate the Article 16 Amendment Provision in its entirety. 
If this Proposal 5 is approved by shareholders, future Changes to Article 16 may be effected in accordance with Delaware law and will not be subject to a super-majority voting requirement. If this Proposal 5 is adopted, under Delaware law, future Changes to Article 16 would need to be approved by the Board and by the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the capital stock of Dover outstanding and entitled to vote on the amendment. 
The approval of this Proposal 5 is not conditioned on the approval of any other Proposal. 
This summary of the proposed amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the proposed elimination of the Article 16 Amendment Provision attached as Appendix B to this Proxy Statement, with deletions indicated by strike outs and additions indicated by underlining. 
Required Vote 
In accordance with Delaware law, our Board has approved and declared advisable the amendment and restatement of our charter, including the elimination of the Article 16 Amendment Provision, and is recommending it to shareholders for approval. Under our charter and Delaware law, approval of Proposal 5 will require the affirmative vote of holders of at least 80% of our outstanding shares of common stock. If Proposal 5 is approved, our shareholders will be deemed to have approved an amended and restated certificate of incorporation of Dover incorporating the elimination of the Article 16 Amendment Provision set forth in Appendix B. 
Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of votes against the proposal. If this Proposal 5 is approved by shareholders, the Board has authorized the officers of Dover to file with the Delaware Secretary of State an amended and restated certificate of incorporation incorporating the elimination of the Article 16 Amendment Provision as set forth in Appendix B. The amendment and restatement of our charter will become effective on the date the amended and restated certificate of incorporation is filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later effective date set forth therein). If Proposal 5 is not approved by the requisite vote, the elimination of the Article 16 Amendment Provision of our charter will not be implemented and Dover's current voting requirements contained therein will remain in place.

Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Our Board has adopted a policy that directors are expected to hold at any time a number of shares at least equal to the aggregate number of shares they received as the stock portion of their annual retainer during the past five years, net of an assumed 30% tax rate. 
Executive officers are expected to hold a number of shares with a value at least equal to a multiple of their annual salary. For a discussion of the executive officer share ownership guidelines, see "Executive Compensation —Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Other Compensation Programs and Policies." 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") requires that our directors and certain of our officers file reports of ownership and changes of ownership of our common stock with the SEC and the NYSE. Based solely on copies of such reports provided to us, we believe that all directors and officers filed on a timely basis all such reports required of them with respect to stock ownership and changes in ownership during 2018. 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 82 
General Information About the Annual Meeting 
We are providing this Proxy Statement to our shareholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board for use at the Annual Meeting. We are mailing this Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement beginning on or about March 21, 2019. 
Record Date 
The record date for determining shareholders eligible to vote at the Annual Meeting is March 8, 2019. As of the close of business on that date, we had outstanding 145,213,280 shares of common stock. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter. 
Electronic Delivery of Proxy Materials 
As permitted under SEC rules, we are making this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (which is our Annual Report) available to shareholders electronically via the internet. We believe electronic delivery expedites receipt of our proxy materials by shareholders, while lowering the costs and reducing the environmental impact of the Annual Meeting. If you receive a notice of internet availability of proxy materials by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials by mail unless you specifically request them. Instead, the notice of internet availability will provide instructions as to how you may review the proxy materials and submit your voting instructions over the internet. If you receive the notice by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials, you should follow the instructions in the notice of internet availability for requesting a printed copy. In addition, the proxy card contains instructions for electing to receive proxy materials over the internet or by mail in future years. 
Shareholders of Record; Beneficial Owners 
Most holders of our common stock hold their shares beneficially through a broker, bank or other nominee rather than of record directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some differences in the way to vote shares held of record and those owned beneficially. 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered the shareholder of record of those shares, and the notice of internet availability or proxy materials are being sent directly to you. As a shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to the persons named as proxy holders or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. If you received or requested printed copies of the proxy materials, Dover has enclosed a proxy card for you to use. You may also submit your proxy on the internet or by telephone as described in the proxy card. 
If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of the shares held in "street name," and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker or nominee who is considered the shareholder of record of those shares. As the beneficial owner, you generally have the right to direct your broker on how to vote and are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote those shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you have a proxy, executed in your favor, from the holder of record of your shares. Your broker or nominee has enclosed a voting instruction card for you to use in directing your broker or nominee as to how to vote your shares. We strongly encourage you to instruct your broker or nominee how you wish to vote. 
Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes; Quorum 
For Proposal 1, a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting is required to elect directors. This means that the number of votes cast "FOR" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST" that director in order for that director to be elected. Our organizational documents do not provide for cumulative voting. 
Proposal 2 will require the affirmative vote of at least a majority of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Proposal 3 is a nonbinding, advisory resolution so its ultimate adoption is at the discretion of the Board. The affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be deemed to be approval by the shareholders of Proposal 3. 
Proposals 4 and 5 will require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our outstanding shares of common stock. 
If you are a shareholder of record and you sign and return your proxy card or vote electronically without 
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 83 
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
 making any specific selection, then your shares will be voted FOR all director nominees listed in Proposal 1 and FOR Proposals 2, 3, 4 and 5. 
If you specify that you wish to "ABSTAIN" from voting on an item, then your shares will not be voted on that particular item. Abstentions will not affect the outcome of the vote on Proposal 1. However, they will have the same effect as a vote against Proposals 2, 3, 4 and 5. 
If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares through a broker or other nominee and do not provide your broker or nominee with voting instructions, the broker or nominee will have discretionary authority to vote your shares on routine matters only and will not vote your shares on non-routine matters. This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote." Only Proposal 2 will be considered a routine matter for the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of the vote on Proposal 1 but will have the same effect as a vote against Proposals 3, 4 and 5 as they will be counted as being present. 
For purposes of the Annual Meeting, there will be a quorum if the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock are present in person or by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining if a quorum is present. 
Additional Matters 
We have been notified that a beneficial owner may seek to present a shareholder proposal to adjourn the Annual Meeting to solicit the votes necessary to pass Proposals 4 and 5 if these proposals do not have the requisite votes to pass at the Annual Meeting (the "Additional Proposal"). We do not believe that the Additional Proposal was submitted to us in accordance with the advance notice requirements of our by-laws. However, if the Additional Proposal is considered at the Annual Meeting, it will require the affirmative vote of at least a majority of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against the Additional Proposal. The Board's designated proxyholders have discretionary authority to vote the proxies solicited by Dover on the Additional Proposal. If the Additional Proposal is considered at the Annual Meeting, the Board's designated proxyholders intend to exercise their discretion to vote "AGAINST" it. 
Voting Procedures 
If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or submit your proxy or voting instruction form over the internet, by telephone or by mail by following the instructions provided in our notice of internet availability, in the proxy materials or in the voting instruction form. If you hold your shares beneficially in "street name" through a broker or other nominee, you must follow the instructions provided by your broker or nominee to vote your shares. 
Revoking Your Proxy/Changing Your Voting Instructions 
If you are a shareholder of record, whether you give your proxy over the internet, by telephone or by mail, you may revoke it at any time before it is exercised. You may submit a new proxy by using the internet or the telephone or by mailing a new proxy card bearing a later date so long as it is received before the Annual Meeting. You may also revoke your proxy by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person, although attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy. If you hold your shares beneficially in "street name" through a broker or other nominee, you must follow the instructions provided by your broker or nominee as to how you may change your voting instructions. 
Shareholders Sharing the Same Address 
SEC rules permit us to deliver one copy of the Proxy Statement or a notice of internet availability of the Proxy Statement to multiple shareholders of record who share the same address and have the same last name, unless we have received contrary instructions from one or more of such shareholders. This delivery method, called "householding," reduces our printing and mailing costs. Shareholders who participate in householding will continue to receive or have internet access to separate proxy cards. 
If you are a shareholder of record subject to householding and wish to receive a separate copy of the Proxy Statement or notice of internet availability of the proxy materials, now or in the future, at the same address or if you are currently receiving multiple copies of such materials at the same address and wish to receive only a single copy, please write to or call the Corporate Secretary, Dover Corporation, 3005 Highland Parkway, Downers Grove, Illinois 60515, telephone: (630) 541-1540.
DOVER CORPORATION – 2019 Proxy Statement 84 
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Beneficial owners sharing an address who are currently receiving multiple copies of the proxy materials or notice of internet availability of the proxy materials and wish to receive only a single copy in the future, or who currently receive a single copy and wish to receive separate copies in the future, should contact their bank, broker or other holder of record to request that only a single copy or separate copies, as the case may be, be delivered to all shareholders at the shared address in the future. 
Proxy Solicitation Costs 
We will pay the reasonable and actual costs of printing, mailing and soliciting proxies, but we will not pay a fee to any of our officers or employees or to officers or employees of any of our subsidiaries as compensation for soliciting proxies. We have retained Morrow Sodali, LLC to solicit brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees or fiduciaries, and to send proxies and proxy materials to the beneficial owners of such shares, for a fee of approximately $20,000 plus expenses. 
Other Matters 
Our Board and management have not received notice of, and are not aware of, any business to come before the Annual Meeting other than the agenda items referred to in this Proxy Statement and the submission of the Additional Proposal. If, however, any other business properly comes before the meeting, the persons named as proxies will use their best judgment in voting the proxies. 
Shareholder Proposals and Director Nominations for 2020 Annual Meeting 
In order for shareholder proposals to be included in our proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held in 2020 (the "2020 Annual Meeting"), they must be received by our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices, 3005 Highland Parkway, Downers Grove, Illinois, 60515, no later than the close of business on November 22, 2019. 
In 2016, we adopted a proxy access right to permit a shareholder or a group of up to 20 shareholders owning 3% or more of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in our proxy materials director candidates constituting up to the greater of two individuals or 20% of the Board, provided that the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in our by-laws. In order to be timely, notice of proxy access director nominees must be received by our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at the address above no earlier than October 23, 2019 and no later than the close of business on November 22, 2019 being, respectively, 150 days and 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date we first distributed this proxy statement. 
All other shareholder nominations and proposals, in order to be voted on at the 2020 Annual Meeting, must be received by us no earlier than January 3, 2020, and no later than the close of business on February 2, 2020 being, respectively, 120 days and 90 days prior to the date of the first anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting.

We caution investors to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to the documents we file with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2019, for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any such forward-looking statements.

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Non-GAAP Disclosures 
In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), we also disclose non-GAAP information that we believe provides useful information to investors. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per common share are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net earnings or diluted earnings per common share as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
Earnings from continuing operations are adjusted by the effect of acquisition-related amortization, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, gains on disposition of businesses, disposition costs, rightsizing and other costs and a product recall reserve reversal to derive at adjusted earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per common share as follows:

5  Disposition costs include costs related to the fourth quarter 2017 sale of Warn.

[END TABLE]
Adjusted earnings from continuing operations represents earnings from continuing operations adjusted for the effect of acquisition-related amortization, the Tax Reform Act, gains on disposition of businesses, disposition costs, rightsizing and other costs and a product recall reserve reversal. We exclude after-tax acquisition-related amortization because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. We exclude the other items because they occur for reasons that may be unrelated to our commercial performance during the period and/or we believe they are not indicative of our ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period. We believe this information is useful to investors to better understand our ongoing profitability as it will better reflect our core operating results, offer more transparency and facilitate easier comparability to prior and future periods and to its peers. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share represents adjusted net earnings divided by average diluted shares.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO ARTICLE FIFTEENTH OF RESTATED 
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO ELIMINATE THE SUPER-MAJORITY 
VOTE REQUIREMENT EXPLAINED IN PROPOSAL 4 
(matter to be deleted is stricken) 
FIFTEENTH: (A) (1) Except as otherwise expressly provided in paragraph (A)(2) below, any purchase by the corporation, or any subsidiary of the corporation, of Voting Shares (as hereinafter defined) from a person or persons known by the corporation to be an Interested Stockholder (as hereinafter defined) at a per share price in excess of the Market Price (as hereinafter defined) at the time of such purchase of the shares so purchased, shall require the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of all then outstanding Voting Shares not beneficially owned by the Interested Stockholder, voting together as a single class. Such affirmative vote shall be required notwithstanding the fact that no vote may be required, or that a lesser percentage or separate class vote may be specified, by law or in any agreement with any national securities exchange or otherwise. 
(2) The provisions of Paragraph (A)(1) of this Article Fifteenth shall not be applicable to any purchase of Voting Shares, if such purchase is pursuant to (i) an offer, made available on the same terms, to the holders of all of the outstanding shares of the same class of those purchased or (ii) a purchase program effected on the open market and not the result of a privately-negotiated transaction. 
(B) (1) In the event that there shall exist a Substantial Stockholder (as hereinafter defined) of the corporation and such existence shall be known or made known to the corporation in advance of a meeting of stockholders at which directors will be elected, each holder of Voting Shares shall be entitled, in connection with any vote taken for such election of directors, to as many votes as shall equal the number of votes which (except for this provision as to cumulative voting) such stockholder would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect to such stockholder's Voting Shares multiplied by the number of directors to be elected, and such stockholder may cast all of such votes for a single director may distribute them among the number of directors to be voted for, or for any two or more of them as such stockholder may see fit. 
(2) In connection with any election of directors in which stockholders are entitled to cumulative voting: 
(a) The Board of Directors shall appoint a committee (the "Committee") consisting of three Directors. 
(b) The Committee shall send to all stockholders of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors at least 90 days in advance of such election a written notice informing stockholders (i) that the cumulative voting provisions of this Article will be in effect, (ii) that persons meeting the eligibility requirements of subparagraph (B)(2)(c) may submit nominations to the Committee, if such nominations are received at least 60 days in advance of the election and contain relevant information concerning the nominee, including all information required to be included in a proxy statement under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder (or any subsequent provisions replacing such Act, rules or regulations), and the nominee's consent to be nominated, and (iii) as to the time, place and date of the meeting at which such election will be held. 
(c) The Committee will review all nominees, and the corporation's proxy materials being prepared in connection with such meeting will include information relating to, and afford stockholders the opportunity to vote for, all nominees who are included by the Committee in the corporation's proxy materials. The Committee shall be required to include in such proxy materials at least one nominee of each stockholder or group of stockholders who beneficially own Voting Shares with a Market Price (as herein defined) of at least $250,000 at the time notice of such meeting is sent to stockholders and who submit the information required with respect to such nominee under subparagraph (B)(2)(b). The Committee may include more than one nominee of such person or persons, provided that the number of nominees included by the Committee which are submitted by any one person or group of persons may not exceed the number of directors to be elected at such a meeting. 
A-1 
(d) The corporation's proxy statement and other communications with respect to the election shall contain, on an equal basis and at the expense of the corporation, descriptions and other statements of or with respect to all nominees for election which qualify under the procedures set forth in this Article. 
(3) If necessary to assure that the provisions of this Paragraph (B) are fairly applied and complied with, the Board of Directors may postpone any meeting of stockholders to which this Article would apply for such period of time as shall be necessary to permit the Committee to perform its responsibilities hereunder. 
(4) Notwithstanding any other provision which may be contained from time to time in this Certificate of Incorporation or the by-laws of the corporation concerning the manner in which the size of the Board of Directors of the corporation may be established or changed, in the event that a person becomes a Substantial Stockholder, the number of directors at the time such person becomes a Substantial Stockholder shall remain fixed and may not be changed by the Board of Directors or the stockholders until such time as such person is no longer a Substantial Stockholder. 
(C) For purposes of this Article Fifteenth: 
(1) "Interested Stockholder" shall mean any person (other than the corporation or any Subsidiary; and other than any profit sharing, employee stock ownership, or other employee benefit plan of the corporation or any subsidiary, or any trustee of or fiduciary with respect to any such plan when acting in such capacity) who or which: 
(a) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of not less than 5% of the Voting Shares and has been such a beneficial owner for less than four years; or 
(b) is an Affiliate of the corporation and at any time within two years prior thereto was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, for a period of less than four years of not less than 5% of the then outstanding Voting Shares; or 
(c) is an assignee of or has otherwise succeeded to any shares of capital stock of the corporation which were at any time within two years prior thereto beneficially owned by any Interested Stockholder and such assignment or succession shall have occurred in the course of a transaction or series of transactions not involving a public offering within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933. 
(2) The term "Substantial Stockholder" shall mean any person (other than the corporation or any Subsidiary; and other than any profit sharing, employee stock ownership or other employee benefit plan of the corporation or any subsidiary, or any trustee of or fiduciary with respect to any such plan when acting in such capacity) who or which is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of not less than 40% of the Voting Shares. 
(3) For the purpose of determining whether a person is an Interested Stockholder or a Substantial Stockholder, the number of Voting Shares deemed to be outstanding shall include shares deemed beneficially owned by such person through application of subparagraph (4) of Paragraph (C) of Article Fourteenth, but shall not include any other Voting Shares that may be issuable pursuant to any agreement, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warranties or options, or otherwise. 
(4) For purposes of this Article Fifteenth, the terms "Voting Shares," "beneficial owner," "person," "Affiliate," "Associate," "Subsidiary," and "Market Price" shall have the meanings set forth in Article Fourteenth of this Certificate of Incorporation, except that "Market Price" shall mean the last closing sale price or the last closing bid quotation immediately preceding the date in question instead of the highest closing sale price or the highest closing bid quotation during the 30-day period immediately preceding the date in question; and 
(D) The Board of Directors shall have the power and the duty to determine for the purposes of this Article Fifteenth (a) whether the provisions of the Article are applicable to a particular transaction, (b) whether a person is an Interested Stockholder or a Substantial Stockholder, (c) the number of Voting Shares or other securities beneficially 
A-2 
owned by any person, (d) whether a person is an Affiliate or Associate of another, (e) what the Market Price is and whether a price is above the Market Price as of a given date, and (f) whether any person nominating directors in accordance with Paragraph B.2. beneficially owns Voting Shares with an aggregate Market Price of at least $250,000. 
(E) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of the corporation to the contrary (and notwithstanding the fact that a lesser percentage may be specified by law, this Certificate of Incorporation or the by-laws of the corporation), any amendment, alteration, change or repeal of this Article Fifteenth of this Certificate of Incorporation shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the then outstanding Voting Shares; provided, however, that this Paragraph E shall not apply to and such 80% vote shall not be required for, any amendment, alteration, change or repeal recommended to the stockholders by the majority vote of the Board of Directors and at the time such amendment, alteration, change or repeal is under consideration there is, to the knowledge of the Board of Directors, neither an Interested Stockholder nor a Substantial Stockholder.
