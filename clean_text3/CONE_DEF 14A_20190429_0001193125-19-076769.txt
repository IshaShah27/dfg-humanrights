Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to consider and approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers ("NEOs") as described in this proxy statement ("Say-on-Pay"). 
Our executive compensation program rewards performance, supports our business strategies, discourages excessive risk-taking, makes us competitive for top talent among our peers and other relevant enterprises, while at the same time creates an ownership culture that aligns our executives' interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Our Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the related compensation tables describe in detail the components of our executive compensation program and the process by which our Compensation Committee makes executive compensation decisions. Highlights of our program include the following: 
PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION
At our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, approximately 86% of the votes were cast in favor of the advisory vote on the 2017 compensation of our NEOs. 
Proposal 2: Say-on-Pay 
We are asking our stockholders to approve the following non-binding advisory resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of CyrusOne Inc. approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of CyrusOne Inc.'s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, Summary Compensation Table and other related tables and disclosures." 
While the vote is non-binding, we highly value the opinions of our stockholders and the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of this advisory vote in connection with future executive compensation decisions. 
The Board has adopted a policy of providing annual advisory votes on the compensation of our NEOs. The next advisory vote is expected to occur at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Proposal 3: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Proposal 3: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, and the Board of Directors is asking stockholders to ratify this appointment. Although current law, rules and regulations, as well as the Audit Committee Charter, require the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to be engaged, retained and supervised by the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors considers the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm to be an important matter of stockholder concern and is submitting the appointment of Deloitte for ratification by stockholders as a matter of good corporate practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee may reconsider whether or not to retain Deloitte in the future. Deloitte has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 2011. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm. 
Fee Disclosure 
The following is a summary of the fees billed by Deloitte for professional services rendered for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:

[END TABLE]
Audit Fees 
"Audit Fees" consist of fees and related expenses billed for professional services rendered for the audit of the financial statements and services that are normally provided by Deloitte in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. For example, audit fees include fees for professional services rendered in connection with quarterly and annual reports, and the issuance of consents by Deloitte to be named in our registration statements and to the use of their audit report in the registration statements. 
Audit-Related Fees 
"Audit-Related Fees" consist of fees and related expenses for products and services other than services described under "Audit Fees", "Tax Fees" and "All Other Fees". These services included, among others, due diligence related to completed and potential acquisitions, accounting consultations that were not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting. 
Tax Fees

Generally, the scope of the work to be performed by Deloitte, and the proposed fees associated with the work, are reviewed by management. The proposed work and associated fees are then presented to the Audit Committee for review, and if deemed appropriate, approved. The Audit Committee in its discretion meets with both Deloitte and with management together and, if needed, separately, prior to giving its approval. For approval of minor adjustments to the scope of work or fees, the Audit Committee in its discretion may delegate approval to its chair. The Audit Committee or designated member concluded that the provision of such services by Deloitte was compatible with the maintenance of that firm's independence in the conduct of its auditing functions. 
A representative of Deloitte will be present at the annual meeting, will be given the opportunity to make a statement if he or she so desires and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

Audit Committee Report 
Audit Committee Report 
The following is a report by the Audit Committee regarding the responsibilities and functions of the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors, in accordance with the Audit Committee Charter adopted by the Board. All members of the Audit Committee are independent under SEC rules and NASDAQ listing standards applicable to service on audit committees, and all three members of the Audit Committee are "audit committee financial experts" as defined by SEC rules. Management is responsible for the preparation of the Company's financial statements and the financial reporting process, including implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of, and reporting on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte, is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the Company's audited financial statements and financial statement schedules with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of our independent auditor. Deloitte has served as the Company's independent auditor since 2011. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed with management and Deloitte the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and discussed with management the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. The Audit Committee also reviewed and discussed with management and Deloitte the disclosures made in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Controls and Procedures" included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
In addition, the Audit Committee received and discussed the written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte that are required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, discussed with Deloitte the firm's independence from management and the Audit Committee, and discussed with Deloitte the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16, "Communications with Audit Committees" (as codified, AS 1301). In reviewing the independence of Deloitte, the Audit Committee considers the non-audit fees paid to Deloitte, if any, during the year. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, prior to the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the SEC, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors (and the Board approved) that the audited financial statements be included in such Annual Report for filing with the SEC.

[END TABLE]
Role of the Board in Risk Oversight 
One of the key functions of the Board of Directors is informed oversight of our enterprise risk management process. The Board administers this oversight function directly, with support from the other standing committees of the Board, each of which addresses risks specific to their respective areas of oversight. In particular, among other things, the Audit Committee has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial and regulatory risk exposures (including cybersecurity) and the steps our management has taken to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate these exposures, including the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken. The Audit Committee also oversees and monitors the performance of our internal audit function and the annual internal audit plan and budget, compliance with the Company's policy on related party transactions, our executives' compliance with the Company's code of business conduct and ethics, and the Company's ethics and compliance reporting helpline. The Compensation Committee oversees succession planning for our executive officers and assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation policies and programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee monitors the effectiveness of our corporate governance guidelines and trends and developments in corporate governance. The Transaction Committee assists the Board with its oversight function in reviewing strategic transactions and capital allocations that arise between regularly scheduled Board meetings, as delegated by the Board. 
Board Leadership 
The Board recognizes that one of its key responsibilities is to evaluate and determine its optimal leadership structure so as to provide independent oversight of management. The Board understands that there is no single, generally accepted approach to providing Board leadership and the right Board leadership structure may vary as circumstances warrant. Consistent with this understanding, the Board of Directors considers its leadership structure on an annual basis. 
Corporate Governance 
The Board of Directors may designate a chairman of the Board, who may or may not be an executive chairman. Since June 2014, Alex Shumate has served as our Chairman of the Board of Directors. Based on its most recent review of our leadership structure and the needs of the Company, the Board continues to believe that having Mr. Shumate serving in this position is optimal because it provides our Company with strong, effective and consistent leadership. Furthermore, our corporate governance guidelines provide that it is the Board's general policy that the positions of Chairman of the Board and CEO should be separate persons as an aid to the Board's oversight of management. The corporate governance guidelines also require a lead independent director, which since June 2014 has been Mr. Shumate. 
In considering its leadership structure, the Board has taken a number of factors into account. The Board, which consists solely of independent directors, other than Mr. Wojtaszek, exercises a strong, self-governing oversight function. Further, the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance, and Transaction Committees are each comprised entirely of independent directors, enhancing the Board's oversight function. A number of Board and committee processes and procedures, including regular executive sessions of independent directors and a regular review of our executive officers' performance, provide substantial independent oversight of our management's performance. Finally, under our Bylaws and corporate governance guidelines, the Board has the ability to change this structure, should it deem doing so to be appropriate and in the best interests of our Company. The Board believes that these factors provide the appropriate balance between the independent authority of those who oversee our Company and those who manage it on a day-to-day basis. 
The Chairman of the Board presides at all meetings of the Board of Directors, unless otherwise prescribed. The Chairman performs such other duties, and exercises such powers, as from time to time shall be prescribed in our Bylaws or by the Board of Directors. 
Director Independence 
In accordance with the corporate governance listing standards of NASDAQ and our corporate governance guidelines, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee that is comprised solely of independent members, affirmatively evaluates and determines the independence of each director and each nominee for election. Based on an analysis of information supplied by the directors, and other information including the matters set forth in "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions," the Board evaluates whether any director has any relationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. 
Based on these standards, the Board affirmatively determined that each of the following directors is independent: Alex Shumate, David H. Ferdman, John W. Gamble, Jr., Michael A. Klayko, T. Tod Nielsen, William E. Sullivan and Lynn A. Wentworth. In determining Mr. Klayko's independence, the Board has considered the Company's employment of Mr. Klayko's son-in-law as an account director in the Company's sales organization, which is permissible under applicable NASDAQ standards for independence and our independence standards, and determined that such employment did not interfere with the exercise of independent judgment by Mr. Klayko in carrying out his responsibilities as a director of the Company. Mr. Klayko's son-in-law is not an officer of the Company and his employment was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee of the Board pursuant to the Company's Policy on Related Party Transactions. For 2018, Mr. Klayko's son-in-law's compensation was approximately $126,000 and is disclosed below in "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions – Review and Approval of Transactions with Related Persons". 
The Board determined that Gary J. Wojtaszek is not independent because he is our President & CEO. 
Board Meetings 
In 2018, the Board of Directors held eight meetings, the Audit Committee held seven meetings, the Compensation Committee held five meetings, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
Corporate Governance held four meetings. The Transaction Committee and the Executive Committee did not meet during 2018. Each director attended over 75% of the meetings of the Board and his or her respective committee(s) in 2018. 
Although we do not have a policy requiring directors' attendance at annual meetings of stockholders, they are expected to do so. Each of our directors attended our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, except Mr. Shumate who was unable to attend due to travel conflicts. 
The Board of Directors regularly meets in executive session, without management present. In addition, the independent directors of the Board and the committees meet regularly in independent sessions without management or non-independent directors present. Generally, these executive sessions follow after each quarterly meeting of the Board and each committee. Alex Shumate, our Chairman and lead independent director, presides over such independent, non-management sessions of the Board. In 2018, the independent directors met at least four times in such independent sessions. As deemed necessary, directors also discuss matters informally between Board and committee meetings.

Corporate Governance 
Each of the committees, other than the Executive Committee, operates pursuant to a written charter which is available on our website at www.cyrusone.com in the "Corporate Governance" section. 
Under our corporate governance guidelines, the composition of each of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee must comply with the rules of the SEC and listing standards and other rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Our corporate governance guidelines define "independent director" by reference to the rules of the SEC and rules, regulations and listing standards of NASDAQ, which generally deem a director to be independent if the director has no relationship that may interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out such director's responsibilities, and which further impose heightened requirements of independence for members of the Audit and Compensation Committees. 
Each of our committees, other than the Executive Committee, consists entirely of independent directors, and each of the members of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee meet applicable heightened requirements for service on such committees. 
Board and Committee Evaluations 
The Board and each of its committees perform an annual performance evaluation, with each director performing a self-evaluation of his or her Board and committee experiences. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the annual performance evaluation process and considers various methods of performing the same. For 2018, the self-evaluations were conducted through questionnaires prepared by the Corporate Secretary. Generally, the evaluation process described below is managed by the Corporate Secretary's office with oversight by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to ensure the process remains as thorough and transparent as possible. The annual evaluation includes a review of each Committee's charter.

Corporate Governance 
Nomination of Directors 
Before each annual meeting of stockholders, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the nomination of all incumbent directors, and also considers new candidates whenever there is a vacancy on the Board or whenever a vacancy is anticipated due to a change in the size or composition of the Board, a retirement of a director or for any other reason. In addition to considering incumbent directors, the Committee may identify director candidates based on recommendations from any qualified individual or group, including, but not limited to, stockholders, the incumbent directors and members of management. The Committee has, and may in the future, engage the services of third-party search firms to assist in identifying or evaluating director candidates. 
The Committee evaluates annually the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, its committees, and of each individual director and identifies any areas in which the Board would be better served by adding new members with different skills, backgrounds or areas of experience. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Whether the candidate would contribute to Board's diversity of experience, profession, expertise, skills and background  (including with respect to race and gender)      
• Whether the candidate would contribute to Board's diversity of experience, profession, expertise, skills and background  (including with respect to race and gender)      
[END TABLE]
Candidates also are evaluated based on their understanding of our business and willingness to devote adequate time to carrying out their duties. The Committee also monitors the mix of skills, experience and background to assure that the Board has the necessary composition to effectively perform its oversight function. As listed above, diversity characteristics of the board as a whole and of a particular candidate are one of several factors considered by the Committee when evaluating director candidates. However, a candidate will neither be included nor excluded from consideration solely based on his or her diversity traits. The Committee conducts regular reviews of current directors in light of the considerations described above and their past contributions to the Board of Directors. 
The Committee will consider appropriate director candidates recommended by a stockholder, evaluating such candidates on the same basis as any other candidates. We did not receive any recommendations of director candidates or director nominations by stockholders for the 2019 annual meeting. 
Recommendations for nominations should be addressed to CyrusOne Inc., 2101 Cedar Springs Road, Suite 900, Dallas, Texas 75201, Attention: Corporate Secretary, indicating the candidate's qualifications and other relevant biographical information and providing confirmation of the candidate's consent to serve as a director, if elected. Stockholders may also nominate qualified individuals for election to the Board by complying with the advance notice and other requirements of our current Bylaws regarding director nominations. These requirements are also described under "Stockholder Proposals." 
Corporate Governance 
Majority Voting Resignation Policy for Election of Directors 
Our corporate governance guidelines provide that, as a condition to nomination, each director will agree to offer to resign if at a meeting of the stockholders relating to an uncontested election, the director receives a greater number of votes "withheld" than votes "for" such election. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the offer and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the offer to resign within 60 days following the certification of the stockholder vote. No later than 90 days following the certification of the stockholder vote, the Board will decide whether to accept the offer to resign. Any director who offers to resign is prohibited from participating in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's deliberations or recommendation, or in the Board's deliberations and determination, regarding whether to accept his or her offer of resignation. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No member of the Compensation Committee has been an officer or employee of the Company. None of our executive officers serves on the board of directors or compensation committee of a company that has an executive officer that serves on our board of directors or the Compensation Committee. 
Corporate Governance Materials Available on Website 
We have adopted corporate governance guidelines and a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to all of our executive officers and employees, and each member of the Board of Directors. We anticipate that any amendments or waivers of our code of business conduct and ethics will be posted on our website.

Executive Summary 
Our long-term success depends on our ability to attract, motivate, focus and retain highly talented individuals who are committed to our vision and strategy. A key objective of our executive compensation program is to create an ownership culture that aligns pay to performance that advances our business strategies and overall stockholder value creation. Other objectives include encouraging high-performing executives to remain with us over the course of their careers. We believe that the amount of compensation for each of our NEOs reflects extensive management experience, continued high performance and exceptional service to CyrusOne. We also believe that our compensation strategies have been effective in attracting executive talent and promoting performance and retention.

Executive Compensation 
Compensation Objectives and Governance Highlights 
Our fundamental objective is to be outstanding stewards of our stockholders' capital by creating value on a consistent, long-term basis. Our compensation philosophy is to incentivize thoughtful capital allocation and value creation for our stockholders by attracting and retaining talented executives with competitive pay packages intended to cultivate an ownership culture, to align the compensation for our executive officers with sustainable, consistent, balanced growth and to achieve specific short- and long-term goals set by the Compensation Committee. We use a combination of compensation programs to incent our executive officers to achieve growth and value creation over the short- and long-term. We supplement our pay for performance program with a number of compensation polices intended to encourage an ownership culture and align the interests of management with those of our stockholders. These include:

Executive Compensation 
Alignment of Pay with Performance 
Our executive compensation program provides significant alignment between pay and performance by linking a meaningful portion of our NEOs' total target compensation to the achievement of pre-established financial and strategic goals under our annual incentive bonus program and the Company's relative total shareholder return (TSR) under our long-term incentive grants. The following charts present the allocation of total pay among different components for our CEO and for our other NEOs as a group, in 2018. 
How We Make Compensation Decisions 
Role of the Compensation Committee and Management 
All compensation for the NEOs (including the CEO) is set by the Compensation Committee annually. The Committee also determines measurements and targets, and performance relative to them, under our annual and long-term incentives for the NEOs. Individual base salaries, and annual and long-term incentive targets, are determined by the Committee after taking into consideration a number of internal and external factors, including the external marketplace and peer group data, the executive's position and responsibility, the demand for executive talent in the marketplace, the Company's performance, and the individual's performance and future potential. The Committee also considers the CEO's self-performance evaluation when setting the CEO's compensation and, with respect to each of the other NEOs, the CEO's recommendations for base salary and annual and long-term incentive targets, as well as actual awards, based on his assessment of their individual performance. 
Role of Compensation Consultant and Market Data 
For 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged FPL Associates, L.P. ("FPL") to assist it in the performance of its duties and to make recommendations to the Committee with respect to NEO and director compensation. FPL assisted the Committee in development of the peer group framework for 2018 and advised the Committee on the 2018 base salaries, target bonuses and LTI awards for our NEOs, and benchmarking for our non-employee director compensation program. The Committee also worked with FPL to update our peer group composition and methodology for 2018, taking into account feedback received through our stockholder engagement, and to conduct a competitive market assessment of the compensation elements for each of our executive officers, compared to our peer groups. An FPL consultant attends certain Compensation Committee meetings as requested by the Compensation Committee. FPL has not been engaged by management to perform any other work for the Company. We paid FPL approximately $107,000 in 2018 for their service as a compensation consultant. In 2018, management engaged Ferguson Partners, an executive search firm and an affiliate of FPL, to assist in the search for a chief accounting officer. Ferguson Partners was paid $145,600 in 2018 for their services.

Compensation Consultant Independence Assessment 
FPL has served as the Compensation Committee's compensation consultant since July 2017. 
In connection with the engagement of FPL, the Committee requested and received information from FPL addressing its independence and potential conflicts of interest. Information provided by FPL included a description of the Company's engagement of Ferguson Partners described above. Based on an assessment of these factors, as well as information gathered from directors and executive officers addressing business or personal relationships between directors or executive officers and the consulting firm or the individual consultants, the Committee concluded that FPL is independent and that the work of the consultant, including services provided by Ferguson Partners, did not raise any conflict of interest. The Committee evaluates the independence of FPL at least annually. 
Use of Data 
The Compensation Committee believes that data plays an important role in the design and implementation of optimal compensation programs. The Committee considers a number of types of internal and external data in making both individual and plan-level compensation decisions. Peer group data plays an important role in our compensation decision making, enabling the Committee to evaluate whether the Company's compensation policies are aligned with Company performance and providing the Committee a market check of its compensation program design and features. The Committee uses peer groups to maintain an awareness of market data and pay practices, but considers various factors-each as discussed in greater detail below in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and does not target any element of compensation at a particular percentile or percentile range of the peer group data. Rather, the Committee uses data and the market median as an initial reference point and their judgment in its decision-making process. 
Use of Judgment 
The Compensation Committee believes that the application of its collective experiences and judgment is as important to excellence in compensation as the use of data and formulae, and the Company's compensation policies and practices as described herein reflect this belief. Market data provides an important tool for analysis and decision-making. However, the Committee believes that over-reliance on data can give a false illusion of precision. Consequently, the Committee also gives consideration and emphasis to an individual's personal contributions to the organization, as well as his skill set, qualifications and experience. The Committee also values and seeks to reward performance that develops talent within the Company, embraces the sense of urgency that we believe distinguishes the Company and demonstrates the qualities of imagination and drive that enables a Company executive to resolve longer-term challenges and address important new issues. The Committee believes these and similar qualities and attributes are not easily correlated to typical compensation data, but also deserve consideration and weight in reaching compensation decisions. 
Peer Groups 
The Compensation Committee evaluates the members of our peer group each year to ensure that they continue to be appropriate. Prior to 2018, our Compensation Committee used three different peer groups in making compensation decisions: a direct competitor peer group, which included competitors against which the company competes for colocation customers; a size based peer group, which included real estate investment trusts that are comparable in size and against which the Company's financial performance is measured by the real estate investors; and a cloud based technology group, which included companies that provide thought leadership on products which drive colocation decisions for companies such as ours. 
Executive Compensation 
In the second half of 2017, after considering feedback from our stockholders received as part of our outreach efforts, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of FPL, determined to revise our compensation peer groups to take into account our size and our complex business model. Based on a review of market data, with the assistance of FPL, the Compensation Committee determined to use two peer groups for purposes of 2018 compensation decisions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a size-based peer group, comprised of high growth REITs of  similar size (0.5x to 2x of our total capitalization) and asset focus (such as data center/industrial or specialty); and  
[END TABLE]

• a technology real estate peer group.

Stockholder Engagement & Say on Pay Vote 
We hold annual Say on Pay votes. At our 2018 annual meeting, approximately 86% of the votes cast were in favor of the Company's executive compensation for fiscal 2017. We continue to maintain an active dialogue with our stockholders regarding our executive compensation program. In 2018, our Compensation Committee chair held individual meetings with five of our top 10 largest stockholders. Since the beginning of 2017, our Board, primarily through the Compensation Committee, has held individual meetings with stockholders who collectively owned approximately 60% of our outstanding stock. We remain committed to listening to feedback from our stockholders and will continue to actively engage with our investors to solicit feedback on our executive compensation program (such as questions about our peer groups, which led to the peer group changes described above) and governance practices generally.

Fixed compensation Variable compensation 
Base Salary 
Policy and Process. Base salary, which under our compensation program is market-derived and market-driven, represents the fixed component of our executive officer compensation program paid in cash. The main purpose of base salary compensation is to provide cash compensation levels sufficient to attract and retain executive officers. Base salary is targeted to be approximately 10% to 30% or less of total target annual compensation opportunity for each of the NEOs. The actual percentages will vary from year to year based on each NEO's performance, as well as the Company's performance, within that year. Because one of the primary objectives of our executive compensation program is to instill an ownership mentality, the base salary component constitutes a smaller percentage of total compensation than incentive-based compensation. On an annual basis, the Compensation Committee reviews the base salary of each of the NEOs and considers adjustments to place executive officer base salary in a position approximately equal to the median base salary paid to similarly situated executives of the peer group companies, subject to further adjustment for individual performance and personal contributions. 
Executive Compensation 
2018 Base Salaries. The table below summarizes the base salaries approved for each of our NEOs. The Compensation Committee reviews base salaries annually as part of its annual compensation review.

Annual Incentive Bonus Opportunity 
Policy and Process. Our annual incentive bonus awards are designed to encourage our executive officers to pursue annual goals that will inure to the benefit of our Company and stockholders in both the short- and long-term. Annual incentive bonus award opportunities are intended to reward NEOs whose contributions improve the operational performance of our existing portfolio and the Company, enhance short-term strategic goals and generate new business opportunities and investments, all of which are intended to create stockholder value over the long-term. 
Each of our NEOs participated in our annual incentive bonus plan for 2018, pursuant to which each NEO had an opportunity to earn additional cash compensation based on achievement of pre-established financial goals (weighted 80%) and individual performance (weighted 20%). 
The Compensation Committee reviewed the bonus targets, as a percentage of base salary, of our NEOs in February 2018 as part of its annual compensation review and determined no adjustments were necessary for 2018. The annual incentive target remained 175% of base salary for our CEO and 100% of base salary for other NEOs. 
The table below depicts the annual incentive bonus opportunity for each NEO for 2018:

Financial Goals. The following graphs show the threshold, target, maximum and actual performance levels for each financial component of the 2018 bonus opportunities for our NEOs, in millions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Normalized FFO(1): The Compensation Committee considers Normalized  FFO, or NFFO, to be an important indicator of the Companys overall financial performance. It also is a metric typically used by investors and analysts, as well as many of our peers, to evaluate performance. The Normalized FFO target  established for 2018 was approximately 16% higher than the actual Normalized FFO results for 2017 ($324M vs. $278.9M). Actual Normalized FFO for 2018 was $332.3 million.   (1)  Normalized NFFO is calculated from the Companys financial statements as set forth in  Appendix A.

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee exercised discretion and determined to adjust the original revenue and Normalized FFO targets to exclude budgeted revenue from the planned acquisition of Zenium due to the delayed closing date of the acquisition as a result of the timing of required regulatory review. 
In determining payouts, the following sliding scale is applied to the financial performance targets, with data between points interpolated on a straight-line basis. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Percentage of Target     Payout Percentage 
 <80%     0% 
 80%     25% 
 90%     50% 
 100%     100%

[END TABLE]
Based on this, the Company's performance relative to the financial goals resulted in a weighted payout of 91.7% of target on the financial component, which accounts for 80% of each NEO's target bonus opportunity. 
Individual Performance. The remaining 20% of each NEO's annual bonus opportunity relates to his or her individual performance and contributions relative to the Company's achievement of the financial performance measures. Based on the Company's above-target performance on the financial goals, the Compensation Committee approved the payout of the individual performance component for Mr. Wojtaszek at above-target, and at or above-target for the other NEOs, as reflected in the table below.

Long-Term Incentives 
Policy and Process. The third component of NEO compensation is targeted toward providing rewards for long-term stockholder value creation. The Compensation Committee believes that long-term incentive awards are the component of executive compensation best suited to promote retention and create an ownership culture that closely aligns the interests of the executive officers with those of our stockholders. Accordingly, at the target level, long-term incentive awards constitute the highest targeted percentage of any of the compensation components paid to each of our NEOs. 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation Program. We believe that outstanding long-term performance is achieved through an ownership culture that encourages a focus on long-term stockholder value creation by our executive officers through the use of equity-based awards. In particular, the Compensation Committee and the Board feel that one way to align the Company's strategy with the executive long-term incentive compensation is to tie the awards directly to the returns provided to our stockholders. As such, long-term incentive ("LTI") awards are made annually under our long-term incentive compensation programs. 
2018 LTI Awards. The LTI awards granted to our NEOs in 2018 consisted of a performance-based restricted stock unit component (75%), which vests based upon achievement of specified TSR goals as compared to the MSCI US REIT Index over a three-year performance period (2018-2020), and a time-based restricted stock unit component (25%), which vests ratably over three years. 
Long-Term Incentive Program 
In selecting relative TSR as the sole performance metric for the 2018 (and 2017) awards, the Compensation Committee considered relevant peer data as well as market practices. The Compensation Committee believes TSR is widely accepted by investors and demonstrates the strong alignment between executive pay and performance. LTI awards granted in 2015 and 2016 also included a return on assets ("ROA") metric. In that regard, the Compensation Committee believes that TSR is more directly focused on stockholder returns, and the elimination of the ROA metric also removes volatility associated with acquisitions that remain part of the Company's growth strategy. 
Executive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee determined the 2018 LTI award values for the NEOs based on the market and peer data provided by FPL, individual and Company performance in 2017, and the value of the other components that make up each NEO's target total direct compensation. The Compensation Committee increased the target dollar value of 2018 LTI awards by approximately 20% for Mr. Wojtaszek, based primarily on market data, individual and Company performance and strong demand for executive talent, and by approximately 10% to 50% for each of the other NEOs, in each case based primarily on market data and strong demand for executive talent. There were no off-cycle or special retention grants made in 2018 or 2017 to any of the NEOs. 
The grant date fair value of the LTI awards to our NEOs made in February 2018, as determined in accordance with FASB ASC 718, was:

       Total Target LTI Award Value ($)       Performance Shares (at  target) ($)       Time-Based Restricted Stock ($) 
[END TABLE]
LTI Payout Determinations 
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee certified the performance results under outstanding performance awards granted in 2016, 2017 and 2018 that vested based upon the performance period ending December 31, 2018, as described below. Our performance awards vest over a three year period contingent upon TSR achievement relative to the MSCI US REIT Index for the applicable one, two and three-year performance period(s), or, with respect to half of the 2016 award, achievement of specified ROA goals. However, even if our TSR achievement exceeds the index performance, if absolute TSR achievement is negative, then the vesting amount is reduced by 50%. For purposes of our LTI awards, TSR is defined as (1) the trailing one month average adjusted closing stock price at the end of the performance period minus the trailing one month average adjusted closing stock price at the beginning of the performance period, divided by (2) the trailing one month average adjusted closing stock price at the beginning of the performance period. 
2016 LTI Performance Awards - Final Vesting Determination 
The performance awards granted in 2016 vested in February 2019. These awards consisted of restricted stock which vested over a three-year performance period ending December 31, 2018 based upon achievement of specified performance metrics. 50% of the performance awards were tied to the achievement of relative TSR goals and 50% were tied to the achievement of return on asset (ROA) goals. If cumulative TSR over the three-year performance period exceeds the MSCI US REIT index by more than 2%, up to 200% of the target award subject to TSR performance may vest. If at the end of the third year ROA meets or exceeds 19.5%, up to 200% of the target award subject to ROA performance may vest. Up to one-third of the total target award can be earned after each of the first year and first two-years of the performance period if actual performance over such periods meets or exceeds the target performance. Actual shares that vested for each NEO as a result of 2018 performance are as follows: Mr. Wojtaszek-34,205; Mr. Duvasula-14,367; Mr. Timmons-10,945; and Mr. Jackson-4,378. Additional information about the 2016 performance awards is disclosed in the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year End table.

Actual TSR for 2017 awards for the 2018 performance period (the two-years ending December 31, 2018) was 35.5%, resulting in achievement at 200%. Payouts for the 2018 performance period were capped at 100%. Actual shares that vested for each NEO as a result of 2018 performance are as follows: Mr. Wojtaszek-18,699; Ms. Morefield-4,415; Mr. Duvasula-4,674;Mr. Timmons-4,160; and Mr. Jackson-3,324.

Other Elements of Compensation 
Retirement and Other Benefits 
Benefits are established based upon a determination of what is needed to aid in attracting and retaining a talented and motivated work force. The Compensation Committee does not view benefits and perquisites for our NEOs as a key component of our executive compensation program. Our NEOs participate in benefit plans on the same terms as our other participating employees and their total value remains a negligible percentage of each executive officer's total compensation package. 
Executive Compensation 
We provide no perquisites or other personal benefits to our NEOs that are not available to all employees of the Company other than a cell phone allowance and, for Mr. Durvasula, a car allowance. In connection with Mr. Durvasula's promotion to President, Europe, effective December 1, 2018 he is also eligible to receive additional benefits available to employees under our long-term international assignment policy, including tax equalization benefits, education assistance, relocation, and a one-time resettlement allowance of $20,000. See "Employment Agreements" below for additional information. We provide the following benefits to all employees of the Company: medical, dental, vision and disability insurance, parking at our corporate offices or public transportation credit, 401(k) employer match and group life insurance premiums. We do not maintain any defined benefit or supplemental retirement plans. 
The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the levels of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to our NEOs and may revise, amend or add to any such benefits and perquisites in the future if it deems advisable. 
Severance Benefits 
In order to achieve our compensation objective of attracting, retaining and motivating qualified executives, we believe that we need to provide the NEOs with severance protection provided in an employment agreement. Each NEO is entitled to certain severance benefits based on the nature of their termination. See "Employment Agreements" and "Executive Compensation Tables—Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control" below for complete details of severance benefits payable to the NEOs upon certain terminations of employment. 
Other Compensation-Related Policies 
Stock Ownership Guidelines. The Company's corporate governance guidelines specify that the CEO is expected to hold shares worth at least six times his or her annual base pay, and each other NEO is expected to hold at least one and a half times his or her annual base pay. As of December 31, 2018, each of our NEOs has met the minimum requirements for stock ownership. 
Hedging and Pledging. The Company has a written policy prohibiting employees, including officers and directors, from owning or trading in derivative financial instruments, short-selling, or engaging in hedging transactions that enable continued ownership of the Company's securities without the full risks and rewards of ownership. Executive officers and directors, and certain other employees, are also prohibited from pledging Company securities, absent specific preapproval. No such preapprovals have been requested or provided. 
Clawback. The Company has a written clawback policy allowing it to recover incentive payments and equity awards realized by our NEOs in the preceding three years in the event of a material restatement of the Company's financial statements, if the incentive payments or amount of equity awards received would have been lower if calculated based on the restated financials, and the executive engaged in actual fraud or willful unlawful misconduct that materially contributed to the need for the restatement. 
Repricing Prohibition. The Company maintains prohibitions on the re-pricing of underwater stock options, and cash buyouts of underwater stock options. 
Double-trigger change-in-control. Severance benefits under an executive's employment agreement are not payable and equity awards do not vest upon a change of control unless the executive is terminated without cause or experiences a constructive termination, in each case, within 12 months following the change in control. 
Employment Agreements 
The Company has entered into written employment agreements with each of our NEOs. Employment agreements allow the Company the flexibility to make changes in key positions with or without cause, and minimize the potential for disagreements or litigation, by establishing separation terms in advance, 
Executive Compensation including arbitration provisions and the execution of appropriate releases, and perpetuation of important confidentiality and non-competition restrictions. The benefits specified in the employment agreements, including the severance and change in control payments, are important provisions designed to ensure the recruitment and retention of quality executive talent. 
Information regarding the severance payable to our NEOs pursuant to their employment agreements and treatment of outstanding equity awards can be found in "Executive Compensation Tables—Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control." 
Effective December 1, 2018, Mr. Durvasula was promoted to Executive Vice President & President, Europe. In connection with his promotion, Mr. Durvasula's base salary was increased to $550,000. Mr. Durvasula remains eligible to receive a target annual bonus of 100% of his base salary and equity awards under our long-term incentive program, with a target annual equity award of 300% of base salary. Mr. Durvasula is entitled to payment for his relocation to London, England. The Company has agreed to pay for his relocation costs, including moving expenses, a housing allowance and settling-in assistance (in addition to a one-time payment of $20,000, subject to tax withholding). Mr. Durvasula is also eligible to receive a goods and services differential, a transportation allowance (or use of a leased automobile while on assignment abroad), and financial assistance with the cost of his children's school attendance. While on international assignment, Mr. Durvasula will be tax equalized, to ensure that his tax costs are approximately equivalent to the tax that would have arisen had he remained in the United States. 
If Mr. Durvasula resigns or is terminated for cause within 12 months of December 1, 2018, he will be responsible for repaying the Company a percentage of relocation costs (100% if termination occurs within the first six months and 50% if termination occurs thereafter, up to 12 months). Under certain circumstances, including a change in the Chief Executive Officer position at the Company, a material adverse change in the duties and responsibilities of Mr. Durvasula's employment, or a change in control of the Company, the Company has agreed to pay for Mr. Durvasula's relocation back to the U.S. within 30 days of any of those events. 
Compensation Committee Analysis of Risk 
The Compensation Committee engaged FPL to perform an annual assessment for the Compensation Committee to determine whether the Company's compensation practices, plans and policies encourage unnecessary risk taking or create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. These assessments reviewed the material elements of executive and non-executive employee compensation. Based on these assessments, the Compensation Committee concluded these policies and practices do not encourage unnecessary risk taking or create risk that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on CyrusOne. 
2019 Compensation Decisions 
In November 2018, the Compensation Committee approved compensation for Mr. Durvasula in conjunction with his promotion to Executive Vice President & President, Europe, effective December 1, 2018, as described above in "2018 Executive Compensation Components—Employment Agreements." In February 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the 2019 target compensation for the other NEOs, along with the performance goals for the 2019 annual incentive bonus plan and 2019 LTI awards. For 2019, the Compensation Committee did not make any changes to the design of our annual or LTI plans, including emphasis on performance requirements. The 2019 base salary and annual incentive bonus opportunity for our CEO and other NEOs remained unchanged from 2018, while the total dollar value of our CEO's target 2019 LTI award was increased by approximately 6% based primarily on market data and individual and Company performance. The Compensation Committee did not grant any special one-time retention awards. 
Compensation Committee Report 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee has the overall responsibility of evaluating the performance and determining the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and approving the compensation structure for the Company's other named executive officers. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management. Based on such review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders for filing with the SEC.

Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control 
Each of the employment agreements with our NEOs specify the payments and benefits to which such executives are entitled upon a termination of employment for specified reasons, as described below. In addition, certain of our award agreements under our long-term incentive plan provide for certain treatment of outstanding equity awards upon a termination of employment for specified reasons, as described below. 
Without Cause or Constructive Termination. If the Company terminates the executive's employment for any reason other than for cause or the executive's death or disability or the executive terminates his or her employment as a result of a constructive termination (as defined below) in circumstances not involving a change in control, then the executive will be entitled to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump-sum cash severance payment equal to two times (for  Messrs. Wojtaszek, Durvasula and Timmons and one times for Ms. Morefield and Mr. Jackson), the sum of her or his (i) then-current annual base salary, and (ii) annual incentive bonus target,  pro-rated to the date of termination (or, in the case of Ms. Morefield and Mr. Jackson, her or his annual incentive bonus target), subject to the executive signing and not revoking a release of  claims ("Cash Severance");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• certain vesting of outstanding equity awards, including:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     immediate vesting of the portion of any outstanding time-based awards that would otherwise have  vested on or prior to the end of the one-year period beginning at the time of such termination (the Severance Period), or for Ms. Morefield, immediate vesting of the pro-rata portion of any outstanding time-based awards from the grant date through the end of the Severance Period.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Tables 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     for Ms. Morefield, immediate vesting of the restricted stock granted to her in connection with  her hiring in November 2016, and, for Messrs. Wojtaszek, Durvasula and Timmons, immediate vesting of the 3-year cliff vesting retention awards granted in February 2016 (which vested in February 2019).   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     performance-based equity awards will remain outstanding until the end of the applicable performance  period (or, if earlier, the executives death or disability or a change in control) and the vesting will be determined based on actual level of performance attained and pro-rated based on the number of days employed during the applicable  performance period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if applicable, an amount equal to the sum of (a) any forfeitable benefits of the executive under  any nonqualified pension, profit sharing, savings or deferred compensation plan that would have vested if the term of his or her employment had not been terminated prior to the end of the Severance Period, plus (b) any additional vested  benefits which would have accrued for the executive under any nonqualified defined benefit pension plan if the term of his or her employment had not been terminated prior to the end of the Severance Period, and if the executive's base salary  and bonus target had not increased or decreased after such termination, payable to the executive at the same time and in the same manner as such benefits would have been paid under such plan or plans had such benefits vested and accrued under such  plan or plans at the time of the termination of his or her employment (the "Nonqualified Benefit");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if applicable, an amount equal to the sum of (a) any forfeitable benefits of the executive under  any qualified pension, profit sharing, 401(k) or deferred compensation plan that would have vested prior if the term of his or her employment had not been terminated prior to the end of the Severance Period, plus (B) any additional vested  benefits which would have accrued for the executive under any qualified defined benefit pension plan if the term of his or her employment had not been terminated prior to the end of the Severance Period, and if the executive's base salary and  bonus target had not increased or decreased after such termination, payable by the Company in one lump sum 60 days after such termination of employment, subject to the Company's receipt of an executed and irrevocable release from the  applicable executive (the "Qualified Benefit") (the Company does not currently offer any Qualified Benefits); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued medical, dental, vision and group term life coverage for the remainder of the Severance  Period, comparable to the medical, dental, vision and group term life coverage in effect for the executive immediately prior to such termination (the "Medical Benefit"). To the extent that the executive would have been eligible for any  post-retirement medical, dental, vision or group term life benefits from the Company if the executive's employment had continued through the end of the Severance Period, the Company will provide such post-retirement benefits to the executive  after the end of the Severance Period (the "Post-Retirement Medical Benefit") (the Company does not currently offer any Post-Retirement Medical Benefits other than subsidized COBRA).  
[END TABLE]
For purposes of the employment agreements, "cause" generally means an act of fraud, misappropriation, embezzlement or misconduct constituting serious criminal activity on the part of the executive. For the purposes of each of the employment agreements, "constructive termination" will generally be deemed to have occurred if, without the executive's consent, (a) there is a material adverse change in the reporting responsibilities set forth in his or her employment agreement or there is otherwise a material reduction in his or her authority, reporting relationship or responsibilities, (b) there is a material reduction in his or her base salary or bonus target or (c) the applicable executive is required to relocate more than 50 miles from his or her designated office in effect as of the effective date of the agreement. 
Executive Compensation Tables 
Change of Control. If within one year following a change in control: (a) the executive terminates his or her employment with the Company as a result of a constructive termination or (b) the Company terminates the executive's employment for any reason other than for cause or the executive's death or disability, then the executive will be entitled to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump-sum cash severance payment in an amount equal to two  times the sum of his or her (i) annual base salary and (ii) annual incentive bonus target, in each case, as then in effect, subject to the executive signing and not revoking a release of claims;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• immediate vesting of any outstanding time-based equity awards, and immediate vesting of any  outstanding performance-based equity awards at the maximum level; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Nonqualified Benefit, the Qualified Benefit, the Medical Benefit, and, to the extent applicable,  the Post-Retirement Medical Benefit.  
[END TABLE]
In the event that Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applies to the payments and benefits set forth above, the aggregate amount of such payments and benefits payable to the executive will not exceed the amount which produces the greatest after-tax benefit to the executive after taking into account any applicable excise tax to be payable by the executive. Each executive is fully responsible for his or her own personal income taxes and the Company has no obligation to reimburse or otherwise provide a tax gross-up to the executive in connection with any change of control payments. 
Disability and Death. In the event of an executive's death or disability, the Company will pay the executive or his or her estate, as applicable, his or her accrued compensation (base salary, bonus or otherwise) as of the date of termination and, in the case of disability, will provide the executive with disability benefits and all other benefits in accordance with the provisions of the applicable disability plans and other applicable plans. In addition, time-based equity awards will vest on a pro-rata basis and performance-based equity awards will vest at the target level on a pro-rata basis. 
Voluntary Resignation. If an executive voluntarily resigns, other than for a constructive termination, then the executive will be entitled only to accrued compensation. 
Restrictive Covenants. Pursuant to the employment agreements, each of the executives is subject to confidentiality and intellectual property covenants during the term of his or her employment and thereafter. In addition, each of the executives is subject to non-competition, non-solicitation and non-interference covenants during the term of his or her employment and for a period of one year following the cessation of his or her employment for any reason.

Estimated Payments in Connection with a Termination of Employment or Change in Control 
The table below presents estimates of the amounts of compensation that would have been payable to the NEOs upon their termination of employment or upon a change in control, in each case as of December 31, 2018. The amounts in the table exclude: (i) 401(k) retirement plan contributions and distributions that are generally available to all salaried employees, (ii) payments pursuant to awards originally scheduled to vest on or before such date by their terms, and (iii) any amounts that may be due at the time of payment for accrued and unpaid salary, bonuses, vacation or interest on payments (if any) delayed as a result of Section 409A of the Code. The actual amounts payable upon such terminations may be different and will only be determined upon the actual occurrence of any such event.

CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure 
CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our median employee and the annual total compensation of Mr. Gary J. Wojtaszek, our President and Chief Executive Officer (our "CEO"). This relationship is referred to as the "CEO pay ratio." The CEO pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
To identify the median employee, the annual total compensation of the median employee and to determine the CEO pay ratio, we took the following steps: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We selected December 31, 2018, the last day of our 2018 payroll year, as the date upon which we  would identify the median employee because it enabled us to make such identification in a reasonably efficient and economical manner.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As permitted by SEC rules, we also excluded 34 employees of Zenium Data Centers, which we acquired in  a transaction that closed in August 2018. Excluding these employees, we determined that, as of December 31, 2018, our employee population consisted of approximately 415 employees, all of whom are located in the United States. This population  consisted of our full-time, part-time and temporary employees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To identify the median employee from our 2018 employee population, we compared the amount of salary  and wages of our employees as reflected in our payroll records as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 (for 2018). In making this determination, we annualized the compensation of approximately  83 full-time employees who were hired in 2018 but did not work for us the entire fiscal year. Other than the foregoing, we did not make any assumptions, adjustments or estimates with respect to our employees' salary and wages as reflected in  our payroll records, and used this consistently applied compensation measure to identify our median employee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Once we identified our median employee, we combined all the elements of the median employee's  compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of regulation S-K, resulting in annual total compensation of $106,193.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the  "Total" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of the median employee was $106,193; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, was  $6,879,371.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee was 65 to 1. 
Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 
Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 
The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 8, 2019, the record date, by (i) each person or group who is known by us to be beneficial owner of 5% or more of our common stock, (ii) each of our directors and director nominees, (iii) each of our NEOs and (iv) our directors and executive officers as a group. 
Beneficial ownership of shares is determined under rules of the SEC and generally includes any shares over which a person exercises sole or shared voting or investment power. Except as indicated by footnote, we believe based on the information provided to us that each person and entity named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to all of the shares of our common stock shown as beneficially owned by such person or entity. Applicable percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 108,329,509 shares of common stock outstanding on the record date. Shares of common stock subject to options currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days after the record date are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding the options for the purpose of computing the percentage of beneficial ownership of that person and any group of which that person is a member, but are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage of beneficial ownership for any other person. Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each named person is c/o CyrusOne Inc., 2101 Cedar Springs Road, Suite 900, Dallas, Texas 75201.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
Indemnification of Officers and Directors 
We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers that provide for indemnification to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, under the Partnership Agreement, our Operating Partnership also indemnifies us, our directors, officers and employees, the general partner and its trustees, officers and employees, employees of the Operating Partnership and any other persons whom the general partner may designate from and against any and all claims arising from or that relate to the operations of the Operating Partnership in which any indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise unless: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• it is established that the act or omission of the indemnitee constituted fraud, intentional harm or  gross negligence on the part of the indemnitee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the claim is brought by the indemnitee (other than to enforce the indemnitee's rights to  indemnification or advance of expenses); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the indemnitee is found to be liable to the Operating Partnership, and then only with respect to each  such claim.  
[END TABLE]
Review and Approval of Transactions with Related Persons 
The Board of Directors has adopted a written policy for the review and approval of related person transactions. The policy provides that the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving or disapproving all interested transactions, meaning any transaction, arrangement or relationship in which (i) the amount involved may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, (ii) the Company will be a participant and (iii) a Related Party has a direct or indirect material interest. A "Related Party" means (i) any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year was, a director or executive officer of the Company or a nominee to become a director of the Company; (ii) any person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of the Company's voting securities; (iii) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons; and (iv) any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed or is a partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person has a 5% or greater beneficial ownership interest. An "immediate family member" of a Related Party means any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law of the Related Party, and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of such Related Party. Generally, a potential transaction that may be a Related Party Transaction is brought first to the General Counsel for review. If the General Counsel determines that a potential transaction involves a Related Party Transaction requiring approval under the policy or disclosure under Rule 404(a) of Regulation S-K, the transaction will be brought to the Audit Committee, which will review the transaction under several criteria, including but not limited to the Related Party's interest in the transaction, the benefits to the Company, the availability of commercial alternatives, and whether it is in the best interests of the Company to enter into the transaction. Subject to limited exceptions, the Audit Committee or the Chair of the Audit Committee must approve all Related Party Transactions. During 2018, there were no Related Party Transactions requiring review under the policy that were not so reviewed or disclosure under Rule 404(a) of Regulation S-K, except as disclosed below. 
A son-in-law of one of our directors, Michael A. Klayko, is employed by the Company as an Account Director in the Company's sales organization. The son-in-law is not an officer of the Company and his employment was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee of the Board pursuant to the Company's Policy on Related Party Transactions. The son-in-law's compensation for 2018 was approximately $126,000. 
Stockholder Proposals 
Stockholder Proposals 
Stockholder proposals intended to be included in our proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the 2020 annual meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act ("Rule 14a-8") must be received by us no later than November 16, 2019. Such proposals must comply with the requirements established by the SEC for such proposals. 
A stockholder who wishes to submit a business proposal at the 2020 annual meeting that is not intended to be included in our proxy statement and form of proxy or who wishes to nominate a director for election at the meeting must, in accordance with our current Bylaws, notify us between October 17, 2019, and 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on November 16, 2019. If the stockholder fails to give timely notice, the nominee or proposal will be excluded from consideration at the meeting. In addition, our current Bylaws include other requirements for nomination of candidates for director and proposals of other business with which a stockholder must comply to make a nomination or business proposal. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our common stock to file reports of ownership of, and changes in ownership of, our securities with the SEC, and to file copies of such reports with us. We believe that no director, executive officer or person who beneficially owns more than ten percent of our common stock failed to file, on a timely basis, the reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, except the withholding of shares for taxes upon the vesting of restricted stock awards on February 13, 2018 was reported on a late Form 4 filing for each of Messrs. Wojtaszek, Durvasula, Timmons and Jackson.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Why did I receive a Notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials  instead of a full set of proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  The Board of Directors is soliciting proxies to be voted at our 2019 Annual Meeting of  Stockholders. This year we have again elected to distribute proxy materials to many stockholders via the Internet under the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) "Notice and Access" rules. On or about March 15, 2019  we mailed a Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice") that contains information about our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and instructions on how to view all proxy materials online. Also included are instructions  on how to request a paper copy of the proxy materials.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who is entitled to vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  All common stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 8, 2019, the record  date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the annual meeting and any postponement or adjournment of the meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, 108,329,509 shares of our common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote. Each  share of common stock is entitled to one vote at the annual meeting. There is no cumulative voting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the quorum for the annual meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  A quorum at the annual meeting will consist of the presence, in person or by proxy, of stockholders  entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on any matter. No business may be conducted at the meeting if a quorum is not present, but the meeting may be adjourned to another date not more than 120 days after the original record  date without notice other than announcement at the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How do I vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company  N.A., ("Computershare"), you are the "stockholder of record" of those shares and you may authorize a proxy to vote your shares by following the instructions listed on the Notice of Internet Availability. If you received a proxy  card, please complete, date, sign and promptly return the proxy card in the self-addressed stamped envelope provided. You may also authorize your proxy to vote your shares by telephone as described on the proxy card. In addition, you can always come  to the meeting and vote your shares in person.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held through a broker, bank or other nominee (held in street name), you will receive instructions from such entity that you must follow in order to have your shares voted. Most brokers, banks and other holders of record allow you to submit voting instructions by mail, telephone and on the internet. If you want to vote in person, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee and bring it to the meeting, and submit it with your vote. 
Whichever method you select to transmit your instructions, the proxies will vote your shares in accordance with those instructions. If you sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors: for each director nominee, for ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm, and for the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation. 
Important: Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on the record date or their duly authorized proxy are entitled to attend the annual meeting and vote in person. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What am I voting on?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  The purpose of the annual meeting is to consider the following three proposals:   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 1: To elect eight directors, each to hold office until our 2020 annual meeting of  stockholders and until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualifies;  
[END TABLE]
General Information about the Meeting 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 2: To consider and vote upon, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's  named executive officers as described in this proxy statement ("Say-on-Pay"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 3: To consider and vote upon the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte &  Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
We are not aware of any matters to be presented at the annual meeting other than those described in this proxy statement. If any matters not described in this proxy statement are properly presented at the meeting, the person named in the accompanying proxy will vote all proxies in their discretion. If the meeting is postponed or adjourned, the proxies can vote your shares at the postponement or adjournment as well. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What vote is required to approve the proposals assuming that a quorum is present at the annual  meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Proposal 1: Election of Eight Directors: The election of the eight director nominees must be  approved by a plurality of the votes cast. However, as a condition to being nominated, each director nominee has agreed to offer to resign if he or she receives a greater number of votes "withheld" than votes "for" his or her  election.  
[END TABLE]
Proposal 2: Say-on-Pay: The approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter. 
Proposal 3: Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm: Ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter. 
If you hold your shares in street name, and you do not submit voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, your broker, bank or other nominee will not be permitted to vote your shares in their discretion on the election of directors or the advisory vote to approve executive compensation, but may still be permitted to vote your shares in their discretion on the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How are abstentions and broker non-votes treated?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Pursuant to Maryland law, abstentions and broker non-votes  are counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. However, broker non-votes and abstentions will have no impact on the outcome of any of the three proposals, as they are not counted  as votes cast. A broker non-vote is a vote that is not cast on a non-routine matter by a broker that is present (in person or by proxy) at the meeting because the shares  entitled to cast the vote are held in street name, the broker lacks discretionary authority to vote the shares and the broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who has paid for this proxy solicitation?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  We are providing these proxy materials in connection with the solicitation by the Company's  Board of Directors of proxies to be voted at our Annual Meeting. We will pay the cost of this proxy solicitation. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, we expect that a number of our employees will solicit stockholders personally,  electronically and by telephone. None of these employees will receive any additional compensation for doing this. We have retained Okapi Partners to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $9,500 plus reimbursement of expenses. We will,  on request, reimburse brokers, banks and other nominees for their expenses in sending proxy materials to their customers who are beneficial owners and obtaining their voting instructions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  May stockholders ask questions at the annual meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A  Yes. There will be time allotted at the end of the meeting when our representatives will answer  appropriate questions from the floor.  
[END TABLE]
General Information about the Meeting 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How many copies should I receive if I share an address with another stockholder?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as a broker, bank or other  nominee, to implement a delivery procedure called "householding". Under this procedure, multiple stockholders who reside at the same address may receive a single copy of our proxy materials, unless the affected stockholder has provided us  with contrary instructions. This procedure provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.  
[END TABLE]
Our Company and some brokers, banks or other nominees may be householding our proxy materials. A single set of our proxy materials, including the proxy statement and our annual report will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Separate proxy cards will be included for each stockholder at the address. Once you have received notice from your broker, bank or other nominee that it will be householding communications to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If you did not respond that you did not want to participate in householding, you were deemed to have consented to the process. Stockholders of record may revoke their consent at any time by contacting Robert M. Jackson, Executive Vice President, General Counsel & Secretary, either by calling toll-free (855) 564-3198 or by writing to 2101 Cedar Springs Road, Suite 900, Dallas, Texas 75201, Attention: Corporate Secretary. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you should contact your holder of record to revoke your consent. 
Upon written or oral request, we will promptly deliver a separate copy of our proxy materials to any stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of any of those documents was delivered. To receive a separate copy of the proxy materials, you may either call (855) 564-3198 or send a written request to CyrusOne Inc., 2101 Cedar Springs Road, Suite 900, Dallas, Texas 75201, Attention: Corporate Secretary. In addition, if you are receiving multiple copies of our proxy materials, you can request householding by contacting our secretary in the same manner. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  It means that you have multiple accounts with our transfer agent or with brokers. Please submit all  of your proxies over the internet, following the instructions provided on your proxy cards, by mail or by telephone to ensure that all of your shares are voted.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I change my vote after I have voted?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you hold your shares in street name, you must follow the instructions of your broker, bank or  other nominee to revoke your voting instructions. If you are a holder of record and wish to revoke your proxy instructions, you must deliver later-dated proxy instructions, advise the Corporate Secretary in writing before the proxies vote your  shares at the meeting, or attend the meeting and vote your shares in person.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I find additional information on the Company's website?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Yes. Our website is located at www.cyrusone.com. Although the information contained on our  website is not part of this proxy statement, you can view additional information on the website, such as our corporate governance guidelines, our code of business conduct and ethics, charters of our Board committees and reports that we file with the  SEC. A copy of our corporate governance guidelines, our code of business conduct and ethics and each of the charters of our Board committees may also be obtained by writing to CyrusOne Inc., 2101 Cedar Springs Road, Suite 900, Dallas, Texas 75201,  Attention: Corporate Secretary.

Appendix A 
Appendix A – Non-Gaap Financial Measures 
Definitions 
Funds From Operations ("FFO") 
We calculate FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP before real estate depreciation and amortization and asset impairments and loss on disposal. While it is consistent with the definition of FFO promulgated by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), our computation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other REITs. Accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to others. 
Normalized FFO ("NFFO") 
We calculate Normalized FFO as FFO plus loss on early extinguishment of debt; unrealized (gain) loss on marketable equity investment; new accounting standards and regulatory compliance and the related system implementation costs; amortization of trade names; transaction, acquisition and other integration expenses; severance and management transition costs; legal claim costs and other special items as appropriate. The Company believes its Normalized FFO calculation provides a comparable measure between different periods. Other REITs may not calculate Normalized FFO in the same manner. Accordingly, our Normalized FFO may not be comparable to others. 
Return on Assets ("ROA") 
ROA is defined as 1) net operating income from properties (fourth quarter revenues less property operating expenses annualized) for the performance evaluation period, divided by 2) total gross investment in real estate less construction in progress on the Company's balance sheet for the last day of the fiscal year. The Compensation Committee exercised discretion and determined to adjust the ROA calculation for the 2016 Awards to exclude acquisitions, including the acquisition of Zenium.
