In 2018, PROS reached new milestones in our cloud transformation efforts, while continuing to enable our customers to leverage our AI-powered solutions that optimize selling in the digital economy.  The following highlights some of our accomplishments in 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continued substantial growth: 
• Subscription revenue increased 57% year-over-year, Recurring Revenue (Subscription + Maintenance Revenue) grew 23% year-over-year, Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) (1) grew 18% year-over-year, and total revenue grew 17% year-over-year and surpassed pre-cloud transition total revenue in less than four years;  
• Cash flow provided by operating activities improved over $30.0 million year-over-year, and Free Cash Flow(2) improved $29.0 million year-over-year; 
• Total shareholder return grew 19% during 2018, and cumulatively grew 59% from the end of 2017 through March 15, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continued to innovate to deliver our solutions faster and with higher gross margins, which in turn drove higher accessibility and faster sales cycles for new customers; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Successfully maintained ISO27001, SOC2 and CSA security certifications, underscoring our commitment to customers by achieving the industry's most rigorous requirements for cloud security and data privacy, governance, and compliance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Enhanced capital structure and strengthened our balance sheet by completing a follow-on public offering of 4,370,000 primary shares of common stock generating $142 million in net proceeds; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Further strengthened our executive team to help us continue scaling our business. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) Annual Recurring Revenue ("ARR") is used to assess the trajectory of our cloud business. ARR means, as of a specified date, the contracted recurring revenue, including contracts with a future start date, together with annualized overage fees incurred above contracted minimum transactions, and excluding perpetual and term license agreements recognized as license revenue in accordance with GAAP. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and any other GAAP measure. 
(2) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less capital expenditures (excluding expenditures for PROS new headquarters), purchases of other (non-acquisition-related) intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software development costs. 
[END TABLE]
 CEO Pay and Company Performance
In 2018, we continued to successfully execute our multi-year cloud transition, delivering subscription revenue growth of over 50% for the second consecutive fiscal year.  Our performance (based on our subscription revenue, ARR, recurring revenue, and stock price) was as follows:

[END TABLE]
CEO pay was set conservatively, just slightly above expected peer CEO median target compensation levels.  This was despite the Company's strong financial performance and 23% total shareholder return in 2017.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation & Leadership Development (CLD) Committee is pleased with the Company's performance and set target pay in line with competitive market practice of similar peer companies to ensure we retain and reward our CEO for continued strong performance going forward.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Growth in shareholder return has outpaced growth in our CEO's target pay. Our CEO's 2018 base salary and target cash incentive remained unchanged from 2017 levels, which is the fourth year in a row with no CEO salary or target cash incentive increase. Our CEO's total target compensation, including base salary, target cash incentive and target value of long-term equity compensation, was set near the median pay level of our peer CEOs that was expected for 2018, which proved true when reviewing peer CEO compensation levels later in 2018.   
[END TABLE]
 (1) Target equity compensation (a) for RSUs and MSUs represents total target equity compensation determined by the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee divided by the closing price of the Company's Common Stock reported by the NYSE on the grant date, and differs from the accounting grant date fair value included in the "Grants of Plan Based Awards" table on page 39 of this Proxy Statement; and (b) for PRSUs represents the accounting grant date fair value. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our CEO's pay continues to be >50% directly "performance-based" (including annual cash incentive and performance-based equity) and >90% at risk (including time-based RSUs). 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We set aggressive performance-based goals, with higher target top line growth required to achieve target payout and significantly higher minimum top line growth required to achieve any payout when compared to our peers' historical averages.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The 2018 annual cash incentive plan resulted in our CEO attaining 138.5% of his annual cash incentive target based strictly on formulaic results vs. predefined targets, with no discretion applied to the outcome. 
[END TABLE]
 CEO 2018 Target Compensation
For 2018, our CLD Committee decided to leave Mr. Reiner's base salary and cash incentive target unchanged from 2017, the third year in a row without an increase in target cash compensation.  Consistent with the median of our peer group compensation, the CLD Committee decided to increase Mr. Reiner's performance-based pay in the form of equity-based compensation due to Mr. Reiner's impact on the Company's successful operational and financial progress on our cloud transition.  As a result, Mr. Reiner's total target compensation increased 9% in 2018-- less than our total shareholder return of 19% in 2018 and 59% cumulative total shareholder return for 2018 through March 15, 2019.
CEO Year-End Compensation Decisions 2019 v. 2018
             For 2019, the CLD Committee decided to leave Mr. Reiner's base salary and cash incentive target unchanged from 2018, the fourth year in a row without an increase in target cash compensation.  Consistent with the median of our peer group, the CLD Committee decided to increase Mr. Reiner's performance-based pay in the form of equity-based compensation due to Mr. Reiner's continued impact on the Company's successful operational and financial progress on our cloud transition and the 19% growth in shareholder return in 2018.

2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
MAY 7, 2019
General
The enclosed proxy is solicited for use at the Annual Meeting to be held May 7, 2019 at 8:00 a.m., local time, at 3100 Main Street, 9th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, for the purposes set forth herein and in the accompanying Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
The purposes of the Annual Meeting are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1 To elect two Class III directors to the Board of Directors, each to serve for a three-year term until the 2022 Annual Meeting; 
2 To conduct an advisory vote on executive compensation; 
3 To approve proposed amendments to 2017 Equity Incentive Plan; 
4 To ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; and 
5 To transact such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment thereof. 
[END TABLE]
Record Date and Shares Outstanding
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, 37,684,301 shares of Common Stock were outstanding. Each stockholder of record as of the Record Date is entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held by such stockholder.
Attending the Annual Meeting
The Annual Meeting will be held at 8:00 a.m., local time, on Tuesday, May 7, 2019, at 3100 Main Street, 9th Floor, Houston, Texas 77002. When you arrive, the receptionist will direct you to the meeting room. Please note that the doors to the meeting room will not be open until 7:50 a.m. You do not need to attend the Annual Meeting to vote. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please submit your vote in advance as instructed below.
Vote Required
If a quorum is present, a plurality vote of the holders of our Common Stock entitled to vote and present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting is required for the election of a director.  This "plurality" standard means the nominees who receive the largest number of "for" votes cast are elected as directors. Thus, the number of shares not voted for the election of a nominee (and the number of "withhold" votes cast with respect to that nominee) will not affect the determination of whether that nominee has received the necessary votes for election under Delaware law. However, the number of "withhold" votes with respect to a nominee will affect whether our Director Resignation Policy will apply to that individual. Our Director Resignation Policy provides that any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" such election is required to offer his or her resignation following certification of the stockholder vote. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would then consider the offer of resignation and make a recommendation to our independent directors as to the action to be taken with respect to the offer. This policy does not apply in contested elections.  The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting is required to approve the ratification of the selection of our independent auditors and the advisory vote on executive compensation. We will not count abstentions as either for or against a director, so abstentions have no effect on the election of a director. A properly executed proxy marked "abstain" with respect to any matter is considered entitled to vote, and thus, will have the effect of a vote against a matter, except for the election of directors.
Our bylaws provide that a majority of the outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote, whether present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Votes for and against, abstentions and "broker non-votes" (shares held by a broker or nominee that does not have the authority, either express or discretionary, to vote on a particular matter) will each be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
Voting Instructions
Stockholders have four ways to votes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Online. You may vote online by visiting www.proxyvote.com, and entering the control number found in your proxy card. You can vote via the Internet up until 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time on May 6, 2019.  
• Telephone. You may vote by calling the toll-free number provided on your proxy card, and following the instructions found on your proxy card. You can vote via the telephone up until 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time on May 6, 2019.  
• Mail. If you received a printed copy of the proxy card, you may vote by filling out the card and returning it in the postage-paid envelope provided. Please promptly mail your proxy card to ensure that it is received prior to the closing of the polls at the Annual Meeting.  
• In Person.  You may vote in person at the Annual Meeting, and any previous votes that you submitted, whether by Internet, telephone or mail, will be superseded by the vote that you cast at the Annual Meeting. 
[END TABLE]
If you are a beneficial owner, or you hold your shares in "street name," please check your voting instruction card or contact your bank, broker or nominee to determine whether you will be able to vote by Internet or telephone.  Even if you plan on attending the Annual Meeting in person, we encourage you to vote in advance via the Internet, by phone, or by mail to ensure that your vote will be represented at the Annual Meeting.
Changing your Vote
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Online.  Using the online voting method described above, in which case only your latest internet proxy submitted prior to the Annual Meeting will be counted. 
• By Phone. Using the telephone voting method described above, in which case only your latest telephone proxy submitted prior to the Annual Meeting will be counted. 
• In Person.  By attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. However, attendance at the Annual Meeting will not in and of itself revoke your proxy unless you properly vote at the Annual Meeting or specifically request that your prior proxy be revoked by delivering a written notice of revocation prior to the Annual Meeting to our Corporate Secretary at or before the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting. 
• Mail. By signing and returning a new proxy card dated as of a later date, in which case only your latest proxy card or voting instruction form received prior to the Annual Meeting will be counted. 
[END TABLE]
Any written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be delivered to PROS Holdings, Inc. at 3100 Main Street, Suite 900, Houston, Texas 77002, Attention: Corporate Secretary, or hand-delivered to our Corporate Secretary before the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting.
Effect of Not Casting Your Vote
Banks, brokers and other intermediaries may not vote shares held in their clients' accounts on elections of directors and other "non-routine" matters unless the client has provided voting instructions.  If you hold your shares in street name, you must cast your vote if you want it to count for purposes of Proposals One, Two, and Three. Proxy Materials are Available on the Internet
We use the internet as the primary means of furnishing proxy materials to our stockholders.  We are mailing to our stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (Notice) that contains instructions on how to access our proxy materials over the Internet, as well as how to request a paper copy of our proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement, our 2018 Annual Report and a form of proxy card or voting instruction card. The Notice was first mailed and those documents were first made available on or about March 25, 2019 to stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. We encourage stockholders to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials on the internet.
Eliminating Duplicate Mailings
Some banks, brokers and other nominee record holders participate in the practice of "householding", which helps reduces the environmental impact of our annual meetings and reduces our printing and mailing costs, by sending only one copy of the Notice and Proxy Statement to multiple stockholders sharing the same address.  If you would prefer to receive separate copies of a proxy statement, please contact our Corporate Secretary by calling 713-335-5151 or by writing to us at 3100 Main Street, Suite 900, Houston, Texas 77002.  In addition, stockholders sharing an address and receiving multiple copies can request delivery of a single copy of proxy statements upon written request to our Corporate Secretary at the address stated above.  
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Role of the Board of Directors
Our Board of Directors (Board) oversees our CEO and other senior management on a day-to-day basis to assure that the long-term interests of shareholders are being served. Our Board currently consists of eight members, divided into three classes, with each class serving for a staggered three-year term. The term of office of one class of directors expires each year in rotation so that one class is elected at each annual meeting for a full three-year term. 
Our Board has adopted formal Corporate Governance Guidelines to ensure that it has the necessary authority and practices in place to review and evaluate our business operations as needed, to make decisions that are independent of our management, and to align the interests of directors and management with the interests of our stockholders. Our key governance documents, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines, are available under the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.pros.com.
Our Board met four times and acted via unanimous written consent three times, the Audit Committee met ten times, the CLD Committee met six times and acted via unanimous written consent three times, and the NCG Committee met three times. Each current director who served as a director in 2018 attended each meeting of our Board and the Committees on which he or she served during 2018.  The Board encourages all directors to attend annual meetings of the stockholders. All incumbent directors attended the 2018 meeting of the stockholders.
Board Committees
The Board has standing Audit, Compensation and Leadership Development (CLD) and Nominating and Corporate Governance (NCG) Committees.  Each Committee has a written charter, which can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.pros.com.  Our Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee qualifies as an Audit Committee financial expert within the meaning of the SEC regulations and the rules of the NYSE. Each member of our CLD Committee is a non-employee director, as defined in Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), and an outside director, as defined pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). 
Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee assist the Board in oversight and monitoring of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of our financial statements: 
• our independent auditors, including their qualifications, engagement, performance and independence; 
• the results of the annual audit and the independent auditor's review of our annual and quarterly financial statements and reports, including discussions with independent auditors without management present; 
• press releases regarding our financial results and any other financial information and earnings guidance provided; 
• matters that have a significant impact on our financial statements; 
• the scope, adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; 
• procedures for complaints for employees to submit concerns anonymously about questionable accounting, internal control or auditing matters; and 
• all material related party transactions that require disclosure. 
[END TABLE]
Compensation and Leadership Development Committee.  The CLD Committee discharges the responsibilities of our Board relating to the compensation and benefits for our executive officers and directors, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing and approving the compensation arrangements for our executive officers and directors; 
• reviewing and approving corporate performance goals and objectives relevant to such compensation; 
• administering our equity incentive plans; 
• reviewing our compensation discussion and analysis and CLD Committee report required by the rules of the SEC;  
• engage with a third party independent advisor to assist in evaluating our executive compensation program. 
• providing oversight on the overall leadership development program throughout the Company; and 
• overseeing succession planning for executive officers jointly with the NCG Committee. 
[END TABLE]
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  The NCG Committee assist the Board in: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• identifying qualified candidates to become directors and considering the nomination of our incumbent directors for reelection; 
• evaluating stockholder nominations of candidates for election to our Board; 
• reviewing our general policy relating to selection of director candidates and members of committees of our Board, including an assessment of the performance of our Board; and 
• reviewing and making recommendations to our Board regarding corporate governance principles and policies. 
[END TABLE]
Independence
The Board has determined that the following directors have no relationships with us that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director, and as such are "independent" under NYSE listing standards and federal securities laws as of December 31, 2018: Messrs. Petersen, Rechan, Russell, Williams, and Woestemeyer and Mss. Herscher and Woestemeyer.  Our Board previously determined that Ellen Keszler was an independent director prior to her retirement from our Board in at our 2018 annual meeting. Our Audit, CLD and NGC Committees are comprised entirely of independent directors.
Independent Non-Executive Chairman
The Board is led by our independent non-executive chairman, Mr. Russell. The Board's current preferred governance structure is to have an independent director serve as chairman. We believe the current structure provides strong leadership for our Board, while also positioning our Chief Executive Officer as the leader of the Company. We believe that our current structure helps ensure independent oversight over the Company, while allowing our Chief Executive Officer to focus on management of the Company.  As our non-executive chairman, among other responsibilities, Mr. Russell oversees the planning of the annual Board calendar, and, with the Chief Executive Officer, in consultation with the other directors, schedules and sets the agenda for meetings of the Board and leads the discussion at such meetings, serves as a liaison between the CEO and the independent directors, and performs such additional duties and responsibilities as requested by the Board from time to time. 
Executive Sessions
Executive sessions of the independent directors of the Board are scheduled during each regularly scheduled in-person Board meeting.  These executive sessions are led by our non-executive chairman of the Board. Our non-executive chairman of the Board provides feedback to our CEO, as needed, promptly after the executive session. 
Risk Oversight
The Board oversees our risk management process. Management reviews the process, including identification of key risks and steps taken to address them, with the full Board at least on an annual basis. The Audit Committee, the CLD Committee, and the NGC Committee assist the Board in discharging its oversight duties. The CLD Committee reviews risks related to the subject matters enumerated in its charter, including risks associated with our compensation programs. The NGC Committee considers risks related to the subject matters for which it is responsible as identified in its charter, including risks associated with corporate governance. Similarly, the Audit Committee considers risks related to the subject matters enumerated in its charter, including risks relating to internal controls, disclosure, and financial reporting.  Accordingly, while each of the three committees contributes to the risk management oversight function by assisting the Board in the manner outlined above, the Board remains responsible for the oversight of our risk management program. Director Nomination
The NCG Committee has the responsibility for establishing the criteria for recommending which directors should stand for reelection to our Board and the selection of new directors to serve on our Board. In addition, the NCG Committee is responsible for establishing the procedures for our stockholders to nominate candidates to our Board. Although the NCG Committee has not formulated any specific minimum qualifications for director candidates, it has determined that desirable characteristics include, but are not limited to, business experience, mature judgment, personal and professional ethics, and integrity. The Company does not have a formal policy with respect to consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees; however, in the process of selecting a director nominee, the NCG Committee assesses backgrounds, diversity and expected contributions of the individuals to the Board. 
Our bylaws permit any stockholder of record to nominate directors. Stockholders who wish to submit nominees for election at an annual or special meeting of stockholders should follow the procedure described in the "Stockholder Proposals" section on page 60 of this Proxy Statement. The NCG Committee applies the same standards in considering candidates submitted by stockholders as it does in evaluating candidates submitted by members of the Board.
Director Resignation Policy
Our Board has adopted a director resignation policy.  Under this policy in an uncontested election of directors, any nominee who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" such election must promptly tender his or her resignation to the NCG Committee.     The NCG Committee will promptly consider all relevant factors including, without limitation, (a) the stated reasons why votes were withheld from such director; (b) any alternatives for curing the underlying cause of the withheld votes; (c) the tenure and qualifications of the director; (d) the director's past and expected future contributions to the Company; (e) our director criteria; (f) our Corporate Governance Guidelines; and (g) the overall composition of the Board, including whether accepting the resignation would cause the Company to fail to meet any applicable SEC or NYSE requirement. The NCG Committee will recommend to the qualified independent directors the action to be taken with respect to such offered resignation, and the qualified independent directors will act on the NCG Committee's recommendation no later than 90 days following the date of the stockholders' meeting in which the election occurred. If a majority of the members of the NCG Committee received a greater number of votes "withheld" from their election than votes "for" their election at the same election, then the remaining qualified independent directors on the Board will consider the matter directly or may appoint a committee of the Board amongst themselves solely for the purpose of considering the tendered resignations that will make the recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject them. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines
Our Board has adopted stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs and directors that are designed to align our NEOs' and directors' interests with our stockholders' interests by promoting long-term share ownership, which reduces the incentive for excessive short-term risk taking and further increase our NEOs' and directors' alignment with stockholder interests. These guidelines require our Chief Executive Officer to hold shares of our stock worth six times his annual salary, other NEOs to hold shares of our stock worth two times their annual salary, and each non-employee director to hold shares of our stock worth five times the director's annual retainer. Our NEOs and directors are expected to achieve their ownership thresholds within five years after joining our Board and/or being appointed as a NEO. As of December 31, 2018, each of our NEOs and directors were in compliance with the applicable guidelines.
Prohibition Against Hedging, Short-Sale, Pledging, and Repricing Underwater Stock Options
We have implemented both anti-hedging and anti-pledging policies, as well as a prohibition on participating in short sales of our stock, to ensure that our executives' stock remains at-risk.  Our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (2017 Plan) also prohibits repricing, repurchase or exchange of underwater stock options without stockholder approval.
Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
No member of our Compensation and Leadership Development Committee and none of our executive officers has any relationships that would constitute an interlocking relationship with executive officers and directors of any other entity.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
Our Board has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our directors and employees.  Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available under Investor Relations section of our website at ir.pros.com. Communication with Our Board

PROPOSAL ONE
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
What am I voting on?
Stockholders are being asked to elect two Class III director nominees to the Board for a three-year term.
Voting Recommendation:
The Board recommends voting "FOR" the election of each of the two Class III director nominees. 
Two (2) directors are to be elected at the Annual Meeting.  Our Board, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, has nominated Andres D. Reiner and Ronald F. Woestemeyer as Class III directors, each to hold office until the 2022 Annual Meeting and until their successor has been duly elected and qualified or until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal.
The Board is also composed of three Class I directors, whose terms expire upon the election and qualification of directors at the annual meeting of our stockholders to be held in 2020, and three Class II directors, whose terms expire upon the election and qualification of directors at the annual meeting of our stockholders to be held in 2021.
The Board knows of no reason why any of the nominees would be unable or unwilling to serve, but if any nominee should for any reason be unable or unwilling to serve, the proxies will be voted for the election of such other person for the office of director as the Board may recommend in the place of such nominee. Unless otherwise instructed, the proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them for the nominees named below.

Directors are elected by a plurality vote of the votes cast by holders of our Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not have any effect on this proposal.  Accordingly, the two nominees who receive the highest number of properly executed "FOR" votes from the holders of Common Stock will be elected as directors. 
In accordance with Delaware law, abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining both whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting and the total number of shares represented and voting on this proposal. While broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum, broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of shares represented and voting with respect to the particular proposal on which the broker has expressly not voted and, accordingly, will not affect the approval of this proposal.
The number of "withhold" votes with respect to a nominee will affect whether our Director Resignation Policy will apply to that individual. In accordance with our Director Resignation Policy, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" such election is required to offer his or her resignation following certification of the stockholder vote. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board would then consider whether to accept the resignation and make a recommendation to our independent directors as to the action to be taken with respect to the offer. For more information about this policy, see "Corporate Governance - Director Resignation Policy."
The NYSE broker discretionary rules prohibit banks, brokers and other intermediaries from voting shares held in their clients' accounts on elections of directors unless the client has provided voting instructions. Therefore, if you hold your shares in street name, it is important that you cast your vote if you want it to count in the election of directors.
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS VOTING "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE THREE CLASS II DIRECTOR NOMINEES.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
In this section, we describe the executive compensation program for our NEOs. We also explain how our Compensation and Leadership Development (CLD) Committee determined the pay of our NEOs and its rationale for specific decisions in 2018. Our NEOs for 2018 were:

2018 Business Highlights
In 2018, we continued to successfully execute on our multi-year cloud transition, growing subscription revenue 57% and total revenue 17%, and driving 59% total shareholder return cumulatively in 2018 and 2019 through March 15, 2019.  Despite this strong performance, we set our CEO's target pay only near peer median pay levels while using a highly performance-based compensation program with rigorous goals. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continued to successfully execute on the multi-year strategy we set when announcing our cloud transition in 2015. To date, the Company has met or exceeded our communicated cloud transition goals, including achieving numerous financial milestones faster than almost every other on-premise software company that has similarly transitioned to a recurring cloud business:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Delivered strong growth and rapid transformation of our business to the cloud. Our results reflected further success in executing on our cloud transition, with year-over-year growth of 57% in subscription revenue, 18% in ARR, and 23% in Recurring Revenue, while also improving Recurring Revenue Gross Margin.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) ARR is used to assess the trajectory of our cloud business. ARR means, as of a specified date, the contracted recurring revenue, including contracts with a future start date, together with annualized overage fees incurred above contracted minimum transactions, and excluding perpetual and term license agreements recognized as license revenue in accordance with GAAP. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and any other GAAP measure. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In connection with our cloud transformation our stock price continued to increase in 2018.  Shareholders benefited from a 19% increase in our share price in 2018 and a cumulative 59% increase from the end of 2017 through March 15, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
2018 Compensation Highlights
In order to promote retention and properly incentivize our NEOs, the CLD Committee focused on a best practices, competitive compensation program as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• CEO target pay was set conservatively, increasing 9% for 2018, and remains near peer median pay levels.  This was despite the Company's strong financial performance and 23% total shareholder return in 2017 levels.  Despite the Company's successful cloud transition and >20% shareholder return in 2017, for 2018 our CEO's base salary and target cash incentive remained unchanged from 2017, and his target equity compensation1 increased to $4.3 million in 2018 from $3.9 million in 2017 to increase target total compensation to the expected 2018 peer median and recognize our >20% shareholder return in 2017. Our CEO's total target pay, including base salary and target cash incentive and the target value of long-term equity compensation, was set near the expected median of our 2018 peer group, and this expected median was later confirmed to be an accurate forecast. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) Target equity compensation (a) for RSUs and MSUs represents total target equity compensation determined by the CLD Committee divided by the closing price of the Company's Common Stock reported by the NYSE on the grant date, and differs from the accounting grant date fair value included in the "Grants of Plan Based Awards" table on page 39 of this Proxy Statement; and (b) for 2016 Stock Price PRSUs represents the accounting grant date fair value. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continued emphasis on pay-for-performance.  In 2018, our CLD Committee again sought to motivate our NEOs through predominantly "performance-based" cash and equity awards.  The majority of our CEO's 2018 target total compensation was directly performance-based, including annual cash incentives tied to pre-established performance targets and MSU equity awards which vary based on the relative performance of our stock compared to the Index over a three-year performance measurement period.  Including RSU equity awards, which increase in value based on share price appreciation, >90% of our CEO's 2018 total target compensation is considered at risk.

(1) Target equity compensation for RSUs and MSUs represents total target equity compensation determined by the CLD Committee divided by the closing price of the Company's Common Stock reported by the NYSE on the grant date, and differs from the accounting grant date fair value included in the "Grants of Plan Based Awards" table on page 39 of this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We set aggressive, performance-based and formulaic 2018 goals based on predefined targets with no discretion.  Performance goals that determine annual cash incentive attainment were set aggressively in 2018 with above median performance expectations compared to our peer group. For example, in 2018, our primary growth-oriented performance metric was ARR, and the ARR goal required 19% growth over 2017 to earn a target level award. This was higher than the approximately 17% average top line growth required to achieve target level incentive compensation by our peer CEOs for 2017. Additionally, the threshold for any incentive payment to be earned in 2018 required at least 14% growth over 2017, much higher than the peer average minimum threshold 5% growth required for our peer CEOs to earn any incentive in 2017. The 2018 annual results compared to the cash incentive plan goals resulted in our CEO earning 138.5% of his annual cash incentive target based on formulaic results vs. the original rigorous goals, with no discretion applied. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Say-on-Pay Vote.    Each year, our CLD Committee takes into account the result of the say-on-pay vote cast by our stockholders. At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders had the opportunity to provide an advisory vote on the compensation paid to our NEOs, or a "say-on-pay" vote.  More than 85% of the total votes cast were voted in favor of our say-on-pay proposal. As a result, the CLD Committee believes that the results of our say-on-pay vote affirmed stockholder support of our updated approach to executive compensation, following 61% support in the 2017 stockholder vote.  While say-on-pay is a key indicator of stockholder sentiment, we also keep an open dialogue with our institutional investors and stockholders throughout the year. We reach out to discuss business topics, seek feedback on our performance and address other matters of importance to our stockholders, such as executive compensation. During 2018, we have actively engaged with a significant majority of our shares outstanding.  As a result of this ongoing outreach, the Committee further reevaluated our executive compensation program and made several changes to our pay program for 2019. The following table summarizes our shareholders' feedback and the Committee's resulting decisions: 
What We Heard   What We Did 
ü Mixed level of concern on CEO pay levels.   ü Updated our peer group to ensure an accurate comparison of peer executive compensation practices and pay levels, with CEO 2018 target compensation near the median of the updated peer group. 
      ü Set CEO 2019 target compensation near the expected median of our updated peer group. 
      ü Continued to set pay based on performance through our bonus plan and equity grants tied to our operational performance. 
      ü Continued to set aggressive goals for cash incentive attainment at the beginning of each year tied to our strategic plan.  For example, in 2018, our primary growth-oriented performance metric was ARR, and this goal required 12% more growth to earn a target award than the approximate 17% median top line growth required for target level pay by our peers during 2017. 
      ü Increased required CEO stock ownership to 6 times annual salary. 
ü Strong support for linking performance-based equity to internal operating measures.   ü Revised the structure of our 2019 performance-based equity grants from performance relative to the Russell 2000 Index, to performance relative to preset internal operating measures which reflect the success of our cloud transition, and aligns with shareholder interests.  
ü  Desire for our performance-based goals to be tied to a successful cloud transition.    ü Updated our annual cash incentive performance measures from ARR1, total revenue, and Free Cash Flow2 in 2018 to total revenue and Recurring Revenue Gross Margin in 2019 to ensure focus on the primary measures of top line growth and overall health of our cloud business.   
ü  Desire for our performance-based goals to be tied to a successful cloud transition.    ü Updated our annual cash incentive performance measures from ARR1, total revenue, and Free Cash Flow2 in 2018 to total revenue and Recurring Revenue Gross Margin in 2019 to ensure focus on the primary measures of top line growth and overall health of our cloud business.   
      ü Changed our performance-based equity compensation to incentivize growth in Recurring Revenue, our primary measure of growth for our cloud business.   
What We Do   What We Do Not Do 
ü Emphasize pay-for-performance where compensation is contingent upon the performance of our business, our stock price and individual performance   ü No hedging or pledging of Company stock, including short sales 
ü Utilize performance-based pay through equity and cash incentive awards that require achievement of pre-established goals with no discretion   ü No excessive perquisites 
ü Maintain "double trigger" change in control agreements   ü No pensions 
ü Maintain a clawback policy   ü No discount from fair market value in setting exercise price of stock options and stock appreciation rights 
ü CLD Committee oversees risks associated with compensation policies and practices   ü No repricing underwater stock options or stock appreciation rights without stockholder approval 
ü CLD Committee retains an independent compensation consultant   ü No equity vesting within less than one year after grant, except for up to 5% of the authorized shares 
ü Expect our CEO to hold stock equal to six times his base salary       
ü Expect each other NEO to hold stock equal to two times their base salary

 Our Compensation Philosophy 
Our executive compensation program is designed to reward achievement of specific corporate goals, align our executives' interests with those of our stockholders by rewarding performance that meets or exceeds established goals, reward superior performance and to achieve the following overall objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Objective   Rationale 
Competitive pay   Enable the Company to attract and retain high-caliber talent by setting compensation competitive with that being offered to individuals holding comparable positions at other public companies with which we compete for business and talent.  The Company does not target a specific percentile and reviews market data to check that compensation is generally in a market range and reflects the individual's experience, performance, and contribution. 
Pay for performance   Provide a compensation package that is weighted heavily towards performance-based pay to motivate high performance among our NEOs, with compensation levels reflecting the achievement of short- and long-term performance objectives 
Align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders   Directly link rewards to the achievement of measurable financial objectives that build long-term stockholder value 
[END TABLE]
2019 Compensation Highlights
Our CLD Committee chose to make the changes set forth below to our NEOs' compensation for 2019 after reviewing each leader's tenure and salary history with us, the Company's and each leader's 2018 performance, the compensation practices from our updated peer group, each leader's compensation relative to our updated peer group, and the feedback from shareholder engagement throughout 2018.
Andres Reiner, President and Chief Executive Officer 
Mr. Reiner joined the Company in 1999 and has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer since 2010.  Mr. Reiner again successfully steered the Company through an accelerated transition to the cloud in 2018. Based on the Company's strong performance in 2018, and shareholder return of 19% in 2018, the CLD Committee increased Mr. Reiner's target pay by 6% to remain in line with the median of our updated peer group. For the fourth year in a row, the CLD Committee did not change Mr. Reiner's base salary and cash incentive target for 2019. The Committee instead increased Mr. Reiner's performance-based equity compensation, from $4.3 million in 2018 to $4.65 million in 2019, consistent with the median target equity compensation for our peer CEOs. This decision was based on Mr. Reiner's continued impact on the Company's successful operational and financial progress on our cloud transition and the resulting growth in shareholder return since the start of 2016.  Together these decisions resulted in Mr. Reiner's total target compensation approximating the median of peer compensation for 2019, although the target incentive and 50% of the equity award will be forfeited if performance at the end of the performance period does not meet the minimum required performance levels.

[END TABLE]
The responsibility for establishing, administering and interpreting our policies governing the compensation and benefits for our NEOs, as well as granting any share-based awards to our NEOs, lies with our CLD Committee, which consists entirely of non-employee directors. Our CLD Committee has taken the following steps to ensure that our executive compensation and benefit policies are consistent with both our compensation philosophy and our Corporate Governance Guidelines:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• solicited recommendations from an independent executive compensation consultant to evaluate our executive compensation practices and assisted in developing and implementing the executive compensation programs; 
• established a practice, in accordance with the rules of the NYSE, of reviewing the performance and determining the compensation earned, paid or awarded to our Chief Executive Officer;  
• established a policy, in accordance with the rules of the NYSE, to review on an annual basis the performance of our other executive officers with assistance from our Chief Executive Officer and determined what we believe to be appropriate total compensation for these executive officers; and 
• our CLD Committee members attended continuing education related to compensation best practices provided by NYSE, NACD, and Equilar, among others. 
[END TABLE]
Our CLD Committee considers a broad range of facts and circumstances in setting executive compensation.  Among the factors considered for our executives generally in 2018, and for the NEOs in particular, are recommendations from our compensation consulting firm, Frederic W. Cook & Co. (FW Cook), advice from our Chief Executive Officer, general economic and market conditions, our financial condition and operating results, our operating plan, our geographic location and the objectives of our executive compensation policies described above. The weight given to each factor differs from year to year and may differ among individual NEOs in any given year.
Our CLD Committee establishes executive compensation programs that the CLD Committee believes, based on the members' experience, is the most appropriate to achieve the goals described above. Our CLD Committee continues to evaluate our executive compensation programs on a quantitative and qualitative basis on at least a yearly basis or more frequently if circumstances dictate. Our CLD Committee expects to make new awards and adjustments to our executive compensation programs as appropriate.
Role of Management
During 2018, Mr. Reiner reviewed the performance and compensation of the NEOs, other than himself, and made recommendations as to their compensation to the CLD Committee. In making its decisions regarding executive compensation, the CLD Committee meets outside the presence of executive officers when making final decisions about each executive officer. The Chief Executive Officer is periodically present during portions of these deliberations that relate to the compensation for other executive officers. In addition, for share-based grants to employees who are not NEOs, the CLD Committee has delegated to the Chief Executive Officer the authority to make share-based awards within certain limitations on aggregate grants and specific award terms. Role of Our Independent Compensation Consultant
The CLD Committee retained FW Cook to advise the CLD Committee on executive compensation matters for 2018 due to the breadth and depth of FW Cook's experience with executive compensation matters and their particular expertise in the software industry. During 2018, FW Cook advised the CLD Committee on a variety of subjects such as compensation plan design and trends, pay for performance analytics, benchmarking norms, executive compensation best practices, and other related matters.  FW Cook reports directly to the Committee, participates in meetings as requested and communicates with the CLD Committee Chair between meetings as necessary. FW Cook has served as our independent compensation consultant since 2017.  
Prior to engaging FW Cook, the CLD Committee reviewed FW Cook's qualifications, as well as their independence and any potential conflicts of interest. The CLD Committee has the sole authority to modify or approve the compensation for FW Cook, determine the nature and scope of their services, evaluate their performance, and terminate their engagement and hire replacement or additional consultants at any time.  FW Cook did not perform any services for us in 2018 other than as serving as advisors to the CLD Committee.
Peer Group
To assist the CLD Committee in its deliberations on executive compensation, the Committee each year reviews our peer group with our compensation consultant for appropriateness based on a variety of factors including: similarities in market capitalization, revenue, relevant industries, the overlapping labor market for top management talent, our status as a publicly traded, U.S.-based firm, and various other characteristics. Additionally, in late 2017, the Committee specifically began to focus on reconsidering peers with a founder CEO who did not appear to be paid in a manner that reflects the external pay market.  As a result of this review, the Committee made the following changes to the peer group:

 With these changes, the CLD Committee examined the compensation practices of these companies, which we believe most closely approximate the size, scope and complexity of our business. The 2018 peer group was set in late 2017 and referenced for setting target compensation for the hiring of Mr. Dziersk, our Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales, and target compensation levels for NEOs for 2018, among other things.  The 2019 peer group was established in late 2018 and referenced for setting target compensation levels for NEOs for 2019, among other things.
FW Cook prepared a compensation analysis using data gathered from publicly available information for these peer groups. The CLD Committee used this data to compare the compensation of our NEOs to similarly positioned persons within the peer group and to determine the relative compensation for each NEO position, based on direct, quantitative comparisons of pay levels.
Components of Executive Compensation
Base Salaries
We use base salaries primarily to compensate and retain our NEOs for their services. Base salaries for our NEOs are reviewed on an annual basis and represent the minimum payment for a satisfactory level of individual performance as long as the executive remains employed with us.  Base salary is set at the CLD Committee's discretion after taking into account the competitive landscape including the compensation practices of the companies in our selected peer groups, our business strategy, our performance goals and certain individual factors, such as position, salary history, individual performance and contribution, length of service with the Company and placement within the general base salary range offered to our NEOs.
Executive compensation activities in 2018.  Based on the criteria above, the CLD Committee made no change to the base salaries for Messrs. Reiner, Schulz, or Dziersk. 
Cash Incentives
For 2018, we utilized a cash incentive plan for Messrs. Reiner, Schulz, and Dziersk under which cash incentive payments could be made after the end of each year based on our performance against our corporate objectives for each year. The cash incentive program was intended to reward our NEOs upon the achievement of financial performance goals. Each component of the cash incentive plan had minimum threshold target and maximum levels and operated independent of the other components in that the target incentive payment amount for each component was payable if we hit our target level for that component.  Actual results between the minimum threshold, target and the maximum goal levels would be pro-rated. We use our cash incentive plan to align our NEOs' performance with our financial results and to motivate our NEOs to successfully implement our cloud strategy and execute our corresponding financial plan by achieving annual goals that were set at the beginning of the year and remained unchanged through the end of the year.
Executive compensation activities in 2018. Our CLD Committee approved our 2018 Named Executive Officer Plan (2018 NEO Plan) for each of our NEOs in March 2018, and many of the changes reflected in the 2018 NEO Plan were in response to feedback received after the 2017 Say-on-Pay vote. The 2018 NEO Plan eliminated the non-GAAP gross profit from the 2017 Named Executive Officer Plan (2017 NEO Plan), retained the ARR and free cash flow elements from the 2017 NEO Plan, and added total revenue as a new element for 2018.  Gross profit was eliminated and replaced with total revenue because we believe that total revenue will be an increasingly valuable indication of top line growth.  Overall, ARR, total revenue, and free cash flow were the best indicators to measure the health and trajectory of our overall cloud business at this point in our cloud transition. The 2018 NEO Plan also eliminated the quarterly component and utilizes only annual performance periods for all measures in order to eliminate shareholder confusion on how our quarterly goals are defined. The weighting of the 2018 NEO Plan components is set forth in the following table:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Component    Weighting 
ARR1   50% 
Free Cash Flow2   25% 
Total Revenue   25% 
Total Incentive Opportunity 100% 
(1) ARR is used to assess the trajectory of our cloud business. ARR means, as of a specified date, the contracted recurring revenue, including contracts with a future start date, together with annualized overage fees incurred above contracted minimum transactions, and excluding perpetual and term license agreements recognized as license revenue in accordance with GAAP. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and any other GAAP measure. 
(2) Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less additions to property, plant and equipment, purchases of other (non-acquisition-related) intangible assets and capitalized internal-use software development costs. 
[END TABLE]
 Payouts under the 2018 NEO Plan were based on Company performance compared to aggressive goals set for each component's target.  Our primary growth-oriented performance metric is ARR and our ARR performance goal required 19% growth at target for 2017, which is 12% more aggressive than the approximately 17% average top line growth required to achieve target level incentive compensation by our peer companies for 2017. The CLD Committee authorized the payments in February 2019 for payment after audited results were determined for 2018. The target, minimum threshold and maximum for each component are set forth in the following table:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Goals ($M)   Performance Achieved 
Component Threshold   Target   Maximum   
ARR1 180.0   190.4   195.7   190.5 
Free Cash Flow (6.0)   (2.0)   1.0   (0.5) 
Total Revenue1 185.0   192.0   197.0   198.5 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) Performance achievement shown on a constant currency basis.  
[END TABLE]
For the 2018 NEO Plan, the CLD Committee set the incentive pay as a percentage of the annual base salary of each of Messrs. Reiner, Schulz, and Dziersk, based on achievement of the minimum threshold targets for each component above, as set forth in the following table:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Named Executive Officer   At Target Threshold  At Target  At Target Maximum
Named Executive Officer   At Target Threshold  At Target  At Target Maximum
Andres D. Reiner   55%   110%   220% 
Stefan B. Schulz   40%   80%   160% 
Thomas F. Dziersk   50%   100%   200% 
Named Executive Officer   Actual Payout 
  As a% of Base   As a% of Target 
Andres D. Reiner   152.35%   138.5% 
Stefan B. Schulz   110.8%   138.5% 
Thomas F. Dziersk   138.5%   138.5% 
[END TABLE]
For 2018, the CLD Committee decided upon the target total cash compensation (base salary plus target cash incentives) for Messrs. Reiner, Schulz, and Dziersk based on each individual's compensation history, recent individual performance and contribution, as well as the competitive landscape including the compensation practices of the companies in our selected peer groups, our business strategy, and placement within the peer group compensation range for each position.
NEO bonuses in 2018 included no adjustment outside of the formulaic outcome driven by performance versus the goals that were set at the start of the year.  We believe that the 2018 goals were aggressive based on performance benchmarking of the growth rates compared to our 2018 peer group, which contributed to our 59% stock price increase between December 31, 2017 and March 15, 2019.
Executive compensation activities in 2019.  In January 2019, our CLD Committee approved our 2019 Named Executive Officer Plan (2019 NEO Plan) for each of our NEOs.  Compared to the 2018 NEO Plan, the 2019 NEO Plan retained the total revenue element, eliminated the ARR and Free Cash Flow metrics, and added a non-GAAP Recurring Revenue Gross Margin metric.  The CLD Committee believes that total revenue and Non-GAAP Recurring Revenue Gross Margin are the best indicators to measure the growth and efficiency of our business at this stage of our cloud transition. The weighting of the 2019 NEO Plan components is set forth in the following table:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Component Threshold   Target    Maximum 
Total Revenue 30%   60%   120% 
Non-GAAP Recurring Revenue Gross Margin1  20%   40%   80% 
Non-GAAP Recurring Revenue Gross Margin1  20%   40%   80% 
Total Incentive Opportunity 50.0%   100.0%   200.0% 
[END TABLE]
 intangibles, acquisition-related expenses and non-cash rent expense on the preoccupied new PROS headquarters (non-GAAP Recurring Cost of Revenue), divided by (b) total recurring revenue, expressed as a percentage.  
In setting the targets for these components, the CLD Committee believed that there was a reasonable likelihood that we could achieve the targets specified if we execute on our business plan. For the 2019 NEO Plan, the incentive payment as a percentage of the base salary for each continuing NEO remains unchanged from 2018.
Equity Awards
The CLD Committee believes that equity compensation plans are an essential tool to link the long-term interests of stockholders and employees, especially the NEOs, and serve to motivate NEOs to make decisions that will, in the long run, deliver the best returns to stockholders.
Executive compensation activities in 2018. In 2018, the CLD Committee considered the equity mix for our NEOs and believed it was in the best interests of our stockholders to grant equity awards in an equal mix of MSUs and RSUs to our Chief Executive Officer and an equity mix for Messrs. Schulz and Dziersk to be 60% RSUs and 40% MSUs to align with our peer group compensation practices.   RSUs granted in 2018 (January 2018 RSUs) to our NEOs vest in four equal annual installments on January 10th of each year.
The CLD Committee determines the size of awards following review of competitive market data from our peer group, as well as subjective factors such as relative job scope, individual performance, tenure and experience, expected future contributions to the growth and development of the Company, Company performance, historical equity compensation awarded to a NEO, and the unvested equity position held by each NEO. These factors are reflected in the MSU and RSU grants made in January 2018 to Messrs. Reiner, Schulz, and Dziersk.
For 2018, the value of Mr. Reiner's target equity award was based on the Company's positive results against targets in 2017 and the substantial progress made in leading the Company's cloud transition. The value of Mr. Schulz's target equity grant in 2018 was based on his especially positive performance in 2017 and his direct impact of the performance on the Company's results. For 2018, the CLD Committee provided a small equity grant to Mr. Dziersk in order to get him on the same annual equity cycle as our other NEOs going forward.
RSUs are intended to assist in retaining our NEOs and to reward them for sustaining and increasing the share price of our Common Stock. 
MSUs are performance-vested units under which the actual number of shares of our Common Stock received following vesting is based on the Company's total stockholder return (TSR) in relation to the Index over a specified performance period. The MSUs awarded in January 2018 (January 2018 MSUs) to Messrs. Reiner, Schulz, and Dziersk have a three-year performance period beginning January 2017.  If we under-perform the Index, the percentage at which the MSUs convert into shares of our Common Stock will be reduced from 100%, at a rate of 2.5 to 1 (2½-percentage-point reduction in the number of target units for each percentage point of under-performance), with a minimum percentage of 0%. If we outperform the Index, the percentage at which the MSUs convert to shares will be increased from 100%, at a rate of 2.5 to 1 (2½-percentage-point increase in the number of target units for each percentage point of over-performance), with a maximum percentage of 200%.
The CLD Committee believes that MSUs reward for performance and adjust the reward and the performance for overall market conditions that may have contributed to the outcome.  The value realized from MSUs can differ materially from reported pay because MSUs may not vest, or may vest below target if our TSR does not sufficiently perform relative to the Index over the three year performance measurement period. For example, the MSUs granted in January 2015 did not vest. These limited vesting results were caused by the decrease in the Company's stock price during the early stages of the Company's transition to a cloud company.
PRSUs are performance vested restricted stock units distinct from MSUs which vest upon achievement of certain performance metrics, which were granted in 2016 with price contingencies that were materially higher than stock price at the time (Stock Price PRSUs). Stock Price PRSUs vest if the average trailing closing price of the Company's Common Stock meets certain minimum stock price growth hurdles. The actual number of shares of our Common Stock issuable under the Stock Price PRSUs is based on our average per share closing price for at least 105 calendar days prior to September 9, 2020, with 25% vesting at $27 (vested in 2017), an additional 25% vesting at $33 (vested in 2018), and the remaining 50% vesting at $41 (not yet vested).  The Stock Price PRSUs were partially earned in 2017 and 2018 based on achieving the first two of three stock price growth goals.  The remaining Stock Price PRSUs have not been earned yet as the applicable stock price hurdle has not been achieved.  The  following table shows the number of Stock Price PRSUs earned during 2017 through 2018 and the number that remain unearned but potentially earnable for each of our NEOs:
[BEGIN TABLE]

Executive compensation activities in 2019.  In 2019, the CLD Committee reviewed the equity mix for our NEOs and believed it was in our best interests to continue to grant equity awards in an equal 50/50 mix of PRSUs and RSUs to Mr. Reiner, and 60% RSUs and 40% PRSUs for Messrs. Schulz and Dziersk to align with our peer group compensation practices.  RSUs granted in 2019 to our NEOs vest in four equal annual installments on January 15th of each year.  After considering feedback from stockholders, the CLD Committee decided to move from TSR-linked MSUs to PRSUs tied to achievement of internal performance metrics.  The PRSUs awarded in 2019 (2019 PRSUs), are payable in shares of our Common Stock, and vest at up to 200% of the grant amount on the third anniversary of the grant based upon achievement of certain internal performance metrics set by the Committee over a two-year performance period beginning January 2019.  If we achieve the target performance level, the percentage at which the 2019 PRSUs convert into shares of our Common Stock will be 100%.  If we fail to achieve the performance level at target, the percentage at which the 2019 PRSUs convert into shares of our Common Stock will be reduced from 100%, through linear interpolation between 50% threshold and 100% achievement, with a minimum percentage of 0% for performance below threshold.  If we perform above the target performance level, the percentage at which the 2019 PRSUs convert to shares of our Common Stock will be increased from 100%, through linear interpolation, with a maximum percentage of 200% for performance above maximum performance levels.
Other Compensation
Our NEOs are eligible to participate in our health and welfare programs, 401(k) plan, Employee Stock Purchase Plan and other benefit programs on the same basis as other U.S. employees.
Severance Compensation and Termination Protection
We generally provide our NEOs with severance packages if they are terminated without cause (as defined in their employment agreements) or for good reason (as defined in their employment agreements) in order to attract and retain them. The amount of severance benefits is described below, and in more detail elsewhere in the section titled "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control" on page 41 of this Proxy Statement. The CLD Committee reviews the potential payouts to ensure their market-competitiveness in order to incentivize our NEOs to maintain focus on both daily and long-term efforts.
Our severance compensation provisions are designed to meet the following objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change in Control: As part of our normal course of business, we may engage in discussions with other companies about possible collaborations and/or other ways in which the companies may work together to further our respective long-term objectives. In certain scenarios, the potential for merger or being acquired may be in the best interests of our stockholders. We provide a component of severance compensation if a NEO is terminated as a result of a change of control transaction to promote the ability of our NEOs to act in the best interests of our stockholders even though they could be terminated as a result of the transaction. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Termination Without Cause or For Good Reason: If we terminate the employment of one of our NEOs "without cause" or one of our NEOs resigns for "good reason," each as defined in the applicable agreement, we are obligated to make certain payments based on the NEO's then-effective base salary. We believe this is appropriate because the terminated NEO is bound by confidentiality and non-competition provisions continuing after termination. We also believe it is beneficial to have a mutually-agreed severance package in place prior to any termination event, to avoid disruptive conflicts and provide us with more flexibility to make a change in management if such a change is in our and our stockholders' best interests. 
[END TABLE]
Employment Agreements
Andres D. Reiner. In December 2018, we entered into a second amended and restated employment agreement with Mr. Reiner, our Chief Executive Officer and President, in order to reflect current competitive market practices. This agreement will automatically renew for additional three-year terms unless the Company decides not to renew. The base salary payable to Mr. Reiner is subject to periodic review by our CLD Committee. In the event Mr. Reiner's employment with us is terminated by him for good reason, by us without cause or we decide not to renew his agreement, he will receive (i) his full base salary each month for the following 12 months, (ii) any unpaid bonus earned prior to the termination relating to periods preceding the date of termination, (iii) the payment of a bonus at 100% of performance targets, including discretionary components, within the bonus plan in effect as if employed by us for 12 months, (iv) an amount equal to 12 times the monthly cost of Mr. Reiner's health benefits, (v) the acceleration of vesting of all equity awards with respect to such shares that would have vested following his termination date, and (vi) the acceleration of vesting of all market stock awards where the number of units vesting is determined as if the performance period ended on his termination date. If Mr. Reiner's employment is terminated by us without cause, if he resigns for good reason, or we decide not to renew his agreement within six months prior to, or any time after, a change of control of the Company, he will receive (i) an amount equal to 150% of his annual salary, (ii) any unpaid bonus earned prior to the termination relating to periods preceding the date of termination, (iii) the payment of an aggregate bonus equal to 100% of performance targets, including any discretionary components, within the bonus plan in effect as if employed by us for eighteen months, (iv) an amount equal to 18 times the monthly cost of Mr. Reiner's health benefits, and (v) the acceleration of vesting of all equity awards with respect to shares that would have vested following the Termination Date. If Mr. Reiner's employment with us terminates due to his death or disability, his employment will automatically terminate and he will be entitled to accelerated vesting of (i) all equity awards with respect to all shares that would have vested after the termination date, and (ii) all MSUs at 100% of the target number granted. In addition, if the surviving or acquiring entity (or its parent entity) elects not to assume, continue or substitute for the equity awards or options due under the either the 2007 Plan or 2017 Plan, all outstanding equity awards and options under each plan will vest in full and become fully exercisable. Mr. Reiner is subject to non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions during the term of his employment and for the 12-month period following the termination of his employment.
Stefan B. Schulz.  In December 2018, we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Mr. Schulz, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, in order to reflect current competitive market practices. This agreement is for a three-year term and automatically renews for three-year terms unless the Company decides not to renew. The base salary payable to Mr. Schulz is subject to periodic review by our CLD Committee. In the event Mr. Schulz's employment with us is terminated by him for good reason, by us without cause, or we decide not to renew his agreement, he will receive (i) his full base salary each month for the following 12 months, (ii) any unpaid bonus earned prior to the termination relating to periods preceding the date of termination, (iii) the payment of a bonus at 100% of performance targets, including discretionary components, within the bonus plan in effect as if employed by us for 12 months, (iv) an amount equal to 12 times the monthly cost of Mr. Schulz's health benefits, (v) the acceleration of vesting of all equity awards with respect to such shares that would have vested following the date of termination and prior to the first anniversary of his termination date, and (vi) the acceleration of vesting of all market stock awards scheduled to vest prior to the first anniversary of his termination date, where the applicable performance period is deemed to have ended on his termination date. Alternatively, if Mr. Schulz's employment is terminated by us without cause, if he resigns for good reason, or we decide not to renew his agreement within six months prior to, or any time after, a change of control of the Company, he will receive (i) an amount equal to 150% of his annual salary, (ii) any unpaid bonus earned prior to the termination relating to periods preceding the date of termination, (iii) the payment of an aggregate bonus equal to 100% of performance targets, including discretionary components, within the bonus plan in effect as if employed by us for 18 months, (iv) an amount equal to 18 times the monthly cost of Mr. Schulz's health benefits, and (v) the acceleration of vesting of all equity awards with respect to such shares that would have vested following the date of termination. In addition, if the surviving or  acquiring entity (or its parent entity) elects not to assume, continue or substitute for the equity awards or options due under the 2007 Plan or 2017 Plan, all outstanding equity awards and options under each plan will vest in full and become fully exercisable. If Mr. Schulz's employment with us terminates due to his death or disability, his employment will automatically terminate and he will be entitled to accelerated vesting of (i) all equity awards with respect to all shares that would have vested after the termination date, and (ii) all MSUs at 100% of the target number granted. Mr. Schulz is subject to non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions during the term of his employment and for the 12-month period following the termination of his employment.
Thomas F. Dziersk.  In October 2017, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Dziersk, our Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales.  This agreement is for a three-year term and automatically renews for three-year terms unless the Company decides not to renew. The base salary payable to Mr. Dziersk is subject to periodic review by our CLD Committee. In the event Mr. Dziersk's employment with us is terminated by him for good reason, by us without cause, or we decide not to renew his agreement, he will receive (i) his full base salary each month for the following 12 months, and (ii) an amount equal to 12 times the monthly cost of Mr. Dziersk's health benefits. Alternatively, if Mr. Dziersk's employment is terminated by us without cause, if he resigns for good reason, or we decide not to renew his agreement within six months prior to, or any time after, a change of control of the Company, he will receive (i) an amount equal to 150% of his annual salary, (ii) any unpaid bonus earned prior to the termination relating to periods preceding the date of termination, (iii) an amount equal to 18 times the monthly cost of Mr. Dziersk's health benefits, and (iv) the acceleration of vesting of all equity awards with respect to such shares that would have vested following the date of termination. In addition, if the surviving or acquiring entity (or its parent entity) elects not to assume, continue or substitute for the equity awards or options due under the 2017 Plan, all outstanding equity awards and options under the 2017 Plan will vest in full and become fully exercisable. Mr. Dziersk is subject to non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions during the term of his employment and for the 12-month period following the termination of his employment.
"Cause" is defined in these employment agreements as (a) a breach by our officer of his duties of confidentiality which causes a material harm to us, (b) his conviction of, or a plea of guilty or no contest to, a felony or any other crime involving dishonesty or moral turpitude under the laws of the United States; (c) continued failure to perform assigned duties or comply with any Company policy after notice and a cure period; (d) any material breach by our officer of his employment agreement or any other agreement between our officer and us after notice and a cure period; (e) any intentional wrongdoing by them that adversely affects us; and (f) any failure to cooperate in good faith with us in any governmental investigation or formal proceeding.
Each of our NEOs can resign for "good reason" and be entitled to severance. "Good reason" is defined in their employment agreements as (i) a material diminution in their authority, duties or responsibilities or the assignment of duties to them that are not materially commensurate with their position with us, other than where they are asked to assume substantially similar duties and responsibilities in a larger entity after any change of control; (ii) the relocation of their offices to more than 25 miles from their present location; (iii) a material reduction in their base salaries other than reductions which are part of a general reduction affecting all employees; (iv) our failure to provide them with similar benefits than we provide to our other employees; (v) any material breach by us of any provision of their employment agreement; or (vi) any failure by any successor corporation to assume our obligations under the NEO's employment agreement.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
As part of our overall corporate governance and compensation practices, our Board adopted stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs and directors. These guidelines are designed to align our NEOs' and directors' interests with our stockholders' long-term interests by promoting long-term share ownership, which reduces the incentive for excessive short-term risk taking and further increase our NEOs' and directors' alignment with stockholder interests. These guidelines require our Chief Executive Officer to hold shares of our stock worth six times his annual salary and each other NEO is required to hold shares of our stock worth two times their annual salary. The guidelines also state that each non-employee director is required to hold shares of our stock worth five times the annual retainer for directors. Share units or unexercised options held by a NEO or director under any of our equity incentive plans are included, at 100% of their intrinsic value, in calculating the value of ownership to determine whether this minimum ownership requirement has been met. Shares held by a NEO or director under either of our equity incentive plans will continue to be included in calculating the value of ownership to determine whether this minimum ownership requirement has been met. Our NEOs must attain this ownership threshold within five years after being appointed as a NEO.  Our directors must attain this ownership threshold within six years after joining our Board.  As of December 31, 2018, each of our NEOs and directors were in compliance with the applicable guidelines. 
Clawback Policy
Our "clawback" policy permits our Board to consider and make a decision in its sole discretion to recover, under applicable law, any incentive bonuses awarded to NEOs whose fraud or intentional misconduct significantly contributed to a restatement of  financial results that led to the awarding of incentive bonuses. This "clawback" policy is designed to further link our executive compensation and our long-term performance. 
Tax and Accounting Considerations
Limits on Deductibility of Compensation.  Section 162(m) of the Code (Section 162(m)) generally prevents us from deducting as a business expense that portion of compensation paid to certain of our executive officers that exceeds $1,000,000.  Historically, there was an exception to this $1,000,000 deduction limit for compensation that qualified as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m).  Under federal tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017, referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act), the performance-based exemption was repealed for taxable years on or after January 1, 2018, and the persons treated as covered employees subject to the deduction limit have been expanded to include our CFO and mandated that once an individual is treated as a covered employee for a given year, that individual will be treated as a covered employee for all subsequent years. Accordingly, any compensation paid to our covered executive officers in excess of $1 million in any one year will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. The CLD Committee believes that its primary responsibility is to provide a compensation program to meet our stated business objectives, and accordingly the Company reserves the right to pay compensation that is not tax-deductible if it determines that such a payment is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.

PROPOSAL TWO
NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
What am I voting on?
As required pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory or non-binding basis, the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with SEC rules.  We currently conduct this advisory vote on an annual basis and expect to conduct the next advisory vote at our Annual Meeting to be held in 2020.
As described in the "Executive Summary" and "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" sections of this Proxy Statement, our executive compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and motivate talented individuals with the executive experience and leadership skills necessary for us to manage our business and meet our long-term objectives. We seek to provide executive compensation that is competitive with companies that are similar to us. We also seek to provide near-term and long-term financial incentives that reward well-performing executives when strategic corporate objectives designed to increase long-term stockholder value are achieved. We believe that executive compensation should include base salary, cash incentives and equity awards. We also believe that our executive officers' base salaries should be set at levels relative to comparable companies, and cash and equity incentives should generally be set at levels that give executives the opportunity to achieve above-average total compensation reflecting above-average Company performance. In particular, our executive compensation philosophy is to promote long-term value creation for our stockholders by rewarding improvement in selected financial metrics and by using equity incentives. Please see our "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" on page 22 of this Proxy Statement and related compensation tables for detailed information about our executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal year 2018 compensation of our NEOs.
This vote is advisory and therefore not binding.  However, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee values the opinions of our stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the NEO compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider those stockholders' concerns, and the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.
Note that because the advisory vote on executive compensation occurs well after the beginning of the compensation year, in most cases it may not be feasible to change any executive compensation program in consideration of any one year's advisory vote on executive compensation.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting is required for advisory approval of this proposal. A properly executed proxy marked "ABSTAIN" with respect to this matter is considered entitled to vote, and thus will have the effect of a vote against this matter.
In accordance with Delaware law, abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining both whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting and the total number of shares represented and voting on this proposal.  While broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum, broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of shares represented and voting with respect to the particular proposal on which the broker has expressly not voted and, accordingly, will not affect the approval of this proposal.
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS VOTING "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT. PROPOSAL THREE
APPROVAL OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO 2017 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN
What am I voting on?
Stockholders are being asked to approve the following amendments (Proposed Amendments) to our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (2017 Plan):
Increased Shares Authorized for Issuance.  An increase of 2,050,000 shares, for an aggregate maximum number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan of 4,550,000 shares, subject to adjustment for certain changes in our capitalization.  The 2017 Plan provides that all of these shares may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options.
Extension of Plan Term.  An extension of the term of the 2017 Plan for an additional two years (currently scheduled to expire in May 2027) to May 7, 2029.
Add Eligibility for More Favorable French Tax Treatment.  Stockholder approval of the amended 2017 Equity Plan, including a French sub-plan, enables us to grant Awards in France that qualify for favorable income tax and social security treatment in France should we decide to grant such awards to employees in France who are eligible to participate in the 2017 Plan.
On March 22, 2019 our Board, upon the recommendation of the CLD Committee, voted to amend the 2017 Plan to incorporate the Proposed Amendments and certain additional clarifying changes, subject to the approval of the Proposed Amendments by the Company's stockholders. If our stockholders approve the Proposed Amendments, they will become effective on the day of the Annual Meeting.  If the Proposed Amendments are not approved, the Proposed Amendments will not take effect and the 2017 Plan will remain in effect, including only the clarifying changes.
Key Plan Features
The 2017 Plan, as amended, contains a number of provisions that we believe are consistent with best practices in equity compensation and which protect the interests of stockholders:
Fixed plan term.  The 2017 Plan has a fixed term of ten years.
No evergreen authorization.  The 2017 Plan does not have an evergreen provision, which would have permitted an annual increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance without further stockholder approval.
No liberal share recycling on options and stock appreciation rights.  The 2017 Plan generally provides for gross share counting. The number of shares remaining available for grant under the 2017 Plan is reduced by the gross number of shares subject to options and stock appreciation rights settled on a net basis, and any shares withheld for taxes in connection with the exercise or settlement of options and stock appreciation rights will not again be available for the future grant of awards.  Shares withheld or reacquired by the Company for taxes up to the minimum statutory withholding rate in connection with the vesting or settlement of full value awards will not reduce the number of shares remaining available for the future grant of awards.
Individual award limits.  The 2017 Plan limits the maximum number of shares for which share-denominated awards may be granted to any employee in any fiscal year and the maximum dollar amount that an employee may earn for each fiscal year contained in a performance period under a cash-denominated award.
Non-employee director award limit.  The number of shares for which awards may be granted to any non-employee member of our Board in a fiscal year is limited.
No discounted options or stock appreciation rights.  Options and stock appreciation rights must have an exercise price or base price at or above the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant.
Prohibition of option repricing.  The 2017 Plan prohibits the repricing of stock options and stock appreciation rights without the approval of our stockholders.
Minimum vesting.  The 2017 Plan requires each stock-based award to have a minimum vesting period of one year, except for 5% of the aggregate number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan. Performance-based awards.  Performance share and performance unit awards require the achievement of pre-established goals.  The 2017 Plan establishes a list of measures of business and financial performance from which the CLD Committee may construct predetermined performance goals that must be met for an award to vest, although the CLD Committee may choose construct performance goals using alternative metrics.
No liberal change-in-control definition.  The 2017 Plan does not contain a "liberal" change in control definition (e.g., mergers require actual consummation).
No automatic vesting upon a change in control.  With the exception of awards held by non-employee directors, the 2017 Plan does not provide for automatic acceleration of award vesting upon a change in control.  The 2017 Plan allows for an acquiring corporation to assume, continue or substitute new awards for outstanding awards, and, if such awards are assumed, continued or replaced, their vesting will generally not accelerate in connection with the change in control, unless the award holder is involuntarily terminated without cause within 18 months following the change in control.  The vesting of awards that are not assumed, continued or replaced will be accelerated.  The vesting of awards held by non-employee directors will accelerate in full upon a change in control.
No tax gross-ups.  The 2017 Plan does not provide for any tax gross-ups.
Limitation on dividends and dividend equivalents.  Dividend equivalents may not be granted in connection with options or stock appreciation rights.  Any dividends or dividend equivalents payable in connection with a full value award will be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying award and will not be paid until and unless such award vests.
The above description is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the 2017 Plan, as amended, which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A and which we encourage stockholders to read in its entirety.
Purpose
Competition for talent in the software industry is intense and our Board believes equity plays an important role in the success of the Company by encouraging and enabling the employees, officers, non-employee directors and other key persons of the Company and its subsidiaries upon whose judgment, initiative and efforts the Company largely depends for the successful conduct of its business to acquire a proprietary interest in the Company.  Our Board anticipates that providing such persons with a direct stake in the Company will assure a closer identification of the interests of such individuals with those of the Company and its stockholders, thereby stimulating their efforts on the Company's behalf and strengthening their desire to remain with the Company. Further, our Board believes that the use of equity-based incentive awards supports the Company's goal of aligning our employees' compensation with long-term shareholder value, and serves as a retention tool for talent in a highly competitive environment.
In approving the initial adoption of the 2017 Plan, our stockholders authorized us to issue up to 2,500,000 shares of our common stock under the 2017 Plan. As of March 15, 2019, a total of 470,611 shares remained available for the future grant of awards under the 2017 Plan.
We believe that these shares remaining available for future award grants under the 2017 Plan is insufficient to meet our future needs.  If the Proposed Amendments are approved by our stockholders, our CLD Committee will have flexibility to use various equity-based incentive awards as compensation tools to secure and retain our employees, consultants, and directors, motivate our workforce, and to align their interests with those of our stockholders.  Based on our current equity award practices, we expect that the additional shares that would be authorized by the Proposed Amendments would be sufficient for grants by the CLD Committee for approximately 2 to 3 years, assuming we continue to grant awards consistent with our current practices and historical usage, and further dependent on the price of our shares and hiring activity during the next few years, forfeitures of outstanding awards, and noting that future circumstances may require us to change our current equity grant practices. We cannot predict our future equity grant practices, the future price of our shares or future hiring activity with any degree of certainty at this time, and the share reserve under the 2017 Plan could last for a shorter or longer time.
Dilution, Burn Rate and Equity Overhang
We recognize that equity awards dilute existing stockholders. Our CLD Committee regularly reviews our equity compensation program to ensure that we balance our employee compensation objectives with our stockholders' interest in limiting dilution from equity awards. Our CLD Committee also regularly reviews our burn rate and potential dilution from equity compensation. Our equity award burn rate averaged 4.0% of weighted average common shares outstanding over the last three fiscal years, calculated as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Fiscal Year   3-Year 
Burn Rate   2016   2017   2018   Average

Summary of 2017 Plan, As Amended
The following description of certain features of the 2017 Plan, as amended, is intended to be a summary only. The summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the 2017 Plan, as amended, that is attached hereto as Appendix A.
General.  The purpose of the 2017 Plan is to advance the interests of the Company and its stockholders by providing an incentive program that will enable the Company to attract and retain employees, consultants and directors and to provide them with an equity interest in the growth and profitability of the Company.  These incentives are provided through the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, other stock-based awards and cash-based awards.
Authorized Shares.  The maximum aggregate number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan is currently 2,500,000.  If the Proposed Amendments are approved, the aggregate number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan will be increased by 2,050,000 to a new total of 4,550,000.
Share Counting.  Each share made subject to an award will reduce the number of shares remaining available for grant under the 2017 Plan by one share.  If any award granted under the 2017 Plan expires or otherwise terminates for any reason without having been exercised or settled in full, or if shares subject to forfeiture or repurchase are forfeited or repurchased by the Company for not more than the participant's purchase price, any such shares reacquired or subject to a terminated award will again become available for issuance under the 2017 Plan.  Shares will not be treated as having been issued under the 2017 Plan and will therefore not reduce the number of shares available for issuance to the extent an award is settled in cash. Shares that are withheld or that are tendered in payment of the exercise price of an option will not be made available for new awards under the 2017 Plan.  However, shares withheld or reacquired by the Company in satisfaction of a tax withholding obligation determined by the minimum statutory withholding rate in connection with the vesting or settlement of any full value award (but not options or stock appreciation rights) will not reduce the number of shares remaining available for the future grant of awards.  Shares withheld for taxes in excess of  the minimum statutory withholding rate will not again be available for grant under the 2017 Plan.  Upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right or net exercise of an option, the number of shares available under the 2017 Plan will be reduced by the gross number of shares for which the award is exercised.
Adjustments for Capital Structure Changes.  Appropriate and proportionate adjustments will be made to the number of shares authorized under the 2017 Plan, to the numerical limits on certain types of awards described below, and to outstanding awards in the event of any change in our common stock through merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares or similar change in our capital structure, or if we make a distribution to our stockholders in a form other than common stock (excluding regular, periodic cash dividends) that has a material effect on the fair market value of our common stock.  In such circumstances, the CLD Committee also has the discretion under the 2017 Plan to adjust other terms of outstanding awards as it deems appropriate.
Non-employee Director Award Limits.  A non-employee director may not be granted awards under the 2017 Plan in any fiscal year having an aggregate grant date fair value exceeding $500,000.
Other Award Limits.  The 2017 Plan establishes limits on the maximum aggregate number of shares or dollar value for which awards may be granted to an employee in any fiscal year, as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No more than 1,250,000 shares under stock-based awards. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No more than $2,000,000 for each full fiscal year contained in the performance period under cash-based awards. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, to comply with applicable tax rules, the 2017 Plan also limits to 4,550,000 the number of shares that may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options granted under the 2017 Plan.
Administration.  The 2017 Plan generally will be administered by the CLD Committee of the Board, although the Board retains the right to appoint another of its committees to administer the 2017 Plan or to administer the 2017 Plan directly.  For purposes of this summary, the term "Committee" will refer to either such duly appointed committee or the Board.  Subject to the provisions of the 2017 Plan, the Committee determines in its discretion the persons to whom and the times at which awards are granted, the types and sizes of awards, and all of their terms and conditions.  The Committee may, subject to certain limitations on the exercise of its discretion provided by the 2017 Plan, amend, cancel or renew any award, waive any restrictions or conditions applicable to any award, and accelerate, continue, extend or defer the vesting of any award.
The 2017 Plan provides, subject to certain limitations, for indemnification by the Company of any director, officer or employee against all reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with any legal action arising from such person's action or failure to act in administering the 2017 Plan.  All awards granted under the 2017 Plan will be evidenced by a written or digitally signed agreement between the Company and the participant specifying the terms and conditions of the award, consistent with the requirements of the 2017 Plan.  The Committee will interpret the 2017 Plan and awards granted thereunder, and all determinations of the Committee generally will be final and binding on all persons having an interest in the 2017 Plan or any award.
Prohibition of Option and SAR Repricing.  The 2017 Plan expressly provides that, without the approval of a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at a meeting of our stockholders, the Committee may not provide for any of the following with respect to options or stock appreciation rights: (1) the cancellation of outstanding options or stock appreciation rights with exercise prices per share greater than the then fair market value of the Company's common stock in exchange for new options or stock appreciation rights having a lower exercise price, other awards or payments in cash (except in the event of a change in control), or (2) the amendment of outstanding options or stock appreciation rights to reduce the exercise price.
Minimum Vesting.  No more than 5% of the aggregate number of shares authorized under the 2017 Plan may be issued pursuant to stock-based awards that vest earlier than one year following the date of grant.  This minimum vesting requirement will not prohibit the Committee from accelerating vesting in connection with a participant's death or disability or in connection with a change in control of the Company.  Also, the minimum vesting requirement will not apply to awards granted by another company that we assume or substitute for in connection with our acquisition of such company or to awards granted to our non-employee directors that vest on the earlier of the one year anniversary of the date of grant or the next annual meeting of the stockholders which is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding year's annual meeting.
Eligibility.  Awards may be granted to employees, directors and consultants of the Company or any present or future parent or subsidiary corporation or other affiliated entity of the Company.  Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees  who, as of the time of grant, are employees of the Company or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company.  As of March 15, 2019, we had approximately 1,042 employees, 7 non-employee directors, as well as other consultants, who would be eligible under the 2017 Plan.
Stock Options.  The Committee may grant nonstatutory stock options, incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, or any combination of these.  The exercise price of each option may not be less than the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant.  However, any incentive stock option granted to a person who at the time of grant owns stock possessing more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any parent or subsidiary corporation of the Company (10% Stockholder) must have an exercise price equal to at least 110% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant.  On March 15, 2019, the closing price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange was $41.95 per share.
The 2017 Plan provides that the option exercise price may be paid in cash, by check, or cash equivalent; by means of a broker-assisted cashless exercise; by means of a net-exercise procedure; to the extent legally permitted, by tender to the Company of shares of common stock owned by the participant having a fair market value not less than the exercise price; by such other lawful consideration as approved by the Committee; or by any combination of these.  Nevertheless, the Committee may restrict the forms of payment permitted in connection with any option grant.  No option may be exercised unless the participant has made adequate provision for federal, state, local and foreign taxes, if any, relating to the exercise of the option, including, if permitted or required by the Company, through the participant's surrender of a portion of the option shares to the Company.
Options will become vested and exercisable at such times or upon such events and subject to such terms, conditions, performance criteria or restrictions as specified by the Committee, subject to the minimum vesting requirements described above.  The maximum term of any option granted under the 2017 Plan is ten years, provided that an incentive stock option granted to a 10% Stockholder must have a term not exceeding five years.  Unless otherwise permitted by the Committee, an option generally will remain exercisable for three months following the participant's termination of service, provided that if service terminates as a result of the participant's death or disability, the option generally will remain exercisable for 12 months, but in any event the option must be exercised no later than its expiration date.
Options are nontransferable by the participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and are exercisable during the participant's lifetime only by the participant.  However, an option may be assigned or transferred to certain family members or trusts for their benefit to the extent permitted by the Committee and, in the case of an incentive stock option, only to the extent that the transfer will not terminate its tax qualification.  No option may be transferred to a third party financial institution for value.
Stock Appreciation Rights.  The Committee may grant stock appreciation rights either in tandem with a related option (Tandem SAR) or independently of any option (Freestanding SAR).  A Tandem SAR requires the option holder to elect between the exercise of the underlying option for shares of common stock or the surrender of the option and the exercise of the related stock appreciation right.  A Tandem SAR is exercisable only at the time and only to the extent that the related stock option is exercisable, while a Freestanding SAR is exercisable at such times or upon such events and subject to such terms, conditions, performance criteria or restrictions as specified by the Committee.  The exercise price of each stock appreciation right may not be less than the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant.
Upon the exercise of any stock appreciation right, the participant is entitled to receive an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock as to which the right is exercised over the aggregate exercise price for such shares.  Payment of this amount upon the exercise of a Tandem SAR may be made only in shares of common stock whose fair market value on the exercise date equals the payment amount.  At the Committee's discretion, payment of this amount upon the exercise of a Freestanding SAR may be made in cash or shares of common stock.  The maximum term of any stock appreciation right granted under the 2017 Plan is ten years.
Stock appreciation rights are generally nontransferable by the participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, and are generally exercisable during the participant's lifetime only by the participant.  If permitted by the Committee, a Tandem SAR related to a nonstatutory stock option and a Freestanding SAR may be assigned or transferred to certain family members or trusts for their benefit to the extent permitted by the Committee.  Other terms of stock appreciation rights are generally similar to the terms of comparable stock options. Restricted Stock Awards.  The Committee may grant restricted stock awards under the 2017 Plan either in the form of a restricted stock purchase right, giving a participant an immediate right to purchase common stock, or in the form of a restricted stock bonus, in which stock is issued in consideration for services to the Company rendered by the participant.  The Committee determines the purchase price payable under restricted stock purchase awards, which may be less than the then current fair market value of our common stock.  Restricted stock awards may be subject to vesting conditions based on such service or performance criteria as the Committee specifies, including the attainment of one or more performance goals similar to those described below in connection with performance awards.  Shares acquired pursuant to a restricted stock award may not be transferred by the participant until vested.  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, a participant will forfeit any shares of restricted stock as to which the vesting restrictions have not lapsed prior to the participant's termination of service.  Participants holding restricted stock will have the right to vote the shares and to receive any dividends or other distributions paid in cash or shares, subject to the same vesting conditions as the original award.
Restricted Stock Units.  The Committee may grant restricted stock units under the 2017 Plan, which represent rights to receive shares of our common stock at a future date determined in accordance with the participant's award agreement.  No monetary payment is required for receipt of restricted stock units or the shares issued in settlement of the award, the consideration for which is furnished in the form of the participant's services to the Company.  The Committee may grant restricted stock unit awards subject to the attainment of one or more performance goals similar to those described below in connection with performance awards, or may make the awards subject to vesting conditions similar to those applicable to restricted stock awards.  Restricted stock units may not be transferred by the participant.  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, a participant will forfeit any restricted stock units which have not vested prior to the participant's termination of service.  Participants have no voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends with respect to restricted stock unit awards until shares of common stock are issued in settlement of such awards.  However, the Committee may grant restricted stock units that entitle their holders to dividend equivalent rights, which are rights to receive cash or additional restricted stock units whose value is equal to any cash dividends the Company pays.  Dividend equivalent rights will be subject to the same vesting conditions and settlement terms as the original award.
Performance Awards.  The Committee may grant performance awards subject to such conditions and the attainment of such performance goals over such periods as the Committee determines in writing and sets forth in a written agreement between the Company and the participant.  These awards may be designated as performance shares or performance units, which consist of unfunded bookkeeping entries generally having initial values equal to the fair market value determined on the grant date of a share of common stock in the case of performance shares and a monetary value established by the Committee at the time of grant in the case of performance units.  Performance awards will specify a predetermined amount of performance shares or performance units that may be earned by the participant to the extent that one or more performance goals are attained within a predetermined performance period.  To the extent earned, performance awards may be settled in cash, shares of common stock (including shares of restricted stock that are subject to additional vesting) or any combination of these.
Performance goals will be based on the attainment of specified target levels with respect to one or more measures of business or financial performance of the Company and each subsidiary corporation consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes, or such division or business unit of the Company as may be selected by the Committee.  The Committee, in its discretion, may base performance goals on one or more of the following such measures (or any other metric or goal the Committee may determine): bookings, revenue; sales; expenses; operating income; gross margin; operating margin; earnings before any one or more of: stock-based compensation expense, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; pre-tax profit; adjusted pre-tax profit; net operating income; net income; economic value added; free cash flow; operating cash flow; balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; stock price; earnings per share; return on stockholder equity; return on capital; return on assets; return on investment; total stockholder return, employee satisfaction; employee retention; market share; customer satisfaction; product development; research and development expense; completion of an identified special project and completion of a joint venture or other corporate transaction.
The target levels with respect to these performance measures may be expressed on an absolute basis or relative to an index, budget or other standard specified by the Committee.  The degree of attainment of performance measures will be calculated in accordance with the Company's financial statements, generally accepted accounting principles, if applicable, or other methodology established by the Committee, but prior to the accrual or payment of any performance award for the same performance period, and, according to criteria established by the Committee, excluding the effect (whether positive or negative) of any event the Committee determines is appropriate to exclude, including changes in accounting standards or any unusual or infrequently occurring event or transaction. Following completion of the applicable performance period, the Committee will certify in writing the extent to which the applicable performance goals have been attained and the resulting value to be paid to the participant.  The Committee retains the discretion to reduce the amount that would otherwise be payable on the basis of the performance goals attained.  The Committee may make positive or negative adjustments to performance award payments to reflect the participant's individual job performance or other factors determined by the Committee.  In its discretion, the Committee may provide for a participant awarded performance shares to receive dividend equivalent rights with respect to cash dividends paid on the Company's common stock to the extent that the performance shares become vested.  The Committee may provide for performance award payments in lump sums or installments.
Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, if a participant's service terminates due to the participant's death or disability prior to completion of the applicable performance period, the final award value will be determined at the end of the performance period on the basis of the performance goals attained during the entire performance period but will be prorated for the number of days of the participant's service during the performance period.  The Committee may provide similar treatment for a participant whose service is involuntarily terminated.  If a participant's service terminates prior to completion of the applicable performance period for any other reason, the 2017 Plan provides that the performance award will be forfeited, unless otherwise determined by the Committee.  No performance award may be sold or transferred other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution prior to the end of the applicable performance period.
Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards.  The Committee may grant cash-based awards or other stock-based awards in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee determines.  Cash-based awards will specify a monetary payment or range of payments, while other stock-based awards will specify a number of shares or units based on shares or other equity-related awards.  Such awards may be subject to vesting conditions based on continued performance of service or subject to the attainment of one or more performance goals similar to those described above in connection with performance awards.  Settlement of awards may be in cash or shares of common stock, as determined by the Committee.  A participant will have no voting rights with respect to any such award unless and until shares are issued pursuant to the award.  The Committee may grant dividend equivalent rights with respect to other stock-based awards that will be subject to the same vesting conditions and settlement terms as the original award..  The effect on such awards of the participant's termination of service will be determined by the Committee and set forth in the participant's award agreement.
Change in Control.  The 2017 Plan provides that a "Change in Control" occurs upon (a) a person or entity (with certain exceptions described in the 2017 Plan) becoming the direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than 50% of the Company's voting stock; (b) stockholder approval of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or (c) the occurrence of any of the following events upon which the stockholders of the Company immediately before the event do not retain immediately after the event direct or indirect beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the voting securities of the Company, its successor or the entity to which the assets of the company were transferred:  (i) a sale or exchange by the stockholders in a single transaction or series of related transactions of more than 50% of the Company's voting stock; (ii) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is a party; or (iii) the sale, exchange or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (other than a sale, exchange or transfer to one or more subsidiaries of the Company).
If a Change in Control occurs, the surviving, continuing, successor or purchasing entity or its parent may, without the consent of any participant, either assume or continue outstanding awards or substitute substantially equivalent awards for its stock.  If so determined by the Committee, stock-based awards will be deemed assumed if, for each share subject to the award prior to the Change in Control, its holder is given the right to receive the same amount of consideration that a stockholder would receive as a result of the Change in Control.  The vesting of any awards that are not assumed, continued or replaced in connection with a Change in Control will be accelerated in full, and, if not exercised prior to the Change in Control, will terminate effective as of the time of the Change in Control.  The vesting of any awards that are assumed, continue or replaced will be accelerated in full if, within 18 months following the Change in Control, the holder's employment is terminated without cause or the holder resigns following reduction in base salary of 15% or more.
Subject to the restrictions of Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may provide for the acceleration of vesting or settlement of any or all outstanding awards upon such other terms and to such extent as it determines.  The vesting of all awards held by non-employee directors will be accelerated in full upon a Change in Control.
The 2017 Plan also authorizes the Committee, in its discretion and without the consent of any participant, to cancel each or any award denominated in shares of stock upon a Change in Control in exchange for a payment to the participant with respect each vested share (and each unvested share if so determined by the Committee) subject to the canceled award of an amount equal to the excess of the consideration to be paid per share of common stock in the Change in Control transaction over the exercise or purchase price per share, if any, under the award. Awards Subject to Section 409A of the Code.  Certain awards granted under the 2017 Plan may be deemed to constitute "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, providing rules regarding the taxation of nonqualified deferred compensation plans, and the regulations and other administrative guidance issued pursuant to Section 409A.  Any such awards will be required to comply with the requirements of Section 409A.  Notwithstanding any provision of the 2017 Plan to the contrary, the Committee is authorized, in its sole discretion and without the consent of any participant, to amend the 2017 Plan or any award agreement as it deems necessary or advisable to comply with Section 409A.
Amendment, Suspension or Termination.  The 2017 Plan will continue in effect until its termination by the Committee, provided that no awards may be granted under the 2017 Plan following the tenth anniversary of the 2017 Plan's effective date, which is May 18, 2027.  If our stockholders approve the Proposed Amendments, the term of the 2017 Plan will be extended to May 7, 2029.  The Committee may amend, suspend or terminate the 2017 Plan at any time, provided that no amendment may be made without stockholder approval that would increase the maximum aggregate number of shares of stock authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan, change the class of persons eligible to receive incentive stock options or require stockholder approval under any applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange on which the Company's shares are then listed.  No amendment, suspension or termination of the 2017 Plan may affect any outstanding award unless expressly provided by the Committee, and, in any event, may not have a materially adverse effect an outstanding award without the consent of the participant unless necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule, including, but not limited to, Section 409A of the Code.
Tax Aspects Under the Code
The following summary is intended only as a general guide to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of participation in the 2017 Plan and does not attempt to describe all possible federal or other tax consequences of such participation or tax consequences based on particular circumstances.
Incentive Stock Options.  A participant recognizes no taxable income for regular income tax purposes as a result of the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option qualifying under Section 422 of the Code.  Participants who neither dispose of their shares within two years following the date the option was granted nor within one year following the exercise of the option will normally recognize a capital gain or loss upon the sale of the shares equal to the difference, if any, between the sale price and the purchase price of the shares.  If a participant satisfies such holding periods upon a sale of the shares, we will not be entitled to any deduction for federal income tax purposes.  If a participant disposes of shares within two years after the date of grant or within one year after the date of exercise (a "disqualifying disposition"), the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the option exercise date and the exercise price (not to exceed the gain realized on the sale if the disposition is a transaction with respect to which a loss, if sustained, would be recognized) will be taxed as ordinary income at the time of disposition.  Any gain in excess of that amount will be a capital gain.  If a loss is recognized, there will be no ordinary income, and such loss will be a capital loss.  Any ordinary income recognized by the participant upon the disqualifying disposition of the shares generally should be deductible by us for federal income tax purposes, except to the extent such deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code.
In general, the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise of an incentive stock option is treated as an adjustment in computing the participant's alternative minimum taxable income and may be subject to an alternative minimum tax which is paid if such tax exceeds the regular tax for the year.  Special rules may apply with respect to certain subsequent sales of the shares in a disqualifying disposition, certain basis adjustments for purposes of computing the alternative minimum taxable income on a subsequent sale of the shares and certain tax credits which may arise with respect to participants subject to the alternative minimum tax.
Nonstatutory Stock Options.  Options not designated or qualifying as incentive stock options are nonstatutory stock options having no special tax status.  A participant generally recognizes no taxable income upon receipt of such an option.  Upon exercising a nonstatutory stock option, the participant normally recognizes ordinary income equal to the difference between the exercise price paid and the fair market value of the shares on the date when the option is exercised.  If the participant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes.  Upon the sale of stock acquired by the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option, any gain or loss, based on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date, will be taxed as capital gain or loss.  We generally should be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant as a result of the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option, except to the extent such deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code. Stock Appreciation Rights.  A Participant recognizes no taxable income upon the receipt of a stock appreciation right.  Upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right, the participant generally will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock on the exercise date over the exercise price.  If the participant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes.  We generally should be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant in connection with the exercise of the stock appreciation right, except to the extent such deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code.
Restricted Stock.  A participant acquiring restricted stock generally will recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the "determination date" over the price paid, if any, for such shares.  The "determination date" is the date on which the participant acquires the shares unless the shares are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and are not transferable, in which case the determination date is the earlier of (i) the date on which the shares become transferable or (ii) the date on which the shares are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (e.g., when they become vested).  If the determination date follows the date on which the participant acquires the shares, the participant may elect, pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code, to designate the date of acquisition as the determination date by filing an election with the Internal Revenue Service no later than 30 days after the date on which the shares are acquired.  If the participant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes.  Upon the sale of shares acquired pursuant to a restricted stock award, any gain or loss, based on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value of the shares on the determination date, will be taxed as capital gain or loss.  We generally should be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant on the determination date, except to the extent such deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code.
Restricted Stock Unit, Performance, Cash-Based and Other Stock-Based Awards.  A participant generally will recognize no income upon the receipt of a restricted stock unit, performance share, performance unit, cash-based or other stock-based award.  Upon the settlement of such awards, participants normally will recognize ordinary income in the year of settlement in an amount equal to the cash received and the fair market value of any substantially vested shares of stock received.  If the participant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes.  If the participant receives shares of restricted stock, the participant generally will be taxed in the same manner as described above under "Restricted Stock."  Upon the sale of any shares received, any gain or loss, based on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value of the shares on the determination date (as defined above under "Restricted Stock"), will be taxed as capital gain or loss.  We generally should be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant on the determination date, except to the extent such deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires each of our directors and NEOs, among others, to file with the SEC an initial report of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of Common Stock of the Company. Such persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all such filings. Based on a review of the copies of such forms in our possession, and on written representations from reporting persons, we believe that during 2018, all of our NEOs and directors filed the required reports on a timely basis under Section 16(a).
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Since January 1, 2018, there has not been (nor is there currently proposed), any transaction or series of similar transactions to which we were or are a party in which the amount involved exceeded or exceeds $120,000 and in which any of our directors, executive officers, holders of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, other than compensation arrangements with directors and executive officers, and the transactions described below:
Relationships with Management, Founders and Investors
Ownership. Ronald F. Woestemeyer and Mariette Woestemeyer, who each serve on our Board, jointly hold more than 5% of our Common Stock.
Indemnification agreements. We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our current directors and officers. These agreements require us, among other things, to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law against liabilities that may arise by reason of their service to us, and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. We also intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our future directors and officers.
Employment arrangements. We have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers, which address, among other things, the terms of their employment, such as base salary, severance payments and payment on a change in control.
Family relationships.  Mr. Rob Reiner, who serves as our Chief Technology Officer is the brother of Andres Reiner, our CEO.  All compensation paid to Mr. R. Reiner has been approved by our Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, which reviews and approves all compensation for our NEOs and any family members who are employees.
Procedures for Related Party Transactions
Under our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our employees and officers are discouraged from entering into any transaction that may cause a conflict of interest. In addition, they must report any potential conflict of interest, including related party transactions, to their managers or our compliance officer who then reviews and summarizes the proposed transaction for our Audit Committee. Pursuant to its charter, our Audit Committee must then approve any related party transactions, including those transactions involving our directors. In approving or rejecting such proposed transactions, the Audit Committee considers the relevant facts and circumstances available and deemed relevant to the Audit Committee, including the material terms of the transactions, risks, benefits, costs, availability of other comparable services or products and, if applicable, the impact on a director's independence. Our Audit Committee will approve only those transactions that, in light of known circumstances, are in, or are not inconsistent with, our best interests, as our Audit Committee determines in the good faith exercise of its discretion.  
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, a current copy of which is available under Corporate Governance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.pros.com. The Audit Committee reviews and assesses the adequacy of its charter at least annually and, when appropriate, recommends changes to the Board to reflect the evolving role of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is composed of non-employee directors who meet the independence and financial literacy requirements of the NYSE and additional, heightened independence criteria applicable to members of the Audit Committee under SEC and NYSE rules. The Audit Committee currently consists of Timothy V. Williams (Chairman), Greg B. Petersen and Les Rechan. Our Board of Directors has determined that each of the members of the Audit Committee are each an "Audit Committee financial expert" as is currently defined under SEC regulations and the rules of the NYSE.
Primary Responsibilities
The Audit Committee oversees the Company's accounting and financial reporting processes on behalf of the Board of Directors, and assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility relating to the integrity of the Company's financial statements and the financial reporting process, the systems of internal accounting and financial controls, and the annual independent audit of the Company's financial statements. The Audit Committee also oversees the independent auditors' qualifications and independence. The Company's management has the primary responsibility for preparing the Company's financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. 
Oversight of Independent Auditors 
The Audit Committee engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as our independent auditors for the year ended December 31, 2018. In its meetings with our independent auditors, the Audit Committee asks them to address, and discusses their responses to, several questions that the Audit Committee believes are relevant to its oversight. The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent auditors those matters required to be discussed by the auditors with the Audit Committee under the rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent auditors' communication with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent auditors their independence. 
2018 Audited Financial Statements
In its oversight role, the Audit Committee relies on the work and assurances of the Company's management. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in 2018, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, including a discussion of, among other things, the quality of the Company's accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant estimates and judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the Company's financial statements.
The Audit Committee has (1) reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management, (2) discussed with PwC, our independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by the statement on Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees", as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, (3) received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent accountant required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent accountant the independent accountant's independence, and (4) considered with the independent auditors whether the provision of non-audit services provided by them to the Company during 2018 was compatible with their independence.  Based upon these discussions and reviews, the Audit Committee recommended to our Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and filed with the SEC.
THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Timothy V. Williams, Chairman
Greg B. Petersen
Les Rechan INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FEES
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy for the pre-approval of services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. Under this policy, each year the Audit Committee pre-approves the audit engagement terms and fees and may also pre-approve detailed types of audit-related and permitted tax services, subject to certain dollar limits, to be performed during the year. All other permitted non-audit services are required to be pre-approved by the Audit Committee on an engagement-by-engagement basis.
The following table summarizes the aggregate fees in 2018 billed for professional services rendered to us by PwC in 2018 and 2017. A description of these various fees and services follows the table: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    2018   2017 
Audit fees   $ 1,845,680     $ 2,058,773   
Audit-related fees   —     —   
Tax fees   41,992     31,000   
All other fees   1,919     1,919   
Total fees   $ 1,889,591     $ 2,091,692   
[END TABLE]
Fees Billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP
Audit fees.  The aggregate fees billed to us by PwC in connection with the annual audit of our financial statements, reviews of our financial statements included in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, consents related to documents filed with the SEC and comfort letters, were $1,845,680 and $2,058,773 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Audit-related fees.  Audit-related fees consist of fees for professional services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company's financial statements. This category may include fees related to due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions, accounting and financial reporting consultations and research necessary to comply with generally accepted audit standards. There were no audit-related fees billed for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Tax fees.  The aggregate tax fees billed to us by PwC related to tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning, and were $41,992 and $31,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
All other fees.  The other fees consist of subscription fees for an accounting and auditing research tool.
Audit Committee Approval of Services
The Audit Committee is authorized by its charter to pre-approve all auditing and permitted non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee reviews and approves the independent registered public accounting firm's retention to perform attest services, including the associated fees. The Audit Committee also evaluates other known potential engagements of the independent registered public accounting firm, including the scope of the proposed work and the proposed fees, and approves or rejects each service, taking into account whether the services are permissible under applicable law and the possible impact of each non-audit service on the independent registered public accounting firm's independence from management. At subsequent meetings, the Audit Committee receives updates on services actually provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, and management may present additional services for approval. The Audit Committee has delegated to the chairman of the Audit Committee the authority to evaluate and approve engagements on behalf of the Audit Committee in the event that a need arises for pre-approval between Audit Committee meetings. If the Chairman approves any such engagements, he reports that approval to the full Audit Committee at its next meeting. During fiscal year 2018, all such services were pre-approved in accordance with the procedures described above.
Our Audit Committee has reviewed the fees described above and believes that such fees are compatible with maintaining the independence of PwC.  
PROPOSAL FOUR
RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM APPOINTMENT
The Audit Committee has selected the independent registered public accounting firm of PwC to audit our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  We have determined to submit the selection of auditors to stockholder ratification, even though it is not required by our governing documents or Delaware law. If the selection of PwC as our independent auditors is not ratified by our stockholders, our Audit Committee will reconsider, but might not change, its selection.  Notwithstanding the selection and ratification, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time, if it believes doing so would be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. 
PwC has audited our financial statements annually since 2002. Representatives of PwC are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Vote Required
Approval of the ratification of the appointment of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock entitled to vote and present or represented at the Annual Meeting. A properly executed proxy marked "ABSTAIN" with respect to this matter is considered entitled to vote and thus, will have the effect of a vote against this matter.
In accordance with Delaware law, abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining both whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting and the total number of shares represented and voting on this proposal. While broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum, broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of shares represented and voting with respect to the particular proposal on which the broker has expressly not voted and, accordingly, will not affect the approval of this proposal.
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS VOTING "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019.  
STOCKHOLDERS PROPOSALS
Stockholders may present proposals for action at meetings of stockholders only if they comply with the rules established by the SEC, applicable Delaware law and our amended and restated bylaws, as contained in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 21, 2013 (Bylaws). No stockholder proposals were received for consideration at the Annual Meeting.
Stockholders interested in submitting a proposal for inclusion in our proxy materials and for consideration at the 2020 annual meeting of our stockholders (2020 Annual Meeting) may do so by following the procedures set forth in Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, as amended. To be eligible for inclusion in such proxy materials, stockholder proposals must be received by our Corporate Secretary no later than November 26, 2019.
Under our Bylaws, for any stockholder proposal or director nomination that is not submitted for inclusion in the next year's proxy statement but instead is proposed to be presented directly at our 2020 Annual Meeting, the stockholder must provide us written notice not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth day prior to our 2020 Annual Meeting or the tenth day following the date on which public announcement of the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is first made.  Any such notice for director nominations must satisfy the requirements specified in Article II, Section 2.15(b) of our Bylaws.  Any such notice for other stockholder proposals (other than director nomination) must satisfy the requirements specified in Article I, Section 1.10(b) of our Bylaws. In the absence of such notice meeting the above requirements, a stockholder shall not be entitled to present any business at our 2020 Annual Meeting.
Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the number of directors to be elected at an annual meeting of stockholders is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming the nominees for the additional directorships at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the Company's previous year's annual meeting of stockholders, a stockholder's notice shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if it is be delivered to the Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company. In the event the Company calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board, any such stockholder may nominate a person(s), for election to such positions as are specified in the Company's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice is delivered to the Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices not earlier than the 90th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by our Board to be elected at such meeting.

We will bear the expense of soliciting proxies in the enclosed form. In addition, we might reimburse banks, brokerage firms, and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of our Common Stock, for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to those beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers or employees, personally or by telephone, telegram, facsimile or other means of communication. We do not intend to pay additional compensation for doing so.

The Company shall determine in good faith and in the exercise of its discretion whether an individual has become or has ceased to be an Employee and the effective date of such individual's employment or termination of employment, as the case may be.

(j)to correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award Agreement and to make all other determinations and take such other actions with respect to the Plan or any Award as the Committee may deem advisable to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan or applicable law.
3.5    Option or SAR Repricing.  Without the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Stock cast in person or by proxy at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which a quorum representing a majority of all outstanding shares of Stock is present or represented by proxy, the Committee shall not approve a program providing for either (a) the cancellation of outstanding Options or SARs having exercise prices per share greater than the then Fair Market Value of Stock ("Underwater Awards") and the grant in substitution therefor of new Options or SARs having a lower exercise price, other Awards or payments in cash (except in the event of a Change in Control), or (b) the amendment of outstanding Awards to reduce the exercise price thereof.

4.Shares Subject to Plan.
4.1    Maximum Number of Shares Issuable.  Subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan shall be equal to 4,550,000 shares, and shall consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of Stock or any combination thereof.
4.2    Share Counting.  If an outstanding Award for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled without having been exercised or settled in full, or if shares of Stock acquired pursuant to an Award subject to forfeiture or repurchase are forfeited or repurchased by the Company for an amount not greater than the Participant's purchase price, the shares of Stock allocable to the terminated portion of such Award or such forfeited or repurchased shares of Stock shall again be available for issuance under the Plan.  Shares of Stock shall not be deemed to have been issued pursuant to the Plan with respect to any portion of an Award that is settled in cash.  Upon payment in shares of Stock pursuant to the exercise of an SAR, the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the gross number of shares for which the SAR is exercised.  If the exercise price of an Option is paid by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock owned by the Participant, or by means of a Net Exercise, the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan shall be reduced by the gross number of shares for which the Option is exercised.  Shares withheld or reacquired by the Company in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations pursuant to the exercise or settlement of Options or SARs pursuant to Section 16.2 shall not again be available for issuance under the Plan.  Shares withheld or reacquired by the Company in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations pursuant to the vesting or settlement of Full Value Awards pursuant to Section 16.2 will again become available for issuance under the Plan; provided, however, that any shares so withheld or tendered above the applicable minimum statutory withholding rate will not become available again for issuance under the Plan.
4.3    Adjustments for Changes in Capital Structure.  Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company and the requirements of Sections 409A and 424 of the Code to the extent applicable, in the event of any change in the Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, or in the event of payment of a dividend or distribution to the stockholders of the Company in a form other than Stock (excepting regular, periodic cash dividends) that has a material effect on the Fair Market Value of Stock, appropriate and proportionate adjustments will be made in the number and kind of shares of Stock subject to the Plan and to any outstanding Awards, the Award limits set forth in Section 5.3 and Section 5.4, and in the exercise or purchase price per share of Stock under any outstanding Award in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participants' rights under the Plan.  For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company will not be treated as "effected without receipt of consideration by the Company."  If a majority of the shares which are of the same class as the shares that are subject to outstanding Awards are exchanged for, converted into, or otherwise become (whether or not pursuant to an Ownership Change Event) shares of another corporation (the "New Shares"), the Committee may unilaterally amend the outstanding Awards to provide that such Awards are for New Shares.  In the event of any such amendment, the number of shares subject to, and the exercise or purchase price per share of, the outstanding Awards must be adjusted in a fair and equitable manner as determined by the Committee, in its discretion.  Any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number and the exercise or purchase price per share shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent.  In no event may the exercise or purchase price, if any, under any Award be decreased to an amount less than the par value, if any, of the Stock subject to such Award.  The Committee in its discretion, may also make such adjustments in the terms of any Award to reflect, or related to, such changes in the capital structure of the Company or distributions as it deems appropriate, including modification of Performance Goals, Performance Award Formulas and Performance Periods.  Any adjustments determined by the Committee pursuant to this Section shall be final, binding and conclusive.
4.4    Assumption or Substitution of Awards.  The Committee may, without affecting the number of shares of Stock reserved or available hereunder, authorize the issuance or assumption of benefits under this Plan in connection with any merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, or reorganization upon such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate, subject to compliance with Section 409A and any other applicable provisions of the Code.
5.Eligibility, Participation and Award Limitations.
5.1    Persons Eligible for Awards.  Awards may be granted only to Employees, Consultants and Directors.
5.2    Participation in the Plan.  Awards are granted solely at the discretion of the Committee.  Eligible persons may be granted more than one Award.  However, eligibility in accordance with this Section shall not entitle any person to be granted an Award, or, having been granted an Award, to be granted an additional Award.
5.3    Incentive Stock Option Limitations.
(a)Maximum Number of Shares Issuable Pursuant to Incentive Stock Options.  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.3, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options shall not exceed 4,550,000 shares.  The maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan pursuant to all Awards other than Incentive Stock Options will be the number of shares determined in accordance with Section 4.1, subject to adjustment as provided in Sections 4.2 and 4.3.
(b)Persons Eligible.  An Incentive Stock Option may be granted only to a person who, on the effective date of grant, is an Employee of the Company, a Parent Corporation or a Subsidiary Corporation (each being an "ISO-Qualifying Corporation").  Any person who is not an Employee of an ISO-Qualifying Corporation on the effective date of the grant of an Option to such person may be granted only a Nonstatutory Stock Option.
(c)Fair Market Value Limitation.  To the extent that options designated as Incentive Stock Options (granted under all stock plans of the Participating Company Group, including the Plan) become exercisable by a Participant for the first time during any calendar year for stock having a Fair Market Value greater than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), the portion of such options which exceeds such amount shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options.  For purposes of this Section, options designated as Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted, and the Fair Market Value of Stock shall be determined as of the time the option with respect to such Stock is granted.  If the Code is amended to provide for a limitation different from that set forth in this Section, such different limitation shall be deemed incorporated herein effective as of the date and with respect to such Options as required or permitted by such amendment to the Code.  If an Option is treated as an Incentive Stock Option in part and as a Nonstatutory Stock Option in part by reason of the limitation set forth in this Section, the Participant may designate which portion of such Option the Participant is exercising.  In the absence of such designation, the Participant shall be deemed to have exercised the Incentive Stock Option portion of the Option first.  Upon exercise of the Option, shares of Stock issued pursuant to each such portion shall be separately identified.
5.4    Award Limits.  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.3, no Employee shall be granted within any fiscal year of the Company one or more share-denominated Awards which in the aggregate are for more than 1,250,000 shares or one or more cash-dominated Awards which could result in such Employee receiving more than $2,000,000 or equivalent value in shares for each full fiscal year of the Company contained in the Performance Period for such Award.
5.5    Nonemployee Director Award Limit.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the aggregate grant date fair value (computed as of the date of grant in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States) of all Awards granted to any Nonemployee Director during any fiscal year of the Company shall not exceed $500,000.
5.6    Minimum Vesting.  As provided in Section 4, no Award (other than cash-based Awards) shall vest earlier than one year following the date of grant of such Award; provided that, the foregoing minimum vesting requirement shall not apply to any (a) acceleration of vesting of any Award, including upon death, disability, or in connection with a Change in Control, as determined by the Committee in its discretion, (b) Substitute Awards, (c) Awards to non-employee Directors that vest on the earlier of the one year anniversary of the date of grant or the next annual meeting of stockholders which is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding year's annual meeting, and (d) other Awards up to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.3).
6.Stock Options.
Options shall be evidenced by Award Agreements specifying the number of shares of Stock covered thereby, in such form as the Committee establishes.  Such Award Agreements may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and must comply with and will be subject to the following terms and conditions:
6.1    Exercise Price.  The Committee, in its discretion, shall establish the exercise price for each Option; provided, however, that (a) the exercise price per share will not be less than the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on the effective date of grant of the Option and (b) the exercise price per share for any Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Owner, must be no less than one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on the effective date of grant of the Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Option (whether an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option) may be granted with an exercise price less than the minimum exercise price set forth above if such Option is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option in a manner that would qualify under the provisions of Section 409A or Section 424(a) of the Code.
6.2    Exercisability and Term of Options.  Subject to the minimum vesting provisions of Section 5.6, Options will be exercisable at such time or times, or upon such event or events, and subject to such terms, conditions, performance criteria and restrictions as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Option; provided, however, that (a) no Option will be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years after the effective date of grant of such Option, (b) no Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Owner will be exercisable after the expiration of five (5) years after the effective date of grant of such Option and (c) no Option granted to a Non-Exempt Employee will be first exercisable until at least six (6) months following the date of grant of such Option (except in the event of such Non-Exempt Employee's death, disability or retirement, upon a Change in Control, or as otherwise permitted by the Worker Economic Opportunity Act).  Subject to the foregoing, unless otherwise specified by the Committee in the grant of an Option, each Option terminates ten (10) years after the effective date of grant of the Option, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its provisions.
6.3    Payment of Exercise Price.
(a)Forms of Consideration Authorized.  Except as otherwise provided below, payment of the exercise price for the number of shares of Stock being purchased pursuant to any Option must be made (i) in cash, by check or in cash equivalent; (ii) if permitted by the Committee and subject to the limitations contained in Section 6.3(b), by means of (1) a Cashless Exercise, (2) a Stock Tender Exercise or (3) a Net Exercise; (iii) by such other consideration as may be approved by the Committee from time to time to the extent permitted by applicable law, or (iv) by any combination thereof.  The Committee may from time to time grant Options which do not permit all of the foregoing forms of consideration to be used in payment of the exercise price or which otherwise restrict one or more forms of consideration.
(b)Limitations on Forms of Consideration.
(i)Cashless Exercise.  A "Cashless Exercise" means the delivery of a properly executed notice of exercise together with irrevocable instructions to a broker providing for the assignment to the 
Company of the proceeds of a sale or loan with respect to some or all of the shares of Stock being acquired upon the exercise of the Option (including, without limitation, through an exercise complying with the provisions of Regulation T as promulgated from time to time by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).  The Company reserves, at any and all times, the right, in the Company's sole and absolute discretion, to establish, decline to approve or terminate any program or procedures for the exercise of Options by means of a Cashless Exercise, including with respect to one or more Participants specified by the Company notwithstanding that such program or procedures may be available to other Participants.
(ii)Stock Tender Exercise.  A "Stock Tender Exercise" means the delivery of a properly executed exercise notice accompanied by a Participant's tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, in a form acceptable to the Company of whole shares of Stock owned by the Participant having a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Stock with respect to which the Option is exercised.  A Stock Tender Exercise is not permitted if it would constitute a violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or agreement restricting the redemption of the Company's Stock.  If required by the Company, an Option may not be exercised by tender to the Company, or attestation to the ownership, of shares of Stock unless such shares either have been owned by the Participant for a period of time required by the Company (and not used for another option exercise by attestation during such period) or were not acquired, directly or indirectly, from the Company.
(iii)Net Exercise.  A "Net Exercise" means the delivery of a properly executed exercise notice followed by a procedure pursuant to which (1) the Company will reduce the number of shares otherwise issuable to a Participant upon the exercise of an Option by the largest whole number of shares having a Fair Market Value that does not exceed the aggregate exercise price for the shares with respect to which the Option is exercised, and (2) the Participant shall pay to the Company in cash the remaining balance of such aggregate exercise price not satisfied by such reduction in the number of whole shares to be issued.
6.4    Effect of Termination of Service.
(a)    Option Exercisability.  Subject to earlier termination of the Option as otherwise provided by this Plan and unless otherwise provided by the Committee, a Participant may exercise an Option after the Participant's termination of Service to the extent it is then vested only during the applicable time period determined in accordance with this Section and the Option will thereafter terminate.
(i)    Disability.  If the Participant's Service terminates because of the Disability of the Participant, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable for vested shares of Stock on the date on which the Participant's Service terminated, may be exercised by the Participant (or the Participant's guardian or legal representative) at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months (or such longer or shorter period provided by the Award Agreement) after the date on which the Participant's Service terminated, but in any event no later than the date of expiration of the Option's term as set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Option (the "Option Expiration Date").
(ii)    Death.  If the Participant's Service terminates because of the death of the Participant, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable for vested shares of Stock on the date on which the Participant's Service terminated, may be exercised by the Participant's legal representative or other person who acquired the right to exercise the Option by reason of the Participant's death at any time prior to the expiration of twelve (12) months (or such longer or shorter period provided by the Award Agreement) after the date on which the Participant's Service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.  The Participant's Service will be deemed to have terminated on account of death if the Participant dies within three (3) months (or such longer or shorter period provided by the Award Agreement) after the Participant's termination of Service.
(iii)    Termination for Cause.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if the Participant's Service is terminated for Cause or if, following the Participant's termination of Service and during any period in which the Option otherwise would remain exercisable, the Participant engages in any act that would constitute Cause, the Option will terminate in its entirety and cease to be exercisable immediately upon such termination of Service or act.
(iv)Other Termination of Service.  If the Participant's Service terminates for any reason, except Disability, death or Cause, the Option, to the extent unexercised and exercisable for vested shares of Stock on the date on which the Participant's Service terminated, may be exercised by the Participant at any time prior to the expiration of three (3) months (or such longer or shorter period provided by the Award Agreement) after the date on which the Participant's Service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.
(b)    Extension if Exercise Prevented by Law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than termination of Service for Cause, if the exercise of an Option within the applicable time periods set forth in Section 6.4(a) is prevented by the provisions of Section 14 below, the Option shall remain exercisable until the later of (i) thirty (30) days after the date such exercise first would no longer be prevented by such provisions or (ii) the end of the applicable time period under Section 6.4(a), but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.
6.5    Transferability of Options.  During the lifetime of the Participant, an Option shall be exercisable only by the Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative.  An Option is not subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by the Committee, in its discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Option, an Option shall be assignable or transferable subject to the applicable limitations, if any, described in the General Instructions to Form S‑8 under the Securities Act or, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, only as permitted by applicable regulations under Section 421 of the Code in a manner that does not disqualify such Option as an Incentive Stock Option.  An Option shall never be transferred to a third-party financial institution for value.
7.Stock Appreciation Rights.
Stock Appreciation Rights must be evidenced by Award Agreements specifying the number of shares of Stock subject to the Award, in such form as the Committee establishes.  Such Award Agreements may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and must comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:
7.1    Types of SARs Authorized.  SARs may be granted in tandem with all or any portion of a related Option (a "Tandem SAR") or may be granted independently of any Option (a "Freestanding SAR").  A Tandem SAR may only be granted concurrently with the grant of the related Option.
7.2    Exercise Price.  The exercise price for each SAR will be established in the discretion of the Committee; provided, however, that (a) the exercise price per share subject to a Tandem SAR will be the exercise price per share under the related Option and (b) the exercise price per share subject to a Freestanding SAR may not be less than the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on the effective date of grant of the SAR.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, an SAR may be granted with an exercise price lower than the minimum exercise price set forth above if such SAR is granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another stock appreciation right in a manner that would qualify under the provisions of Section 409A of the Code.
7.3    Exercisability and Term of SARs.
(a)Tandem SARs.  Tandem SARs are exercisable only at the time and to the extent, and only to the extent, that the related Option is exercisable, subject to such provisions as the Committee may specify where the Tandem SAR is granted with respect to less than the full number of shares of Stock subject to the related Option.  The Committee may, in its discretion, provide in any Award Agreement evidencing a Tandem SAR that such SAR may not be exercised without the advance approval of the Company and, if such approval is not given, then the Option will nevertheless remain exercisable in accordance with its terms.  A Tandem SAR will terminate and cease to be exercisable no later than the date on which the related Option expires or is terminated or canceled.  Upon the exercise of a Tandem SAR with respect to some or all of the shares of Stock subject to such SAR, the related Option shall be canceled automatically as to the number of shares with respect to which the Tandem SAR was exercised.  Upon the exercise of an Option related to a Tandem SAR as to some or all of the shares subject to such Option, the related Tandem SAR is canceled automatically as to the number of shares with respect to which the related Option was exercised.
(b)Freestanding SARs.  Subject to the minimum vesting provisions of Section 5.6, Freestanding SARs are exercisable at such time or times, or upon such event or events, and subject to such terms, conditions, performance criteria and restrictions as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR; provided, however, that (i) no Freestanding SAR will be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years after the effective date of grant of such SAR and (ii) no Freestanding SAR granted to a Non-Exempt Employee will be first exercisable until at least six (6) months following the date of grant of such SAR (except in the event of such Non-Exempt Employee's death, disability or retirement, upon a Change in Control, or as otherwise permitted by the Worker Economic Opportunity Act).  Subject to the foregoing, unless otherwise specified by the Committee in the grant of a Freestanding SAR, each Freestanding SAR terminates ten (10) years after the effective date of grant of the SAR, unless earlier terminated in accordance with its provisions.
7.4    Exercise of SARs.  Upon the exercise (or deemed exercise pursuant to Section 7.5) of an SAR, the Participant (or the Participant's legal representative or other person who acquired the right to exercise the SAR by reason of the Participant's death) shall be entitled to receive payment of an amount for each share with respect to which the SAR is exercised equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on the date of exercise of the SAR over the exercise price.  The Company shall pay such amount (a) in the case of a Tandem SAR, solely in shares of Stock in a lump sum upon the date of exercise of the SAR and (b) in the case of a Freestanding SAR, in cash, shares of Stock, or any combination thereof as determined by the Committee, in a lump sum upon the date of exercise of the SAR.  When payment is to be made in shares of Stock, the number of shares to be issued will be determined on the basis of the Fair Market Value of Stock on the date of exercise of the SAR.  For purposes of Section 7, an SAR is deemed exercised on the date on which the Company receives notice of exercise from the Participant or as otherwise provided in Section 7.5.
7.5    Deemed Exercise of SARs.  If, on the date on which an SAR would otherwise terminate or expire, the SAR by its terms remains exercisable immediately prior to such termination or expiration and, if so exercised, would result in a payment to the holder of such SAR, then any portion of such SAR which has not previously been exercised is automatically deemed to be exercised as of such date with respect to such portion.
7.6    Effect of Termination of Service.  Subject to earlier termination of the SAR as otherwise provided herein and unless otherwise provided by the Committee, an SAR shall be exercisable after a Participant's termination of Service only to the extent and during the applicable time period determined in accordance with Section 6.4 (treating the SAR as if it were an Option) and thereafter terminates.
7.7    Transferability of SARs.  During the lifetime of the Participant, an SAR is only exercisable by the Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative.  An SAR is not subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permitted by the Committee, in its discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award, a Tandem SAR related to a Nonstatutory Stock Option or a Freestanding SAR is assignable or transferable subject to the applicable limitations, if any, described in the General Instructions to Form S‑8 under the Securities Act.
8.Restricted Stock Awards.
Restricted Stock Awards must be evidenced by Award Agreements specifying whether the Award is a Restricted Stock Bonus or a Restricted Stock Purchase Right and the number of shares of Stock subject to the Award, in such form as the Committee establishes.  Such Award Agreements may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:
8.1    Types of Restricted Stock Awards Authorized.  Restricted Stock Awards may be granted in the form of either a Restricted Stock Bonus or a Restricted Stock Purchase Right.  Restricted Stock Awards may be granted upon such conditions as the Committee shall determine, including, without limitation, upon the attainment of one or more Performance Goals described in Section 10.4.  If either the grant of or satisfaction of Vesting Conditions applicable to a Restricted Stock Award is to be contingent upon the attainment of one or more Performance Goals, the Committee shall follow procedures substantially equivalent to those set forth in Sections 10.3 through 10.5(a).
8.2    Purchase Price.  The purchase price for shares of Stock issuable under each Restricted Stock Purchase Right will be established by the Committee in its discretion.  No monetary payment (other than applicable tax withholding) is required as a condition of receiving shares of Stock pursuant to a Restricted Stock Bonus, the consideration for which is services actually rendered to a Participating Company or for its benefit.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if required by applicable state corporate law, the Participant shall furnish consideration in the form of cash or past services rendered to a Participating Company or for its benefit having a value not less than the par value of the shares of Stock subject to a Restricted Stock Award.
8.3    Purchase Period.  A Restricted Stock Purchase Right is exercisable within the period established by the Committee, which shall in no event exceed thirty (30) days from the effective date of the grant of the Restricted Stock Purchase Right.
8.4    Payment of Purchase Price.  Except as otherwise provided below, payment of the purchase price for the number of shares of Stock being purchased pursuant to any Restricted Stock Purchase Right shall be made (a) in cash, by check or in cash equivalent, (b) by such other consideration as may be approved by the Committee from time to time to the extent permitted by applicable law, or (c) by any combination thereof.
8.5    Vesting and Restrictions on Transfer.  Subject to the minimum vesting provisions of Section 5.6, shares issued pursuant to any Restricted Stock Award may (but need not) be made subject to Vesting Conditions based upon the satisfaction of such Service requirements, conditions, restrictions or performance criteria, including, without limitation, Performance Goals as described in Section 10.4, as established by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award.  During any period in which shares acquired pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award remain subject to Vesting Conditions, such shares may not be sold, exchanged, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise disposed of other than pursuant to an Ownership Change Event or as provided in Section 8.8.  The Committee, in its discretion, may provide in any Award Agreement evidencing a Restricted Stock Award that, if the satisfaction of Vesting Conditions with respect to any shares subject to such Restricted Stock Award would otherwise occur on a day on which the sale of such shares would violate the provisions of the Trading Compliance Policy, then satisfaction of the Vesting Conditions automatically shall be determined on the next trading day on which the sale of such shares would not violate the Trading Compliance Policy.  Upon request by the Company, each Participant shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such transfer restrictions.
8.6    Voting Rights; Dividends and Distributions.  Except as provided in this Section 8.6, Section 8.5 and any Award Agreement, during any period in which shares acquired pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award remain subject to Vesting Conditions, the Participant shall have all of the rights of a stockholder of the Company holding shares of Stock, including the right to vote such shares and to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such shares; provided, however, that such dividends and distributions shall be subject to the same Vesting Conditions as the shares subject to the Restricted Stock Award with respect to which such dividends or distributions were paid.  In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or other property or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.3, any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than regular, periodic cash dividends) to which the Participant is entitled by reason of the Participant's Restricted Stock Award shall be immediately subject to the same Vesting Conditions as the shares subject to the Restricted Stock Award with respect to which such dividends or distributions were paid or adjustments were made.
8.7    Effect of Termination of Service.  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the Award Agreement evidencing a Restricted Stock Award, if a Participant's Service terminates for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary (including the Participant's death or disability), then (a) the Company shall have the option to repurchase for the purchase price paid by the Participant any shares acquired by the Participant pursuant to a Restricted Stock Purchase Right which remain subject to Vesting Conditions as of the date of the Participant's termination of Service and (b) the Participant shall forfeit to the Company any shares acquired by the Participant pursuant to a Restricted Stock Bonus which remain subject to Vesting Conditions as of the date of the Participant's termination of Service.  The Company shall have the right to assign at any time any repurchase right it may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company.
8.8    Nontransferability of Restricted Stock Award Rights.  Rights to acquire shares of Stock pursuant to a Restricted Stock Award are not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, except transfer by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  All rights with respect to a Restricted Stock Award granted to a Participant hereunder shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative.
9.Restricted Stock Units.
Restricted Stock Unit Awards must be evidenced by Award Agreements specifying the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award, in such form as the Committee establishes.  Such Award Agreements may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:
9.1    Grant of Restricted Stock Unit Awards.  Restricted Stock Unit Awards may be granted upon such conditions as the Committee shall determine, including, without limitation, upon the attainment of one or more Performance Goals described in Section 10.4.  If either the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit Award or the Vesting Conditions with respect to such Award is to be contingent upon the attainment of one or more Performance Goals, the Committee shall follow procedures substantially equivalent to those set forth in Sections 10.3 through 10.5(a).
9.2    Purchase Price.  No monetary payment (other than applicable tax withholding, if any) may be required as a condition of receiving a Restricted Stock Unit Award, the consideration for which shall be services actually rendered to a Participating Company or for its benefit.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if required by applicable state corporate law, the Participant shall furnish consideration in the form of cash or past services rendered to a Participating Company or for its benefit having a value not less than the par value of the shares of Stock issued upon settlement of the Restricted Stock Unit Award.
9.3    Vesting.  Subject to the minimum vesting provisions of Section 5.6, Restricted Stock Unit Awards may (but need not) be made subject to Vesting Conditions based upon the satisfaction of such Service requirements, conditions, restrictions or performance criteria, including, without limitation, Performance Goals as described in Section 10.4, as established by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award.
9.4    Voting Rights, Dividend Equivalent Rights and Distributions.  Participants have no voting rights with respect to shares of Stock represented by Restricted Stock Units until the date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).  However, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any Restricted Stock Unit Award that the Participant shall be entitled to Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock during the period beginning on the date such Award is granted and ending, with respect to each share subject to the Award, on the earlier of the date the Award is settled or the date on which it is terminated.  Dividend Equivalent Rights, if any, will be paid by crediting the Participant with a cash amount or with additional whole Restricted Stock Units as of the date of payment of such cash dividends on Stock, as determined by the Committee.  The number of additional Restricted Stock Units (rounded to the nearest whole number), if any, to be credited will be determined by dividing (a) the amount of cash dividends paid on the dividend payment date with respect to the number of shares of Stock represented by the Restricted Stock Units previously credited to the Participant by (b) the Fair Market Value of Stock on such date. Such cash amount or additional Restricted Stock Units are subject to the same terms and conditions and must be settled in the same manner and at the same time as the Restricted Stock Units originally subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Award.  In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or other property or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.3, appropriate adjustments will be made in the Participant's Restricted Stock Unit Award so that it represents the right to receive upon settlement any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than regular, periodic cash dividends) to which the Participant would be entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of the Award, and all such new, substituted or additional securities or other property are immediately subject to the same Vesting Conditions as are applicable to the Award.
9.5    Effect of Termination of Service.  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing a Restricted Stock Unit Award, if a Participant's Service terminates for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary (including the Participant's death or disability), then the Participant shall forfeit to the Company any Restricted Stock Units pursuant to the Award which remain subject to Vesting Conditions as of the date of the Participant's termination of Service.
9.6    Settlement of Restricted Stock Unit Awards.  The Company shall issue to a Participant on the date on which Restricted Stock Units subject to the Participant's Restricted Stock Unit Award vest or on such other date determined by the Committee in compliance with Section 409A, if applicable, and set forth in the Award Agreement one (1) share of Stock (and/or any other new, substituted or additional securities or other property pursuant to an adjustment described in Section 9.4) for each Restricted Stock Unit then becoming vested or otherwise to be settled on such date, subject to the withholding of applicable taxes, if any.  The Committee, in its discretion, may provide in any Award Agreement evidencing a Restricted Stock Unit Award that if the settlement date with respect to any shares issuable upon vesting of Restricted Stock Units would otherwise occur on a day on which the sale of such shares would violate the provisions of the Trading Compliance Policy, then the settlement date will be deferred until the next trading day on which the sale of such shares would not violate the Trading Compliance Policy but in any event no later than the 15th day of the third calendar month following the year in which such Restricted Stock Units vest.  If permitted by the Committee, the Participant may elect, consistent with the requirements of Section 409A, to defer receipt of all or any portion of the shares of Stock or other property otherwise issuable to the Participant pursuant to this Section, and such deferred issuance date(s) and amount(s) elected by the Participant must be set forth in the Award Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide for settlement of any Restricted Stock Unit Award by payment to the Participant in cash of an amount equal to the Fair Market Value on the payment date of the shares of Stock or other property otherwise issuable to the Participant pursuant to this Section.
9.7    Nontransferability of Restricted Stock Unit Awards.  The right to receive shares pursuant to a Restricted Stock Unit Award is not subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  All rights with respect to a Restricted Stock Unit Award granted to a Participant hereunder will be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative.
10.Performance Awards.
Performance Awards must be evidenced by Award Agreements in such form as the Committee establishes.  Such Award Agreements may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and must comply with and will be subject to the following terms and conditions:
10.1    Types of Performance Awards Authorized.  Performance Awards may be granted in the form of either Performance Shares or Performance Units.  Each Award Agreement evidencing a Performance Award must specify the number of Performance Shares or Performance Units subject thereto, the Performance Award Formula, the Performance Goal(s) and Performance Period applicable to the Award, and the other terms, conditions and restrictions of the Award.
10.2    Initial Value of Performance Shares and Performance Units.  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in granting a Performance Award, each Performance Share has an initial monetary value equal to the Fair Market Value of one (1) share of Stock, subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.3, on the effective date of grant of the Performance Share, and each Performance Unit has an initial monetary value established by the Committee at the time of grant.  The final value payable to the Participant in settlement of a Performance Award determined on the basis of the applicable Performance Award Formula will depend on the extent to which Performance Goals established by the Committee are attained within the applicable Performance Period established by the Committee.
10.3    Establishment of Performance Period, Performance Goals and Performance Award Formula.  In granting each Performance Award, the Committee shall establish in writing the applicable Performance Period (subject to the minimum vesting provisions of Section 5.6), Performance Award Formula and one or more Performance Goals which, when measured at the end of the Performance Period, shall determine on the basis of the 
Performance Award Formula the final value of the Performance Award to be paid to the Participant. The Company shall notify each Participant granted a Performance Award of the terms of such Award, including the Performance Period, Performance Goal(s) and Performance Award Formula.
10.4    Measurement of Performance Goals.  Performance Goals must be established by the Committee on the basis of targets to be attained ("Performance Targets") with respect to one or more measures of business or financial performance (each, a "Performance Measure"), subject to the following:
(a)Performance Measures.  Performance Measures must be calculated in accordance with the Company's financial statements, or, if such measures are not reported in the Company's financial statements, they must be calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, a method used generally in the Company's industry, or in accordance with a methodology established by the Committee prior to the grant of the Performance Award.  As specified by the Committee, Performance Measures may be calculated with respect to the Company and each Subsidiary Corporation consolidated therewith for financial reporting purposes, one or more Subsidiary Corporations or such division or other business unit of any of them selected by the Committee.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Performance Measures applicable to the Performance Award will be calculated prior to the accrual of expense for any Performance Award for the same Performance Period and excluding the effect (whether positive or negative) on the Performance Measures of any event the Committee determines is appropriate to exclude, including change in accounting standards or any unusual or infrequently occurring event or transaction.  Each such adjustment, if any, shall be made solely for the purpose of providing a consistent basis from period to period for the calculation of Performance Measures in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of the Participant's rights with respect to a Performance Award.  Performance Measures may be based upon one or more of the following, as determined by the Committee (or any other metric or goal as the Committee may determine):  revenue; sales; expenses; operating income; gross margin; operating margin; earnings before any one or more of: stock-based compensation expense, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; pre-tax profit; net operating income; net income; economic value added; free cash flow; operating cash flow; balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; stock price; earnings per share; return on stockholder equity; return on capital; return on assets; return on investment; total stockholder return; employee satisfaction; employee retention; market share; customer satisfaction; product development; research and development expenses; completion of an identified special project; completion of a joint venture or other corporate transaction; and bookings.
(b)Performance Targets.  Performance Targets may include a minimum, maximum, target level and intermediate levels of performance, with the final value of a Performance Award determined under the applicable Performance Award Formula by the Performance Target level attained during the applicable Performance Period.  A Performance Target may be stated as an absolute value, an increase or decrease in a value, or as a value determined relative to an index, budget or other standard selected by the Committee.
10.5    Settlement of Performance Awards.
(a)    Determination of Final Value.  As soon as practicable following the completion of the Performance Period applicable to a Performance Award, the Committee shall certify in writing the extent to which the applicable Performance Goals have been attained and the resulting final value of the Award earned by the Participant and to be paid upon its settlement in accordance with the applicable Performance Award Formula.
(b)    Discretionary Adjustment of Award Formula.  In its discretion, the Committee may, either at the time it grants a Performance Award or at any time thereafter, provide for the positive or negative adjustment of the Performance Award Formula applicable to a Performance Award granted to any Participant to reflect such Participant's individual performance in his or her position with the Company or such other factors as the Committee may determine.  The Committee shall have the discretion, on the basis of such criteria as may be established by the Committee, to reduce some or all of the value of the Performance Award that would otherwise be paid to the Employee upon its settlement notwithstanding the attainment of any Performance Goal and the resulting value of the Performance Award determined in accordance with the Performance Award Formula.
(c)Effect of Leaves of Absence.  Unless otherwise required by law or a Participant's Award Agreement, payment of the final value, if any, of a Performance Award held by a Participant who has taken in excess of thirty (30) days in unpaid leaves of absence during a Performance Period will be prorated on the basis of the number of days of the Participant's Service during the Performance Period during which the Participant was not on an unpaid leave of absence.
(d)Notice to Participants.  As soon as practicable following the Committee's determination and certification in accordance with Sections 10.5(a) and (b), the Company shall notify each Participant of the determination of the Committee.
(e)Payment in Settlement of Performance Awards.  As soon as practicable following the Committee's determination and certification in accordance with Sections 10.5(a) and (b), but in any event within the Short-Term Deferral Period described in Section 15.1 (except as otherwise provided below or consistent with the requirements of Section 409A), payment will be made to each eligible Participant (or such Participant's legal representative or other person who acquired the right to receive such payment by reason of the Participant's death) of the final value of the Participant's Performance Award.  Payment of such amount will be made in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee.  Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement evidencing a Performance Award, payment will be made in a lump sum.  If permitted by the Committee, the Participant may elect, consistent with the requirements of Section 409A, to defer receipt of all or any portion of the payment to be made to the Participant pursuant to this Section, and such deferred payment date(s) elected by the Participant must be set forth in the Award Agreement.  If any payment is to be made on a deferred basis, the Committee may, but is not obligated to, provide for the payment during the deferral period of Dividend Equivalent Rights or interest.
(f)Provisions Applicable to Payment in Shares.  If payment is to be made in shares of Stock, the number of such shares of Stock shall be determined by dividing the final value of the Performance Award by the Fair Market Value of Stock determined by the method specified in the Award Agreement.  Shares of Stock issued in payment of any Performance Award may be fully vested and freely transferable shares or may be shares of Stock subject to Vesting Conditions as provided in Section 8.5.  Any shares subject to Vesting Conditions must be evidenced by an appropriate Award Agreement and will be subject to the provisions of Sections 8.5 through 8.8 above.
10.6    Voting Rights; Dividend Equivalent Rights and Distributions.  Participants have no voting rights with respect to shares of Stock represented by Performance Share Awards until the date of the issuance of such shares, if any (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).  However, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any Performance Share Award that the Participant will be entitled to Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock during the period beginning on the date the Award is granted and ending, with respect to each share subject to the Award, on the earlier of the date on which the Performance Shares are settled or the date on which they are forfeited.  Such Dividend Equivalent Rights, if any, will be credited to the Participant either in cash or in the form of additional whole Performance Shares as of the date of payment of such cash dividends on Stock, as determined by the Committee.  The number of additional Performance Shares (rounded to the nearest whole number), if any, to be so credited shall be determined by dividing (a) the amount of cash dividends paid on the dividend payment date with respect to the number of shares of Stock represented by the Performance Shares previously credited to the Participant by (b) the Fair Market Value per share of Stock on such date.  Dividend Equivalent Rights, if any, will be accumulated and paid to the extent that the related Performance Shares become nonforfeitable.  Settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights may be made in cash, shares of Stock, or a combination thereof as determined by the Committee, and may be paid on the same basis as settlement of the related Performance Share as provided in Section 10.5.  Dividend Equivalent Rights will not be paid with respect to Performance Units.  In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or other property or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.3, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the Participant's Performance Share Award so that it represents the right to receive upon settlement any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than regular, periodic cash dividends) to which the Participant would be entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of the Performance Share Award, and all such new, substituted or additional securities or other property shall be immediately subject to the same Performance Goals as are applicable to the Award.
10.7    Effect of Termination of Service.  Unless otherwise provided by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing a Performance Award, the effect of a Participant's termination of Service on the Performance Award will be as follows:
(a)    Death or Disability.  If the Participant's Service terminates because of the death or Disability of the Participant before the completion of the Performance Period applicable to the Performance Award, the final value of the Participant's Performance Award will be determined by the extent to which the applicable Performance Goals have been attained with respect to the entire Performance Period and will be prorated based on the number of months of the Participant's Service during the Performance Period.  Payment will be made following the end of the Performance Period in any manner permitted by Section 10.5.
(b)    Other Termination of Service.  If the Participant's Service terminates for any reason except death or Disability before the completion of the Performance Period applicable to the Performance Award, such Award is forfeited in its entirety; provided, however, that in the event of an involuntary termination of the Participant's Service, the Committee, in its discretion, may waive the automatic forfeiture of all or any portion of any such Award and determine the final value of the Performance Award in the manner provided by Section 10.7(a).  Payment of any amount pursuant to this Section will be made following the end of the Performance Period in any manner permitted by Section 10.5.
10.8    Nontransferability of Performance Awards.  Prior to settlement in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, no Performance Award is subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  All rights with respect to a Performance Award granted to a Participant hereunder is exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant or the Participant's guardian or legal representative.
11.Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards.
Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards must be evidenced by Award Agreements in such form as the Committee establishes.  Such Award Agreements may incorporate all or any of the terms of the Plan by reference and will comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:
11.1    Grant of Cash-Based Awards.  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee, at any time and from time to time, may grant Cash-Based Awards to Participants in such amounts and upon such terms and conditions, including the achievement of performance criteria, as the Committee determines.
11.2    Grant of Other Stock-Based Awards.  The Committee may grant other types of equity-based or equity-related Awards not otherwise described by the terms of this Plan (including the grant or offer for sale of unrestricted securities, stock-equivalent units, stock appreciation units, securities or debentures convertible into common stock or other forms determined by the Committee) in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine.  Other Stock-Based Awards may be made available as a form of payment in the settlement of other Awards or as payment in lieu of compensation to which a Participant is otherwise entitled.  Other Stock-Based Awards may involve the transfer of actual shares of Stock to Participants, or payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of Stock and may include, without limitation, Awards designed to comply with or take advantage of the applicable local laws of jurisdictions other than the United States.
11.3    Value of Cash-Based and Other Stock-Based Awards.  Each Cash-Based Award shall specify a monetary payment amount or payment range as determined by the Committee.  Each Other Stock-Based Award must be expressed in terms of shares of Stock or units based on such shares of Stock, as determined by the Committee.  Subject to the minimum vesting provisions of Section 5.6, The Committee may require the satisfaction of such Service requirements, conditions, restrictions or performance criteria, including, without limitation, Performance Goals as described in Section 10.4, as  established by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award.  If the Committee exercises its discretion to establish performance criteria, the final value of Cash-Based Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards that will be paid to the Participant will depend on the extent to which the performance criteria are met.  The establishment of performance criteria with respect to the grant or vesting of any Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award shall follow procedures substantially equivalent to those applicable to Performance Awards set forth in Section 10.
11.4    Payment or Settlement of Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards.  Payment or settlement, if any, with respect to a Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award will be made in accordance with the terms of the Award, in cash, shares of Stock or other securities or any combination thereof as the Committee determines.  The determination and certification of the final value with respect to any Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award will comply with the requirements applicable to Performance Awards set forth in Section 10.  To the extent applicable, payment or settlement with respect to each Cash-Based Award and Other Stock-Based Award shall be made in compliance with the requirements of Section 409A.
11.5    Voting Rights; Dividend Equivalent Rights and Distributions.  Participants have no voting rights with respect to shares of Stock represented by Other Stock-Based Awards until the date of the issuance of such shares of Stock (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), if any, in settlement of such Award.  However, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any Other Stock-Based Award that the Participant shall be entitled to Dividend Equivalent Rights with respect to the payment of cash dividends on Stock during the period beginning on the date such Award is granted and ending, with respect to each share subject to the Award, on the earlier of the date the Award is settled or the date on which it is terminated.  Such Dividend Equivalent Rights, if any, will be paid in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 9.4.  Dividend Equivalent Rights are not granted with respect to Cash-Based Awards.  In the event of a dividend or distribution paid in shares of Stock or other property or any other adjustment made upon a change in the capital structure of the Company as described in Section 4.3, appropriate adjustments will be made in the Participant's Other Stock-Based Award so that it represents the right to receive upon settlement any and all new, substituted or additional securities or other property (other than regular, periodic cash dividends) to which the Participant would be entitled by reason of the shares of Stock issuable upon settlement of such Award, and all such new, substituted or additional securities or other property are immediately subject to the same Vesting Conditions and performance criteria, if any, as are applicable to the Award.
11.6    Effect of Termination of Service.  Each Award Agreement evidencing a Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award must set forth the extent to which the Participant shall have the right to retain such Award following termination of the Participant's Service.  Such provisions will be determined in the discretion of the Committee, need not be uniform among all Cash-Based Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination, subject to the requirements of Section 409A, if applicable.
11.7    Nontransferability of Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards.  Prior to the payment or settlement of a Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award, the Award is not subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, or garnishment by creditors of the Participant or the Participant's beneficiary, except transfer by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  The Committee may impose such additional restrictions on any shares of Stock issued in settlement of Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards as it may deem advisable, including, without limitation, minimum holding period requirements, restrictions under applicable federal securities laws, under the requirements of any stock exchange or market upon which such shares of Stock are then listed and/or traded, or under any state securities laws or foreign law applicable to such shares of Stock.
12.Standard Forms of Award Agreement.
12.1    Award Agreements.  Each Award must comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the appropriate form of Award Agreement approved by the Committee and as amended from time to time.  No Award or purported Award is a valid and binding obligation of the Company unless evidenced by a fully executed Award Agreement, which execution may be evidenced by electronic means.
12.2    Authority to Vary Terms.  The Committee has the authority from time to time to vary the terms of any standard form of Award Agreement either in connection with the grant or amendment of an individual Award or in connection with the authorization of a new standard form or forms; provided, however, that the terms and conditions of any such new, revised or amended standard form or forms of Award Agreement are not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan.
13.Change in Control.
13.1    Effect of Change in Control on Awards.  In the event of a Change in Control, outstanding Awards will be subject to the definitive agreement entered into by the Company in connection with the Change in Control.  Subject to the requirements and limitations of Section 409A, if applicable, the Committee may provide for any one or more of the following:
(a)Accelerated Vesting.  In its discretion, the Committee may provide in the grant of any Award or at any other time may take such action as it deems appropriate to provide for acceleration of the exercisability, vesting and/or settlement in connection with a Change in Control of each or any outstanding Award or portion thereof and shares acquired pursuant thereto upon such conditions, including termination of the Participant's Service prior to, upon, or following the Change in Control, and to such extent as the Committee determines.
(b)Assumption, Continuation or Substitution.  In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the "Acquiror"), may, without the consent of any Participant, assume or continue the Company's rights and obligations under each or any Award or portion thereof outstanding immediately prior to the Change in Control or substitute for each or any such outstanding Award or portion thereof a substantially equivalent award with respect to the Acquiror's stock, as applicable.  For purposes of this Section, if so determined by the Committee in its discretion, an Award denominated in shares of Stock will be deemed assumed if, following the Change in Control, the Award confers the right to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the applicable Award Agreement, for each share of Stock subject to the Award immediately prior to the Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, other securities or property or a combination thereof) to which a holder of a share of Stock on the effective date of the Change in Control was entitled (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Stock); provided, however, that if such consideration is not solely common stock of the Acquiror, the Committee may, with the consent of the Acquiror, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise or settlement of the Award, for each share of Stock subject to the Award, to consist solely of common stock of the Acquiror equal in Fair Market Value to the per share consideration received by holders of Stock pursuant to the Change in Control.  Any Award or portion thereof which is neither assumed or continued by the Acquiror in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised or settled as of the time of consummation of the Change in Control will become immediately exercisable and vested in full (a) as of ten (10) days prior to, and subject to, the consummation of the Change in Control or (b) settled effective immediately prior to the time of consummation of the Change in Control, as applicable.  Any Award or portion thereof that is immediately exercisable and vested in full pursuant to the preceding sentence to the extent unexercised immediately prior to the consummation of the Change in Control shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the time of the consummation of the Change in Control.
(c)Termination in Connection with a Change in Control.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if the Participant's Service is terminated without Cause or the Participant voluntarily terminates the Participant's employment after a reduction of the Participant's base salary of fifteen percent (15%) or greater without the Participant's express written consent within eighteen (18) months following the consummation of a Change in Control, such Participant's Awards will become immediately exercisable and vested in full as of the date of such termination.  Such immediately exercisable and fully vested Awards will be settled to the extent possible on the date of the Participant's termination pursuant to this subsection (c).  Awards requiring the Participant's exercise, may be exercised by the Participant at any time prior to the expiration of three (3) months after the date on which the Participant's Service terminated, but in any event no later than the Option Expiration Date.
(d)Cash-Out of Outstanding Stock-Based Awards.  The Committee may, in its discretion and without the consent of any Participant, determine that, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, each or any Award denominated in shares of Stock or portion thereof outstanding immediately prior to the Change in Control and not previously exercised or settled shall be canceled in exchange for a payment with respect to each vested share (and each unvested share, if so determined by the Committee) of Stock subject to such canceled Award in (i) cash, (ii) stock of the Company or of a corporation or other business entity a party to the Change in Control, or (iii) other property which, in any such case, will be in an amount having a Fair Market Value equal to the Fair Market Value of the consideration to be paid per share of Stock in the Change in Control, reduced (but not below zero) by the exercise or purchase price per share, if any, under such Award.  In the event such determination is made by the Committee, an Award having an exercise or purchase price per share equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value of the consideration to be paid per share of Stock in the Change in Control may be canceled without payment of consideration to the holder thereof.  Payment pursuant to this Section (reduced by applicable withholding taxes, if any) will be made to Participants in respect of the vested portions of their canceled Awards as soon as practicable following the date of the Change in Control and in respect of the unvested portions of their canceled Awards in accordance with the vesting schedules applicable to such Awards.
13.2    Effect of Change in Control on Nonemployee Director Awards.  Subject to the requirements and limitations of Section 409A, if applicable, including as provided by Section 15.4(f), in the event of a Change in Control, each outstanding Nonemployee Director Award shall become immediately exercisable and vested in full and, except to the extent assumed, continued or substituted for pursuant to Section 13.1(b), will be settled effective immediately prior to the time of consummation of the Change in Control.
13.3    Federal Excise Tax Under Section 4999 of the Code.
(a)    Excess Parachute Payment.  If any acceleration of vesting pursuant to an Award and any other payment or benefit received or to be received by a Participant would subject the Participant to any excise tax pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code due to the characterization of such acceleration of vesting, payment or benefit as an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code, then, provided such election would not subject the Participant to taxation under Section 409A, the Participant may elect to reduce the amount of any acceleration of vesting called for under the Award in order to avoid such characterization.
(b)    Determination by Tax Firm.  To aid the Participant in making any election called for under Section 13.3(a), no later than the date of the occurrence of any event that might reasonably be anticipated to result in an "excess parachute payment" to the Participant as described in Section 13.3(a), the Company shall request a determination in writing by the professional firm engaged by the Company for general tax purposes, or, if the tax firm so engaged by the Company is serving as accountant or auditor for the Acquiror, the Company will appoint a nationally recognized tax firm to make the determinations required by this Section (the "Tax Firm").  As soon as practicable thereafter, the Tax Firm shall determine and report to the Company and the Participant the amount of such acceleration of vesting, payments and benefits which would produce the greatest after-tax benefit to the Participant.  For the purposes of such determination, the Tax Firm may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code.  The Company and the Participant shall furnish to the Tax Firm such information and documents as the Tax Firm may reasonably request in order to make its required determination.  The Company shall bear all fees and expenses the Tax Firm charges in connection with its services contemplated by this Section.
14.Compliance with Securities Law.
The grant of Awards and the issuance of shares of Stock pursuant to any Award is subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and foreign law with respect to such securities and the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed.  In addition, no Award may be exercised or shares issued pursuant to an Award unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act is at the time of such exercise or issuance in effect with respect to the shares issuable pursuant to the Award, or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable pursuant to the Award may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.  The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares under the Plan will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.  As a condition to issuance of any Stock, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.
15.    Compliance with Section 409A.
15.1    Awards Subject to Section 409A.  The Company intends that Awards granted pursuant to the Plan either be exempt from or comply with Section 409A, and the Plan shall be so construed.  The provisions of this Section 15 apply to any Award or portion thereof that constitutes or provides for payment of Section 409A Deferred Compensation.  Such Awards may include, without limitation:
(a)A Nonstatutory Stock Option or SAR that includes any feature for the deferral of compensation other than the deferral of recognition of income until the later of (i) the exercise or disposition of the Award or (ii) the time the stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Award first becomes substantially vested.
(b)Any Restricted Stock Unit Award, Performance Award, Cash-Based Award or Other Stock-Based Award that either (i) provides by its terms for settlement of all or any portion of the Award at a time or upon an event that will or may occur later than the end of the Short-Term Deferral Period (as defined below) or (ii) permits the Participant granted the Award to elect one or more dates or events upon which the Award will be settled after the end of the Short-Term Deferral Period.
Subject to the provisions of Section 409A, the term "Short-Term Deferral Period" means the 2½ month period ending on the later of (i) the 15th day of the third month following the end of the Participant's taxable year in which the right to payment under the applicable portion of the Award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or (ii) the 15th day of the third month following the end of the Company's taxable year in which the right to payment under the applicable portion of the Award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.  For this purpose, the term "substantial risk of forfeiture" has the meaning provided by Section 409A.
15.2    Deferral and/or Distribution Elections.  Except as otherwise permitted or required by Section 409A, the following rules applies to any compensation deferral and/or payment elections (each, an "Election") that may be permitted or required by the Committee pursuant to an Award providing Section 409A Deferred Compensation:
(a)    Elections must be in writing and specify the amount of the payment in settlement of an Award being deferred, as well as the time and form of payment as permitted by this Plan.
(b)    Elections must be made by the end of the Participant's taxable year prior to the year in which services commence for which an Award may be granted to the Participant.
(c)Elections  continue in effect until a written revocation or change in Election is received by the Company, except that a written revocation or change in Election must be received by the Company prior to the last day for making the Election determined in accordance with paragraph (b) above or as permitted by Section 15.3.
15.3    Subsequent Elections.  Except as otherwise permitted or required by Section 409A, any Award providing Section 409A Deferred Compensation which permits a subsequent Election to delay the payment or change the form of payment in settlement of such Award must comply with the following requirements:
(a)    No subsequent Election may take effect until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which the subsequent Election is made.
(b)    Each subsequent Election related to a payment in settlement of an Award not described in Section 15.4(a)(ii), 15.4(a)(iii) or 15.4(a)(vi) must result in a delay of the payment for a period of not less than five (5) years from the date on which such payment would otherwise have been made.
(c)    No subsequent Election related to a payment pursuant to Section 15.4(a)(iv) may be made less than twelve (12) months before the date on which such payment would otherwise have been made.
(d)Subsequent Elections continue in effect until a written revocation or change in the subsequent Election is received by the Company, except that a written revocation or change in a subsequent Election must be received by the Company prior to the last day for making the subsequent Election determined in accordance the preceding paragraphs of this Section 15.3.
15.4    Payment of Section 409A Deferred Compensation.
(a)    Permissible Payments.  Except as otherwise permitted or required by Section 409A, an Award providing Section 409A Deferred Compensation must provide for payment in settlement of the Award only upon one or more of the following:
(i)The Participant's "separation from service" (as defined by Section 409A);
(ii)The Participant's becoming "disabled" (as defined by Section 409A);
(iii)The Participant's death;
(iv)A time or fixed schedule that is either (i) specified by the Committee upon the grant of an Award and set forth in the Award Agreement evidencing such Award or (ii) specified by the Participant in an Election complying with the requirements of Section 15.2 or 15.3, as applicable;
(v)A change in the ownership or effective control or the Company or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company determined in accordance with Section 409A; or
(vi)The occurrence of an "unforeseeable emergency" (as defined by Section 409A).
(b)    Installment Payments.  It is the intent of this Plan that any right of a Participant to receive installment payments (within the meaning of Section 409A) will, for all purposes of Section 409A, be treated as a right to a series of separate payments.
(c)    Required Delay in Payment to Specified Employee Pursuant to Separation from Service.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, except as otherwise permitted by Section 409A and to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of taxes under Section 409A, no payment pursuant to Section 15.4(a)(i) in settlement of an Award providing for Section 409A Deferred Compensation may be made to a Participant who is a "specified employee" (as defined by Section 409A) as of the date of the Participant's separation from service before the date (the "Delayed Payment Date") that is six (6) months after the date of such Participant's separation from service, or, if earlier, the date of the Participant's death.  All such amounts that would, but for this paragraph, become payable prior to the Delayed Payment Date will be accumulated and paid on the Delayed Payment Date.
(d)    Payment Upon Disability.  All distributions of Section 409A Deferred Compensation payable pursuant to Section 15.4(a)(ii) by reason of a Participant becoming disabled will be paid in a lump sum or in periodic installments as established by the Participant's Election.  If the Participant has made no Election with respect to distributions of Section 409A Deferred Compensation upon becoming disabled, all such distributions will be paid in a lump sum upon the determination that the Participant has become disabled.
(e)Payment Upon Death.  If a Participant dies before complete distribution of amounts payable upon settlement of an Award subject to Section 409A, such undistributed amounts will be distributed to his or her beneficiary under the distribution method for death established by the Participant's Election upon receipt by the Committee of satisfactory notice and confirmation of the Participant's death.  If the Participant has made no Election with respect to distributions of Section 409A Deferred Compensation upon death, all such distributions will be paid in a lump sum upon receipt by the Committee of satisfactory notice and confirmation of the Participant's death.
(f)Payment Upon Change in Control.  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any amount constituting Section 409A Deferred Compensation would become payable under this Plan by reason of a Change in Control, such amount will become payable only if the event constituting a Change in Control would also constitute a change in ownership or effective control of the Company or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company within the meaning of Section 409A.  Any Award which constitutes Section 409A Deferred Compensation and which would vest and otherwise become payable upon a Change in Control as a result of the failure of the Acquiror to assume, continue or substitute for such Award in accordance with Section 13.1(b) will vest to the extent provided by such Award but will be converted automatically at the effective time of such Change in Control into a right to receive, in cash on the date or dates such award would have been settled in accordance with its then existing settlement schedule (or as required by Section 15.4(c)), an amount or amounts equal in the aggregate to the intrinsic value of the Award at the time of the Change in Control.
(g)Payment Upon Unforeseeable Emergency.  The Committee shall have the authority to provide in the Award Agreement evidencing any Award providing for Section 409A Deferred Compensation for payment pursuant to Section 15.4(a)(vi) in settlement of all or a portion of such Award in the event that a Participant establishes, to the satisfaction of the Committee, the occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency.  In such event, the amount(s) distributed with respect to such unforeseeable emergency cannot exceed the amounts reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need plus amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of such distribution(s), after taking into account the extent to which such emergency need is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the Participant's assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship) or by cessation of deferrals under the Award.  All distributions with respect to an unforeseeable emergency shall be made in a lump sum upon the Committee's determination that an unforeseeable emergency has occurred.  The Committee's decision with respect to whether an unforeseeable emergency has occurred and the manner in which, if at all, the payment in settlement of an Award will be altered or modified, is final, conclusive, and not subject to approval or appeal.
(h)Prohibition of Acceleration of Payments. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, this Plan does not permit the acceleration of the time or schedule of any payment under an Award providing Section 409A Deferred Compensation, except as permitted by Section 409A.
(i)No Representation Regarding Section 409A Compliance.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Company makes no representation that Awards will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A.  No Participating Company is liable for any tax, penalty or interest imposed on a Participant by Section 409A.
16.    Tax Withholding.
16.1    Tax Withholding in General.  The Company has the right to deduct from any and all payments made under the Plan, or to require the Participant, through payroll withholding, cash payment or otherwise, to make adequate provision for, the federal, state, local and foreign taxes (including social insurance), if any, required by law to be withheld by any Participating Company with respect to an Award or the shares acquired pursuant thereto.  The Company has no obligation to deliver shares of Stock, to release shares of Stock from an escrow established pursuant to an Award Agreement, or to make any payment in cash under the Plan until the Participating Company Group's tax withholding obligations have been satisfied by the Participant.
16.2    Withholding in or Directed Sale of Shares.  The Company has the right, but not the obligation, to deduct from the shares of Stock issuable to a Participant upon the exercise or settlement of an Award, or to accept from the Participant the tender of, a number of whole shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value, as determined by the Company, equal to all or any part of the tax withholding obligations of any Participating Company.  The Fair Market Value of Stock withheld or tendered to satisfy any such tax withholding obligations may not (a) be less than the amount determined by the applicable minimum statutory withholding rates; and (b) exceed the amount determined by the maximum applicable statutory withholding rates applicable to the Participant and to the particular Award or the shares acquired pursuant thereto. Any shares withheld above minimum statutory rates shall not be added back into the share authorization of Section 4.1, in accordance with Section 4.2. The Company may require a Participant to direct a broker, upon the vesting, exercise or settlement of an Award, to sell a portion of the shares subject to the Award determined by the Company in its discretion to be sufficient to cover the tax withholding obligations of any Participating Company and to remit an amount equal to such tax withholding obligations to such Participating Company in cash.
17.    Amendment, Suspension or Termination of Plan.
The Committee may amend, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time.  However, without the approval of the Company's stockholders, there shall be (a) no increase in the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan (except by operation of the provisions of Sections 4.2 and 4.3), (b) no change in the class of persons eligible to receive Incentive Stock Options, and (c) no other amendment of the Plan that would require approval of the Company's stockholders under any applicable law, regulation or rule, including the rules of any stock exchange or quotation system upon which the Stock may then be listed or quoted.  No amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan shall affect any then outstanding Award unless expressly provided by the Committee.  Except as provided by the next sentence, no amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan may have a materially adverse effect on any then outstanding Award without the consent of the Participant.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, the Committee may, in its sole and absolute discretion and without the consent of any Participant, amend the Plan or any Award Agreement, to take effect retroactively or otherwise, as it deems necessary or advisable for the purpose of conforming the Plan or such Award Agreement to any present or future law, regulation or rule applicable to the Plan, including, but not limited to, Section 409A.
18.    Miscellaneous Provisions.
18.1    Repurchase Rights.  Shares issued under the Plan may be subject to one or more repurchase options, or other conditions and restrictions as determined by the Committee in its discretion at the time the Award is granted.  The Company has the right to assign at any time any repurchase right it may have, whether or not such right is then exercisable, to one or more persons as may be selected by the Company.  Upon request by the Company, each Participant shall execute any agreement evidencing such transfer restrictions prior to the receipt of shares of Stock hereunder and shall promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares of Stock acquired hereunder for the placement on such certificates of appropriate legends evidencing any such transfer restrictions.
18.2    Forfeiture Events.
(a)    The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participant's rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment upon the occurrence of specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award.  Such events may include, but are not be limited to, termination of Service for Cause or any act by a Participant, whether before or after termination of Service, that would constitute Cause for termination of Service, or any accounting restatement due to material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirements of securities laws as a result of which, and to the extent that, such reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment is required by applicable securities laws.
(b)    If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, any Participant who knowingly or through gross negligence engaged in the misconduct, or who knowingly or through gross negligence failed to prevent the misconduct, and any Participant who is one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, shall reimburse the Company for (i) the amount of any payment in settlement of an Award received by such Participant during the twelve (12) month period following the first public issuance or filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (whichever first occurred) of the financial document embodying such financial reporting requirement, and (ii) any profits realized by such Participant from the sale of securities of the Company during such twelve (12) month period.
18.3    Provision of Information.  Each Participant will be given access to information concerning the Company equivalent to that information generally made available to the Company's common stockholders.
18.4    Rights as Employee, Consultant or Director.  No person, even though eligible pursuant to Section 5, has a right to be selected as a Participant, or, having been so selected, to be selected again as a Participant.  Nothing in the Plan or any Award granted under the Plan confers on any Participant a right to remain an Employee, Consultant or Director or interfere with or limit in any way any right of a Participating Company to terminate the Participant's Service at any time.  To the extent that an Employee of a Participating Company other than the Company receives an Award under the Plan, that Award will in no event be understood or interpreted to mean that the Company is the Employee's employer or that the Employee has an employment relationship with the Company.
18.5    Rights as a Stockholder.  A Participant has no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by an Award until the date of the issuance of such shares (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company).  No adjustment will be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such shares are issued, except as provided in Section 4.3 or another provision of the Plan.
18.6    Delivery of Title to Shares.  Subject to any governing rules or regulations, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued the shares of Stock acquired pursuant to an Award and shall deliver such shares to or for the benefit of the Participant by means of one or more of the following: (a) by delivering to the Participant evidence of book entry shares of Stock credited to the account of the Participant, (b) by depositing such shares of Stock for the benefit of the Participant with any broker with which the Participant has an account relationship, or (c) by delivering such shares of Stock to the Participant in certificate form.
18.7    Fractional Shares.  The Company is not be required to issue fractional shares upon the exercise or settlement of any Award.
18.8    Retirement and Welfare Plans.  Neither Awards made under this Plan nor shares of Stock or cash paid pursuant to such Awards may be included as "compensation" for purposes of computing the benefits payable to any Participant under any Participating Company's retirement plans (both qualified and non-qualified) or welfare benefit plans unless such other plan expressly provides that such compensation must be taken into account in computing a Participant's benefit.
18.9    Beneficiary Designation.  Subject to local laws and procedures, each Participant may file with the Company a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any benefit under the Plan to which the Participant is entitled in the event of such Participant's death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit.  Each designation will revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, will be in a form prescribed by the Company, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime.  If a married Participant designates a beneficiary other than the Participant's spouse, the effectiveness of such designation may be subject to the consent of the Participant's spouse.  If a Participant dies without an effective designation of a beneficiary who is living at the time of the Participant's death, the Company will pay any remaining unpaid benefits to the Participant's legal representative.
18.10    Severability.  If any one or more of the provisions (or any part thereof) of this Plan shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision will be modified so as to make it valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or any part thereof) of the Plan will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
18.11    No Constraint on Corporate Action.  Nothing in this Plan will be construed to: (a) limit, impair, or otherwise affect the Company's or another Participating Company's right or power to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations, or changes of its capital or business structure, or to merge or consolidate, or dissolve, liquidate, sell, or transfer all or any part of its business or assets; or (b) limit the right or power of the Company or another Participating Company to take any action which such entity deems to be necessary or appropriate.
18.12    Unfunded Obligation.  Participants shall have the status of general unsecured creditors of the Company.  Any amounts payable to Participants pursuant to the Plan are considered unfunded and unsecured obligations for all purposes, including, without limitation, Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  No Participating Company will be required to segregate any monies from its general funds, or to create any trusts, or establish any special accounts with respect to such obligations.  The Company shall retain at all times beneficial ownership of any investments, including trust investments, which the Company may make to fulfill its payment obligations hereunder.  Any investments or the creation or maintenance of any trust or any Participant account will not create or constitute a trust or fiduciary relationship between the Committee or any Participating Company and a Participant, or otherwise create any vested or beneficial interest in any Participant or the Participant's creditors in any assets of any Participating Company.  Participants have no claim against any Participating Company for any changes in the value of any assets which may be invested or reinvested by the Company with respect to the Plan.
18.13    Choice of Law.  Except to the extent governed by applicable federal law, the validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the Plan and each Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of law rules.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Secretary of the Company certifies that the foregoing sets forth the PROS 2017 Equity Incentive Plan as duly adopted by the Board on March 22, 2019.
