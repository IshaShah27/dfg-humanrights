            2018 PERFORMANCE         
[END TABLE]
Abbott achieved outstanding returns for shareholders in 2018 and for the second consecutive year ranked #1 in our peer group. Abbott's one-year total shareholder return (TSR) was 29.0%, delivering significant shareholder returns despite negative returns of –3.5% and –4.4% for both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500), respectively. 
During a period of strategic shaping including the additions of St. Jude Medical and Alere Inc., which positioned Abbott as a leader in several new areas of cardiovascular care, neuromodulation and rapid diagnostic testing, Abbott's three- and five-year TSR of 72.0% and 110.4%, respectively, are twice that of the peer group median and the broader S&P 500 market index. These returns are driven by the strength of our position in many high-growth healthcare markets and our robust organic pipeline of innovative products across all of our businesses. 
In addition to delivering significant shareholder returns, Abbott continued to make significant progress in positioning the Company for long-term and sustainable growth.

            EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION         
[END TABLE]
   SHAREHOLDER OUTREACH
During 2018, we conducted extensive shareholder outreach to discuss our compensation program. In the spring, we engaged shareholders representing approximately 60% of our outstanding shares in an open dialogue to discuss various topics, including our executive compensation program. Many of these discussions included our Lead Independent Director and the Chair of our Compensation Committee, giving shareholders the opportunity to provide important feedback directly to members of our Board. The feedback we received indicated that overall, shareholders viewed our executive compensation program favorably, and that additional enhancements to our proxy disclosure could further shareholder understanding of how pay decisions are made and how the metrics we use are linked to business strategy and goals. 
In the fall, we continued our dialogue with shareholders. Our Lead Independent Director and the Chair of our Compensation Committee again facilitated many of these discussions, where we shared the enhancements we intended to make to our proxy disclosure following the shareholder input we received in the spring. Shareholder responses were overwhelmingly positive, and the enhanced disclosure can be found on pages 34 to 43 of this proxy statement. 
   KEY FEATURES OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM
The following practices and policies ensure alignment of interests between shareholders and executives, and effective ongoing compensation governance. 
Details of the compensation decisions made for our named executive officers are outlined on pages 34 to 43.

        INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING   
        WHO CAN VOTE   
Shareholders of record at the close of business on February 27, 2019 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of January 31, 2019, Abbott had 1,756,470,269 outstanding common shares, which are Abbott's only outstanding voting securities. All shareholders have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors and one vote per share on all other matters. 
        NOTICE AND ACCESS   
In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's "Notice and Access" rules, Abbott mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to certain shareholders in mid-March of 2019. The Notice describes the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting and how the shareholders can access the proxy materials online. It also provides instructions on how those shareholders can vote their shares. If you received the Notice, you will not receive a print version of the proxy materials, unless you request one. If you would like to receive a print version of the proxy materials, free of charge, please follow the instructions on the Notice. 
        CUMULATIVE VOTING   
Cumulative voting allows a shareholder to multiply the number of shares owned by the number of directors to be elected and to cast the total for one nominee or distribute the votes among the nominees, as the shareholder desires. Shareholders may not cumulate their votes against a nominee. If shares are voted cumulatively and there are more nominees than there are director vacancies, nominees who receive the greatest number of votes will be elected. If you wish to cumulate your votes, you must sign and mail in your proxy card or attend the Annual Meeting. 
        VOTING BY PROXY   
All of Abbott's shareholders may vote by mail or at the Annual Meeting. Abbott's By-Laws provide that a shareholder may authorize no more than two persons as proxies to attend and vote at the meeting. Most of Abbott's shareholders may also vote their shares by telephone or the Internet. If you vote by telephone or the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. The instructions for voting can be found with your proxy card or on the Notice. 
        REVOKING A PROXY   
You may revoke your proxy by voting in person at the Annual Meeting or, at any time prior to the meeting:
        DISCRETIONARY VOTING AUTHORITY   
Unless authority is withheld in accordance with the instructions on the proxy, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares covered by proxies they receive to elect the 13 nominees named in Item 1 on the proxy card. Should a nominee become unavailable to serve, the shares will be voted for a substitute designated by the Board of Directors, or for fewer than 13 nominees if, in the judgment of the proxy holders, such action is necessary or desirable. The persons named in the proxy may also decide to vote shares cumulatively in their sole discretion so that one or more of the nominees may receive fewer votes than the other nominees (or no votes at all), although they have no present intention of doing so. The proxy holders may not cast your vote for any nominee from whom you have withheld authority to vote. 
Where a shareholder has specified a choice for or against the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors, the advisory vote on the approval of executive compensation, or the approval of a shareholder proposal, or where the shareholder has abstained on these matters, the shares represented by the proxy will be 
Abbott Laboratories      9
voted (or not voted) as specified. Where no choice has been specified, the proxy will be voted FOR the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors, FOR the approval of executive compensation, and AGAINST the shareholder proposal. 
With the exception of matters omitted from this proxy statement pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Board of Directors is not aware of any other issue which may properly be brought before the meeting. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the accompanying proxy will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders. 
        QUORUM AND VOTE REQUIRED TO APPROVE EACH ITEM ON THE PROXY   
A majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on a matter, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for consideration of that matter at the meeting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on a matter shall be the act of the shareholders with respect to that matter. 
        EFFECT OF WITHHOLD VOTES, BROKER NON-VOTES, AND ABSTENTIONS   
Shares represented by proxies which are present and entitled to vote on a matter but which have elected to withhold authority to vote for one or more directors or to abstain from voting on another matter will have the effect of votes against those directors or that matter. A proxy submitted by an institution, such as a broker or bank that holds shares for the account of a beneficial owner, may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by that proxy are not being voted with respect to a particular matter. This could occur, for example, when the broker or bank is not permitted to vote those shares in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. These "non-voted shares" will be considered shares not present and, therefore, not entitled to vote on those matters, although these shares may be considered present and entitled to vote for other purposes. Brokers and banks have discretionary authority to vote shares in absence of instructions on matters the New York Stock Exchange considers "routine", such as the ratification of the appointment of the auditors. They do not have discretionary authority to vote shares in absence of instructions on "non-routine" matters. The election of directors, the advisory vote on the approval of executive compensation, and shareholder proposals are "non-routine" matters. Non-voted shares will not affect the determination of the outcome of the vote on any matter to be decided at the meeting. 
        INSPECTORS OF ELECTION   
The inspectors of election and the tabulators of all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify shareholders are independent and are not Abbott employees. 
        COST OF SOLICITING PROXIES   
Abbott will bear the cost of making solicitations from its shareholders and will reimburse banks and brokerage firms for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this solicitation. Proxies may be solicited by mail, telephone, Internet, or in person by directors, officers, or employees of Abbott and its subsidiaries. 
Abbott has retained Georgeson LLC to aid in the solicitation of proxies at an estimated cost of $19,500 plus reimbursement for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
        ABBOTT LABORATORIES STOCK RETIREMENT PLAN   
Participants in the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Plan will receive voting instructions for their shares held in the Abbott Laboratories Stock Retirement Trust. The Stock Retirement Trust is administered by both a trustee and an Investment Committee. The trustee of the Trust is The Northern Trust Company. The members of the Investment Committee are Stephen R. Fussell, Karen M. Peterson, and Brian P. Wentworth, employees of Abbott. The voting power with respect to the shares is held by and shared between the Investment Committee and the participants. The Investment Committee must solicit voting instructions from the participants and follow the voting instructions it receives. The Investment Committee may use its own discretion with respect to those shares for which no voting instructions are received. 
10      Abbott Laboratories
        CONFIDENTIAL VOTING   
It is Abbott's policy that all proxies, ballots, and voting tabulations that reveal how a particular shareholder has voted be kept confidential and not be disclosed, except:
        HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS   
Shareholders sharing an address may receive only one copy of the proxy materials or the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, unless their broker, bank, or other intermediary has received contrary instructions from any shareholder at that address. This is known as "householding." Shareholders wishing to discontinue householding and receive separate copies of the proxy materials or the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials should notify their broker, bank, or other intermediary.

        THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS COMMITTEES   
[BEGIN TABLE]
            THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS         
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors held 6 meetings in 2018. The average attendance of all directors at Board and committee meetings in 2018 was 98 percent and each director attended at least 75% of the total number of Board meetings and meetings of the committees on which he or she served. Abbott encourages its Board members to attend the annual shareholders meeting. Last year, all of Abbott's directors attended the annual shareholders meeting. 
The Board has determined that each of the following directors is independent in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange listing standards: R. J. Alpern, R. S. Austin, S. E. Blount, M. A. Kumbier, E. M. Liddy, N. McKinstry, P. N. Novakovic, W. A. Osborn, S. C. Scott III, D. J. Starks, J. G. Stratton, and G. F. Tilton. To determine independence, the Board applied the categorical standards attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement. The Board also considered whether a director has any other material relationships with Abbott or its subsidiaries and concluded that none of these directors had a relationship that impaired the director's independence. This included consideration of the fact that some of the directors are officers or serve on boards of companies or entities to which Abbott sold products or made contributions or from which Abbott purchased products and services during the year. In making its determination, the Board relied on both information provided by the directors and information developed internally by Abbott. 
The Board has risk oversight responsibility for Abbott and administers this responsibility both directly and with assistance from its committees. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
            LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE         
[END TABLE]
The Board has determined that the current leadership structure, in which the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are held by one individual and an independent director acts as lead independent director, ensures the appropriate level of oversight, independence, and responsibility is applied to all Board decisions, including risk oversight, and is in the best interests of Abbott and its shareholders.

            DIRECTOR SELECTION         
[END TABLE]
The Nominations and Governance Committee assists the Board of Directors in identifying individuals qualified to become Board members and recommends to the Board the nominees for election as directors at the next annual meeting of shareholders. The process used by the Nominations and Governance Committee to identify a nominee to serve as a member of the Board of Directors depends on the qualities being sought. From time to time, Abbott engages an executive search firm to assist the Committee in identifying individuals qualified to be Board members. 
Abbott's outline of directorship qualifications, which is part of Abbott's corporate governance guidelines, is available in the corporate governance section of Abbott's investor relations website (www.abbottinvestor.com). These qualifications describe specific characteristics that the Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board take into consideration when selecting nominees for the Board, such as: strong management experience and senior level experience in medicine, hospital administration, medical and scientific research and development, finance, international business, government, and academic administration. An individual nominee is not required to satisfy all the characteristics listed in the outline of directorship qualifications and there is no requirement that all such characteristics be represented on the Board. 
In addition, Board members should have backgrounds that, when combined, provide a portfolio of experience and knowledge that will serve Abbott's governance and strategic needs. Board candidates will be considered on the basis of a range of criteria, including broad-based business knowledge and relationships, prominence, and excellent reputations in their primary fields of endeavor, as well as a global business perspective and commitment to good corporate citizenship. Directors should have demonstrated experience and ability that is relevant to the Board of Directors' oversight role with respect to Abbott's business and affairs. Each director's biography includes the particular experience and qualifications that led the Board to conclude that the director should serve on the Board. The directors' biographies are on pages 12 through 18. 
A description of the procedure for the recommendation and nomination of directors, including by proxy access, is on page 73.

            BOARD DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION         
[END TABLE]
In the process of identifying nominees to serve as a member of the Board of Directors, the Nominations and Governance Committee considers the Board's diversity of relevant experience, areas of expertise, ethnicity, gender, and geography and assesses the effectiveness of the process in achieving that diversity. Six of the 13 directors nominated for election are women or minorities. 
The process used to identify and select nominees has resulted in an experienced, diverse, and well-rounded Board of Directors that possesses the skills and perspectives necessary for its oversight role. All of Abbott's directors exhibit:

            BOARD EVALUATION PROCESS         
[END TABLE]
Each year, Abbott's directors evaluate the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees in performing its governance and risk oversight responsibilities. Directors assess the performance of the Board of Directors, each of the Committees on which they serve, and their peers, as follows: 
Abbott Laboratories      21
[BEGIN TABLE]
            COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS         
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors has five committees established in Abbott's By-Laws: Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominations and Governance Committee, Public Policy Committee, and Executive Committee. Each of the members of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominations and Governance Committee, and Public Policy Committee is independent. 
      Audit Committee         
The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to Abbott's accounting and financial reporting practices and the audit process; the quality and integrity of Abbott's financial statements; the independent auditors' qualifications, independence, and performance; the performance of Abbott's internal audit function and internal auditors; certain areas of legal and regulatory compliance; and enterprise risk management, including major financial and cybersecurity risk exposures. The Committee is governed by a written charter. A copy of the report of the Audit Committee is on page 65. 
      Compensation Committee         
The Compensation Committee assists the Board of Directors in carrying out the Board's responsibilities relating to the compensation of Abbott's executive officers and directors. The Committee is governed by a written charter. The Compensation Committee annually reviews the compensation paid to the members of the Board and gives its recommendations to the full Board regarding both the amount of director compensation that should be paid and the allocation of that compensation between equity-based awards and cash. In recommending director 
22      Abbott Laboratories compensation, the Compensation Committee takes comparable director fees into account and reviews any arrangement that could be viewed as indirect director compensation. 
This Committee also reviews, approves, and administers the incentive compensation plans in which any executive officer of Abbott participates and all of Abbott's equity-based plans. It may delegate the responsibility to administer and make grants under these plans to management, except to the extent that such delegation would be inconsistent with applicable law or regulation or with the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange. The processes and procedures used for the consideration and determination of executive compensation are described in the section of the proxy captioned, "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
The Compensation Committee has the sole authority, under its charter, to select, retain, and/or terminate independent compensation advisors. The Committee engaged Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC as its compensation consultant for 2018. Meridian performs no other work for Abbott. The Committee engages compensation consultants to provide counsel and advice on executive and non-employee director compensation matters. The consultant and its principal report directly to the Chair of the Committee. The principal meets regularly and as needed with the Committee in executive sessions, has direct access to the Chair during and between meetings, and performs no other services for Abbott or its senior executives. The Committee determines what variables it will instruct the consultant to consider, and they include: peer groups against which performance and pay should be examined, financial metrics to be used to assess Abbott's relative performance, competitive long-term incentive practices in the marketplace, and compensation levels relative to market practice. The Committee negotiates and approves any fees paid to the consultant for these services. Based on its evaluation of Meridian's independence in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange listing standards and information provided by Meridian, the Committee determined that the work performed by Meridian does not present any conflicts of interest. A copy of the Compensation Committee report is on page 46. 
      Nominations and Governance Committee         
The Nominations and Governance Committee assists the Board of Directors in identifying individuals qualified to become Board members and recommends to the Board the nominees for election as directors at the next annual meeting of shareholders; recommends to the Board the people to be elected as executive officers of Abbott; develops and recommends to the Board the corporate governance guidelines applicable to Abbott; and serves in an advisory capacity to the Board and the Chairman of the Board on matters of organization, management succession plans, major changes in the organizational structure of Abbott, and the conduct of Board activities. The Committee is governed by a written charter. The process used by this Committee to identify a nominee to serve as a member of the Board of Directors depends on the qualities being sought. From time to time, Abbott engages an executive search firm to assist the Committee in identifying individuals qualified to be Board members. The process used by the Committee to identify nominees is described on page 20 in the section captioned, "Director Selection." 
      Public Policy Committee         
The Public Policy Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with respect to Abbott's public policy, certain areas of legal and regulatory compliance, and governmental affairs and healthcare compliance issues that affect Abbott. The Committee is governed by a written charter. 
      Executive Committee         
The Executive Committee may exercise all the authority of the Board in the management of Abbott, except for matters expressly reserved by law for Board action.

The distribution of deferred fees and amounts held in a director's grantor trust generally commences when the director reaches age 65, or upon retirement from the Board of Directors, if later. The director may elect to have deferred fees and fees deposited in trust credited to either a guaranteed interest account or to a stock equivalent account that earns the same return as if the fees were invested in Abbott stock. If necessary, Abbott contributes funds to a director's trust so that as of year-end the stock equivalent account balance (net of taxes) is not less than seventy-five percent of the market value of the related common stock at year-end.

[BEGIN TABLE]
   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS    
[END TABLE]
        INTRODUCTION   
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) describes Abbott's executive compensation program in 2018. In particular, this CD&A explains how the Compensation Committee (the Committee) and Board of Directors made compensation decisions for the Company's executives, including the five named officers: Miles D. White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Brian B. Yoor, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; Hubert L. Allen, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; Robert B. Ford, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Stephen R. Fussell, Executive Vice President, Human Resources. 
The CD&A also describes the process the Committee utilizes to examine performance in the context of executive pay decisions, the performance goals and results for each named officer, and recent updates to our compensation program. This year's CD&A reflects the feedback from our shareholders gathered during our extensive 2018 shareholder outreach described on page 28. 
        2018 PERFORMANCE   
In 2018, Abbott again achieved outstanding returns to shareholders. We ranked first in our peer group on a 3-year TSR basis and 1-year TSR basis and second on a 5-year TSR basis. Our returns over each of these periods significantly exceeded the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. In addition, we continued our focus on strategic positioning for future growth through expanding manufacturing capability in our most important business segments and achieving important product approvals. For more details on our 2018 performance, see page 3.

   CHANGES BASED ON SHAREHOLDER FEEDBACK AND MARKET PRACTICES    
[END TABLE]
During 2018, we conducted extensive shareholder outreach to discuss our compensation program. 
In the spring, we engaged shareholders representing approximately 60% of our outstanding shares in an open dialogue to discuss various topics, including our executive compensation program. Many of these discussions included our Lead Independent Director and the Chair of our Compensation Committee, giving shareholders the opportunity to provide important feedback directly to members of our Board. The feedback we received indicated that overall, shareholders viewed our executive compensation program favorably, and that additional enhancements to our proxy disclosure could further shareholder understanding of how pay decisions are made and how the metrics we use are linked to our business strategy and goals. 
In the fall, we continued our dialogue with shareholders regarding our executive compensation program and the results of the 2018 annual Say on Pay vote. Our Lead Independent Director and the Chair of our Compensation Committee again facilitated many of these discussions, where we shared the enhancements we intended to make to our proxy disclosure following the shareholder input we received in the spring. Shareholder responses were overwhelmingly positive. 
As illustrated in the table below, over the past several years we have made numerous changes to our program and our proxy statement based on feedback from our shareholders as well as a review of market practices.

   ABBOTT'S PEER GROUP FOR PAY AND COMPANY PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKING    
[END TABLE]
To determine the competitiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, the Committee, in consultation with its independent consultant, annually compares the level of compensation, pay practices, and our relative performance to those of peer companies. 
Our peer group was selected to reflect the breadth of our business, reflecting our diverse and balanced portfolio. It strikes the appropriate balance between size (both revenues and market capitalization), return profiles, geographic breadth, and management and operating structure. This approach has been overwhelmingly supported by our investors during shareholder outreach. It does not, however, provide a direct comparison to any one of our four business segments, as the peer group is intended to reflect the entirety of our businesses. 
Our shareholders compare us to other global multinational companies, not limited to those in healthcare. These companies share similar characteristics aligned with our investment identity. 
This peer group is summarized below, showing the primary characteristics for each company selected, including the Abbott business segment(s) represented by the peer company.

   BASIS FOR COMPENSATION DECISIONS    
[END TABLE]
Abbott and its Compensation Committee have designed a compensation program that balances short- and long-term objectives to focus our executives on actions that create value today, while building for sustainable future success. Almost two-thirds of our pay is equity-based, directly tying a significant portion of executive compensation to shareholder returns. 
Our compensation program is market-based (to ensure our ability to attract and retain talented executives) and produces compensation outcomes that are  performance-based (to incent the achievement of profitable growth that increases shareholder value).  
        COMPENSATION PROGRAM IS MARKET-BASED   
All components of total direct compensation are market-based. Each year, the Compensation Committee reviews market data with the independent compensation consultant to ensure our programs are aligned and our officers are positioned appropriately relative to the market. 
      Base Salary         
Base salary targets are initially set using the median of the peer group as a benchmark. Base salaries then vary depending on the officer's experience, expertise, and performance. The average base salary of our executive officers is approximately at the market median.

Annual incentive targets are initially set using the median of the peer group as a benchmark. The targets may vary based on other factors, including internal pay comparisons. Further linkage to the market is achieved by setting targets that require our officers to exceed the anticipated growth of the market in which they compete in order to achieve a target payout of their annual incentives. 
      Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI)         
To set annual LTI award guidelines, the Committee first reviews LTI grants made by peer companies to identify the competitive market range. Each year the guidelines are set at the appropriate level within the competitive market range based on Abbott's relative performance, as described below. To recognize the continued growth focus of Abbott and to directly align the interests of executive officers with the interests of our shareholders, the Compensation Committee grants long-term incentive awards in the form of 50% stock options and 50% performance restricted shares. This mix of incentive awards is consistent with our peers. 
        COMPENSATION OUTCOMES ARE PERFORMANCE-BASED   
Other than base salary, which is the smallest component of our executives' compensation, all remaining components of Total Direct Compensation (i.e., annual incentive, performance-based restricted stock awards, and stock options) are aligned with individual, Company and business segment performance. 
      Annual Incentive Plan         
In order for the annual incentive plan to pay out, the EPS goal must be achieved. If the EPS goal is not achieved, then the annual incentive plan is not funded. Final payouts are determined based upon performance relative to annual goals and are capped as a percentage of consolidated net earnings (CEO cap is 0.15%; other NEO cap is 0.075%). The following formula summarizes the annual incentive payout process for officers, assuming the EPS goal is achieved. 
For example: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   BASE SALARY               BONUS TARGET%           TOTAL GOAL SCORE               AWARD PAYOUT 
        $525,000   x           90%   x            95%   =           $448,875  
[END TABLE]

For 2018 performance, annual incentive payouts for Abbott executive officers averaged 96% of target. For individual calculations for each named officer, see pages 34 to 43. The annual incentive plan is formula driven based on financial, strategic, and talent and succession results. Officer financial goals are based on adjusted measures that reflect the true results of our ongoing operations and are set based on the expected market growth of the businesses in the markets in which we compete. 
      Long-Term Incentive Plan         
Throughout the process, Abbott's awards are based on Company and individual performance, from guideline positioning all the way through vesting. Conversely, most other companies reflect performance only at the company level, through relative TSR at vesting. Thus, Abbott's process is much more rigorous and performance-based than other companies' programs. 
The Committee positions LTI award guidelines relative to the market by comparing Abbott's 3-year TSR performance against our peers. 5- and 1-year TSR performance are also referenced to ensure long-term performance is sustained and current performance is on track with shareholder expectations. 
For example, guidelines for grants made in February 2018 were set at the 75th percentile of our peer group, reflecting strong 63rd percentile relative 3-year TSR ranking for the period ending in 2017. The 5-year TSR ranked at the median of our peer group for the period ending in 2017, while the 1-year TSR was at the top of our peer group. 
The recommendation for each officer starts with the Company LTI award guideline (based on relative TSR performance and market data as described above) for the officer's position and is adjusted based upon assessment of their sustained contributions over the last three years. Contribution scores are totaled and used to adjust each officer's award guideline. Final awards may be increased or decreased based on the long-term impact each individual officer had on the organization. For example: 
Awards granted in 2018, based on individual officer performance for the three-year period ending in 2017, resulted in awards ranging from the 24th percentile to the 90th percentile of our peer group, with an average of the 77th percentile. For individual calculations for each named officer, see pages 34 to 43. 
Since stock options realize value only through share price appreciation, the value realized upon the exercise of vested stock options directly aligns the compensation earned with the value shareholders received over the same period. Options are also aligned with shareholder value through the impact of relative TSR in determining the LTI award guidelines. 
Abbott Laboratories      31
Performance restricted shares vest 1/3 each year only if the Adjusted Return on Equity (ROE) performance target is achieved. Vesting is absolute—either 100% or 0%. There is no partial vesting if the target is missed and no additional vesting upside if the Company over-performs. The Committee believes Adjusted ROE is the appropriate performance measure for vesting because ROE measures how much profit the Company generates over the long-term with the capital that shareholders have invested and is a measure reflecting deployment of capital or capital allocation. Adjusted ROE reflects earnings from continuing operations excluding specified items, such as intangible amortization expense and various other costs including expenses related to restructuring actions or business acquisitions. Adjusted ROE also excludes the impact of foreign exchange on equity. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        In 2019, the Adjusted ROE vesting target to determine future vesting was increased from 12% to 13%. This increase follows similar increases in prior years, which have increased this target 30% since 2014. This is consistent with our stated intent to   increase our Adjusted ROE targets over time following the separation of AbbVie, which had a significant impact on our ROE and other return measures, including Return on Assets (ROA).    Prior to the separation of Abbott and AbbVie, the AbbVie business accounted for the majority (65%) of Abbott's adjusted net income. However, at the separation of AbbVie, Abbott retained the majority (90%) of the   equity. While Abbott's ROE was disproportionally lower following the AbbVie separation, shareholders that retained their Abbott and AbbVie shares the past six years since the AbbVie separation would have seen a 151%   appreciation in their holdings.

        BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES   
Each of the benefits described below was designed to support the Company's objective of providing a competitive total pay program. Individual benefits do not directly affect decisions regarding other benefits or pay components, except to the extent that benefits and pay components must, in aggregate, be competitive. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
                       BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES              DESCRIPTION              ​ 
     Retirement Benefits    The named officers participate in two Abbott-sponsored defined benefit plans: the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan and the Abbott  Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan. These plans are described in greater detail in the "Pension Benefits" section of the proxy.     
         Since officers' Supplemental Pension Plan benefits cannot be secured in a manner similar to qualified plans, which are held in trust,  officers receive an annual cash payment equal to the increase in present value of their Supplemental Pension Plan benefit. Officers have the option of depositing these annual payments to an individually established grantor trust, net of tax  withholdings. Deposited amounts may be credited with the difference between the officers' actual annual trust earnings and the rate used to calculate trust funding (currently 8%) while they are employed. Amounts deposited in the individual trusts are  not tax deferred.     
         Officers do not receive tax gross-ups on their grantor trusts. The manner in which the grantor trust will be distributed to an officer upon  retirement from the Company generally follows the manner elected by the officer under the Annuity Retirement Plan. Should an officer (or the officer's spouse, depending upon the pension distribution method elected by the officer under the Annuity  Retirement Plan) live beyond the actuarial life expectancy age used to determine the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit and, therefore, exhaust the trust balance, the Supplemental Pension Plan benefit will be paid by the Company.    
     Deferred Compensation    Officers of the Company, like all U.S. employees, are eligible to defer a portion of annual base salary and bonus (in certain cases), on a  pre-tax basis, to the Company's qualified 401(k) plan, up to the IRS contribution limits. Officers are also eligible to defer up to 18% of their base salary, less contributions to the 401(k) plan, to a non-qualified plan. Unlike other U.S. managers,  officers are not eligible to elect to defer compensation into the Deferred Compensation Plan. However, up to one hundred percent (100%) of annual incentive awards earned under the Company's Performance Incentive Plan is eligible for deferral to a  non-qualified plan. Officers may defer these amounts to unfunded book accounts or choose to have the amounts paid in cash on a current basis and deposited into individually established grantor trusts, net of tax withholdings. These amounts are  credited annually with earnings. Officers do not receive tax gross-ups on their grantor trusts. Officers elect the manner in which the assets held in their grantor trusts will be distributed to them upon retirement or other separation from the  Company.

     Change in Control Arrangements    Mr. White does not have an Abbott change in control agreement. The other named officers have Abbott change in control agreements, the  purpose of which is to aid in retention and recruitment, encourage continued attention and dedication to assigned duties during periods involving a possible change in control of the Company, and protect the earned benefits of the officer against  adverse changes resulting from a change in control. The level of payments provided under the agreements is established to be consistent with market practices as confirmed by data provided to the Committee by its independent compensation consultant.  These arrangements are described in greater detail in the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" section of this proxy.    
     Financial Planning    Named officers are eligible to receive up to $10,000 of fees annually associated with estate planning advice, tax preparation, and general  financial planning. If an officer chooses to utilize this benefit, fees for services received up to the annual allocation are paid by the Company and are treated as imputed income to the officer, who then is responsible for payment of all taxes due  on the fees paid by the Company.    
     Company Automobile    Named officers are eligible for use of a Company-leased vehicle, with a lease term of 50 months. Seventy-five percent (75%) of the cost  of the vehicle is imputed to the officer as income for federal income tax purposes.    
     Company Aircraft    Non-business-related flights on corporate aircraft by Mr. White are covered by a time-sharing lease agreement, pursuant to which  incremental costs associated with those flights are reimbursed by the executive to the Company in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations.    
     Disability Benefit    In addition to Abbott's standard disability benefits, the named officers are eligible for a monthly long-term disability benefit, which is  described in greater detail in the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" section of this proxy.

        SHARE OWNERSHIP AND RETENTION GUIDELINES   
To further promote sustained shareholder returns and to ensure the Company's executives remain focused on both short- and long-term objectives, the Company has established share ownership guidelines. Each officer has five years from the date appointed/elected to his/her position to achieve the ownership level associated with the position.

[END TABLE]
Any officer who has not achieved at least 50% of the share ownership guideline after three years in their current position will be required to hold 50% of future equity awards until they meet the ownership guideline. 
All named officers with 5 years tenure in their current position meet or exceed the guidelines. 
      HEDGING         
Directors and officers are prohibited from entering into or engaging in any financial transaction that is designed to reduce the financial risk associated with owning Abbott shares. These financial transactions include, but are not limited to, engaging in short sales, derivative transactions (such as equity swaps, straddles, puts, or calls), and hedging or monetizing transactions (such as collars, exchange funds, or prepaid forward variable contracts) that are linked directly to Abbott stock. 
Abbott Laboratories      45
        PLEDGING   
Directors and officers are prohibited from holding Abbott stock in a margin account, pledging Abbott stock, or otherwise securing any of their obligations by assigning Abbott stock as collateral. The Compensation Committee, or its delegate, may grant an exception provided that:
        RECOUPMENT POLICY   
The Compensation Committee has broad discretion to administer and implement the Company's policy and seek recoupment of equity or cash incentive awards if it determines that a senior executive engaged in misconduct or failed in a supervisory capacity, resulting in a material violation of law or Abbott policy that causes significant financial harm to Abbott. The Compensation Committee may recover incentive compensation awarded to a senior executive in the prior three years or reduce future awards. The policy will not affect awards made prior to its effective date or following a change in control. 
        COMPLIANCE   
The Committee considers the deductibility of executive compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) and reserves the flexibility to take actions that may be based on considerations in addition to tax deductibility. The Committee believes that shareholder interests are best served by not restricting the Committee's discretion and flexibility in crafting compensation programs, even if such programs may result in certain non-deductible compensation expenses. Accordingly, Abbott may provide compensation that is not deductible. Section 162(m) (as amended in 2017 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) generally disallows, subject to certain exceptions, a federal income tax deduction to public companies for compensation in excess of $1 million per year paid to an individual who was the company's chief executive officer or chief financial officer, or among the company's three most highly compensated executive officers, at any time during the year, or an individual whose compensation was subject to the $1 million cap on deductible compensation in 2017 or later years (under the once a covered employee always a covered employee rule), or beneficiary of any such individual.

Each of the named officers have grantor trusts into which the awards may be deposited, net of maximum tax withholdings. The named officers also have grantor trusts in connection with the Abbott Laboratories 401(k) Supplemental Plan and the 1986 Abbott Laboratories Management Incentive Plan (although none of the named officers currently receives awards under the Management Incentive Plan). These amounts include the trusts' earnings (net of the reportable interest included in footnote 4).  
Employer Contributions to Defined Contribution Plans
M. D. White: $95,000 / $95,000 / $95,000; B. B. Yoor: $39,803 / $32,163 / $29,212; H. L. Allen: $35,335 / $34,505; R. B. Ford: $39,213 / $33,750; and S. R. Fussell: $31,000.

The Abbott Laboratories 401(k) Supplemental Plan permits eligible Abbott officers to contribute amounts in excess of the limit set by the Internal Revenue Code for employee contributions to 401(k) plans up to the excess of (i) 18% of their base salary over (ii) the amount contributed to Abbott's tax-qualified 401(k) plan. Abbott matches participant contributions at the rate of 250% of the first 2% of compensation contributed to the plan. The named officers have these amounts paid to them in cash on a current basis and deposited into a grantor trust established by the officer, net of maximum tax withholdings. 
Other Compensation
Mr. White's non-business-related flights on corporate aircraft are covered by a time-sharing lease agreement, pursuant to which he reimburses Abbott for certain costs associated with those flights in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations. The following amounts are included in the totals in this column, which reflect Abbott's incremental cost less reimbursements for non-business-related flights: $229,599 / $292,292 / $204,527.  
Abbott determines the incremental cost for flights based on the direct cost to Abbott, including fuel costs, parking, handling and landing fees, catering, travel fees, and other miscellaneous direct costs.  
For Mr. White, the following costs associated with security are included: $230,033 / $209,414 / $219,680. Abbott determines the cost for these expenses based on its actual costs. The security is provided on the recommendation of an independent security study.  
Also included in the totals shown in the table is the cost of providing a corporate automobile less the amount reimbursed by the officer: B. B. Yoor: $20,443 / $20,559 / $20,178; H. L. Allen: $23,600 / $9,158; R. B. Ford: $19,516 / $18,541; and S. R. Fussell: $27,360.

            PENSION BENEFITS         
[END TABLE]
During 2018, the named officers participated in two Abbott-sponsored defined benefit pension plans: the Abbott Laboratories Annuity Retirement Plan, a tax-qualified pension plan; and the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan, a non-qualified supplemental pension plan. The Supplemental Pension Plan also includes a benefit feature Abbott uses to attract officers who are at the mid-point of their careers. This feature provides an additional benefit to officers who are mid-career hires that is less valuable to officers who have spent most of their careers at Abbott. Except as provided in Abbott's change in control agreements, Abbott does not have a policy granting extra years of credited service under the plans. These change in control agreements are described on pages 61 and 62. 
The compensation considered in determining the pension payable to the named officers is the compensation shown in the "Salary" and "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" columns of the Summary Compensation Table on page 49. 
        ANNUITY RETIREMENT PLAN   
The Annuity Retirement Plan covers eligible employees in the United States who are age 21 or older, and provides participants with a life annuity benefit at normal retirement equal to A plus the greater of B or C below.  
The benefit for service prior to 2004 (B or C above) is reduced for the cost of preretirement surviving spouse benefit protection. The reduction is calculated using formulas based on age and employment status during the period in which coverage was in effect. 
Final average earnings are the average of the employee's 60 highest-paid consecutive calendar months of compensation (salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation). The Annuity Retirement Plan covers earnings up to the limit imposed by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) and provides for a maximum of 35 years of benefit service. 
Participants become fully vested in their pension benefit upon the completion of five years of service. The benefit is payable on an unreduced basis at age 65. Participants hired after 2003 who terminate prior to age 55 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. Participants hired prior to 2004 who terminate prior to age 50 with at least 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 50. Participants hired prior to 2004 who terminate prior to age 50 with less than 10 years of service may choose to commence their benefits on an actuarially reduced basis as early as age 55. 
58      Abbott Laboratories
The Annuity Retirement Plan offers several optional forms of payment, including certain and life annuities, joint and survivor annuities, and level income annuities. The benefit paid under any of these options is actuarially equivalent to the life annuity benefit produced by the formula described above. 
Participants who retire from Abbott prior to their normal retirement age may receive subsidized early retirement benefits. Participants hired after 2003 are eligible for early retirement at age 55 with 10 years of service. Participants hired prior to 2004 are eligible for early retirement at age 50 with 10 years of service or age 55 if the employee's age plus years of benefit service total 70 or more. As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. White and Fussell were eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan. 
The subsidized early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service after 2003 (A above) depend upon the participant's age at retirement. If the participant retires after reaching age 55, the benefit is reduced 5 percent per year for each year that payments are made before age 62. If the participant retires after reaching age 50 but prior to reaching age 55, the benefit is actuarially reduced from age 65. 
The early retirement reductions applied to the benefit payable for service prior to 2004 (B and C above) depend upon age and service at retirement:
        SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN   
With the following exceptions, the provisions of the Supplemental Pension Plan are substantially the same as those of the Annuity Retirement Plan:
Abbott Laboratories      59
from the plan's unreduced retirement age, unless the benefit is being actuarially reduced from age 65. As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. White and Fussell were eligible for early retirement benefits under the plan. 
Benefits payable under the Supplemental Pension Plan are offset by the benefits payable from the Annuity Retirement Plan, calculated as if benefits under the plans commenced at the same time. The amounts paid to an officer's Supplemental Pension Plan grantor trust to fund plan benefits are actuarially determined. The plan is designed to result in Abbott paying the officer's Supplemental Pension Plan benefits to the extent assets held in the officer's trust are insufficient.

            POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL         
[END TABLE]
        POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION—GENERALLY   
Abbott does not have employment agreements with its named officers. 
The following summarizes the payments that the named officers would have received if their employment had terminated on December 31, 2018. Earnings would have continued to be paid to the named officer's Performance Incentive Plan, Management Incentive Plan, and Supplemental 401(k) Plan grantor trusts, until the trust assets were fully distributed. The amount of these payments would depend on the period over which the trusts' assets were distributed and the trusts' earnings. If the trusts' assets were distributed over a ten-year period and based on current earnings, the named officers would receive the following average annual payments over such ten-year period:
In addition, the following one-time deposits would have been made under the Abbott Laboratories Supplemental Pension Plan for the following named officers:
If the termination of employment was due to disability, then the following named officers also would have received, in addition to Abbott's standard disability benefits, a monthly long-term disability benefit in the amount of:
This long-term disability benefit would continue for up to 24 months following termination of employment. It ends if the officer retires, recovers, dies, or ceases to meet eligibility criteria. 
In addition, if the employment of these named officers had terminated due to death or disability, the officer's unvested stock options and restricted shares would have vested on December 31, 2018 with values as set forth below in the section captioned, "Equity Awards." 
        POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL   
Mr. White does not have a change in control agreement with Abbott.
Abbott has change in control arrangements with other key members of its management team, in the form of change in control agreements for Abbott officers and a change in control plan for certain other management personnel. The agreements with Messrs. Yoor, Allen, Ford, and Fussell are described below. 
Each change in control agreement continues in effect until December 31, 2020, and can be renewed for successive two-year terms upon notice prior to the expiration date. If notice of non-renewal is given, the agreement will expire on the later of the scheduled expiration date and the one-year anniversary of the date of such notice. If no notice is given, the agreement will expire on the one-year anniversary of the scheduled expiration date. Each agreement also automatically extends for two years following any change in control (see below) that occurs while the agreement is in effect. 
Abbott Laboratories      61
The agreements provide that if the officer is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the officer elects to terminate employment for good reason (see below) within two years following a change in control of Abbott, the officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to three times the officer's annual salary and annual incentive ("bonus") award (assuming for this purpose that all target performance goals have been achieved or, if higher, based on the average bonus for the last three years), plus any unpaid bonus owing for any completed performance period and the pro rata bonus for any current bonus period (based on the highest of the bonus assuming achievement of target performance, the average bonus for the past three years, or in the case of the unpaid bonus for any completed performance period, the actual bonus earned). If the officer is terminated other than for cause or permanent disability or if the officer elects to terminate employment for good reason during a potential change in control (see below), the officer is entitled to receive a lump sum payment of the annual salary and bonus payments described above, except that the amount of the bonus to which the officer is entitled will be based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance goals. If the potential change in control becomes a "change in control event" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), the officer will be entitled to receive the difference between the bonus amounts the officer received upon termination during the potential change in control and the bonus amounts that would have been received had such amounts instead been based on the higher of the officer's target bonus or the average bonus paid to the officer in the preceding three years. Bonus payments include payments made under the Performance Incentive Plan. The officer will also receive up to three years of additional employee benefits (including welfare benefits, outplacement services and tax and financial counseling, and the value of three more years of pension accruals). 
If change in control-related payments and benefits become subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, payments under the agreement will be reduced to prevent application of the excise tax if such a reduction would leave the executive in a better after-tax position than if the payments were not reduced and the tax applied. The agreements also limit the conduct for which awards under Abbott's incentive stock programs can be terminated and generally permit options to remain exercisable for the remainder of their term. 
For purposes of the agreements, the term "change in control" includes the following events: any person becoming the beneficial owner of Abbott securities representing twenty percent or more of the outstanding voting power (not including an acquisition directly from Abbott and its affiliates); a change in the majority of the members of the Board of Directors whose appointment was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the incumbent directors; and the consummation of certain mergers or similar corporate transactions involving Abbott. A "potential change in control" under the agreements includes, among other things, Abbott's entry into an agreement that would result in a change in control. Finally, the term "good reason" includes: a significant adverse change in the executive's position, duties, or authority; Abbott's failure to pay the executive's compensation or a reduction in the executive's base pay or benefits; or the relocation of Abbott's principal executive offices to a location that is more than thirty-five miles from the location of the offices at the time of the change in control. 
If a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2018 immediately followed by one of the covered circumstances described above, Messrs. Yoor, Allen, Ford, and Fussell would have been entitled to receive the following payments and benefits under the change in control agreements:

        EQUITY AWARDS   
Under Abbott Laboratories' Incentive Stock Programs, upon a change in control, the surviving company may assume, convert, or replace awards to executive officers on an equivalent basis. If the surviving company does not do so, then the awards vest. If the surviving company does assume, convert, or replace the awards on an equivalent basis, then the awards vest if the officer's employment is terminated without cause or the officer resigns for good reason during the period six months prior to and through two years after a change in control. The term "good reason" has the same definition as in the change of control agreements. 
62      Abbott Laboratories
If a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2018, and the surviving company did not assume, convert, or replace the awards, then Messrs. White, Yoor, Allen, Ford, and Fussell would have vested in the following options, restricted shares, and restricted stock units: 
The value of stock options shown is based on the excess of the closing price of a common share on December 31, 2018 over the exercise price of such options, multiplied by the number of unvested stock options held by the named officer. The value of restricted shares shown is determined by multiplying the number of restricted shares that would vest as of December 31, 2018 and the closing price of a common share on December 31, 2018.

            CEO PAY RATIO         
[END TABLE]
In 2018, we compared CEO pay to that of the median employee previously identified in 2017 using the methodology described in our 2018 proxy statement. Abbott does not believe there have been changes in Abbott's employee population or employee compensation arrangements in 2018 that would significantly impact our median employee. 
We collected the 2018 annual total compensation for the median employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table on page 49 and then added the cost of medical and dental benefits ($11,420) in the calculation of annual total compensation for the median employee and CEO. 
The annual total compensation of our median employee was $80,569, resulting in a ratio of 301:1. 
The above ratio and annual total compensation amount are reasonable estimates that have been calculated using methodologies and assumptions permitted by SEC rules.

        RATIFICATION OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS AUDITORS   (ITEM 2 ON PROXY CARD)   
Abbott's By-Laws provide that the Audit Committee shall appoint annually a firm of independent registered public accountants to serve as auditors. In October 2018, the Audit Committee appointed Ernst & Young LLP to act as auditors for 2019. Ernst & Young LLP has served as Abbott's auditors since 2014. 
Although the Audit Committee has sole authority to appoint auditors, it would like to know the opinion of the shareholders regarding its appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for 2019. For this reason, shareholders are being asked to ratify this appointment. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for 2019, the Audit Committee will take that fact into consideration, but may, nevertheless, continue to retain Ernst & Young LLP. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for 2019.
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
        AUDIT FEES AND NON-AUDIT FEES   
The following table presents fees for professional audit services by Ernst & Young LLP for the audit of Abbott's annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and fees billed for other services rendered by Ernst & Young during these periods.

        POLICY ON AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND PERMISSIBLE NON-AUDIT SERVICES OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR   
The Audit Committee has established policies and procedures to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by the independent auditor and its related affiliates. 
Prior to engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next year's audit, management will submit a schedule of all proposed services expected to be rendered during that year for each of four categories of services to the Audit Committee for approval. 
Prior to engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the Audit Committee requires the independent registered public accounting firm and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent registered public accounting firm. 
The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
            REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE         
[END TABLE]
Management is responsible for Abbott's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an audit of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, as well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee reviews these processes on behalf of the Board of Directors. In this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K with Abbott's management and its independent registered public accounting firm. 
The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed pursuant to Auditing Standard No. 16  (Communications with Audit Committees),  as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the firm's independence. The Audit Committee has also considered whether the provision of the services described on page 64 under the caption "Audit Fees and Non-Audit Fees" is compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in Abbott's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

        SAY ON PAY—AN ADVISORY VOTE ON THE APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (ITEM 3 ON PROXY CARD)   
Shareholders are being asked to approve the compensation of Abbott's named officers, as disclosed under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and related material included in this proxy statement. 
Abbott achieved outstanding returns to shareholders in 2018. During a period of strategic shaping including the additions of St. Jude Medical and Alere Inc., which positioned Abbott as a leader in several new areas of cardiovascular care, neuromodulation and rapid diagnostic testing, Abbott's three-year TSR of 72.0% has delivered shareholder returns that are twice that of the peer group median and the broader S&P 500 market index. These returns are driven by the strength of our position in many high-growth healthcare markets and our robust organic pipeline of innovative products across all of our businesses. 
Our compensation program is market-based and produces outcomes that directly link to both Company and officer performance. The vast majority of compensation for our executive officers is performance-based and objectively determined. Long Term Incentives (LTI), which comprise the largest percentage of compensation for our executive officers, are directly linked to shareholder returns. Our annual incentive plan links officer compensation to the metrics which ensure financial success for the short-term and position the Company for growth in the future as well. 
The Compensation Committee, with the counsel of its independent consultant, concluded that the compensation reported herein was earned and appropriate. The specific details of the executive compensation program and compensation paid to the named executive officers are described on pages 27 through 46 of this proxy statement. 
While this vote is advisory and non-binding, the Board of Directors and Compensation Committee value the opinion of the shareholders and will review the voting results and take into account the results and our ongoing dialogue with shareholders when future compensation decisions are made. 
Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the named officers' compensation.

            THE PROPOSAL         
[END TABLE]
Shareholder Proposal on Independent Board Chairman  (Item 4 on Proxy Card)  
Mr. Kenneth Steiner, 14 Stoner Avenue, 2M, Great Neck, New York 11021, has informed Abbott that he intends to present the following proposal at the Annual Meeting and that he owns no fewer than 300 Abbott common shares. 
        PROPONENT'S STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL   
    Proposal 4—Independent Board Chairman         
Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next Chief Executive Officer transition, implemented so it does not violate any existing agreement. 
If the Board determines that a Chairman who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chairman who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above. 
Caterpillar and Wells Fargo are examples of companies changing course and naming an independent board chairman. Caterpillar had even opposed a shareholder proposal for an independent board chairman at its annual meeting. 
Now is a good time to take the first step to transition to an independent board chairman given the following concerns at Abbott:

     Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition to the Shareholder Proposal on Independent Board Chairman         
     (Item 4 on Proxy Card)         
The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote AGAINST this proposal again, which Mr. Kenneth Steiner, through the same proxy, has submitted three times in the last four years and Abbott shareholders overwhelmingly rejected it each time. 
There is good reason to regularly reject this proposal. As is well accepted now, there is no proved improvement to governance or performance in separating the CEO role from the Chairman role. In fact, many successful companies have a combined CEO and Chair role. And the shareholder proposal would also deny the Board a key succession option. During CEO transitions, corporate boards sometimes elect to separate the CEO and Chair roles, allowing the outgoing CEO to serve as the board chairman to provide continuity and guidance during the transition. Very few S&P 500 companies (a mere 4%) adopt an inflexible policy that mandates separating the roles forever more, as the proponent would have it here.  See Spencer Stuart U.S. Board Index, pg. 20 (2015). 
Moreover, there is no sudden governance failing at Abbott such that a drastic change in how the Board determines its leadership is now necessary. The shareholder proposal provides a laundry list of misleading and vague references to issues and legal claims in an effort to manufacture some systemic governance concern that, frankly, does not exist. Many of the issues ambiguously hinted at by the shareholder's proposal relate to St. Jude Medical, Inc. and Alere Inc.—companies that Abbott acquired in 2017. Other claims relate to small product-related actions that arise in the ordinary course of business or unproved allegations made in lawsuits that typically affect the entire industry. It is particularly clear that the proponent's purported concerns are pretextual because this particular shareholder has submitted this very request to Abbott year in and year out (as well as approximately 165 different times in the last decade at various S&P 500 firms). 
For years, Abbott has been helmed by a combined CEO and Chair, overseen by an independent Board and a Lead Independent Director. There have been obvious benefits at Abbott to leadership with a single hand. At Abbott, this singular focus has enabled it to execute on strategic acquisitions and product launches that have positioned the company for sustainable long-term growth. The St. Jude Medical, Inc. acquisition has enhanced Abbott's presence in the cardiovascular and neuromodulation spaces, and given the company leading positions in attractive areas of cardiac care. The Alere Inc. acquisition has built upon Abbott's long-standing presence in the diagnostic-testing space and made Abbott #1 in point-of-care testing. Abbott's Board is best positioned to determine what sort of leadership structure is best suited given Abbott's strategic needs. 
In short, as the Board has stated year after year in response to this ill-advised proposal, providing the Board with the flexibility to choose appropriate leadership for Chairman and CEO best serves Abbott's shareholders. In each case, the overwhelming majority of Abbott's shareholders have agreed. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.

        APPROVAL PROCESS FOR RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS   
It is Abbott's policy that the Nominations and Governance Committee review, approve, or ratify any transaction in which Abbott participates and in which any related person has a direct or indirect material interest if such transaction involves or is expected to involve payments of $120,000 or more in the aggregate per fiscal year. Related person transactions requiring review by the Nominations and Governance Committee pursuant to this policy are identified in:
In determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Nominations and Governance Committee will consider the following items, among others:
This process is included in the Nominations and Governance Committee's written charter, which is available in the corporate governance section of Abbott's investor relations website (www.abbottinvestor.com). The spouse of one of our executive officers, Jaime Contreras, is employed by Abbott. During 2018, her total compensation exceeded the foregoing threshold.

Nominating shareholders are permitted to include in Abbott's proxy statement a 500-word statement in support of their nominee(s). Abbott may omit any information or statement that it, in good faith, believes is materially false or misleading, omits to state a material fact, or would violate any applicable law or regulation. 
 Other Nominations of Directors or Proposals to Transact Business:    A shareholder may also recommend persons as potential nominees for director by submitting the names of such persons in writing to the Chairman of the Nominations and Governance Committee or the Secretary of Abbott. Recommendations should be accompanied by a statement of qualifications and confirmation of the person's willingness to serve. A nominee who is recommended by a shareholder following these procedures will receive the same consideration as other comparably qualified nominees. 
A shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors at an Annual Meeting and who is a shareholder of record on:
may directly nominate persons for director, or make proposals of other business to be brought before the Annual Meeting, by providing proper timely written notice to the Secretary of Abbott. 
 Other Nominations of Directors or Proposals to Transact Business:    The notice submitted by a shareholder must include certain information required by Article II of Abbott's By-Laws, including information about the shareholder, any beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is being made, their respective affiliates or associates or others acting in concert with them, and any proposed director nominee. 
For each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the Annual Meeting, the notice must also include a brief description of the business to be discussed, the reasons for conducting such business at the Annual Meeting, any material interest of the shareholder in such business and certain other information specified in the By-Laws. In addition, in the case of a director nomination, including through proxy access, the notice must include a completed and signed questionnaire, representation and agreement of the nominee addressing matters specified in the By-Laws. 
To be timely, written notice either to directly nominate persons for director, including through proxy access, or to bring business properly before the Annual Meeting must be received at Abbott's principal executive offices not less than ninety days and not more than one hundred twenty days prior to the anniversary date of the preceding Annual Meeting. If the Annual Meeting is called for a date that is not within twenty-five days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be received not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such notice of the date of the Annual Meeting was mailed or made public in a press release or in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, whichever occurs first. To be timely for the 2020 Annual Meeting, this written notice must be received by Abbott no later than January 27, 2020. 
In addition, the notice must be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information provided or required to be provided is true and correct as of the record date for the Annual Meeting and as of the date that is ten business days prior to the meeting. Any such update or supplement must be delivered to the Secretary of Abbott at Abbott's principal executive offices not more than five business days after the record date for the Annual Meeting, and not less than eight business days before the date of the Annual Meeting in the case of any update or supplement required to be made as of ten business days prior to the Annual Meeting.
