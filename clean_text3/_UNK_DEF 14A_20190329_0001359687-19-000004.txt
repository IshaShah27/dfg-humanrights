[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The record date for the 2019 Annual Meeting is the close of business on January 28, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What am I voting on? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: You are voting on (1) the election of three governors; and (2) the First Amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Member Control Agreement proposed by the Company (the "Control Agreement Amendment").  The nominees are Frank Kirschenheiter, Sid Mauch and Anthony Mock.  
[END TABLE]
 Q:    How many membership units are outstanding?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: On January 28, 2019, there were 40,148,160 outstanding membership units.  This means there is a total of 40,148,160 votes on any matter presented to the members.                                      
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What constitutes a quorum? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: As of the record date, the Company had 40,148,160 outstanding membership units.  The presence of members holding fifty percent of the total outstanding membership units, or 20,074,080 membership units, constitutes a quorum.  If you submit a properly executed proxy or appear in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting, then your units will be counted as part of the quorum.       
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q. How did you select the nominees for governors? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A. The Nominating Committee evaluates prospective nominees' knowledge about the Company, the ethanol industry, financial statements, corn and ethanol markets and general business. Frank Kirschenheiter, Sid Mauch and Anthony Mock were considered for nomination to their existing seats.  Based on this evaluation of the nominees, the Nominating Committee recommended that Frank Kirschenheiter, Sid Mauch and Anthony Mock be nominated for election as Group III governors, to serve until the 2022 annual meeting or until their successors are duly elected and qualified.  The Board recommends that members vote their units in favor of the election of Frank Kirschenheiter, Sid Mauch and Anthony Mock.     
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the voting requirement to elect the governors and what is the effect of a withhold vote? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: In the election of governors, the three nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected, regardless of whether any individual nominee receives votes from a majority of the quorum. The presence (in person or by proxy) of members representing at least fifty percent of the membership voting interests is required for the election of governors.    
[END TABLE]
Withhold votes will be counted when determining whether a quorum is present.  Withhold votes for governor elections, however, will not be counted for or against any nominee because governors are elected by plurality vote, meaning that the three nominees receiving the most votes win.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How many votes can I cast when electing governors? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The Company has received written notice of a member's intent to use cumulative voting.  As a result, in accordance with the cumulative voting rights set forth in the Company's Articles of Organization and in Section 10-32-76 of the North Dakota Limited Liability Company Act, to which the Company is subject, you are entitled to give a nominee as many votes as is equal to the number of membership units you own multiplied by the number of governors to be elected, or you may distribute your votes among the nominees as you see fit.  For example, if you own 100 membership units as of the record date, and if three governors are to be elected in a group at the annual meeting, you have 300 votes that you can allocate among the nominees in that group in any manner you choose.  You are not required to cumulate your votes and may split your votes equally among candidates.  If three governors are to be elected at the annual meeting, the three nominees receiving the greatest number of affirmative votes at the annual meeting will be elected to the Board.         
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: What is the voting requirement to approve the proposed Control Agreement Amendment and what is the effect of abstention? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: The proposed Control Agreement Amendment will be approved if it receives affirmative votes from members holding  at least 66.67% of the units, represented at a meeting where a quorum is present and having governance rights entitled to vote on the matter.  Abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining if a quorum is represented at the meeting, but will have the effect of a vote AGAINST the proposed Control Agreement Amendment. 
[END TABLE]
Q:     What is the effect of a broker non-vote?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  While we do not believe that any of the Company's units are held in street name by brokers, broker non-votes, if any, will count for purposes of establishing a quorum at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  A broker non-vote occurs when an individual owns units which are held in the name of a broker. The individual is the beneficial owner of the units, however, on the records of the Company, the broker owns the units. If the individual who beneficially owns the units does not provide the broker with voting instructions on non-routine matters, this is considered a broker non-vote. For such non-routine  
[END TABLE]
 matters, the broker cannot vote either way and reports the units as "non-votes." These broker non-votes function as abstentions under the Company's governing documents.    
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Do I have dissenters' rights?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Pursuant to Section 10-32-54 of the North Dakota Statutes, members have no dissenters' rights with regard to governor elections or the Control Agreement Amendment vote.  Dissenters' rights are generally the  right of a security holder to dissent from and obtain the fair value of their membership units in certain events, such as mergers, share exchanges, and certain amendments to a company's governance documents. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How do I vote? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Membership units can be voted only if the holder of record is present at the 2019 Annual Meeting, either in person or by proxy.  You may vote using either of the following methods: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proxy.  The Company's proxy card is a means by which a member may authorize the voting of his, her, or its membership units at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  The membership units represented by each properly executed proxy card will be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting in accordance with the member's directions.  The Company urges you to specify your choices by marking the appropriate boxes on the proxy card.  After you have marked your choices, please sign and date the proxy card and return it to the Company at P.O. Box 11, Richardton, ND 58652 or by fax to the Company at (701) 974-3309.  To be certain that your membership units will be represented at the 2019 Annual Meeting, your proxy card must be received by the Company by 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, March 28, 2019.   However, proxy cards may still be accepted by the Company in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting at any time prior to the polls closing.   
[END TABLE]
If you sign and return the proxy card without specifying any choices for governor, your membership units will be voted for the recommended candidates Frank Kirschenheiter, Sid Mauch and Anthony Mock, and your vote will be split equally between the three nominees. If you sign and return the proxy card without specifying any choices regarding the Control Agreement Amendment, your membership units will be voted for Proposal Two - Control Agreement Amendment. 
.    
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In person at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  All members may vote in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
If membership units are owned jointly by more than one person, both persons must sign the proxy card in order for the units to be counted.
Q:    What can I do if I change my mind after I return my proxy?
A:    You may revoke your proxy by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Voting in person at the 2019 Annual Meeting; 
• Giving written notice of the revocation to our CFO, Jodi Johnson, at the Company's offices at P.O. Box 11, 3682 Highway 8 South, Richardton, ND  58652 prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting; or 
• Giving written notice of the revocation to our CFO, Jodi Johnson, at the commencement of the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
[END TABLE]
Q:    What happens if I mark too few or too many boxes on the proxy card?
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: If you do not mark any choices on the proxy card for governors, then the proxies will vote your units for the Board recommended candidates Frank Kirschenheiter, Sid Mauch and Anthony Mock and your votes will be allocated equally between the three nominees.  You may wish to vote for only one of the governor nominees.  In this case, your votes will only be counted for the governor nominee you have selected and all of your cumulated votes will be allocated for that governor nominee.   If you do not mark any choices on the proxy card, the the proxies will vote your units for Proposal Two - Control Agreement Amendment.  If you mark contradicting choices on the proxy card, such as both for and withhold for a nominee or for and against Proposal Two - Control Agreement Amendment, your votes will not be counted with respect to the governor nominee(s) for whom you marked contradicting choices or for the proposal for which you marked contradicting choices.  
[END TABLE]
Each fully executed proxy card will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: Who will count the vote? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: All votes will be tabulated by the Company's CFO, Jodi Johnson, and the election will be certified by a representative from the BrownWinick Law Firm who will be serving as inspector of elections.  Votes, abstentions and withhold votes will be tabulated separately.                                               
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: How do I nominate a candidate for election as a governor at next year's annual meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: Two governor positions will stand for election at the 2020 annual meeting.  Nominations for governor positions are made by a nominating committee appointed by the Board.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, our Amended and Restated Operating Agreement provides that members must give advance notice to the Company of any person that they propose be nominated as a governor.  Under the advance notice provision, to be timely, a member's notice must be received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 60 days or more than 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of members.

[BEGIN TABLE]

If your proposal is included in the Company's proxy statement, then the Company must also provide the means for members to vote on the matter via the proxy card. The deadlines and procedures for submitting member proposals are explained in the following question and answer.  The Company reserves the right to reject, rule out of order, or take appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements.                                         
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q: When are member proposals due for the 2020 annual meeting? 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A: In order to be considered for inclusion in the Company's 2020 annual meeting proxy statement, member proposals must be submitted in writing to the Company, by October 1, 2019 (approximately 120 days prior to the one year anniversary date of the mailing of the 2019 proxy materials for the 2019 Annual Meeting).

SECTION II  -  PROPOSALS TO BE VOTED UPON
PROPOSAL ONE
ELECTION OF GOVERNORS
The Company has seven governors.  Each governor is elected to a three year term.  The terms of the governors are staggered, so that the terms of no more than three governors expire every three years.  The staggering of the terms of the governors commenced at the annual meeting of the members which was held on May 30, 2007, at which meeting two governors were elected to an initial one year term (Group I), two governors were elected to an initial two year term (Group II), and three governors were elected to an initial three year term (Group III).  The Company's current governors, listed by group, are as follows:  
Group I:     Ronald Aberle and Ambrose Hoff - Terms expire in 2020
Group II:       Mike Appert and William Price - Terms expire in 2021
Group III:      Frank Kirschenheiter, Sid Mauch and Anthony Mock - Terms expire in 2019
The Nominating Committee of the Board is comprised of Ronald Aberle, Mike Appert, Ambrose Hoff, and William Price and is responsible for selecting candidates for governor.  The Nominating Committee undertook a review of all prospective nominees.  Frank Kirschenheiter, Sid Mauch and Anthony Mock, the Group III incumbent governors, were considered for nomination to their existing seats.  
Based on this evaluation of the nominees, the Nominating Committee recommended that Frank Kirschenheiter, Sid Mauch and Anthony Mock be nominated for election as Group III governors, to serve until the 2022 annual meeting or until their successors are duly elected and qualified.  Frank Kirschenheiter, Sid Mauch and Anthony Mock have each consented to being named in the proxy statement and to serve if elected.  The Board recommends that members vote their units in favor of the election of Frank Kirschenheiter, Sid Mauch and Anthony Mock.    
The three nominees who receive a plurality of the votes for the election of governors (in person or by proxy) will be elected to the position of governor.  If you fail to mark a vote, the proxies solicited by the Board will be voted in favor of the Board's nominees and your units will be equally distributed among the three Board recommended nominees.  If you do not submit a proxy card or attend the meeting, your vote will not be counted as a vote for or against any nominee and you will not be counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum.  If you withhold your vote, your vote will not be counted as a vote for or against any nominee but will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum. 
The following table contains certain information with respect to the nominees for election to the Board at the 2019 Annual Meeting:

PROPOSAL TWO
APPROVAL OF FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED MEMBER CONTROL AGREEMENT PROPOSED BY THE COMPANY
Proposal Two is to adopt the Control Agreement Amendment proposed by the Company. The primary purpose of the Control Agreement Amendment is to update the Amended and Restated Member Control Agreement dated May 28, 2009 (the "Member Control Agreement") in response to the revised IRS audit procedures for businesses taxed as partnerships, including limited liability companies taxed as partnerships. The general effect is to update the  Member Control Agreement to be in compliance with the IRS audit procedures for businesses taxed as partnerships.  The proposed Control Agreement Amendment is set forth below.
The Member Control Agreement is amended as follows:
1.    Section 3.4 of the Member Control Agreement (Tax Matters) is removed in its entirety and is replaced by the following:
3.4     Tax Matters. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1) Tax Status.  The Company shall be classified and taxed as a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes except to the extent that the Company is to be disregarded as an entity for federal and state income tax purposes pursuant to applicable provisions of the Code.  If the Company is disregarded for income tax purposes, the Company shall not be disregarded as a separate legal entity for any other purpose, including but not limited to, diminishing in any respect the LLC Act providing that a Person owning or holding Membership Interests, Governor, Officer or other agent of the Company is not liable for the acts, debts, liabilities, or obligations of the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2) Appointment. Chairman of the Board is hereby appointed as the "tax matters partner" (as defined in Code Section 6231 prior to its amendment by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ("BBA")) (the "Tax Matters Member") and the "partnership representative" (the "Partnership Representative") as provided in Code Section 6223(a) (as amended by the BBA). The Tax Matters Member or Partnership Representative may resign at any time. The Tax  
[END TABLE]
 Matters Member or Partnership Representative may be removed at any time by the Board. Upon resignation, death, or removal of the Tax Matters Member or Partnership Representative, the Board will select the successor Tax Matters Member or Partnership Representative.

[END TABLE]
BOARD OF GOVERNORS' MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES
The Board generally meets once per month.  The Board held twelve regularly scheduled meetings and no special meetings during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.  Each governor attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.  
The Board does not have a formalized process for holders of membership units to send communications to the Board. The Board feels this is reasonable given the accessibility of our governors.  Members desiring to communicate with the Board  are free to do so by contacting a governor.  The names of our governors are listed on the Company's website at www.redtrailenergyllc.com/investors/board_of_directors or are available by calling the Company's office at (701) 974-3308.  
The Board does not have a policy with regard to governors' attendance at annual meetings. Last year, all seven governors attended the Company's annual meeting.  Due to this high attendance record, it is the view of the Board that such a policy is unnecessary.
Governor and Nominee Independence
All of our governors and nominees are independent, as defined by our Audit Committee Charter. In evaluating the independence of our governors and nominees, we considered the following factors: (i) the business relationships of our governors and nominees; (ii) positions our governors and nominees hold with other companies; (iii) family relationships between our governors and nominees and other individuals involved with the Company; (iv) transactions between our governors and nominees and the Company; and (v) compensation arrangements between our governors and nominees and the Company.
Board Leadership Structure and Role In Risk Oversight
The Company is managed by a Chief Executive Officer that is separate from the Chairman of the Board.  The Board has determined that its leadership structure is effective to create checks and balances between the executive officers of the Company and the Board.  The Board is actively involved in overseeing all material risks that face the Company.  The Board administers its oversight functions by reviewing the operations of the Company, by overseeing the executive officers' management of the Company, and through its risk management committee.  
Code of Ethics
The Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct that applies to all of our employees, officers and governors, and a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Grain Merchandiser and other persons performing similar functions.  The Code of Business Conduct and Code of Ethics are available on the Investors section of our website at www.redtrailenergyllc.com/investors/how_to_invest.  
Committees
The Board has four standing committees:  the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating Committee and Risk Management Committee.  Each committee member attended at least 75% of the committee meetings for all committees on which they served. Audit Committee
The Audit Committee of the Board operates under a charter adopted by the Board on December 22, 2010.  A copy of our Audit Committee charter is posted on our website at www.redtrailenergyllc.com/investors/how_to_invest.  Under the charter, the Audit Committee must have at least three members.  Our Audit Committee members are Ronald Aberle, Ambrose Hoff and William Price.  The chairperson of the Audit Committee is Mr. Aberle.  Our Audit Committee currently does not have an individual designated as a financial expert and has communicated this to the Nominating Committee for their consideration as they review potential nominees for the Board.  The reason the Audit Committee does not have a financial expert is that none of our current governors qualify as a financial expert.  Since the Company is not registered with a national securities exchange, the Audit Committee is exempt from the independence listing standards required by such national securities exchanges.  Our Audit Committee charter requires a majority of our committee members to be independent as defined in the Audit Committee charter.  All three members of our Audit Committee are independent as required by our Audit Committee charter.
The Audit Committee held five meetings during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.  
Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee delivered the following report to the Board of the Company on December 17, 2018. The following report of the Audit Committee shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference in any previous or future documents filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates the report by reference in any such document.
The Audit Committee reviews the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process.  The Company's independent auditors are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the audited financial statements to generally accepted accounting principles.  The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Company's audited financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.  The committee has discussed with Eide Bailly LLP, its independent accountants, the matters required to be discussed under Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 61, as amended Communications with Audit Committee (AS61). The committee has received from the independent auditors written disclosures regarding the auditors' independence required by PCAOB and the Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, and has discussed with the independent auditors, the independent auditors' independence. The committee has considered whether the provision of services by Eide Bailly LLP not related to the audit of the financial statements referred to above and to the reviews of the interim financial statements included in the Company's Forms 10-Q are compatible with maintaining Eide Bailly LLP independence.
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements referred to above be included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
Audit Committee
Ronald Aberle, Chairman
Ambrose Hoff
William Price 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committee has selected Eide Bailly LLP as the independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019.  A representative of Eide Bailly LLP is expected to be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting to respond to questions from the members and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire. 
Audit Fees              
The aggregate fees billed to the Company by our independent registered public accountants, Eide Bailly LLP, during our 2018 and 2017 fiscal years are as follows:   
[BEGIN TABLE]
Category   Fiscal Year   Eide Bailly Fees
Category   Fiscal Year   Eide Bailly Fees
Audit Fees(1)   2018   $ 91,021   
    2017   82,998   
Tax Fees(2)   2018   16,898   
    2017   17,096   
[END TABLE]
The Board is required to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services performed by the Company's independent auditor to assure that the provision of such services does not impair the auditor's independence.  All audit and non-audit services performed by the Company's independent auditor were pre-approved by the Board.  The Board will not authorize the independent auditor to perform any non-audit service which independent auditors are prohibited from performing under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Board may delegate its pre-approval authority to one or more of its governors, but not to management. The governor or governors to whom such authority is delegated shall report any pre-approval decisions to the Board at its next scheduled meeting.
Compensation Committee
The Company's standing Compensation Committee consists of all members of the Board.  Sid Mauch serves as the chairman of the Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee has the overall responsibility for approving and evaluating the Company's governor and Chief Executive Officer's compensation.  Each member of the Compensation Committee is independent pursuant to the independence standard included in the Company's Audit Committee charter.  The Compensation Committee has delegated to the Chief Executive Officer the authority to set compensation for lower executive officers, including the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Grain Merchandiser, and also the authority to implement compensation plans, policies and programs consistent with the Company's philosophy and objectives.  The Compensation Committee has not engaged compensation consultants or any other person to assist in determining or recommending the amount or form of executive or governor compensation, but would consider doing so in those situations where it felt such an engagement was warranted or appropriate.  
The Compensation Committee does not operate under a charter and is exempt from the independence listing standards because the Company's securities are not listed on a national securities exchange or listed in an automated inter-dealer quotation system or a national securities association or to issuers of such securities.  The Compensation Committee held one meeting during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 and each member of the Compensation Committee attended the meeting.
For additional information on the responsibilities and activities of the compensation committees, including the process for determining executive compensation; see the section of this proxy statement entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."
Nominating Committee
The Nominating Committee of the Board consists of Ronald Aberle, Mike Appert, Ambrose Hoff and William Price.  Mr. Appert serves as chairman of the Nominating Committee.  Each member of the Nominating Committee is independent pursuant to the independence standard included in the Company's Audit Committee charter.  The Nominating Committee held one meeting during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 and each member of the Nominating Committee attended the meeting.  The Nominating Committee does not operate under a written charter.   
Governor Nominations Policy
Our Nominating Committee will consider governor candidates recommended by members.  Members interested in submitting the name of a candidate for consideration as governor should send a letter to the Secretary of the Company, P.O. Box 11,  3682 Highway 8 South, Richardton, ND 58652, and specify that the letter should be forwarded to the chairman of the Nominating Committee.  The Board has not yet adopted a formal policy regarding qualifications of governor candidates and we do not have  a policy regarding considering diversity in governor nominees.  In evaluating governor nominees, the nominating Committee and the Board considers a variety of factors, including the appropriate size of the Board; our needs with respect to the particular talents and experience of our governors; the knowledge, skills and experience of nominees, including experience in the ethanol, corn or feed industries, finance, administration or public service, in light of prevailing business conditions and the knowledge, skills and experience already possessed by other members of the Board; experience with accounting rules and practices; and the desire to balance the benefit of continuity with the periodic injection of the fresh perspective provided by new Board members.  To date, we have not engaged third parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying potential nominees, although we reserve the right in the future to retain a third party search firm, if necessary.
On July 31, 2008, the Board adopted an Amended and Restated Operating Agreement, which provided that members must give advance notice to the Company of any business that they propose to bring before an annual meeting or of any person that they propose be nominated as a governor.  Under the advance notice provision, to be timely a member's notice must be received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of members.  With regard to governor nominations, the notice must also set forth (a) the name and address of the member who intends to make the nomination, (b) the name, age, business address and, if known, residence address of each person so proposed, (c) the principal occupation or employment of each person so proposed for the past five years, (d) the number of membership units of the Company beneficially owned by each person so proposed and the earliest date of acquisition of any such membership units, (e) a description of any arrangement or understanding between each person so proposed and the member(s) making such nomination with respect to such person's proposal for nomination and election as a governor and actions to be proposed or taken by such person if elected a governor; and (f) the written consent of each person so proposed to serve as a governor if nominated and elected as a governor.
For the 2019 Annual Meeting, the Nominating Committee evaluated the qualifications and performance of three incumbent governors, Frank Kirschenheiter, Sid Mauch and Anthony Mock, whose terms as Group III governors will expire at the 2019 Annual Meeting and who were each recommended by members of the Company.  Based upon these evaluations, the Nominating Committee nominated and recommended Mr. Kirschenheiter, Mr. Mauch and Mr. Mock for election as governors at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  The Nominating Committee did not receive any nomination, other than for the incumbent governors Frank Kirschenheiter, Sid Mauch and Anthony Mock. 
Risk Management Committee
The Risk Management Committee of the Board consists of Ronald Aberle, Mike Appert, Sid Mauch and Anthony Mock.  Mr. Appert serves as chairman of the Risk Management Committee.  The Risk Management Committee is involved in setting the direction for the Company in relation to its corn and ethanol hedging strategies.  The Risk Management Committee met fifty-nine times during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 and each committee member attended at least 75% of the committee meetings.  
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
The Board has adopted a written policy requiring all governors, officers and employees, and their immediate family members to notify the Board about any transaction, of any size, with the Company.  The Board is responsible for enforcing this policy.  Some of our governors, officers and employees and their immediate family members have sold corn to the Company or purchased E85 or distillers grains from the Company.  These purchases and sales were made on terms available to all parties that do business with the Company, and were as follows for our 2018 fiscal year:

The Company's Code of Business Conduct and Code of Ethics also includes a written policy governing related party transactions, that applies to all of our employees, officers and governors. 
COMPENSATION OF GOVERNORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Overview
Throughout this proxy statement, the individuals who serve as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Grain Merchandiser are referred to as the "executive officers".  The Compensation Committee has responsibility for establishing, implementing and regularly monitoring adherence to the Company's compensation philosophy and objectives.  
In setting compensation, the Compensation Committee took into account the member vote at our 2017 annual member meeting called the "Say-on-Pay," where the Company's members overwhelming voted to endorse the Company's system of compensating its executive officers. 
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
Our compensation programs are designed to achieve the following objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract, retain and motivate highly qualified and talented executives who will contribute to the Company's success by reason of their ability, ingenuity and industry; 
• Link compensation realized to the achievement of the Company's short and long-term financial and strategic goals; 
• Align management and member interests by encouraging long-term member value creation; 
• Maximize the financial efficiency of the compensation program from tax, accounting, cash flow and dilution perspectives; and 
• Support important corporate governance principles and comply with best practices. 
[END TABLE]
Compensation Committee Procedures
The Compensation Committee is responsible for determining the nature and amount of compensation for the Company's Chief Executive Officer and has delegated to the Chief Executive Officer the authority to set compensation for lower executive officers, including the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Grain Merchandiser.  The Compensation Committee has also delegated to the Chief Executive Officer the authority to implement compensation plans, policies and programs consistent with the Company's philosophy and objectives.  
The Compensation Committee recommended that the Company enter into an employment agreement with the Company's Chief Executive Officer effective July 8, 2010.  On April 26, 2017, the agreement was extended until December 31, 2022. The employment agreement provides for an annual base salary and a year-end bonus based on the Company's net income.
Base Salary
The evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer's employment agreement was based on the scope of the chief executive's roles, responsibilities, experience levels and performance, and taking into account competitive market compensation paid by comparable companies for similar positions.   Bonus    
In addition to the base salary, the evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer's employment agreement also included the potential to earn a year-end bonus based on the Company's net income.  The Compensation Committee believes that the alignment of bonus potential with the Company's financial performance is consistent with the Company's compensation philosophy and objectives.  
Accounting and Tax Treatment of Awards
None of our executive officers, governors, or employees receives compensation in excess of $1,000,000 and therefore the entire amount of their compensation is deductible by the Company as a business expense. Certain large executive compensation awards are not tax deductible by companies making such awards. None of our compensation arrangements are likely to reach this cap in the foreseeable future.
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management.  Based upon this review and discussion, the Board determined that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis should be included in this proxy statement.

CEO Pay Ratio
As a result of rules adopted by the SEC, we are disclosing the following information regarding the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018:
• The median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (excluding the Chief Executive Officer) was $86,949.
• The annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, as reported on our Summary Compensation Table, was $263,213.
• Based on this information, the ratio of our Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to our median employee was 3.03:1.00.
Our employee population as of September 30, 2018 (the date we selected to identify our median employee), consisted of 48 individuals, with all of these individuals located in the United States. We identified our median employee based on the annual total compensation paid during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, calculated consistent with the disclosure requirements of executive compensation under Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.
In addition, for purposes of reporting the ratio of annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the median employee, both the Chief Executive Officer and median employee's total compensation paid during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, were calculated consistent with the disclosure requirements of executive compensation under Item 402(c)(2)(x) of  Regulation S-K. The Company has not made any of the adjustments permissible by the SEC, nor have any material assumptions or estimates been made to identify the median employee or to determine annual total compensation.
