LETTER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS FROM OUR  BOARD OF TRUSTEES
Dear Fellow Shareholders: 
              Please join us for our annual meeting on Thursday, May 16, 2019. The business to be conducted at the meeting is explained in the attached Notice of Meeting and Proxy Statement. We believe furnishing these materials over the internet expedites shareholders' receipt of these important materials while lowering cost and reducing the environmental impact of our annual meeting. 
              Please be assured that our Board takes seriously our role in the oversight of our Company's long term business strategy, which is the best path to long term value creation for you, our shareholders. With this in mind, we have begun what we expect to be a multiyear process of re-examining our fundamental governance policies as we understand that good governance is critical to building and keeping shareholder confidence and to long term value creation. Shareholder engagement and feedback have been critical components of this re-examination. Our initial steps include: expanding the size of our Board to add two additional members; engaging an executive search consulting firm to help us identify and vet qualified and diverse board candidates so that we can, as needed, refresh our Board and add members with diverse skills and backgrounds; adopting a proxy access bylaw; and amending our Bylaws so we have a plurality vote standard for contested elections of our Trustees. We discuss our plans in more detail in the accompanying Proxy Statement. 
              We thank you for your investment in Office Properties Income Trust and for the confidence you put in this Board to oversee your interests in our business.

     Review of Corporate Governance Policies and Shareholder Engagement   
[END TABLE]
In recognition of the relationship between corporate governance and long term performance and as a result of engagement with and feedback from our shareholders, the Board has embarked on a review of the Company's corporate governance principles. The Board expects that corporate governance reform will be a multi-year process and, as it weighs various alternatives, the Board is prioritizing its consideration based on a review of best practices and input from our shareholders. Based on these principles, the Board has established the following priorities and taken the following steps:
The Board has also instituted a number of complementary mechanisms to allow shareholders to communicate their points of view, including:
As the Board continues on the path to enhanced good governance, we appreciate your support of the Board and these initiatives.

     Board Composition, Expansion and Refreshment   
[END TABLE]
We are currently governed by an eight member Board of Trustees. Ensuring the Board is comprised of Trustees who bring diverse viewpoints and perspectives, exhibit a variety of skills, professional experience and backgrounds and effectively represent the long-term interests of shareholders is a top priority of the Board and the Nominating and Governance Committee. Following our merger with Select Income REIT ("SIR"), we increased the size of the Board from six to eight members. The Board continues to evaluate its composition, including to ensure the proper mix of skills and diversity among Board members, ensure a smooth transition if and when a Trustee decides to retire or otherwise leaves the Board and ensure that the Board is comprised of individuals with a diverse set of backgrounds, perspectives and skills. The Board believes that continuity is important to the effective conduct of our business and expects that any refreshment will take place over several years. To facilitate these efforts, the Board has retained Korn Ferry, a leading executive search and consulting firm, to act as an advisor and to assist the Nominating and Governance Committee in:

     The Board's Role in Oversight of Risk Management   
[END TABLE]
The Board is elected by shareholders to oversee the Company's business and long term strategy. As part of fulfilling its responsibilities, the Board oversees the safeguarding of the Company's assets, the maintenance of appropriate financial and other internal controls and the Company's compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Inherent in these responsibilities is the Board's understanding and oversight of the various risks the Company faces. The Board considers that risks should not be viewed in isolation and should be considered in virtually every business decision and as part of the Company's business strategy. 
The Board oversees risk as part of its general oversight of the Company. Oversight of risk is addressed as part of various Board and Board committee activities and through regular and special Board and Board committee meetings. The day to day business of the Company is conducted by our manager, The RMR Group LLC ("RMR LLC"), and RMR LLC and the Company's officers and Director of Internal Audit are responsible for incorporating risk management in their activities. The Company's Director of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee and provides the Company advice and assistance with the Company's risk management function. 
In discharging their oversight responsibilities, the Board and Board committees review regularly a wide range of reports RMR LLC and other service providers provide, including:
6         2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
The Board and Board committees discuss these matters among themselves and with representatives of RMR LLC, officers of the Company, the Director of Internal Audit, legal counsel, the Company's independent auditors and other professionals, as appropriate. 
The Audit Committee takes a leading role in helping the Board fulfill its responsibilities for oversight of the Company's financial reporting, internal audit function, risk management and the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Board and Audit Committee review periodic reports from the Company's independent auditors regarding potential risks, including risks related to the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also reviews, approves and oversees an internal audit plan developed by the Company's Director of Internal Audit with the goal of helping the Company systematically evaluate the effectiveness of its risk management, control and governance processes on an annual basis. The Audit Committee considers risks relating to cybersecurity, receiving regular reports from management regarding cybersecurity risks and countermeasures being undertaken or considered by the Company, including updates on the internal and external cybersecurity landscape and relevant technical developments. The Audit Committee meets at least quarterly and reports its findings to the Board. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the Company's Director of Internal Audit to review the results of the Company's internal audits, and directs or recommends to the Board actions or changes it determines appropriate to enhance or improve the effectiveness of the Company's risk management. 
The Compensation Committee whose duties are detailed in its charter, among other duties, evaluates the performance of the Company's Director of Internal Audit and RMR LLC's performance under the Company's business and property management agreements, including any perceived risks created by compensation arrangements. Also, the Compensation Committee and the Board consider that the Company has a share award program that requires share awards to executive officers to vest over a period of years. The Company believes that the use of share awards vesting over time rather than stock options mitigates the incentives for the Company's management to undertake undue risks and encourages management to make longer term and appropriately risk balanced decisions. 
It is not possible to identify all of the risks that may affect the Company or to develop processes and controls to eliminate all risks and their possible effects, and processes and controls employed to address risks may be limited in their effectiveness. Moreover, it is necessary for the Company to bear certain risks to achieve its objectives. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the Company's ability to manage risk is subject to substantial limitations. 
To learn more about the risks facing the Company, you can review the matters discussed in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements" in our Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 ("Annual Report"). The risks described in the Annual Report are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that may currently be deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.

     Trustee Independence   
[END TABLE]
Under the corporate governance listing standards of the Nasdaq, the Board must consist of a majority of Independent Trustees. Our governing documents also require that a majority of the Board be Independent Trustees. Under our governing documents, Independent Trustees are Trustees who are not employees of RMR LLC, are not involved in the Company's day to day activities and who meet the qualifications for independence under the applicable rules of the Nasdaq and the SEC. 
The Board affirmatively determines whether Trustees have a direct or indirect material relationship with the Company, including the Company's subsidiaries, other than serving as the Company's Trustees or trustees or directors of the Company's subsidiaries. In making independence determinations, the Board observes the Nasdaq and SEC criteria, as well as the criteria set forth in our governing documents. When assessing a Trustee's relationship with the Company, the Board considers all relevant facts and 
    2019 Proxy Statement    7
Table of Contents circumstances, not merely from the Trustee's standpoint, but also from that of the persons or organizations with which the Trustee has an affiliation. Based on this review, the Board has determined that Donna D. Fraiche, Barbara D. Gilmore, John L. Harrington, William A. Lamkin, Elena B. Poptodorova and Jeffrey P. Somers currently qualify as independent trustees under applicable Nasdaq and SEC criteria and as Independent Trustees under our governing documents. In making these independence determinations, the Board reviewed and discussed additional information provided by the Trustees and the Company with regard to each of the Trustees' relationships with the Company, RMR Inc. or RMR LLC and the other companies to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services. The Board has concluded that none of these six Trustees possessed or currently possesses any relationship that could impair his or her judgment in connection with his or her duties and responsibilities as a Trustee or that could otherwise be a direct or indirect material relationship under applicable Nasdaq and SEC standards.

     Executive Sessions of Independent Trustees   
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to the Company's Governance Guidelines, our Independent Trustees are expected to meet at least twice per year in regularly scheduled meetings at which only Independent Trustees are present. Our Independent Trustees also meet separately with the Company's officers, with the Company's Director of Internal Audit and with the Company's independent auditors. The presiding Trustee for purposes of leading Independent Trustee sessions will be the Chair of the Audit Committee, unless the Independent Trustees determine otherwise. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Board Leadership Structure   
[END TABLE]
In accordance with our governing documents, the Board is comprised of eight Trustees, including six Independent Trustees and two Managing Trustees, and our Board is divided into three classes, with each Trustee of each class elected at an annual meeting of shareholders serving for a term that continues until the third annual meeting of shareholders following his or her election and until his or her successor is elected and qualifies. All Trustees play an active role in overseeing the Company's business both at the Board and committee levels. As set forth in the Company's Governance Guidelines, the core responsibility of our Trustees is to exercise sound, informed and independent business judgment in overseeing the Company and its strategic direction. Our Trustees are skilled and experienced leaders and currently serve or have served as members of senior management in public and private for profit organizations and law firms, and have also served as government officials and in academia. Our Trustees may be called upon to provide solutions to various complex issues and are expected to, and do, ask hard questions of the Company's officers and advisers. The Board is small, which facilitates informal discussions and communication from management to the Board and among Trustees. We do not have a Chairman of the Board or a lead Independent Trustee. 
Our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and our Director of Internal Audit regularly attend Board and Board committee meetings. Special meetings of the Board may be called at any time by any Managing Trustee, the President or pursuant to the request of any two Trustees then in office. Our Managing Trustees, in consultation with the Company's management and the Director of Internal Audit, set the agenda for Board meetings. Other Trustees may suggest agenda items. Discussions at Board meetings are led by the Managing Trustee or Independent Trustee who is most knowledgeable on a subject. 
Six of our Trustees, including two of our nominees for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting, are independent under the applicable Nasdaq and SEC criteria and our Bylaws. All of the members of the Audit Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee and Compensation Committee are independent under the applicable listing requirements and rules of the Nasdaq and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, including those of the SEC. As set forth in our governing documents, two of our Trustees are Managing Trustees, persons who have been employees, officers or directors of RMR LLC or who have been involved in the Company's day to day activities for at least one year prior to his or her election as Trustees.

     Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Committee Governance   
[END TABLE]
The Board is committed to corporate governance that promotes the long term interests of our shareholders. The Board has established Governance Guidelines that provide a framework for effective governance. The Board regularly reviews developments in corporate governance and updates our Governance Guidelines and other governance materials as it deems necessary and appropriate. 
The Company has also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") to, among other things, provide guidance to our Trustees and officers and RMR LLC, its officers and employees and its parent's and subsidiaries' directors, officers and employees to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
The Board has an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee. The Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee each have adopted a written charter, and reviews its written charter on an annual basis to consider whether any changes are required. 
Our corporate governance materials are available for review in the governance section of our website, including our Governance Guidelines, the charter for each Board committee, the Code and information about how to report concerns or complaints about accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and any violations or possible violations of the Code and how to communicate with our Trustees, individually or as a group.

     Vote Standard for Election of Trustees and Trustee Resignation Policy   
[END TABLE]
In March 2019, the Board adopted an amendment to our Bylaws to provide that, in contested elections, our Trustees will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by our shareholders. This amendment was adopted to ensure that, in contested elections, those Trustee nominees who receive the largest number of votes are elected by shareholders to the Board. This amendment aligns our voting practices for contested elections with the guidelines of many institutional shareholders and proxy advisory firms and is consistent with best practices. 
Our governing documents provide that if an incumbent Trustee does not receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election, the Trustee will submit an offer to resign from the Board. In such circumstance, the Nominating and Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation offer, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the resignation offer taking into account the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee and make its decision within 90 days following the certification of the election results. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Adoption of Proxy Access Bylaw   
[END TABLE]
In March 2019, after extensive analysis and shareholder engagement, the Nominating and Governance Committee recommended, and the Board adopted, a proxy access bylaw pursuant to which a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least three percent of the outstanding Common Shares continuously for at least three years, may nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials for an annual meeting Trustee nominees constituting up to the greater of two nominees or 20% of the number of Trustees on the Board that holders of our Common Shares are entitled to elect, provided that for so long as the Company has a classified Board of less than nine Trustees, such number of Trustee nominees will be reduced so that for any annual meeting it does not exceed one-half of the number of Trustees to be elected at the meeting as noticed by the Company rounded down to the nearest whole number (but not rounded down as a result of this proviso to less than one). Shareholders making such a nomination and their nominees must also satisfy the informational, documentation and other requirements specified by Section 2.18 of our Bylaws.

     Nominations for Trustees   
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating nominees for Trustee and for recommending to the Board nominees for election at each annual meeting of shareholders. The Nominating and Governance Committee may consider candidates suggested by the Company's Trustees, officers or shareholders or by others. Shareholders who would like to recommend a nominee for the position of Trustee should submit their recommendations in writing by mail to the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee, c/o Office Properties Income Trust, Secretary, at Two Newton Place, 255 Washington Street, Suite 300, Newton, Massachusetts 02458 or by email to secretary@opireit.com.

The Nominating and Governance Committee may request additional information about the shareholder recommended nominee or about the shareholder recommending the nominee. Recommendations by shareholders will be considered by the Nominating and Governance Committee in its discretion using the same criteria as other candidates it considers. 
As noted above, a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least three percent of the outstanding Common Shares continuously for at least three years may utilize our proxy access bylaw to nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials Trustee candidate(s) for election at an annual meeting of shareholders provided that the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the informational, documentation and other requirements specified by Section 2.18 of our Bylaws. 
Shareholders seeking to nominate one or more individuals as a Trustee candidate without relying on our proxy access bylaw shall comply with the advance notice requirements for shareholder nominations set forth in Section 2.14 of our Bylaws, which include, among other things, requirements as to the proposing shareholder's timely delivery of advance notice, continuous requisite ownership of Common Shares and submission of specified documentation and information.

      BOARD MEETINGS     
In 2018, the Board held 12 meetings. In 2018, each then Trustee attended 75% or more of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served or that were held during the period in which the Trustee served as a Trustee or committee member. All of the then Trustees attended last year's annual meeting of shareholders. The Company's policy with respect to Board members' attendance at meetings of the Board and annual meetings of shareholders can be found in the Company's Governance Guidelines, the full text of which appears at the Company's website, www.opireit.com. 
      TRUSTEE COMPENSATION     
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Compensation of Trustees   
[END TABLE]
The Board of Trustees believes that competitive compensation arrangements are necessary to attract and retain qualified Independent Trustees. On May 24, 2018, after conducting a market review with respect to leading companies of similar size to the Company as well as an industry peer group and other companies managed by RMR LLC or its subsidiaries, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board approved the Company's compensation arrangements for Independent Trustees of the Company. 
The Company will continue to compensate its Independent Trustees through the use of annual retainers plus fees for meetings attended. Effective May 24, 2018, each Independent Trustee receives an annual fee of $50,000 for services as a Trustee, plus a fee of $1,250 for each Board or Board committee meeting attended. Up to two $1,250 fees are paid if a Board meeting and one or more Board committee meetings, or two or more Board committee meetings, are held on the same date. Each Independent Trustee who serves as a committee chair of the Board's Audit, Compensation or Nominating and Governance Committees also receives an additional annual fee of $15,000, $10,000 and $10,000, respectively. Trustees are reimbursed for travel expenses they incur in connection with their duties as Trustees and for out of pocket costs they incur in connection with their attending certain continuing education programs. 
Each Independent Trustee and Managing Trustee also receives an award of Common Shares annually, which was 3,000 Common Shares in 2018. Managing Trustees do not receive cash compensation for their services as Trustees. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Trustee Share Ownership Guidelines   
[END TABLE]
The Board believes it is important to align the interests of Trustees with those of our shareholders, and for Trustees to hold equity ownership positions in the Company. Accordingly, each Trustee is expected to hold at least 20,000 Common Shares by the later of: (i) the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders of the Company and (ii) five years from the annual meeting of shareholders of the Company at which the Trustee was initially elected or, if earlier, the first annual meeting of shareholders of the Company following the initial appointment of the Trustee to the Board. Compliance with these ownership guidelines is measured as of the end of each fiscal year. For purposes of determining compliance with these ownership guidelines, Common Shares owned as of immediately prior to the Company's one-for-four reverse share split, which was effective on December 31, 2018 (the "Reverse Share Split"), by Trustees who were serving as Trustees of the Company or trustees of SIR as of immediately prior to SIR's merger with and into a subsidiary of the Company on December 31, 2018 (the "SIR Merger"), and which Common Shares are owned continuously thereafter through the end of the applicable compliance measurement period, are not adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Share Split. Any Trustee who is prohibited by law or by applicable regulation of his or her employer from owning equity in the Company is exempt from this requirement. The Nominating and Governance Committee may consider whether exceptions should be made for any Trustee on whom this requirement could impose a financial hardship. 
As of February 28, 2019, all Trustees have met or, within the applicable period, are expected to meet, these share ownership guidelines.

      PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION     
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Company seeks a non-binding advisory vote from its shareholders to approve the compensation of its named executive officers as described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section beginning on page 26 and the "Executive Compensation" section beginning on page 32. 
The Board recommends that shareholders vote FOR the following resolution: 
RESOLVED: That the shareholders of the Company approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation paid by the Company to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" in this Proxy Statement. 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, the Board values shareholders' opinions and the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. 
Assuming a quorum is present at the meeting, approval of the advisory vote to approve executive compensation requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
   The Board of Trustees recommends a vote "FOR" the advisory vote to approve executive compensation.

      COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS     
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Compensation Overview   
[END TABLE]
The Company's compensation structure is unique because of its relationship with RMR LLC. The Company's business management agreement with RMR LLC is designed to incentivize RMR LLC to provide the highest quality services to the Company. RMR LLC's base business management fee is based on the lower of the historical cost of the Company's properties and the Company's market capitalization. RMR LLC may earn an incentive management fee based on the three year total return of the Common Shares relative to an index of the Company's peers. Because they are employees of RMR LLC and not the Company, RMR LLC, not the Company, determines the cash compensation payable to the Company's named executive officers. The Company does not reimburse RMR LLC for compensation RMR LLC paid or pays to the Company's executive officers, and the Company's management agreements with RMR LLC do not require RMR LLC to allocate or pay a specific amount or percentage of RMR LLC's management fees to the named executive officers or require those officers to dedicate a specified amount of their time to Company business. As part of the Company's shareholder engagement to address prior Say on Pay votes, the Company endeavored to better explain to shareholders these arrangements with RMR LLC and to help them understand that disclosure of cash compensation to the Company's named executive officers would not reflect actions or considerations by our Compensation Committee. 
Pursuant to its management agreement with RMR LLC, RMR LLC provides services that otherwise would be provided by employees and, as a result, the Company does not have any employees of our own. The Company's named executive officers are employees of RMR LLC. RMR LLC conducts the Company's day to day operations on the Company's behalf and compensates or compensated the Company's named executive officers directly and in its sole discretion in connection with their services rendered to the Company and to RMR LLC and the other companies managed by RMR LLC or its subsidiaries. The Compensation Committee is satisfied with this arrangement because of the imbedded compensation incentives for RMR LLC in the Company's business management agreement. The Company does not pay its named executive officers salaries or bonuses or provide other compensatory benefits except for the awards of Common Shares under the Office Properties Income Trust 2009 Incentive Share Award Plan, as amended (the "Share Award Plan"), discussed below. RMR LLC, not the Company, determines the cash compensation payable to the Company's named executive officers. The Company does not reimburse RMR LLC for compensation RMR LLC paid or pays to the Company's executive officers. None of the Company's named executive officers has an employment agreement with the Company or with RMR LLC. Except for the share award agreements and the retirement agreement RMR LLC entered into with Mark L. Kleifges, who resigned as the Company's Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer effective December 31, 2018, discussed below under "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control," none of the Company's named executive officers has an agreement that provides for payments or benefits upon or in connection with his termination or a change in control of the Company. Although the Compensation Committee reviews and approves the Company's business management and property management agreements with RMR LLC, it is not involved in compensation decisions made by RMR LLC for its employees other than the employee serving as the Company's Director of Internal Audit. The Company's payments to RMR LLC are described in "Certain Related Person Transactions" beginning on page 48 of this Proxy Statement. For information regarding the compensation paid by RMR LLC and RMR Inc. to the named executive officers of RMR Inc., please see the below "RMR LLC and RMR Inc. Compensation Practices" section and the documents filed by RMR Inc. with the SEC, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 and its Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A for its 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. RMR Inc.'s filings with the SEC are not incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement.

     Compensation Philosophy   
[END TABLE]
The Company's compensation program for its executive officers consists of awards of shares under the Share Award Plan. The Compensation Committee believes that these share awards recognize the Company's executive officers' scope of responsibilities, reward demonstrated performance and leadership, motivate future performance and further align the interests of the executive officers with those of our shareholders.

     Overview of 2018 Compensation Actions   
[END TABLE]
In September 2018, the Chair of the Compensation Committee met with one of the Company's Managing Trustees, Adam D. Portnoy, and the chairs of the compensation committees of RMR Inc. and of the then other public companies to which RMR LLC provides management services, which included: the Company; Hospitality Properties Trust ("HPT"); Industrial Logistics Properties Trust ("ILPT"); SIR; Senior Housing Properties Trust ("SNH"); Tremont Mortgage Trust ("TRMT" and, together with HPT, ILPT, SIR and SNH, the "Other RMR Managed REITs"); Five Star Senior Living Inc. ("FVE"); and TravelCenters of America LLC ("TA"). The purposes of this meeting were, among other things, to discuss compensation philosophy and factors that may affect compensation decisions, to consider the compensation payable to the Company's Director of Internal Audit (who provides services to the Company and to other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services), to consider the allocation of internal audit and related services costs among RMR Inc., the Company and other companies to which RMR LLC provides such services, to provide a comparative understanding of potential share awards by the Company and the other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services and to hear and consider recommendations from RMR LLC concerning potential share awards and the vesting of those shares. The share awards made by the other companies managed by RMR LLC are considered to be appropriate comparisons because of the similarities between certain services the Company requires from the Company's share awardees and the services provided by awardees providing similar services to these other companies. Subsequent to this meeting, the members of the Compensation Committee held a meeting at which the Compensation Committee Chair provided a report of the information discussed with Mr. Adam D. Portnoy and others, and made recommendations for share awards to the Company's named executive officers. The Compensation Committee then discussed these recommendations and other factors, including the following factors for the 2018 share awards: (i) the value of the proposed share awards; (ii) the historical awards previously awarded to these named executive officers and the corresponding values at the time of the awards; (iii) the recommendations of RMR LLC as presented by Mr. Adam D. Portnoy, president and chief executive officer of RMR LLC; (iv) the value of share awards to executive officers providing comparable services at the applicable Other RMR Managed REITs and companies to which RMR LLC provides management services; (v) the scope of, and any changes to, the responsibilities assigned to, or assumed by, these named executive officers during the past year and on a going forward basis; (vi) the length of historical services by these named executive officers; (vii) the Compensation Committee's perception regarding the quality of the services provided by these named executive officers in carrying out those responsibilities; and (viii) the Company's financial and operating performance in the past year and the Company's perceived future prospects. The Compensation Committee considered these multiple factors in determining whether to increase or decrease the amounts of the prior year's awards. There was no formulaic approach in the use of these various factors in determining the number of shares to award to each named executive officer. The share amounts were determined on a subjective basis, using the various factors in the Compensation Committee's sole discretion. These named executive officers did not participate in these meetings and were not involved in determining or recommending the amount or form of named executive officer compensation they received from the Company.

     Analysis of 2018 Awards under the Share Award Plan   
[END TABLE]
Although the Company does not pay any cash compensation directly to its officers and has no employees, the Company has adopted the Share Award Plan to reward the Company's named executive officers and other RMR LLC employees who provide services to the Company and to foster a continuing identity of interest between them and our shareholders. The Company awards shares under the Share Award Plan to recognize the named executive officers' scope of responsibilities, reward demonstrated performance and leadership, motivate future performance, align the interests of the Company's executives with those of the Company's other shareholders and motivate the executives to remain employees of the Company's manager and to continue to provide services to the Company through the term of the awards. 
Under its charter, the Compensation Committee evaluates, approves and administers the Company's equity compensation plans, which currently consist solely of the Share Award Plan. The Compensation Committee has historically determined to use awards of Common Shares under the Share Award Plan rather than stock options as equity compensation. Because the value of the Common Shares may be determined in part by reference to its dividend yield relative to market interest rates rather than by its potential for capital appreciation, the Company believes a conventional stock option plan might not provide appropriate incentives for management for a business like that of the Company, but a share award plan may create a better identity of interests between management and other shareholders. Also, because the Company believes a stock option plan could have the potential to encourage excessive short term risk taking, the Company has historically granted share awards rather than stock options. 
The Compensation Committee uses comparative information about the applicable Other RMR Managed REITs as additional data to help it determine whether it is awarding share amounts that are reasonable based on the characteristics of those REITs and their respective officers. The Compensation Committee also considers the size and structure of the applicable Other RMR Managed REITs and other RMR LLC managed businesses, and the experience, length of service and scope of duties and responsibilities of the officers at these other companies to assess the appropriateness of the value of the share awards proposed for the Company's officers in light of the proposed awards for officers with comparable roles at the other companies. The Compensation Committee reviewed the compensation data regarding the applicable Other RMR Managed REITs and their officers, together with the other factors discussed above, but the Compensation Committee did not undertake a detailed comparison of the named executive officers across the applicable Other RMR Managed REITs or other companies managed by RMR LLC or assign weight to any particular characteristic of these other companies or their officers because the Compensation Committee determines the share amounts in its sole discretion on a non-formulaic basis. In 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the foregoing factors and decided to award the same number of shares to Messrs. Blackman and Kleifges as was awarded in 2017, in accordance with the recommendation of RMR LLC and the Chair of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee also determined that it would be appropriate to provide that such share awards would vest upon the occurrence of certain corporate "change in control" or termination events. Mr. Kleifges resigned as the Company's Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer effective December 31, 2018. In connection with Mr. Kleifges's retirement, the Compensation Committee approved the accelerated vesting of Mr. Kleifges's unvested Common Shares as of June 30, 2019. 
The Company determines the fair market value of the shares awarded based on the closing price of the Common Shares on the date of the award. The Compensation Committee has imposed, and may impose, vesting and other conditions on the awarded Common Shares because it believes that time based vesting encourages the recipients of the share awards to remain employed by RMR LLC and to continue to provide services to the Company. The Compensation Committee currently uses a vesting schedule under which one fifth of the shares vest immediately and the remaining shares vest in four equal, consecutive annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the date of the award. The Compensation Committee utilizes a four year time based vesting schedule to provide an incentive to provide services for a long term and in consideration of the tax treatment of the share awards to the Company and to the recipients. In the event a recipient who has been awarded a share award ceases to perform duties for the Company or ceases to be an officer or an employee of RMR LLC or any company that RMR LLC or its 
28         2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents subsidiaries manage during the vesting period, the Company may cause the forfeiture of, or the Company may repurchase for nominal consideration, the Common Shares that have not yet vested. As with other issued Common Shares, vested and unvested shares awarded under the Share Award Plan are entitled to receive distributions that the Company makes, if any, on the Common Shares. As described above, the Compensation Committee approved the accelerated vesting of Mr. Kleifges's unvested Common Shares as of June 30, 2019. 
Because the consideration of share awards by the Compensation Committee and the Board is determined on a regular schedule (i.e., in September for the Company's officers and employees of RMR LLC and at the first meeting of the Board after the annual meeting of shareholders for the Trustees), the proximity of any awards to earnings announcements or other market events, if any, is coincidental. 
The Compensation Committee believes that its compensation philosophy and programs are designed to foster a business culture that aligns the interests of its named executive officers with those of its shareholders. The Compensation Committee believes that the equity compensation of its named executive officers is appropriate to the goal of providing shareholders dependable, long term returns.

     Frequency of Say on Pay   
[END TABLE]
The Company's current policy, consistent with the prior vote of our shareholders, is to provide shareholders with an opportunity to approve, on an advisory basis, the Company's compensation of the Company's named executive officers each year at the annual meeting of shareholders. Accordingly, the Company is providing shareholders with an opportunity to approve this compensation. As noted above, the Company's only compensation to the Company's named executive officers is Common Share awards. None of the Company's named executive officers are employed by the Company. The Company's manager, RMR LLC, provides services that otherwise would be provided by employees and employs and compensates the Company's named executive officers directly and in RMR LLC's sole discretion in connection with their services rendered to the Company and to RMR LLC and the other companies managed by RMR LLC or its subsidiaries. 
In evaluating the Company's compensation process for 2018, the Compensation Committee generally considered the results of the most recent advisory vote of our shareholders on the compensation of the executive officers named in the proxy statement for the Company's 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.

     RMR LLC and RMR Inc. Compensation Practices   
[END TABLE]
RMR LLC has advised the Company that in 2018 RMR LLC paid each of the Company's named executive officers cash compensation comprised of a fixed salary and a cash bonus. RMR LLC did not provide guaranteed cash bonuses to these named executive officers during 2018 and did not set specific performance targets on which bonuses would be payable to them. Instead, the annual cash bonuses paid by RMR LLC to these named executive officers in 2018 were discretionary in amount and were based on a performance evaluation conducted by the compensation committee of RMR Inc. 
As explained above, the Company's manager, RMR LLC, provides services that otherwise would be provided by employees, conducts the Company's day to day operations on the Company's behalf and compensates or compensated the Company's named executive officers directly and in its sole discretion in connection with their services rendered to the Company and to RMR LLC and the other companies managed by RMR LLC or its subsidiaries. The Company does not pay its named executive officers salaries or bonuses or provide other compensatory benefits except for awards of Common Shares under the Share Award Plan. The Company does not reimburse RMR LLC for compensation RMR LLC or RMR Inc. pays or paid to the Company's named executive officers. 
RMR Inc., the parent of RMR LLC, awarded 4,000 shares of Class A common stock of RMR Inc., with an award date fair value of $380,000, each to Mr. Blackman and Mr. Kleifges. One fifth of the shares awarded vested on the award date and an additional one fifth vests on each of the next four anniversaries

RMR LLC has also informed the Company that it is not able to allocate with reasonable certainty or provide a reasonable estimate of the compensation paid by RMR LLC to our named executive officers for their services to the Company for a number of reasons:

      PROPOSAL 3: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS INDEPENDENT  AUDITORS     
The Audit Committee has the sole authority and responsibility to hire, evaluate and, when appropriate, replace our independent auditors and is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and general oversight of the work of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee is responsible for approving the audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditors and the associated fees. 
The Audit Committee evaluates the performance of our independent auditors annually and determines whether to re-engage the current independent auditors or consider other audit firms. In doing so, the Audit Committee considers the quality and efficiency of the services provided by the auditors, the auditors' technical expertise and knowledge of our operations and industry, the auditors' independence, legal proceedings involving the auditors, the results of PCAOB inspections and peer quality reviews of the auditors and the auditors' reputation in the marketplace. In connection with the mandated rotation of the independent auditors' lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its chair consider the selection of the new lead engagement partner identified by the independent auditors. 
Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Ernst & Young LLP has served as the Company's independent auditors since our formation in 2009 and is considered by management and the Audit Committee to be well qualified. Further, the Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
The Audit Committee has determined to submit its selection of the independent auditors to our shareholders for ratification. This vote will ratify prior action by the Audit Committee and will not be binding upon the Audit Committee. However, the Audit Committee may reconsider its prior appointment of the independent auditors or consider the results of this vote when it determines who to appoint as our independent auditors in the future.

 Audit Fees. This category includes fees associated with the annual financial statements audit and related audit procedures, the audit of internal control over financial reporting, work performed in connection with any registration statements and any applicable Current Reports on Form 8-K and the review of any of the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The increase in audit fees from 2017 to 2018 was due primarily to audit fees related to the registration statement filed in connection with the SIR Merger. 
 Audit Related Fees. This category consists of services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of financial statements and are not included in "Audit Fees." These services principally include due diligence in connection with acquisitions, consultation on accounting and internal control matters, audits in connection with proposed or consummated acquisitions, information systems audits and other attest services. 
 Tax Fees. This category consists of fees for tax services, including tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. The decrease in tax fees in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to tax fees for tax services in connection with our acquisition of First Potomac Realty Trust in 2017. 
 All Other Fees. This category consists of services that are not included in the above categories. The amounts for 2018 and 2017 reflect annual subscription fees for Ernst & Young LLP's online accounting research application.

     Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditors   
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has established policies and procedures that are intended to control the services provided by our independent auditors and to monitor their continuing independence. Under these policies, our independent auditors may not undertake any services unless the engagement is specifically approved by the Audit Committee or the services are included within a category that has been approved by the Audit Committee. The maximum charge for services is established by the Audit Committee when the specific engagement or the category of services is approved. In certain circumstances, our management is required to notify the Audit Committee when approved services are undertaken and the Audit Committee or its Chair may approve amendments or modifications to the engagement or the maximum fees. Our Director of Internal Audit is responsible for reporting to the Audit Committee regarding compliance with these policies and procedures. 
The Audit Committee will not approve engagements of the independent auditors to perform non-audit services for the Company if doing so will cause the independent auditors to cease to be independent within the meaning of applicable SEC or Nasdaq rules. In other circumstances, the Audit Committee considers, among other things, whether our independent auditors are able to provide the required services in a more or less effective and efficient manner than other available service providers and whether the services are consistent with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rules. 
All services for which the Company engaged its independent auditors in fiscal 2018 and 2017 were approved by the Audit Committee. The total fees for audit and non-audit services provided by Ernst & Young LLP in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 are set forth above. The Audit Committee approved the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP to provide the non-audit services described above because it determined that Ernst & Young LLP providing these services would not compromise Ernst & Young LLP's independence and that the firm's familiarity with our record keeping and accounting systems would permit the firm to provide these services with equal or higher quality, more efficiently and at a lower cost than the Company could obtain these services from other providers.

   PROPOSAL 4:  APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE OFFICE PROPERTIES INCOME TRUST 2009 INCENTIVE SHARE AWARD PLAN, AS AMENDED 
The Share Award Plan became effective on June 11, 2009, and is scheduled to expire on June 11, 2019. We are asking shareholders to approve an amendment to the Share Award Plan to extend the term of the plan by three years to June 11, 2022. No increase to the number of Common Shares available for award under the Share Award Plan is being proposed. 
The Share Award Plan currently provides that an aggregate of 500,000 Common Shares are available for award under the plan pursuant to grants of Common Shares or Common Shares subject to restrictions ("Restricted Shares"). As of December 31, 2018, 330,372 Common Shares were available for grants of future awards pursuant to the Share Award Plan, and there were 55,321 unvested Restricted Shares outstanding, which remain subject to possible forfeiture to, or repurchase for nominal consideration by, us as provided in applicable share award agreements. We anticipate that the number of Common Shares available for issuance under the Share Award Plan will be sufficient to allow us to satisfy the Company's anticipated share award plans through the extended term of the plan. 
The Board believes that equity and equity-based compensation assists in recognizing executive's and other service provider's scope of responsibilities, rewarding demonstrated performance and leadership, motivating future performance, aligning the interests of the Company's executives and other service providers with those of the Company's other shareholders and motivating executives and other service providers to remain in the service of the Company and RMR LLC and to continue to provide services to the Company through the term of the awards. The Share Award Plan is the only plan the Company has to provide equity and equity-based incentive compensation to eligible individuals. The term of the Share Award Plan will expire on June 11, 2019, following which, absent approval of the amendment to the Share Award Plan, we will no longer have an equity compensation plan to assist us in accomplishing our compensation objectives. Shareholder approval of the amendment to the Share Award Plan will permit us to use the plan to satisfy our equity compensation needs through June 11, 2022. 
For purposes of evaluating our equity compensation program, shareholders may wish to consider two key metrics: "historical burn rate" and "dilution."

     Material Terms of the Share Award Plan, as Amended   
[END TABLE]
A copy of the Share Award Plan, which reflects Amendment No. 1 to the Share Award Plan adopted on August 25, 2015, and the proposed amendment to the Share Award Plan ("Amendment No. 2"), is set forth as Annex A to this Proxy Statement. All references to the Share Award Plan hereafter are to the Share Award Plan as it would be amended by Amendment No. 2, unless otherwise indicated. The material features of the Share Award Plan are described below. The following description is intended to 
38         2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents be a summary, and does not purport to be a complete statement of the terms of the Share Award Plan. Accordingly, this summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to Annex A. 
 Administration.    The Share Award Plan will continue to be administered by the Board or, in the discretion of the Board, a committee designated by the Board and composed of at least two members of the Board. As of the effective date of the Share Award Plan, the Board has delegated its authority to administer the Share Award Plan to the Compensation Committee; however, the Board may revoke or rescind this delegation of authority in whole or in part at any time. Each member of any committee administering the Share Award Plan is required to be a "non-employee director" (within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act). The Board or a committee thereof has the authority to administer the Share Award Plan, including the authority to interpret the plan, to make awards thereunder (and determine the terms of such awards) and to adopt and approve from time to time the forms of share award agreements under the Share Award Plan. 
 Awards.    The Share Award Plan permits discretionary awards of Common Shares, which will be subject to such terms and conditions as the Board or a committee may determine, which may include, without limitation, terms with respect to vesting, forfeiture, repurchase and transfer restrictions, typically based on continued employment or service. If it determines to do so, the Board or the designated committee may award shares under the Share Award Plan that are not subject to vesting, forfeiture, repurchase and transfer restrictions. 
 Participants.    The Share Award Plan permits awards to be made to our Trustees and officers, employees of our manager, consultants, advisors or other persons or entities providing management, administrative or other services to us or to our subsidiaries. Actual participants are determined by the Board or a committee thereof in its discretion. 
 Change in Control.    The form of share award agreement for awards made to the Company's named executive officers provides for acceleration of vesting of all share awards upon the occurrence of certain change in control or termination events. If shareholders approve extending the term of the Share Award Plan to June 11, 2022, the Share Award Plan will also provide that if the Company is subject to a "Change in Control," or a "Termination Event" unvested awards will vest upon the occurrence of the Change in Control or Termination Event. For purposes of the Share Award Plan, a Change in Control will generally be defined as occurring only upon (1) the acquisition by a third party of 50% or more of the Company's shares or voting power, (2) an unapproved change in a majority of the members of the Board, (3) the consummation of a merger or similar transaction involving the Company in which our shares do not represent more than 50% of the shares of the resulting entity or (4) a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets to an unaffiliated third party or the liquidation of the Company. For purposes of the Share Award Plan, a Termination Event will occur if RMR LLC (or any entity controlled by, under common control with or controlling RMR LLC) ceases to be the manager or shared services provider to the Company. 
 Amendment and Termination.    The Share Award Plan may be amended or terminated by our Board, subject to shareholder approval where required by law or applicable listing requirements. The Share Award Plan will, unless terminated earlier by the Board, terminate on June 11, 2022. However, awards made before the termination of the Share Award Plan may extend beyond that date in accordance with their terms. 
 Common Shares Available.    The total number of Common Shares that may be granted under the Share Award Plan is 500,000, subject to adjustment for certain transactions as set forth in the plan. If any Common Shares subject to an award are forfeited, the shares with respect to such award will, to the extent of any such forfeiture, again be available for awards under the plan. The number of Common Shares reserved for issuance under the Share Award Plan and the awards made under the plan are generally subject to adjustment by the Board upon the occurrence of a merger, sale of assets, reorganization, recapitalization, exchange of shares, stock split, combination of shares or dividend payable in shares or other securities or any similar corporate transaction.

On March 27, 2019, the last reported sale price of the Common Shares on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") was $27.78 per share. 
Persons eligible to receive awards of shares under the Share Award Plan will be those key persons selected by the Board or committee in its discretion from among our Trustees and officers, employees of our manager, consultants, advisors or other persons or entities providing management, administrative or other services to us or to our subsidiaries. As of March 27, 2019, the Company had two executive officers and eight Trustees (one of whom is also an executive officer of the Company) and RMR LLC and its subsidiaries had approximately 600 employees who were not either executive officers or Trustees of the Company; all of those persons and other qualifying service providers of the Company would be eligible for awards under the Share Award Plan. During 2018, 70 eligible Trustees, executive officers and RMR LLC employees (and those of its subsidiaries) received awards under the Share Award Plan. 
Awards under the Share Award Plan will generally be made in the discretion of the Board or designated committee and are therefore not determinable at this time. Please refer to the  2018 Grants of Plan Based Awards in this Proxy Statement to review equity awards made to our named executive officers in 2018. 
 Other Vesting Events.    Awards currently outstanding under the Share Award Plan provide for full vesting of outstanding awards upon the death of the holder. 
 Share Award Plan Benefits.    The future benefits or amounts that would be received under the Share Award Plan are discretionary and are therefore not determinable at this time.

     Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences in Respect of the Share Award Plan   
[END TABLE]
The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences with respect to awards under the Share Award Plan. Participants should consult with their own tax advisors and should not rely upon this summary. 
 Share Awards.    A participant in the Share Award Plan receiving an unrestricted Common Share award (or the unrestricted portion of a Restricted Share award) will be taxed as ordinary compensation income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Common Shares at the time of the award. 
 Restricted Shares.    The term "restricted shares" refers to an award of Common Shares under the Share Award Plan that are subject to forfeiture restrictions. A participant generally will not be taxed upon the receipt of a Restricted Share award, but rather will recognize ordinary compensation income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Common Shares at the time the Common Shares are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. A participant may, however, elect under Internal Revenue Code Section 83(b) and not later than 30 days after the transfer of such Common Shares to the participant to recognize ordinary compensation income at the time the Restricted Shares are awarded in an amount equal to the fair market value at that time, notwithstanding the fact that such Common Shares are subject to restrictions and a substantial risk of forfeiture. If such an election is made, no additional income will be recognized by such participant at the time the restrictions lapse. However, if Common Shares subject to a Section 83(b) election are later forfeited, no tax deduction is allowable with respect to the previously recognized ordinary compensation income to the participant for the forfeited Common Shares. 
The full amount of dividends or other distributions of property made with respect to Restricted Shares before the lapse of any applicable restrictions will constitute ordinary compensation income, unless a Section 83(b) election has been made. 
The Company, as the recipient of the services rendered by the participant, will be entitled to a deduction at the same time as and in the same amount that the participant recognizes ordinary compensation income. If the participant makes a Section 83(b) election and later forfeits the Common Shares, the

Company will be deemed to recognize ordinary income equal to the amount of the deduction previously allowed. 
 Company Deductions.    The Company deductions referred to in this summary may be limited by Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) for certain employees.

The Board believes that shareholder approval of the proposed amendment to the Share Award Plan will continue to enable the Company to encourage its Trustees, officers and other individuals (whether or not employees) who render services to the Company or a subsidiary to continue their association with the Company by providing opportunities for them to participate in the ownership and future growth of the Company through the award of Common Shares, including Restricted Shares. If the amendment to the Share Award Plan is not approved by shareholders, the Compensation Committee may continue to make awards under the Share Award Plan in its current form until the earlier of such time as there are no longer any Common Shares that may be subject to awards or June 11, 2019, unless the Share Award Plan is earlier terminated by the Board. 
Assuming a quorum is present at the meeting, approval of the proposed amendment to the Share Award Plan requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
   The Board of Trustees recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the amendment to the Office Properties Income Trust 2009 Incentive Share Award Plan.

      REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE     
In the course of the Audit Committee's oversight of the Company's financial reporting process, the Audit Committee has: (i) reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018; (ii) discussed with Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent auditors, the matters required to be discussed under PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301; (iii) received the written disclosures and the letter from the auditors required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditors' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence; (iv) discussed with the independent auditors their independence; and (v) considered whether the provision of non-audit services by the independent auditors is compatible with maintaining their independence and concluded that it is compatible at this time. 
Based on the foregoing review and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS     
   Proxy Materials and Voting Information       
 1.  What is included in the proxy materials? What is a proxy statement and what is a proxy?  
The proxy materials for the 2019 Annual Meeting include the Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials, Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report (collectively, the "proxy materials"). If you request a paper copy of these materials, the proxy materials will also include a proxy card or voting instruction form. 
A proxy statement is a document that the SEC regulations require the Company to give you when it asks you to return a proxy designating individuals to vote on your behalf. A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote the shares you own. That other person is called your proxy. We are asking you to designate the following three persons as your proxies for the 2019 Annual Meeting: Jennifer B. Clark, Secretary; David M. Blackman, Managing Trustee, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Adam D. Portnoy, Managing Trustee. 
 2.  What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner?  
If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's registrar and transfer agent, Equiniti Shareowner Services, you are considered a shareholder of record of those shares. If you are a shareholder of record, you should receive only one notice or proxy card for all the Common Shares you hold in certificate form and in book entry form. 
If your shares are held in an account you own at a bank or brokerage or you hold shares through another nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares. If you are a beneficial owner, you will receive voting instruction information from the bank, broker or other nominee through which you own your Common Shares. 
If you hold some shares of record and some shares beneficially, you should receive a notice or proxy card for all the Common Shares you hold of record and a separate voting instruction form for the shares from the bank, broker or other nominee through which you own Common Shares. 
 3.  What different methods can I use to vote?  
 By Written Proxy.    All shareholders of record can submit voting instructions by written proxy card. If you are a shareholder of record and receive a Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials, you may request a written proxy card by following the instructions included in the notice. If you are a beneficial owner, you may request a written proxy card or a voting instruction form from your bank, broker or other nominee. Proxies submitted by mail must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on May 15, 2019 or, if the meeting is postponed or adjourned to a later date, by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the day immediately preceding the date of the reconvened meeting. 
 By Telephone or Internet.    All shareholders of record also can authorize a proxy to vote their shares by touchtone telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903, or through the internet at www.proxyvote.com, using the procedures and instructions described in your Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card. Beneficial owners may authorize a proxy by telephone or internet if their bank, broker or other 
    2019 Proxy Statement    43
Table of Contents nominee makes those methods available, in which case the bank, broker or nominee will include the instructions with the proxy voting materials. To authorize a proxy by telephone or internet, you will need the 16 digit control number provided on your Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials, proxy card or voting instruction form. The telephone and internet proxy authorization procedures are designed to authenticate shareholder identities, to allow shareholders to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been recorded properly. Proxies submitted by telephone or through the internet must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on May 15, 2019 or, if the meeting is postponed or adjourned to a later date, by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the day immediately preceding the date of the reconvened meeting. 
 In Person.    All shareholders of record may vote in person at the meeting. Beneficial owners may vote in person at the meeting if they have a legal proxy, as described in the response to question 12. 
If you have any questions or need assistance in voting your shares or authorizing your proxy, please call the firm assisting the Company in the solicitation of proxies:

 4.  Who may vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting?  
Holders of record of Common Shares as of the close of business on February 28, 2019, the record date, may vote at the meeting. Holders of Common Shares are entitled to one vote for each Common Share held on the record date. 
 5.  What if I authorize a proxy and do not specify how my shares are to be voted?  
If you submit a signed proxy card or authorize a proxy by internet or telephone, but do not indicate how your Common Shares should be voted on one or more proposals, then the proxies will vote your shares as the Board of Trustees recommends on those proposals. Other than the proposals listed on pages 13, 25, 35 and 38, we do not know of any other matters to be presented at the meeting. If any other matters are properly presented at the meeting, the proxies may vote your shares in accordance with their best judgment. 
 6.  What is a quorum? How are abstentions and broker non-votes counted?  
A quorum of shareholders is required for shareholders to take action at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of shareholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the 2019 Annual Meeting constitutes a quorum. 
Abstentions and broker non-votes are included in determining whether a quorum is present. Abstentions are not votes cast and, therefore, will not be included in vote totals and will have no effect on the outcome of any Proposal to be voted on at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes are not votes cast and, therefore, will not be included in vote totals and will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 1, 2 or 4. There can be no broker non-votes on Proposal 3 as it is a matter on which, if you hold your shares in street name and do not provide voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares, the nominee has discretionary authority to vote on your behalf. 
44         2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
With respect to Proposal 1, a proxy marked "WITHHOLD" will have the same effect as an abstention and will not be counted for purposes of determining a plurality of votes cast, but will be counted as a vote "AGAINST" for purposes of determining a majority of votes cast under the Company's Trustee resignation policy. Pursuant to the Company's Governance Guidelines, if a Trustee nominee fails to receive a majority of votes cast, he or she will offer to resign from the Board, and the Board will decide whether to accept or reject the resignation offer. 
 7.  What if I change my mind after I authorize a proxy to vote my shares?  
Shareholders have the right to revoke a proxy at any time before it is voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting, subject to the proxy voting deadlines described above. Shareholders may revoke a proxy by authorizing a proxy again on a later date by internet or by telephone (only the last internet or telephone proxy submitted prior to the meeting will be counted) or by signing and returning a later dated proxy card or by attending the meeting and voting in person. If you are a beneficial owner, see the response to question 12. 
A shareholder's attendance at the 2019 Annual Meeting will not revoke that shareholder's proxy unless that shareholder votes again at the meeting or sends an original written statement to the Secretary of the Company revoking the prior proxy. An original written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be delivered to Office Properties Income Trust, Two Newton Place, 255 Washington Street, Suite 300, Newton, Massachusetts 02458, Attention: Secretary, or hand delivered to the Secretary before the taking of the vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Beneficial owners who wish to change their votes should contact the organization that holds their shares. 
 8.  Can I access the proxy materials on the internet? How can I sign up for the electronic proxy delivery service?  
The Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report are available at www.proxyvote.com. You may access these proxy materials on the internet through the conclusion of the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Instead of receiving future copies of the Company's proxy materials by mail, shareholders of record and most beneficial owners may elect to receive these materials electronically. Opting to receive your future proxy materials electronically will reduce the environmental impact of our annual meeting, save us the cost of printing and mailing documents, and also will give you an electronic link to our proxy voting site. Your Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials instructs you as to how you may request electronic delivery of future proxy materials. 
 9.  How are proxies solicited and what is the cost?  
The Company bears all expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation of proxies. The Company has engaged Morrow Sodali LLC ("Morrow Sodali") to assist with the solicitation of proxies for an estimated fee of $15,000 plus reimbursement of expenses. The Company has agreed to indemnify Morrow Sodali against certain liabilities arising out of the Company's agreement with Morrow Sodali. We will request banks, brokers and other nominees to forward proxy materials to the beneficial owners of Common Shares and to obtain their voting instructions. We will reimburse those firms for their expenses of forwarding proxy materials. 
    2019 Proxy Statement    45
Table of Contents
Proxies may also be solicited, without additional compensation, by the Company's Trustees and officers, and by RMR LLC, its officers and employees and its parent's and subsidiaries' directors, officers and employees, by mail, telephone or other electronic means or in person. 
 10.  What is householding?  
As permitted by the Exchange Act, we may deliver only one copy of the Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials, Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report to shareholders residing at the same address, unless the shareholders have notified us of their desire to receive multiple copies of those documents. This practice is known as "householding."

If you have questions regarding these admission procedures, please call Investor Relations at (617) 219-1410. 
12.  How can I vote in person at the meeting if I am a beneficial owner?  
If you are a beneficial owner and want to vote your shares at the 2019 Annual Meeting, you need a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee. You also need to follow the procedures described in the response to question 11 and to bring the legal proxy with you to the meeting and hand it in with a signed ballot that will be provided to you at the meeting. You will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting without a legal proxy. If you do not have a legal proxy, you can still attend the meeting by following the procedures described in the response to question 11. However, you will not be able to vote your shares at the meeting without a legal proxy. The Company encourages you to vote your shares in advance, even if you intend to attend the meeting.

       RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS     
The descriptions of agreements in this "Related Person Transactions" section do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and qualified in their entirety by, reference to the actual agreements, copies of certain of which are filed as exhibits to the Annual Report. 
A "related person transaction" is a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which (i) the Company was, is or will be a participant, (ii) the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and (iii) any related person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 
A "related person" means any person who is, or at any time since January 1, 2018 was:
The Company has adopted written Governance Guidelines that describe the consideration and approval of related person transactions. Under these Governance Guidelines, the Company may not enter a transaction in which any Trustee or executive officer, any member of the immediate family of any Trustee or executive officer or other related person, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest unless that transaction has been disclosed or made known to the Board and the Board reviews and approves or ratifies the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested Trustees, even if the disinterested Trustees constitute less than a quorum. If there are no disinterested Trustees, the transaction must be reviewed, authorized and approved or ratified by both (i) the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board and (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Trustees. In determining whether to approve or ratify a transaction, the Board, or disinterested Trustees or Independent Trustees, as the case may be, also act in accordance with any applicable provisions of the Company's Declaration of Trust and Bylaws and consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances and approve only those transactions that they determine are fair and reasonable to the Company. All related person transactions described below were reviewed and approved or ratified by a majority of the disinterested Trustees or otherwise in accordance with the Company's policies, Declaration of Trust and Bylaws, each as described above. In the case of transactions with the Company by employees of RMR Inc. and its subsidiaries who are subject to the Code but who are not Trustees or executive officers of the Company, the employee must seek approval from an executive officer who has no interest in the matter for which approval is being requested. Copies of the Company's Governance Guidelines and the Code are available on the Company's website, www.opireit.com.

David Blackman, the Company's other Managing Trustee and the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, and each of the Company's other officers is also an officer and employee of RMR LLC, including Jeffrey Leer, who succeeded Mark L. Kleifges as the Company's Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer effective January 1, 2019. Mark Kleifges resigned from his positions as the Company's Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of the Company and as a Managing Trustee effective December 31, 2018. 
The Company's Independent Trustees also serve as independent trustees or independent directors of other public companies to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services. Adam Portnoy serves, and, until his death, Barry Portnoy served, as a managing director or managing trustee of these companies and other officers of RMR LLC serve as managing trustees or managing directors of certain of these companies. In addition, officers of RMR LLC and RMR Inc. serve as the Company's officers and officers of other companies to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services. 
RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services to four other Nasdaq listed REITs: HPT, which owns hotels and travel centers; ILPT, which owns industrial and logistics properties; SNH, which primarily owns healthcare, senior living and medical office buildings; and TRMT, which primarily originates and invests in first mortgage loans secured by middle market and transitional commercial real estate. RMR LLC also provides services to other publicly and privately owned companies, including: FVE, which is listed on the Nasdaq and operates senior living communities; TA, which is listed on the Nasdaq and operates and franchises travel centers and restaurants; and Sonesta International Hotels Corporation ("Sonesta"), which operates, manages and franchises hotels, resorts and cruise ships. A subsidiary of RMR LLC is an investment adviser to RIF, a closed end investment company listed on the NYSE American, which invests in securities of real estate companies that are not managed by RMR LLC. 
The Company has no employees. The personnel and various services the Company requires to operate the Company's business are provided to the Company by RMR LLC. The Company has two agreements with RMR LLC to provide management services to the Company: (i) a business management agreement, which relates to the Company's business generally, and (ii) a property management agreement, which relates to the Company's property level operations. Both of these management agreements are described below, see "—Management Agreements with RMR LLC." 
 Ownership Interest in RMR Inc. and Registration and Lock-up Agreements. The Company currently holds 2,801,061 shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc., which the Company and SIR acquired in June 2015 in a transaction pursuant to which, among other things, the Company, SIR and two other REITs then managed by RMR LLC acquired class A common stock of RMR Inc. and entered into amended and restated business and property management agreements with RMR LLC. The Company is party to a registration rights agreement with RMR Inc. covering the shares of class A common stock of RMR Inc. issued to the Company in this transaction, pursuant to which the Company has demand and piggyback registration rights, subject to certain limitations. 
The Company is also party to a lock up and registration rights agreement with ABP Trust, Adam Portnoy and Barry Portnoy pursuant to which they (on behalf of themselves and their permitted transferees) agreed not to transfer the 175,000 Common Shares (after giving effect to the Reverse Share Split) that ABP Trust received in this transaction for a 10 year period ending on June 5, 2025 and they have certain demand and piggyback registration rights, subject, in each case, to certain exceptions. 
Prior to the SIR Merger, SIR was party to similar registration rights and lock-up agreements with RMR LLC that the Company assumed in the SIR Merger.

 Management Agreements with RMR LLC. The Company's management agreements with RMR LLC provide for an annual base management fee, an annual incentive management fee and property management and construction supervision fees, payable in cash, among other terms:
The average aggregate historical cost of the Company's real estate investments includes the Company's consolidated assets invested, directly or indirectly, in equity interests in or loans secured by real estate and personal property owned in connection with such real estate (including acquisition related costs and costs which may be allocated to intangibles or are unallocated), all before reserves for depreciation, amortization, impairment charges or bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves; provided, however, the Company's ownership of SIR common shares was not included as part of the Company's real estate investments for purposes of calculating the Company's base management fee due to RMR LLC since SIR paid separate business management fees to RMR LLC. 
For purposes of the total return per share of the holders of Common Shares, share price appreciation for a measurement period is determined by subtracting (1) the closing price of the Common Shares on the Nasdaq on the last trading day of the year immediately before the first year of the applicable measurement period, or the initial share price, from (2) the average closing price of the Common Shares on the 10 consecutive trading days having the highest average closing prices during the final 30 trading days in the last year of the measurement period.

    2019 Proxy Statement    51
Table of Contents with RMR LLC, SIR incurred an incentive management fee of approximately $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, payable in January 2019. In addition, SIR had incurred, in the ordinary course, but not paid, aggregate business management, property management and construction supervision fees of approximately $2.2 million at December 31, 2018. As successor to SIR as a result of the SIR Merger, the Company assumed the obligations to pay SIR's 2018 incentive management fee and the business management, property management and construction supervision fees it had accrued, but not paid, as of December 31, 2018. The Company paid these fees to RMR LLC in January 2019. In calculating the incentive management fee payable by SIR for the year ended December 31, 2018, SIR's total shareholder return per share and benchmark return per share were adjusted in accordance with its business management agreement to reflect aggregate net increases in the number of SIR common shares outstanding as a result of certain share issuances and repurchases by SIR during the three year measurement period ended December 31, 2018, and compared to the SNL U.S. REIT Equity Index. Upon consummation of the SIR Merger, SIR's separate business and property management agreements with RMR LLC were terminated for convenience and RMR LLC waived its right to receive payment of the termination fees due on account of that termination.

Table of Contents fee calculated as described above, but assuming a 10 year term was remaining prior to the termination. The Company is not required to pay any termination fee if the Company terminates the Company's management agreements with RMR LLC for cause or as a result of a change of control of RMR LLC. 
 Share Awards to RMR LLC Employees. The Company awards Common Shares to the Company's officers and other employees of RMR LLC annually. Generally, one fifth of these awards vests on the date of the awards and one fifth vests on each of the next four anniversaries of the dates of the awards. During 2018, the Company awarded to the Company's officers and other employees of RMR LLC annual awards of 14,675 Common Shares (after giving effect to the Reverse Share Split), valued at approximately $1.0 million, in aggregate, based upon the closing price of the Common Shares on the Nasdaq on the date the awards were made under the Company's equity compensation plan. These share awards to RMR LLC employees are in addition to the share awards made to the Company's current and former Managing Trustees, as Trustee compensation, and the fees the Company paid to RMR LLC. During 2018, the Company purchased 4,984 Common Shares (after giving effect to the Reverse Share Split), at the closing price of the Common Shares on the Nasdaq on the date of purchase, from certain of the Company's trustees and officers and other employees of RMR LLC in satisfaction of tax withholding and payment obligations in connection with the vesting of awards of the Common Shares. 
On occasion, the Company has entered into arrangements with former employees of RMR LLC in connection with the termination of their employment with RMR LLC, providing for the acceleration of vesting of Common Share awards previously awarded to them under the Company's equity compensation plans. The aggregate value of the Common Share awards the Company so accelerated, measured as of the effective dates of acceleration, was approximately $0.02 million, in aggregate, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, each of the Company's executive officers during 2018 received share awards of RMR Inc. and other companies to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services in their capacities as officers or employees of RMR LLC. 
Prior to the SIR Merger, SIR historically made share awards to certain RMR LLC employees under its equity compensation plan and during 2018, SIR awarded to its officers and other employees of RMR LLC annual share awards of 58,700 of its common shares, valued at approximately $1.2 million in aggregate. During this period, SIR repurchased 13,063 common shares awarded to certain of its officers and employees of RMR LLC in satisfaction of tax withholding and payment obligations in connection with the vesting of awards of its common shares. During the year ended December 31, 2018, SIR accelerated the vesting of its common shares previously awarded to certain of its officers and employees of RMR LLC in 
    2019 Proxy Statement    53
Table of Contents connection with their termination of employment from RMR LLC. The aggregate value of the Common Share awards the Company so accelerated, measured as of the effective dates of acceleration, was approximately $0.04 million, in aggregate, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, each of SIR's executive officers during 2018 received share awards of RMR Inc. and other companies to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services in their capacities as officers or employees of RMR LLC. 
 Leases with RMR LLC. The Company leases office space to RMR LLC in certain of the Company's properties for RMR LLC's property management offices. Pursuant to the Company's lease agreements with RMR LLC, the Company recognized rental income from RMR LLC for leased office space of approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company's office space leases with RMR LLC are terminable by RMR LLC if the Company's management agreements with RMR LLC are terminated. 
 Other. The Company has in the past held, and likely will in the future hold, business meetings at hotels operated by Sonesta, which is majority owned by one of the Company's Managing Trustees, Adam Portnoy, and the remainder was owned by Barry Portnoy until his death and which manages certain hotels owned by HPT, and the Company's Trustees and officers have in the past stayed, and are likely in the future to stay, overnight at hotels operated by Sonesta when traveling for Company business. The Company pays Sonesta for the use of meeting space and related services and pays Sonesta or reimburses the Company's Trustees and officers for the costs of these hotel stays. 
 Relationship with SIR. Until October 9, 2018 (as further described below), the Company owned 24,918,421 SIR common shares, or approximately 27.8% of its then outstanding common shares. During 2018, the Company's Managing Trustees also served as managing trustees of SIR, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer also served as SIR's president and chief executive officer and Jeffrey Leer, the Company's Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, served as SIR's chief financial officer and treasurer. During 2018, each of SIR's officers was also an officer and employee of RMR LLC. RMR LLC provides management services to the Company and provided management services to SIR until it ceased to exist. 
 SIR Merger. On September 14, 2018, the Company and the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, GOV MS REIT, a Maryland real estate investment trust ("Merger Sub"), and SIR entered an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "SIR Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which SIR merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity in the merger. 
The SIR Merger was consummated and became effective at 4:01 p.m., Eastern time, on December 31, 2018. Pursuant to the terms set forth in the SIR Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the SIR Merger, the Company issued to SIR's shareholders 1.04 Common Shares, for each common share of SIR issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the SIR Merger (other than SIR common shares held by the Company or any of the Company's or SIR's wholly owned subsidiaries), with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares and any outstanding unvested SIR common share awards under SIR's equity compensation plan were converted into awards under the Share Award Plan, subject to substantially similar vesting requirements and other terms and conditions, of a number of the Common Shares determined by multiplying the number of unvested SIR common shares subject to such award by 1.04 (rounded down to the nearest whole number). Later on December 31, 2018, Merger Sub merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving entity and the Company changed the Company's name to "Office Properties Income Trust." 
As a condition of the SIR Merger, on October 9, 2018, the Company sold all of the 24,918,421 common shares of SIR the Company then owned (the "Secondary Sale"), in an underwritten public offering at a price of $18.25 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $435.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The Company used the net proceeds from the Secondary Sale to repay amounts outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility.

In addition, as a condition of the SIR Merger, on December 27, 2018, SIR paid a pro rata distribution to SIR's shareholders as of the close of business on December 20, 2018 of all 45,000,000 common shares of beneficial interest of ILPT that SIR owned. 
Upon consummation of the SIR Merger, the Company assumed all of the principal and interest on all of SIR's outstanding approximately $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.60% Senior Notes due 2020, approximately $300 million aggregate principal amount of 4.15% Senior Notes due 2022, approximately $350 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2024 and approximately $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% Senior Notes due 2025. 
 IPO Related Agreements with ILPT. On January 17, 2018, ILPT, then a wholly owned subsidiary of SIR, completed an initial public offering (the "ILPT IPO") and listing on the Nasdaq of 20,000,000 of its common shares. In connection with the ILPT IPO, SIR and ILPT entered a transaction agreement (the "Transaction Agreement") to govern SIR's relationship with ILPT. The Company is the successor to SIR under the Transaction Agreement. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement:
 Relationship with AIC. The Company, ABP Trust, ILPT and four other companies to which RMR LLC provides management services currently own AIC, an Indiana insurance company, in equal amounts and are parties to a shareholders agreement regarding AIC. 
All the Company's Trustees (other than David Blackman) and all the independent trustees and independent directors of the other AIC shareholders currently serve on the board of directors of AIC. On December 28, 2018, SIR and ILPT entered into a stock purchase agreement (the "AIC Stock Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which ILPT purchased all of SIR's shares of common stock of AIC, effective December 31, 2018, for approximately $8.6 million. RMR LLC provides management and administrative services to AIC pursuant to a management and administrative services agreement with AIC. Pursuant to this agreement, AIC pays RMR LLC a service fee equal to 3.0% of the total annual net earned premiums payable under then active policies issued or underwritten by AIC or by a vendor or an agent of AIC on its behalf or in furtherance of AIC's business. 
The Company and the other AIC shareholders participate in a combined property insurance program arranged and insured or reinsured in part by AIC. The Company paid aggregate annual premiums, including taxes and fees, of approximately $1.2 million in connection with this insurance program for the policy year ending June 30, 2019, which amount may be adjusted from time to time as the Company acquires or disposes of properties that are included in this insurance program. Properties that the Company acquired as a result of the SIR Merger were already previously included in this insurance program because SIR was a participant in the program. SIR paid an annual premium, including taxes and fees, of approximately $1.7 million in connection with this insurance program for the policy year ending June 30, 2019. 
 Directors' and Officers' Liability Insurance. The Company, RMR Inc. and certain other companies to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services participate in a combined directors' and

   OFFICE PROPERTIES INCOME TRUST        2009 INCENTIVE SHARE AWARD PLAN     
Office Properties Income Trust, formerly known as Government Properties Income Trust (the "Company"), hereby adopts the Office Properties Income Trust 2009 Incentive Share Award Plan (as amended from time to time, the "Plan"), effective as of June 11, 2009.  
The Plan is intended to advance the interests of the Company and its subsidiaries by providing a means of rewarding selected officers, employees and Trustees of the Company, employees of its manager and others rendering valuable services to the Company or its subsidiaries, through grants of the Company's Shares.  
Terms that are capitalized in the text of the Plan have the meanings set forth below: 
(a)   "Board" means the Board of Trustees of the Company. 
(b)   "Company" means Office Properties Income Trust, a Maryland real estate investment trust. 
(c)   "Exchange Act" means the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
(d)   "Key Person" means an employee, consultant, manager, Trustee, officer or other person providing services to the Company, to a subsidiary of the Company or to the Manager on behalf of the Company. 
(e)   "Manager" means the person or entity serving as manager to the Company. 
(f)    "Participant" means a person to whom Shares have been granted, or any other person who becomes owner of the Shares by reason of such person's death or incapacity.

    2019 Proxy Statement    A-1
Table of Contents
Grants of Shares to any person shall be made by action of the Board, and shall be made solely in accordance with the instructions of the Board as to the selection of persons to whom Shares are to be granted, the amount and timing of each such grant, and the extent, if any, to which vesting restrictions or other conditions shall apply to the granted Shares. If a person to whom such a grant of Shares has been made fails to execute and deliver to the Company a Share Agreement within ten (10) days after it is submitted to him or her, the grant of Shares related to such Share Agreement may be cancelled by the Company, acting by the Board, at its option without further notice to the Participant. Nothing in this Section IV shall prevent the Board from delegating its authority to make grants to a committee pursuant to Section V.  
The Plan shall be administered by the Board or, in the discretion of the Board, a committee designated by the Board and composed of at least two (2) members of the Board. All references in the Plan to the Board shall be understood to refer to such committee or the Board, whoever shall administer the Plan. As of the effective date of the Plan, the Board has delegated its authority to administer the Plan to the Compensation Committee of the Company pursuant to the written charter for such committee; however, the Board may revoke or rescind this delegation of authority in whole or in part at any time. All questions of interpretation and application of the Plan and of grants of Shares shall be determined by the Board or its designated committee in its sole discretion, and its determination shall be final and binding upon all persons, including the Company and all Participants. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board or the designated committee is authorized to adopt and approve from time to time the forms and, subject to the terms of the Plan, the terms and conditions of any Share Agreement. If it determines to do so, the Board or its designated committee may grant Shares under this Plan which are not subject to a Share Agreement. 
For so long as Section 16 of the Exchange Act is applicable to the Company, each member of any committee designated to administer the Plan shall be a "non-employee director" or the equivalent within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and, for so long as Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the "Code"), is applicable to the Company, an "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations thereunder. 
With respect to persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, grants under the Plan are intended to be exempt from the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 or its successor under the Exchange Act.  
The persons eligible to receive grants of Shares shall be those persons selected by the Board or designated committee from among Key Persons who contribute to the business of the Company and its subsidiaries.  
In the event that the outstanding Shares are hereafter changed for a different number or kind of Shares or other securities of the Company, or are otherwise affected by reason of a merger, sale of assets, reorganization, recapitalization, exchange of shares, stock split, combination of shares or dividend payable in shares or other securities or any similar corporate transaction, a corresponding adjustment shall be made in the number and kind of Shares or other securities covered by outstanding grants of Shares, and for which Shares may be granted under the Plan.  
Shares may be granted under the Plan from time to time until the close of business on June 11, 2022. Subject to any shareholder approval that may be required under applicable law or the rules of any stock 
A-2         2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents exchange on which the Shares are listed, the Board hereafter may at any time amend or extend the Plan, including amendments to change the number of shares subject to the Plan. The Plan may be terminated at any time by action of the Board without, however, affecting the rights of a Participant or the Company as to Shares granted prior to such termination.  
A.    Nonassignability of Shares.    Shares subject to a Share Agreement shall not be assignable or transferable by a Participant except in accordance with the terms of the applicable Share Agreement. 
B.    No Guarantee of Employment.    Neither the award of Shares nor a Share Agreement shall give any person the right to continue in the employment of, or to continue to act as an officer or Trustee of, or to serve in any other capacity with, the Company, any subsidiary or the Manager, or give the Company, any subsidiary or the Manager the right to require such person to continue in any such capacity. 
C.    Tax Withholding; Section 409A.    To the extent required by law, the Company shall withhold or cause to be withheld income and other taxes incurred by a Participant by reason of a grant of Shares, and, as a condition to the receipt of any grant of Shares, a Participant agrees that if the amount payable to him by the Company in the ordinary course is insufficient to pay such taxes, he shall, upon request of the Company, pay the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy its tax withholding obligations. 
Without limiting the foregoing, the Compensation Committee may in its discretion permit any Participant's withholding obligation to be paid in whole or in part in the form of Shares, by withholding from the Shares to be issued to such Participant or by accepting delivery of Shares already owned by him. The fair market value of the Shares for this purpose shall be the closing price of the Shares on the principal securities exchange on which the Shares are listed on the date such Shares are repurchased by the Company, unless otherwise determined by the Board in its discretion. 
If payment of withholding taxes is made in whole or in part in Shares, the Participant shall deliver to the Company share certificates registered in his name or other evidence of legal and beneficial ownership of Shares owned by him, fully vested and free of all liens, claims and encumbrances of every kind, duly endorsed or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed by the record holder of the Shares represented by such share certificates. If the Participant is subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, his ability to pay the withholding obligation in the form of Shares shall be subject to such additional restrictions as may be necessary to avoid any transaction that might give rise to liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. 
It is intended that awards granted under the Plan be exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code, and the Plan and such awards shall be construed in accordance with that intention. 
D.    Compliance with Law.    This Plan, the granting and vesting of Shares hereunder, and the other obligations of the Company under this Plan and any Share Agreement, shall be subject to all applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any regulatory or governmental agency as may be required. The Company, in its reasonable discretion, may postpone the issuance or delivery of Shares until completion of any required action under any state or federal law, rule or regulation as the Company may consider appropriate in order to comply with the applicable laws, and may require any Participant to make such representations and furnish such information as it may consider appropriate in connection with the issuance or delivery of Shares in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. No provisions of this Plan shall be interpreted or construed to obligate the Company to register any Shares under federal or state law. 
E.    Governing Law.    The validity, construction and effect of this Plan, any rules and regulations relating to this Plan and any Share Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws.

(c)   there is consummated a merger or consolidation of the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company with any other entity, other than (i) a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or any parent thereof) at least 50% of the combined voting power of the securities of the Company or such surviving entity or any parent thereof outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or (ii) a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no Person is or becomes the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company (not including in the securities Beneficially Owned by such Person any securities acquired directly from the Company or its Affiliates) representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or

In addition, for purposes of the Plan, a "Termination Event" shall occur if The RMR Group LLC (or any entity controlled by, under common control with or controlling The RMR Group LLC) ceases to be the manager or shared services provider to the Company.
