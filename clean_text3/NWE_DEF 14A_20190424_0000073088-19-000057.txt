  2018 Executive Pay Overview Alignment of Pay with Shareholder and Customer Interests Our executive pay program is designed to align the long-term interests of our executives, shareholders, and customers. About 78 percent of the compensation of our chief executive officer, or CEO, and about 59 percent of the compensation of our other named executive officers is at risk in the form of performance-based incentive awards. Our Board establishes the metrics and targets for these incentive awards, based upon advice from the Board's independent compensation consultant. The performance metrics did not change from the prior year. We also require our executives to retain meaningful ownership of our stock (from 2x to 6x their annual base salary). This structure encourages our executives to focus on short- and long-term performance and provides a reward to our executives, shareholders, and customers when we achieve our financial and operating objectives. Our CEO to median employee pay ratio for 2018 was 27:1.  
    Executive Pay Components at a Glance

    Base Salary Fixed, paid in cash Target middle of competitive range of peer group, with adjustments for trade area economics, turnover, tenure, and experience 22% 41% Executive officers received a 3 percent cost of living adjustment provided to all employees; two named executive officers received additional increases due to increased responsibilities     
    Annual Cash Incentive  Variable, paid in cash Based on net income, safety, reliability, and customer satisfaction metrics and individual performance 22% 19% Increased target opportunity for three executives to align with market median; no change to performance metrics; updated performance targets     
    Long-Term Incentive Program Awards Variable, paid in equity Based on earnings per share, return on average equity and relative total shareholder return performance over a three-year vesting period 43% 32% Increased target opportunity for one executive to align with market median; no change to performance metrics; updated performance targets     
    Executive Retention / Retirement Program Awards Variable, paid in equity Based on net income performance over a five-year vesting period; paid over five-year period following separation from service 13% 8% Increased target opportunity for CEO to align with market median

  Performance Against Incentive Targets In 2018, we managed our business through challenging regulatory outcomes, with significant increases in net income and gross margin, and achieved all-time high customer satisfaction and near all-time high safety performance, while providing shareholders a 22.7 percent return for the three‑year period ending December 31, 2018, which lagged our 2016 peer group average. As a result, we achieved above target performance for our 2018 annual incentive awards and near target performance for our long-term incentive awards.

  Shareholder Feedback on Executive Pay At our 2018 annual meeting, our 2017 named executive officer pay program was approved by 99 percent of the votes cast. In light of the overwhelming approval from our shareholders, we have not changed the overall structure of our named executive officer pay program for 2018. We continue to use the same executive pay components and operate within the parameters previously approved by our shareholders. 2018 Corporate Governance Overview Our Board has nominated eight individuals for re-election as director. Each of the nominees currently serves on our Board, and we list these individuals on the following page in Proposal No. 1—Election of Directors.   Last year, shareholders elected our eight director nominees by approximately 99 percent of the votes cast. Each of our Board members and nominees is independent, with the sole exception of our CEO. Our Board is led by an independent non-executive chair, and our three Board committees – Audit; Compensation; and Governance – are chaired by and composed entirely of independent directors. In addition, diversity is important to our Board, as reflected in the graphs below regarding our slate of nominees.  We made no material changes to our corporate governance practices in 2018. Our previous independent non-executive Board chair, Dr. E. Linn Draper, Jr., retired from our Board on April 25, 2018. Our Board elected Stephen P. Adik as Dr. Draper's successor as independent non-executive Board chair. Mr. Adik, the retired Vice Chair of NiSource, Inc., has served on our Board since 2004, including several years as chair of our Audit Committee.

  Unless you specifically withhold your authority to vote for the election of directors, the persons named in the accompanying proxy intend to vote "FOR" the election of each of the director nominees. All nominees have advised the Board that they are able and willing to serve as directors. If any nominee becomes unavailable for any reason (which is not anticipated), the shares represented by the proxies may be voted for such other person or persons as may be determined by the holders of the proxies (unless a proxy contains instructions to the contrary). In no event will the proxy be voted for more than eight nominees.  Our Board values the diversity of its members. When selecting this slate of nominees, our Board concluded these nominees will provide insight from a number of perspectives based on their diversity with respect to gender, age, ethnicity, skills and background, as well as location of residence. We believe these varied perspectives expand the Board's ability to provide relevant guidance to our business.   Our Board also concluded that these individuals bring extensive professional experience from both within and outside our industry. This diversity of experience provides our Board with a broad collective skill set which is advantageous to the Board's oversight of our company. While the industry-specific expertise possessed by certain of the nominees is essential, we also will benefit from the viewpoints of directors with expertise outside our industry. Thus, our Board recommends a vote "FOR" election of each of the nominees.   Vote Required  Directors will be elected by a favorable vote of a plurality of the shares of voting stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting. You may vote "FOR" all of the nominees or you may "WITHHOLD AUTHORITY" for one or more of the nominees. Withheld votes will not count as votes cast for the nominee, but will count for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. Shareholders do not have the right to cumulate their vote for directors. If your shares are held through a broker, bank, or other nominee and you do not vote your shares, your bank, broker, or other nominee may not vote your shares in this proposal, as it is considered a "non-routine" matter. Abstentions or broker non-votes as to the election of directors will not affect the election of the candidates receiving a plurality of votes; however, under our Majority Plus Resignation Vote Policy described on page 49 of this proxy statement, if a nominee for director receives more "WITHHOLD AUTHORITY" votes than "FOR" votes, such nominee shall immediately tender his or her resignation under the procedures in the policy.

        The Board values your input on the committee's appointment of Deloitte, but approval by shareholders is not required by law.

Regardless of the voting result, the committee may appoint a new firm at any time if the committee believes a change would be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.   Description of Fees   The table below presents a summary of the fees Deloitte billed us for professional services for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018.

      Total fees 1,467,305     1,510,235       
    As reflected in the table: Audit fees are fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our financial statements, internal control over financial reporting, review of the interim financial statements included in quarterly reports, services in connection with debt and equity securities offerings, and services that are normally provided by Deloitte in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. For 2018, this amount includes estimated billings for the completion of the 2018 audit, which Deloitte rendered after year-end. Audit-related fees are fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our consolidated financial statements and are not reported under "Audit Fees." There were no audit-related fees in fiscal 2017 and 2018.  Tax fees are fees billed for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. All other fees are fees for products and services other than the services reported above. In fiscal years 2017 and 2018, there were no other fees. Pre-approval Policies and Procedures   Rules adopted by the SEC in order to implement requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require public company audit committees to pre-approve audit and non-audit services. Our Audit Committee follows procedures pursuant to which audit, audit-related, and tax services and all permissible non-audit services, are pre-approved by category of service. The fees are budgeted, and actual fees versus the budget are monitored

  Proposal No. 3 Advisory Vote to Approve  Named Executive Officer Compensation   
  We would like your input as to how we pay our named executive officers, as required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, through an advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation (or a say-on-pay vote). Your vote will provide insight and guidance to us and our Board regarding your sentiment about our executive pay philosophy, policies and practices, as described in this proxy statement. Our Board will consider the guidance received by the say-on-pay vote when determining executive pay for the remainder of 2019 and beyond. We ask you to support our executive pay and vote in favor of the say-on-pay resolution.   Last year, through the say-on-pay vote, over 99 percent of the votes cast approved how we pay our named executive officers. In fact, since our first say-on-pay vote in 2011, at least 94 percent of the votes cast have approved our executive pay each year.

        We view your voting guidance over the years as strong support for the way we pay our executives. Thus, in 2018, we left intact the executive pay program you previously approved and continued to use four components: base salary, annual cash incentive awards, long-term incentive awards, and retention/retirement awards. We did not change the design of these components. In fact, the only changes for 2018 from the 2017 program you approved, were (1) three percent base salary increases (the same increase available to all employees) and (2) certain other adjustments for certain executive officers to align with the market median.  If you would like additional information about what we do with our executive pay program, we have provided a more detailed discussion in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, or CD&A, starting on page 9 of this proxy statement, and the 2018 Executive Pay section, starting on page 31.  Our Human Resources Committee, or Compensation Committee, and our Board believe the company's overall executive pay program is structured to reflect a strong pay-for-performance philosophy and aligns the long-term interests of our executives and our shareholders. Accordingly, the Board recommends that shareholders approve our executive pay program by voting "FOR" the following advisory resolution:   RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the company's named executive officers (as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the compensation discussion and analysis, the compensation tables and any related material disclosed in the company's 2019 proxy statement) is hereby APPROVED.   
  The Board of Directors recommends you vote  "FOR"  the resolution approving  named  executive  officer compensation.     
    This advisory vote to approve named executive officer pay is not binding on the company. However, we and our Board will take into account the result of the vote when determining future executive pay arrangements. At last year's annual meeting of shareholders, more than a majority of our shareholders voted in favor of an annual advisory vote on executive compensation. Consistent with those voting results, the Board has determined that we will hold an annual advisory vote on executive compensation until the next required vote on the frequency of future shareholder votes on executive compensation, as required pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the related rules and regulations. Under current rules and regulations, we will hold the next frequency vote in connection with our 2023 annual meeting of shareholders. Vote Required The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting power of the shares of our common stock which are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the say-on-pay resolution set forth above. If your shares are held through a broker, bank, or other nominee and you do not vote your shares, your bank, broker, or other nominee may not vote your shares in this proposal, as it is considered a "non-routine" matter. Assuming a quorum is present, broker non-votes or the failure to vote – either by not returning a properly executed proxy card or not voting in person at the annual meeting – will have no effect on the outcome of the voting on this proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. Unless instructed to the contrary in the proxy, the shares represented by the proxies will be voted "FOR" the proposal to approve, on an advisory basis, the pay of the company's named executive officers, as set forth in the company's 2019 proxy statement.

CD&A Executive Summary
2018 Results
In 2018, we faced a number of challenges that required us to efficiently manage our business to achieve operational success and earnings in line with expectations. We worked safely in 2018 (nearly as safe as our all-time best safety year of 2016) and achieved our highest ever customer satisfaction ratings, while providing customers with reliable service. We also produced earnings in line with our announced expectations and net income ahead of our target. However, primarily as a result of 2018's regulatory headwinds, our shareholder return lagged our 2018 peer group.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2018 Basic Earnings Per Share Our basic EPS increased 17.6 percent to $3.94 in 2018 from $3.35 in 2017.      Total Shareholder Return Our TSR was 22 percent for the three-year period ending December 31, 2018, ranking last of our 2018 peer group (54.2 percent average).      Dividend Yield Our dividend of $2.20 per share provided a dividend yield of 3.7 percent based on our stock price at the end of 2018.

  Safety In 2018, we worked safely, with lost time and total recordable incident rates near all-time lows.      Reliability The reliability of our electric and natural gas systems was at or slightly better than target.      Customer Service For the third year in a row, our JD Power results showed customer satisfaction at our highest level ever.   Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[END TABLE]
We achieved these strong operating results during 2018, while also: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Initiating a Montana electric rate case. In 2018, we filed our first electric rate case in the state of Montana in almost ten years. With an anticipated conclusion in 2019, we requested an annual increase to electric rates of $34.9 million, based on a return on equity of 10.65% and an overall rate of return of 7.42%;  
● Implementing a new Montana electric supply tracker. In 2018, our Montana regulators approved an electric Power Cost and Credit Adjustment Mechanism (PCCAM) to share with customers a portion of the business risk or benefit associated with the cost of power purchased and fuel used to generate electricity; and 
● Completing regulatory tax settlements in all jurisdictions. In 2018, we reached settlements with each of our state regulators to ensure that our customers received the appropriate benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

The overall pay our executives receive ranks near the bottom of our 2018 peer group, which is identified on page 15 of this proxy statement. In summary, for 2017 (the most recent year for which peer group executive compensation is publicly available in the Summary Compensation Table for each respective company, excluding changes in pension value):
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Our named executive officers had an average compensation per named executive officer that was less than all but four of the other 12 companies in our 2018 peer group ($1.2 million for us versus $1.5 million for the peer median).● Our CEO's total compensation was approximately 89 percent of the median total compensation (excluding change in pension value) of the CEOs in our 2018 peer group.

Our overarching philosophy is that we should structure executive pay to be consistent with our peers and to align the long-term interests of our executives, shareholders, and customers so that the pay appropriately reflects performance in achieving financial and non-financial operating objectives. To live up to this philosophy, we believe that a significant portion of an executive's pay should be at risk in the form of performance-based incentive awards that are only paid if the individual and company performance targets are met.
Our executive pay program is designed to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Attract and retain a high-quality executive team by providing competitive pay and benefits that reflect our financial operational size; 
● Reward executives for both individual and company performance (based on financial, reliability, customer care, and safety metrics) through performance-based, at-risk pay; and 
● Maximize long-term shareholder value by emphasizing financial performance, reliability, safety, and customer satisfaction.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Our Pay Practices   
  Our executive pay program accomplishes our goals by incorporating certain pay practices while avoiding other, more problematic or controversial practices.   
  What We Do   
● Place a significant portion of executive pay at risk by granting incentive awards that are paid, if earned, based on continuing annual and long-term individual and company performance.   
● Utilize multiple performance metrics for long-term incentive awards that align executive and shareholder interests.   
● Target executive pay around the median of our peers, while also considering trade area economics, turn-over, tenure, experience, and other factors.   
  What We Don't Do   
● Use employment or golden parachute agreements.   
● Provide change in control payments exceeding three times base salary and target bonus. Our only change in control provision appears in our Equity Compensation Plan and provides for the immediate vesting or cash payment of any unvested equity awards upon a change in control.   
● Grant stock options. No stock options are currently outstanding, and none have been issued under our Equity Compensation Plan.   
● Allow option repricing or liberal share recycling. These practices are expressly prohibited under our Equity Compensation Plan.   
● Promise multi-year guarantees for salary increases.   
● Provide perquisites for executives that differ materially from those available to employees generally.   
● Maintain a non-performance-based top hat plan or separate retirement plan available only to our executive officers. We do maintain a performance-based executive retirement / retention program, with five-year cliff vesting and a five-year payout period after the recipient's separation from service.   
● Pay tax gross-ups to our executives.   
● Pay dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested performance shares or units.   
● Allow our executives or directors to hedge company securities.   
[END TABLE]
Pay Package
For 2018, our executive pay package included the same components as in 2017 — base salary, annual cash incentive award, and two long-term stock incentive awards. All incentive awards (cash and stock; annual and long-term) were performance-based. Unlike many of our peers, we do not offer a non-performance-based supplemental executive retirement plan.
The table on the following page provides a high level summary of our 2018 executive pay package. Please see the Pay Components section later in this CD&A for a more detailed summary of how we pay our executives.

Pay for Performance 
Our Compensation Committee has designed our pay program to align pay with performance. Our executives are rewarded for providing value to shareholders and for performing relative to our 2018 peer group, which is identified on page 15 of this proxy statement.
Value Provided to Shareholders
Over the past three years, we have provided value to our shareholders, with total shareholder return, or TSR, (including reinvestment of dividends) of 22.7 percent (as calculated as required by our LTIP), average EPS growth of 7.5 percent, and return on average equity of 10 percent.
These results we achieved for our shareholders are consistent with the results obtained under our incentive plans. With respect to our annual cash incentive plan for 2018, our net income achieved 150 percent of target and our customer satisfaction results were at an all-time high, while our safety performance was near our all-time high. These operational successes resulted in a funding of our annual cash incentive plan at 136 percent of target for 2018. 
The grants of long-term performance units that were made in 2016 pursuant to the LTIP vested on December 31, 2018. The performance measures associated with those grants were measured over a three-year vesting period and were tied to EPS growth, ROAE, and TSR. The company had solid results over the three-year vesting period with respect to the LTIP metrics, attaining 7.5 percent average EPS growth, 10 percent ROAE, and 22.7 percent TSR (12th highest of our 14-member 2016 peer group when calculated as required by the LTIP). Based on these results, the LTIP awards paid out at 94.3 percent of target.
[BEGIN TABLE] Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[END TABLE]
The chart below shows the total return on an investment made over that same three-year vesting period and highlights our stock price performance with the S&P 500 and our 2018 peer group. The chart below shows our TSR of 22 percent, assuming reinvestment of dividends. However, the calculation required by the 2016 LTIP results in a TSR of 22.7 percent for the same period. The difference in these TSRs is (1) the method of calculation required by the terms of our LTIP award agreement, which uses a 20-day average stock price at the beginning and end of the performance period and does not assume reinvestment of dividends, and (2) slightly different peer groups based on our 2018 peer group reflected in the chart below, and the 2016 peer group we used for the 2016 LTIP grants.

THREE-YEAR TSR

The charts below provide another depiction of pay for performance and the value we provide to shareholders by illustrating the directional relationship between the compensation of our CEO and company performance over a five-year period based on the three performance metrics utilized in our LTIP performance units.

5-YEAR CEO PAY ALIGNMENT 
 VS. EPS VS. ROAE VS. CUMULATIVE TSR 
EPS reflects diluted earnings per average share of our common stock. TSR illustrates the growth of $100 invested in our common stock on December 31, 2013, assuming reinvestment of dividends. CEO Compensation is total compensation (excluding change in pension value) as published in the proxy statement Summary Compensation Table. 
[END TABLE]
Performance Relative to Our Peers
Relative to our 2018 peers, our CEO pay is generally aligned with performance. For the three-year period ending December 31, 2018, our 22 percent TSR was the lowest in our 2018 peer group (according to S&P Global Market Intelligence and assuming reinvestment of dividends), while our CEO's compensation was the tenth highest of our 2018 peer group (based on the three most recently available years of compensation data as disclosed in the proxy statement summary compensation tables of our peers). In addition, the aggregate compensation provided to our 
[BEGIN TABLE] Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[END TABLE]
named executive officers and the pay multiple of our CEO to the second highest paid named executive officer both lag the median of our 2018 peer group.
We also provide value to shareholders by maintaining a relatively small executive team, which reduces overall executive compensation. We currently have eight members on our executive team. As of February 25, 2019, five of our 2018 peers have larger executive teams with nine or more members, two peers have eight executives, and five peers have seven or fewer. We believe that having a relatively small executive team creates efficiencies and a stronger team that is more effective as a group. 
The pay-for-performance charts and tables below reflect relative values for CEO pay and TSR that are expressed as a percentile of the range between the highest and lowest values. The charts and tables demonstrate our strong CEO pay for performance alignment over the past three years. Our CEO is generally being compensated at a lower level than the CEOs of most of our 2018 peers.
Datapoints within the shaded pay-for-performance alignment band reflect an alignment of pay and performance. Datapoints to the left and above the band suggest lower pay for higher performance; while those to the right and below the band suggest higher pay for lower performance.

As with our CEO's total compensation package, the total compensation provided to our other named executive officers relative to our peers demonstrates a strong pay-for-performance alignment for our shareholders. As shown in the charts below, our named executive officer group lags the median total compensation provided to our 2018 peer group named executive officers. The summary also depicts that the multiple of our CEO's compensation compared with our next most highly compensated named executive officer lags our 2018 peer group median.

Our Compensation Committee (a) selects the members of our peer group and periodically examines whether peers continue to meet the criteria for inclusion described below, and (b) uses our peer group for both compensation and performance benchmarking. As part of the peer group selection process, the Compensation Committee receives advice from its independent compensation consultant to create a peer group that includes companies that: (1) maintain a regulated utility industry perspective which emphasizes operational excellence and customer satisfaction as a means to create shareholder value; (2) reflect our labor market for key executive talent and are part of high-cost geographic areas; and (3) have similar revenue, market capitalization and return-based measures of performance.  For 2018, based on these criteria and the advice of its independent compensation consultant, our Compensation Committee removed three members of our 2017 peer group (Avista Corp., Great Plains Energy Incorporated and Westar Energy, Inc., due to pending merger and acquisitions transactions) and replaced them with Northwest Natural Gas Company and Spire Inc.

Say-on-Pay Results
At our annual meeting in 2018, our shareholders continued to show strong support of our executive pay program, with 99 percent of the votes approving the say-on-pay resolution. 
Those 2018 voting results occurred after the Compensation Committee took action to approve 2018 pay. Nevertheless, the Compensation Committee and the Board reviewed that feedback from shareholders when establishing executive pay for 2019. The Compensation Committee believes the results from our 2018 annual meeting affirm our shareholders' continuing support of the company's approach to executive pay. Thus, the Compensation Committee made no substantive changes to executive pay for 2019. 
How we set pay
Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee, composed entirely of independent directors, is responsible for the oversight of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay, benefits, and other employment matters for executives; 
• Stock-based pay plans for employees; 
• The election and appointment of executive officers and other corporate officers; 
• CEO performance; and 
• Director pay. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee considers several factors when it sets executive pay — all of which ultimately influence our executive pay program.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Align Interests. Provide pay that aligns management (and employee) interests with those of shareholders and customers.      Peer Comparison. Establish overall pay approximating the median of our peer group and applicable position comparisons.      Attract Talent. Set pay that will attract talent from both within and outside the utility industry.

Set pay that will attract talent from both within and outside the utility industry.  
  Economic Circumstances. Set pay based on economic circumstances, including turnover and retention considerations.      Pay for Performance. Tie all components of incentive pay to the company's short-and long-term financial and operational performance.      No Executive Perks. Executives participate in same benefits plans available to all non‑union employees, with no additional perquisites, other than executive physicals.

[BEGIN TABLE] Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[END TABLE]
of our executives, paying particular attention to applicable comparisons with our 2018 peer group. When making comparisons to the peer group, the Compensation Committee seeks to establish compensation levels that approximate the median of our peer group. After determining appropriate levels, the Compensation Committee recommends both CEO and executive officer pay to the Board for approval. The CEO is not a member of the Compensation Committee and does not vote on Board matters concerning executive pay. 
With respect to our CEO's pay, the Compensation Committee conducts an annual performance assessment of the CEO and determines appropriate adjustments to all elements of his pay based on his individual performance and the company's performance. The Compensation Committee then considers our CEO's preference: having a larger percentage of his pay be at risk in the form of performance-based compensation and his overall pay to be below the median of his peers.
For the other executive officers, the CEO and CFO make recommendations to the Compensation Committee for all elements of pay based on individual performance, market data from our peer group and published survey data. The Compensation Committee reviews, discusses, modifies, and approves, as appropriate, these recommendations. 
The diagram below summarizes the Compensation Committee's annual process for setting executive pay, which begins in July and concludes the following February.

Pay Philosophy
We target base salary, annual cash incentive awards, and long-term equity grants, as well as total pay, to be market competitive for our executive officers. Our Compensation Committee believes that the best proxy to determine market competitiveness of pay is the median of our peer group, including individual pay components, as well as total pay. However, because comparative data is one of several tools that are used in determining executive officer compensation, competitiveness of compensation may fluctuate based on a number of factors, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The level of achievement of our pre-established performance goals; 
● Our TSR compared against our peer group; 
● Individual performance and scope of job responsibilities; 
● Internal equity considerations;  
● Market competitiveness and internal executive turnover; and 
● The executive's industry and position experience and tenure. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE] Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[END TABLE]
To align the long-term interests of our executives, shareholders, and customers, our Compensation Committee uses performance-based incentive awards to place a significant component of each executive's pay at risk. According to our Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, our relative TSR performance metric that is part of our long term incentive program is set at a higher level, and is more difficult to achieve, than our peers. This structure encourages our executives to focus on both short- and long-term performance and provides a reward to our executives, shareholders, and customers when we achieve our financial and operating objectives.
[BEGIN TABLE]
The target pay mix for our named executive officers changed slightly in 2018 from 2017. As part of the overall 2018 pay package, our Compensation Committee increased (1) the targeted annual incentive opportunity for three of our named executive officers as described below in the Annual Cash Incentive Awards section, and (2) the targeted long-term equity incentive opportunity for our CEO and one of our other named executive officers as described below in the Long-Term Performance-Based Equity Incentive Awards section. As a result, the percentage of at-risk pay component of the target pay mix increased for our named executive officers, as a whole, to 68 percent in 2018 from 67 percent in 2017.   Percent of pay at risk increased for 2018 
[END TABLE]
For our CEO, 78 percent of the overall targeted pay in 2018 (base salary plus targeted annual and long-term incentives) relates to performance-based incentive awards. For our named executive officers other than the CEO, that percentage averages 59 percent. The charts below depict the target total pay mix for our CEO and the average of our other named executive officers.

For long-term incentive purposes, Willis Towers Watson performs its analysis using the published survey data and focuses on companies in the energy services industry, specifically those with annual revenues less than $3 billion. The Compensation Committee considers the responsibilities of the job performed by each of our executive officers and his or her performance, and adjusts each executive's targeted pay amounts accordingly. As further detailed below, internal comparison with other officer positions also is considered.
[BEGIN TABLE] Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[END TABLE]
In addition to these efforts, Willis Towers Watson prepares an analysis of market data compiled from the Willis Towers Watson Compensation DataBank for energy services executives. The analysis examines the target direct compensation opportunity for energy services executives, including base salary, target annual incentives, and the expected value of long-term incentives. Using regression analysis, Willis Towers Watson size-adjusts the data to reflect our revenue scope.
We also conducted a separate analysis of the 2017 executive pay of the 12 other companies in our 2018 peer group. This internal analysis, which was based on proxy data, examined base salary, bonus, other annual compensation, equity awards, and non-equity incentive plan compensation (and excluded change in pension value). Using this analysis, our named executive officers had average pay of $1.2 million in 2017, which was less than all but four of the companies in our 2018 peer group; while the peer group median had average pay per named executive officer of approximately $1.5 million. Our CEO's total 2017 pay was approximately 89 percent of the median total pay of 2018 peer group CEOs.
These analyses demonstrate that, on average, our highest paid employees are paid at a level that is below the median of our 2018 peer group and industry. We also are cognizant of prevailing economic conditions, internal pay equity, and executive turnover, which our Compensation Committee takes into account when determining executive compensation.
CEO Pay Ratio
[BEGIN TABLE]
We believe executive pay must be internally consistent and equitable to motivate our employees to create shareholder value. We are committed to internal pay equity, and the Compensation Committee monitors the relationship between the pay our executive officers receive and the pay our non-managerial employees receive. The Compensation Committee reviewed a comparison of CEO pay (base salary and incentive pay) to the pay of all our employees (other than our CEO) in 2018. The compensation for our CEO in 2018 was approximately 27 times the median pay of our employees as compared to 23 times in 2017, using the same methodology. 27:1 CEO Pay Ratio

The compensation for our CEO in 2018 was approximately 27 times the median pay of our employees as compared to 23 times in 2017, using the same methodology. 27:1 CEO Pay Ratio
[END TABLE]
We identified the new median employee this year by using the same methodology we used to identify last year's median employee — by examining the 2018 total cash compensation for all individuals (excluding our CEO) who were employed by us on December 14, 2018, the last day of our payroll year (last year, we also used the last day of our payroll year). We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation, and we did not annualize the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of 2018. We believe the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees (seven percent of our employees receive annual equity awards).
Our determination of the median employee yielded two median employees because we had an even number of employees. After identifying the two median employees based on total cash compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for each such employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table later in this proxy statement and selected the employee with the lower total compensation to compute the ratio.

[END TABLE]
Wealth Accumulation
The Compensation Committee reviews annually the wealth accumulation of our executives, considering all of the elements of total pay each executive officer receives during the prior five-year period, including base salaries, annual cash incentive payouts, the value of long-term incentive awards and any special payments made to an individual executive. The Compensation Committee also reviews the projected value of each executive officer's accumulated equity grants over the subsequent five-year period based upon various stock appreciation and "stay to normal retirement" scenarios. This is done to analyze not only the amount of pay each executive officer has accumulated to date, but also to better understand how current equity grants may affect the amount of wealth executive officers accumulate in the future.
Pay Components
[BEGIN TABLE]
  The primary pay components for our executive officers in 2018 were:   
● Base Salary;   
● Annual performance-based cash incentive awards; and   
● Long-term performance-based equity incentive awards in the form of performance units and ERRP restricted share units.    
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes these pay components align the interests of our executives and our shareholders by basing a significant portion of total pay on performance and achievement of our short- and long-term goals. The specific mix among the individual components reflects market comparisons (primarily with respect to the median of our 2018 peer group) and individual position and performance. Base salary represents 22 percent of our CEO's targeted total pay and, on average, 41 percent of our other named executive officers' targeted total pay. Performance-based awards (annual and long-term incentive) represent the remaining portion of targeted pay. 
The Compensation Committee also believes that our executive pay program appropriately mitigates the risk associated with incentive-based pay. The Compensation Committee has designed the entire program and the metrics under our annual and long-term performance-based incentive awards to curb inappropriate risk taking. For example, we do not offer guaranteed bonuses. In addition, our annual and long-term performance-based incentive awards utilize multiple performance metrics which vary from plan to plan, and rewards under those plans are aligned with the interests of our shareholders. If our shareholders benefit from our performance, our executive officers are rewarded. Our ERRP restricted share units also benefit our long-term succession and strategic plan by providing for payment only after the recipient leaves employment with us, and then over a five-year period. Furthermore, we have limited severance packages, we do not maintain a non-performance-based supplemental executive retirement plan, 
[BEGIN TABLE] Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[END TABLE]
and our retirement, healthcare, and welfare benefit programs for executives are generally the same as for all employees and are discussed in the 2018 Executive Pay section of this proxy statement. Finally, we maintain stock ownership guidelines for our executives. In light of these pay practices, the Compensation Committee believes that our executive pay program appropriately address the risks associated with performance-based incentives.
Base Salary
The general guideline for determining salary levels for our executive officers, including the CEO, is to be around the median of our peer group, adjusted for other factors such as trade area economics, turn-over, tenure, and experience. Adjustments from peer group levels are made based on experience in the position, industry experience, and individual performance and responsibilities. While we are cognizant of the competitive range, our primary goal is to compensate our executives at a level that best achieves our pay philosophy, whether or not this results in actual pay for some positions that may be higher or lower than the market median. We find that survey results for particular positions can vary from year to year. Thus, we consider market trends for certain positions over a period of several years rather than a one-year period in setting pay for such positions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
The Compensation Committee considers adjustments to base salaries for the executive officers on an annual basis. For 2018, the Compensation Committee felt that an increase to the base salaries of our executive officers in line with the increases provided to our employees generally was reasonable in light of the company's operating results in 2017. In addition, two of our named executive officers received an additional increase to reflect the additional responsibilities assigned to them upon the resignation of one of our executive officers who was not replaced. 
To remain competitive with the market, the Compensation Committee also considered the effect of such increased salaries for our executive officers in relation to the median of our 2018 peer group. The table to the right sets forth the base salaries for our named executive officers. The base salary adjustments for 2018 were effective April 1, 2018.

(1) Base Salary
Base salary is the first component in the calculation of the annual cash incentive award. Base salary is described in the Base Salary section immediately preceding this Annual Cash Incentive Awards discussion.
(2) Individual Target Incentive
Each year, the Compensation Committee approves an annual incentive target, expressed as a percentage of base salary, for each executive. The target opportunity for our executive officers is derived in part from peer group and competitive survey analysis data and in part by the Compensation Committee's judgment on the internal equity of the positions, scope of job responsibilities, and each executive's industry experience and tenure. Potential adjustments to the annual incentive target for the executive officers are considered by the Compensation Committee on an annual basis.
[BEGIN TABLE]
In 2018, the Compensation Committee adjusted the target incentive opportunity for our chief executive officer only, increasing the opportunity to 100 percent from 80 percent in 2017. The Compensation Committee believed this increase was appropriate to align his incentive opportunity with his peers. The table to the right sets forth the 2018 annual incentive target opportunity for our named executive officers.       2018

[END TABLE]
(3) Plan Funding Percentage
Before each annual incentive plan year begins, management proposes specific performance targets for the plan's financial and operational measures. The Compensation Committee considers the proposed targets, and the Compensation Committee and the Board approve final targets. Following the end of the plan year, the Compensation Committee reviews data submitted by management regarding company performance against each of the specific performance targets and determines the degree to which each performance measure was met during the year, subject to Board approval. The aggregate percentage of financial and operational measures met during the year represents the plan funding percentage for the annual incentive plan. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
For our executives, the funding (as a percentage of target) under the annual incentive plan has ranged from 80 percent to 125 percent for the five previous years, as set forth in the table to the right.    Historical Funding of Annual Cash Incentive (as a percentage of target)
For our executives, the funding (as a percentage of target) under the annual incentive plan has ranged from 80 percent to 125 percent for the five previous years, as set forth in the table to the right.    Historical Funding of Annual Cash Incentive (as a percentage of target)
  2013 2014 2015 (1) 2016 2017 
  108% 125% 80% 113% 99% 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee may use discretion in increasing or decreasing the plan funding percentage from actual performance due to specific facts and circumstances, such as current economic conditions as well as unusual one-time events that significantly impact financial or non-financial results. The Compensation Committee exercises this discretion only for unusual, non-operational items.
For many years, including 2018, the annual incentive plan has used four categories of performance measures to determine the plan funding percentage – financial, safety, reliability, and customer satisfaction. The relative weightings of these measures are set forth in the graphic on the following page.
[BEGIN TABLE] Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
In order for any awards under the 2018 annual incentive plan to be earned and paid out, the company must attain at least 90 percent of the budgeted net income target, which coincides with the threshold net income target for the plan. This metric for determining performance against our financial goal is derived from our audited financial statements. However, the Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may consider certain items or events as unusual when determining performance against the metric and make what it deems to be appropriate adjustments. There were no adjustments in 2018.  In addition, the 2018 annual incentive plan provided that the lost-time incident rate portion of the safety metric would be forfeited in the event of a work-related fatality, unless the Compensation Committee determined that no actions on the part of the employee or the Company contributed to the incident.   Annual Incentive Plan Metrics 
[END TABLE]
We continued to achieve high levels of customer satisfaction in 2018, achieving our highest ever J.D. Power overall customer satisfaction score, an increase over our previous highest score in 2017. The table below shows the associated performance metrics (including threshold, target, and maximum levels), weighting and plan payout percentage for each of the 2018 performance measures, which resulted in the plan funding at 136 percent of target for our named executive officers.

OSHA specifically defines what workplace injuries and illnesses should be recorded and, of those recorded, which must be considered lost time incidents. The threshold level for the safety measures represents our five-year average performance for these metrics, which is significantly above our Edison Electric Institute (EEI) peer group average; the target level is significantly above our peer group average and represents a 15 percent improvement over our five-year average performance for lost time incident rate and total recordable incident rate; and the maximum represents first quartile performance for our EEI peer group and a significant improvement over historical company performance. Safety Training Completion includes completion of assigned safety training for

The threshold for SAIDI, including major event days, represents a ten percent improvement of the five-year average performance for IEEE medium-sized utilities; the target level represents a 10 percent improvement over the gap between the company's five-year average results and the maximum level; and the maximum level is equal to the company's best SAIDI, including major event days, in the last five years.
Damages per 1000 Locates. This natural gas reliability metric assesses the effectiveness of the company's programs to prevent damage to its natural gas system. The threshold level represents the company's five-year average and the average of second quartile performance as reported in a leak reporting survey conducted by the American Gas Association (AGA); the target level represents a 20 percent improvement over the company's five-year average; and the maximum level represents first quartile performance.
Leaks per 100 Miles of Main. This natural gas reliability metric assesses the overall performance of the company's natural gas system. The threshold level represents a level equal to first quartile performance as reported by the AGA; the target level represents the company's five-year average, which is first quartile performance; and the maximum level represents a 35 percent improvement over the company's five-year average, well into first quartile performance.

(4) Customer Satisfaction. J.D. Power. One customer satisfaction metric is measured by the broadly utilized J.D. Power residential electric and gas customer satisfaction surveys and studies, which include the following components: communications, corporate citizenship, billing and payment, price, power quality and reliability (electric) or field service (gas) and customer service. The threshold level represents the company's five-year average; the target level is an improvement of one point over our best ever score, which we achieved in 2017; and the maximum level is a five point improvement over our 2017 best ever score. 
[END TABLE]
Flynn Wright Surveys. The remaining two customer satisfaction metrics are measured based on the results of a 2018 customer tracking survey conducted on our behalf by Flynn Wright, a full service advertising, marketing, public relations, web design, interactive and research advertising agency. For both of these metrics, the threshold level is set ten percent below target; the target level represents our average score for three waves of surveys from Fall 2016 to Fall 2017; and the maximum level is set at ten percent above target.
(4) Individual Performance Multiple
After the Compensation Committee determines the plan funding percentage, the committee determines an individual performance multiple for each executive, which is factored into the incentive payout calculation. To make this determination, the Compensation Committee analyzes the total mix of available information, as well as actual performance measured against pre-established goals. 
The company's successes in 2018 were due to the substantial efforts of our executive officers and many other employees across all departments of the company. As a result of the factors noted above, the Compensation Committee determined that it was appropriate to award each named executive officer (and the other executive officers) the annual cash incentive award as provided by the 2018 annual cash incentive plan, without the addition of any performance multiplier. Actual 2018 annual cash incentive awards for the named executive officers are reflected in the following table.

Long-Term Performance-Based Equity Incentive Awards 
We have used our Equity Compensation Plan to provide for the award of long-term, performance-based equity incentive awards to our executive officers. These performance-based awards help us achieve our compensation philosophy of being market competitive while simultaneously aligning the interests of our executives and shareholders. 
The Equity Compensation Plan authorizes several types of stock-based awards, including restricted stock and a variety of performance-based awards. In 2018, the Compensation Committee granted two types of long-term, equity incentive awards to our executives under the Equity Compensation Plan: (1) LTIP performance units with cliff vesting after a three-year performance period; and (2) a smaller award of ERRP restricted share units with cliff vesting after a five-year performance period and a payout over five years following the executive's separation from service with the company. All of these 2018 awards are performance-based and payable, if and when earned, in shares of our common stock.
LTIP Performance Units. The Compensation Committee determines the terms and restrictions applicable to grants of LTIP performance units. After the company's financial results are available for the prior year, the Compensation Committee approves the annual grant of LTIP performance units to our executive officers (and nearly 95 other participants in 2018). The awards of LTIP performance units are intended to provide a link between executive officer compensation and long-term shareholder interests as reflected in changes in our stock price, and to motivate and reward achievement of pre-established corporate financial goals and relative TSR. The Compensation Committee believes that making an annual grant of LTIP performance units motivates our executive officers (and the other participants) to focus on long-term, sustainable improvement in shareholder value because the award payout is tied to financial performance and continued service over a three-year period with cliff vesting at the end of such period, and the ultimate value delivered is dependent upon the value of our stock.
During the performance periods summarized in the table below, the performance measures for the LTIP awards included (1) a combined financial metric comprised of ROAE and either average EPS or net income growth, contributing 50 percent of the payout, and (2) TSR relative to our peer group, also contributing 50 percent of the payout. The table below shows, for the past five completed performance periods, to the overall payout (expressed as a percentage of target).

[END TABLE]
ERRP Restricted Share Units. In 2011, the Compensation Committee made the first annual grants of ERRP restricted share units. The Compensation Committee instituted the practice of granting ERRP restricted share units to bring the long-term incentive component of our executives' compensation in line with the median of our peers, while simultaneously encouraging retention with the five-year cliff vesting component and providing retirement benefits. The ERRP share units also encourage succession planning and continuity of our strategic plan through the five-year payout of vested awards following the executive officer's separation from service with the company. The key distinction between these awards and the non-performance-based supplemental executive retirement plans that certain of our peers and many other companies provide is that our ERRP restricted share units are earned based upon company performance.
The number of ERRP restricted share units that the Compensation Committee has granted annually has been considerably fewer than the grants of performance units. Like the performance units described above, these restricted share units are intended to provide a link between executive officer compensation and retirement planning and long-term shareholder interests and to motivate and reward achievement of pre-established corporate financial goals. The Compensation Committee believes that an annual grant of restricted share units motivates our executive officers to focus on long-term, sustainable improvement in our business because (1) vesting of the award is tied to financial performance and continued service over a five-year period and (2) payout of the vested award occurs over a five-year period following the executive officer's separation from service with the company. On December 31, 2016, the first ERRP grants vested.

2018 Long-Term Incentive Program Performance Unit Grants
In February 2018, the Compensation Committee approved grants of LTIP performance units subject to a three-year performance period with cliff vesting at the end of such period. The target long-term equity opportunities for each executive officer are derived from 2018 peer group and competitive survey data and from the Compensation Committee's judgment on the internal equity of the positions and scope of job responsibilities. To determine the target value of each executive officer's LTIP performance unit awards, the Compensation Committee considered the range for comparable roles within our peer group, with consideration given to the strategic value of each position. Based on these considerations, in 2018, the Compensation Committee increased the targeted opportunity (expressed as a percentage of base salary) associated with the LTIP awards for one of our named executive officers to better align with the market median.
Each executive officer's targeted opportunity is converted into specific LTIP performance unit grants by dividing the total targeted value (the targeted percentage of base salary) by the weighted average fair value of a share of our stock on the grant date, less the present value of expected dividends. The resulting calculation represents the number of LTIP performance units that were granted and will vest on December 31, 2020, if all performance goals are met at the target performance level. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
The target equity opportunities (value at target and number of shares) for the 2018 grants of LTIP performance units are shown in the table to the right. The table also compares the target opportunities (expressed as a percentage of base salary) applicable to the 2017 and 2018 awards.         Target LTIP Performance Unit Opportunity for 2018

2018 Executive Retention / Retirement Program Restricted Share Unit Grants
In December 2018, the Compensation Committee approved performance-based ERRP restricted share unit grants. These restricted share unit awards are subject to a five-year performance and five-year cliff vesting period and, once vested, will be paid out in shares of the company's common stock over a five-year period after a recipient has separated from service with the company. 
Our overall compensation program does not provide any non-performance-based supplemental executive retirement benefit. The Compensation Committee designed and implemented the ERRP in lieu of a traditional supplemental executive retirement plan which is not performance-based but is offered by many of our peers and other companies to increase overall competitiveness. The ERRP restricted share units help to achieve our compensation philosophy of being market competitive while aligning the interests of our executives and shareholders. It also promotes retention through the five-year cliff vesting component and benefits succession planning and continuity of our strategic plan through its five-year payout following separation from service.
The long-term equity opportunity for the ERRP is derived from peer group and competitive survey data and from the Compensation Committee's judgment on the internal equity of the positions and scope of job responsibilities. To determine the value of each executive officer's ERRP restricted share unit award, the Compensation Committee considered the range for comparable roles within our peer group, with consideration given to each position's strategic value, and the overall long-term equity opportunity offered to that group. For 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the equity incentive opportunities provided to our 2018 peer group to analyze whether the targeted ERRP restricted share unit awards to our executive officers approximated the peer group median. Based on its review, the Compensation Committee determined that no changes were required for the 2018 ERRP restricted share unit awards for all of our executive officers other than our CEO, who received an increase of his award to 60 percent of base salary from 50 percent of base salary.
The target equity opportunities for the 2018 ERRP restricted share unit grants to our named executive officers, based on a percentage of base salary, are shown in the table below. Each executive officer's 2018 award value was converted into specific equity grants by dividing the total potential value of the award by the fair market value of a share of our stock on the grant date. This represents the number of restricted share units that will vest on December 31, 2023, if the company's net income for three of the five calendar years 2019 – 2023 exceeds the company's net income for 2018. The value of the award on the grant date, as reflected in the below table, is based on the closing market price of our stock on the grant date, less the present value of expected dividends. If earned, the value of the award on payout will depend on the market price of our common stock on the date of payout.

Depending upon actual company performance relative to these performance goals, the exact number of shares that could have vested ranged from zero to 200 percent of the target award. As summarized above in the  2018 Long-Term Incentive Program Performance Unit Grants section, our relative TSR metrics are established at levels higher than our peers according to a market analysis conducted by the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant. At the conclusion of the performance period, the Compensation Committee calculated the company's performance relative to these goals during the three-year performance period to determine the vesting percentage for the 2016 LTIP performance unit grants. 
For the financial goals related to the 2016 LTIP performance unit grants, ROAE was 10 percent and simple average EPS growth was 7.5 percent. This financial performance resulted in a 84.3 percent vesting percentage for that half of the program. For our market goal, TSR was 22.7 percent, resulting in a ranking of 12th out of 14 with respect to our 2016 peers, and contributing 10 percent with respect to that half of the program. Our peer group remains generally consistent from year to year. However, with mergers and acquisition activities over the years, we have made minor changes to our peer groups, and our 2016 peer group differs from our 2018 peer group.
For purposes of our 2016 LTIP, we calculated TSR by comparing the average closing price for a share of common stock of us and our 2016 peers during the period beginning 10 days prior to the end of the performance period and ending 10 days after the performance period plus the cumulative dividends earned during the performance period, to the average closing price of a share of common stock of us and our 2016 peers during the period beginning 10 days prior to the start of the performance period and ending 10 days after the start of the performance period. Our Compensation Committee believes that calculating relative TSR using the 20-day average share price around the beginning and end of the performance period results in a more accurate reflection of return for the period that is less impacted by stock market activity on the first and last days of the performance period.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Based on the Compensation Committee's calculation of these performance measures, the 2016 LTIP performance unit grants vested at 94.3 percent. The table to   Performance Measures — 2016-2018   Result   Weight   Vesting

Retirement benefits are offered to employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, through tax-qualified company-funded pension plans and to all eligible employees through a 401(k) defined contribution plan. Both pension plans and 401(k) plans are common benefits provided in the utility and energy industry. Our executive officers, including the CEO, participate in some or all of these plans, and the terms governing the retirement benefits under these plans are the same as those available to substantially all employees. We do not offer any supplemental retirement benefits to our executive officers other than the performance-based ERRP restricted share units described above. Our healthcare, insurance, and other welfare and employee-benefit programs are generally the same for substantially all employees, including the CEO and executive officers. We share the cost of health and welfare benefits with our employees, which is dependent on the benefit coverage option that each employee elects. Our executive officers do not receive any material perquisites or special benefits that differ materially from those available to employees generally.
Severance and Post-Termination Benefits
We provide severance and post-termination benefits to our executive officers under our severance plan. Severance and post-termination benefits are explained in detail under the 2018 Executive Pay—Pay After Employment Ends section, starting on page 35 of this proxy statement.
Non-qualified Deferred Compensation
The company provides a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which is intended to be an unfunded plan. The 2009 Officer Deferred Compensation Plan (officer deferred plan) allows eligible officers to defer up to 100 percent of certain compensation, including base salary (subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code compensation limit), short-term incentive awards and awards earned under our Equity Compensation Plan. There are no company contributions to the officer deferred plan. Participants in the officer deferred plan may elect to have deferrals credited to their account in company stock (in the form of deferred share units issued under the Equity Compensation Plan) or cash investment options that substantially mirror the qualified employee 401(k) plan investment options. The value of each deferred compensation account is adjusted periodically to reflect the gains, losses, and dividends associated with the designated investments. Officer deferred plan participants do not pay income taxes on amounts deferred or earnings thereon until those amounts are distributed from the officer deferred plan. A participant's benefits under the officer deferred plan are fully vested and are payable after terminating employment. Benefits are paid in a lump sum unless a participant elects annual installments.

[END TABLE]
No Employment Agreements
We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our executives. We generally believe that ongoing employment agreements are not necessary to retain talented executives; however, agreements may be appropriate on a case-by-case basis, such as when an executive begins employment with us. Due to the changing marketplace in which we compete for talent, the Compensation Committee regularly reviews this practice to help ensure that we remain competitive in our industry. 
Tax Treatment of Certain Compensation
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the company deductibility of executive compensation paid to certain named executive officers (and, beginning in 2018, certain former executive officers) to $1 million per year. Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, Section 162(m) contained an exception to the $1 million deduction limit for certain qualifiying performance-based compensation. The Act eliminated this performance-based exception other than for "written binding contracts" in effect as of November 2, 2017, so long as such contracts are not materially modified after that date. 
We had structured our Equity Compensation Plan to enable grants of equity-based incentive awards to be deductible under Section 162(m), and the material terms of the Equity Compensation Plan were approved by shareholders at our 2016 annual meeting. Thus, we believe we should be able to deduct our long-term performance-based equity incentive awards that were outstanding as of November 2, 2017 (such as LTIP performance unit awards and ERRP restricted share unit awards). However, similar awards made after such date will not be eligible for the exception and may not be deductible.
The Compensation Committee generally seeks ways to limit the impact of Section 162(m). However, the Compensation Committee believes that the tax deduction limitation should not compromise our ability to establish and implement incentive programs that support the compensation objectives discussed above. Accordingly, achieving these objectives and maintaining required flexibility in this regard may result in payments of compensation or grants of awards that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes.

number of shares issued upon vesting will vary from zero to 200 percent of the target award, depending on actual company performance relative to the performance goals. In addition, if earned, the value of a performance unit award and a restricted share unit award on the vesting date, based on the fair market value of our stock on that future date, likely will differ from the value on the grant date, which is based on the fair market value of a share of our stock and, with respect to a performance unit award, is based on the target amount for such award. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding assumptions underlying the valuation of equity awards.
Percentage of Salary Compared to Total Compensation
For 2018, base salary for the named executive officers accounted for approximately 22 to 49 percent of total direct compensation (i.e., salary plus targeted annual and long-term incentive compensation), while incentive compensation accounted for approximately 51 to 78 percent of total direct compensation, assuming achievement of a target level of performance for each named executive officer.

(1)  LTIP Shares vested consist of performance units for the 2016-2018 performance period that vested on December 31, 2018, at a performance level of 94.3 percent. We determined the value realized for the vesting of these shares using the fair market value of our common stock on the December 31, 2018, vesting date, which was $59.44. 
(2)  ERRP Shares vested consist of restricted share units for the 2013-2018 performance period that vested on December 31, 2018. We determined the value realized for the vesting of these restricted share units using the fair market value of our common stock on the December 31, 2018, vesting date, which was $59.44. All of the restricted share units are deferred until the recipient departs NorthWestern. Upon departure, the restricted share units are paid out as shares of common stock in five annual installments.

We have two separate defined benefit pension plans that cover employees hired prior to January 1, 2009. The NorthWestern Energy Pension Plan is applicable to employees who began their employment in Montana, and the NorthWestern Corporation Pension Plan is applicable to employees who began their employment in South Dakota or Nebraska.

Under the NorthWestern Energy Pension Plan, a participant's account grows based upon (1) contributions by the company made once per year, and (2) interest credits at the rate of six percent per year. Contributions by the company range from (a) three percent to 12 percent for eligible compensation, plus (b) 1.5 percent to six percent for eligible compensation above one-half of the taxable social security wage base. Upon termination of employment, an employee who is at least 50 years of age with five years of service may begin receiving a monthly annuity or defer receiving benefits until he or she is required to take a minimum distribution. Mr. Rowe currently is eligible for this early retirement option.
Under the cash balance formula of the NorthWestern Corporation Pension Plan, a participant's account grows based upon (1) annual pay credits, and (2) annual interest credits based on the average federal 30-year Treasury Bill rate for November of the preceding year. Pay credits range from three percent to 7.5 percent for compensation below the taxable wage base, and such amounts are doubled for compensation above the taxable wage base. Upon termination of employment, an employee (or if deceased, his or her beneficiary) may elect to (a) defer receiving benefits until he or she is required to take a minimum distribution or (b) receive an early retirement benefit of either (i) a lump sum payment equal to the cash balance in the account or (ii) a monthly annuity if age 55 or greater. Messrs. Bird and Pohl and Ms. Schroeppel currently are eligible for the lump sum early retirement option. Mr. Bird also is eligible for the monthly annuity early retirement option.
For both pension plans, credited years of service are based on actual hire date, and pensionable earnings include base pay only. Mercer Human Resources Consulting, the actuary for our pension plans, calculated the present value of accumulated benefits using participant data provided by us. 
Non-qualified Deferred Compensation
We implemented a deferred compensation plan in 2009. Mr. Rowe is the only one of our named executive officers who has deferred compensation into the plan, although he did not elect to defer any compensation in 2018. The deferred compensation plan is discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Other Pay Policies—Non-qualified Deferred Compensation section of this proxy statement,

[END TABLE]
Our executive officers receive annual grants under our ERRP program. Pursuant to the terms of the ERRP award agreement, when a grant vests, our executive officers receive restricted share units, which we credit to an account for each executive officer similar to a deferred compensation account. These restricted share units are not deferrals under our deferred compensation plan; however, the restricted share units are similar to deferred compensation because an executive officer cannot access the units until he or she is no longer our employee. For more details about our ERRP program, please refer to the Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Pay Components—Long-Term Performance-Based Equity Incentive Awards section in this proxy statement.

Termination or Change in Control Arrangements
Key Employee Severance Plan
Our named executive officers participate in our Key Employee Severance Plan. The Compensation Committee believes that it is appropriate for us to have a severance plan to provide a consistent means of addressing severance situations. 
The Key Employee Severance Plan does not provide for change in control payments, but it does provide for the payment of severance benefits in the event an officer is terminated involuntarily without cause. Cause generally is defined in the Key Employee Severance Plan as (1) fraud, misappropriation of corporate property or funds, or embezzlement; (2) malfeasance in office, misfeasance in office which is willful or grossly negligent, or nonfeasance in office which is willful or grossly negligent; (3) failure to comply with our Code of Conduct; (4) illegal conduct, gross misconduct, or dishonesty, in each case which is willful and results (or is reasonably likely to result) in substantial damage to the company; or (5) willful and continued failure by the employee to perform substantially his/her duties. Involuntary termination does not include a termination resulting from a participant's death or disability. 
The severance benefits payable under the Key Employee Severance Plan consist of:

• Severance Payment: A lump-sum cash payment equal to two times annual base pay plus two times targeted annual cash incentive;  
• Interrupted Annual Bonus: A lump-sum cash payment equal to the amount of the annual cash incentive, pro-rated to the end of the month prior to separation of service and based on actual performance; 
• Welfare Benefits: Reimbursement of Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) premiums paid by the participant during the 24-month period following the participant's termination date; and  
• Outplacement Services: Up to $12,000 of outplacement services during the 12-month period following the participant's termination date.

Equity Compensation Plan Change in Control Provision
All outstanding equity awards were granted under our Equity Compensation Plan. In a change in control situation, the plan provides that either the vesting of awards shall accelerate so that awards shall vest as to the shares that otherwise would have been unvested, or the Compensation Committee shall arrange or otherwise provide for the payment of cash or other consideration to participants in exchange for the satisfaction and cancellation of outstanding awards.

The table to the right shows the amount of potential stock value that would have been received, based on an assumed change in control date of December 31, 2018, outstanding equity awards at target payout, and a closing stock price on December 31, 2018, of $59.44. For a termination of service that does not involve a change in control, death, disability, or retirement, all outstanding equity awards granted under the Equity Compensation Plan are forfeited.

Assuming that our named executive officers terminated their employment as a result of death, disability or retirement on December 31, 2018, each named executive officer would have received the same payout of the earned annual cash incentive award for 2018 that is set forth in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 31. Similarly, each named executive officer would have received the same payout of long-term incentive compensation for the LTIP performance units whose three-year performance period ended December 31, 2018 as reflected in the "Stock Awards - Value Realized" on LTIP Vesting column in the  2018 Stock Vested Table on page 33. The reason for the same payouts is that the individual would have been employed throughout the entire performance period for the awards.

Director Pay 
[END TABLE]
2018 Director Pay
Compensation to our non-employee directors consists of an annual cash retainer, an annual unrestricted stock award, an annual cash retainer for the chairperson of each committee of the Board and meeting attendance and field visit fees. Non-employee directors are not eligible to participate in our retirement plans. The company also reimburses non-employee directors for the cost of participation in approved continuing education programs and the expense of traveling for Board and committee meetings. Employee directors are not compensated for service on the Board. 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee asked Willis Towers Watson to update its review of the competitive market data concerning Board compensation from peer company comparisons so that the Compensation Committee could determine 2019 compensation levels for non-employee directors. Based upon this review, the Compensation Committee made no changes to the rate of compensation provided to our non-employee directors in connection with meetings and membership. 
Also, in 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that the education opportunity afforded by Board member field visits would be valuable to the director, the Board, and the company. Thus, the Compensation Committee decided that each Board member could be compensated for up to one field visit per quarter. 
The table below presents the 2019 compensation schedule for non-employee directors.

Non-employee directors may elect to defer up to 100 percent of any qualified cash or equity-based compensation that would be otherwise payable to them, subject to compliance with NorthWestern's 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (director deferred plan) and Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. For those directors who defer their compensation under the director deferred plan, the meeting fee or retainer, as applicable, is the value utilized to determine the amount of deferred compensation. The deferred compensation may be invested in deferred stock units of the company's common stock or in designated investment options that substantially mirror the qualified employee 401(k) plan options. Based on the election of the non-employee director, other than on account of death, he or she shall receive a distribution either in a lump sum or in approximately equal installments over a designated number of years (not to exceed ten years). Distributions of deferred share units will be equal to one share of the company's common stock for each unit. The value of each deferred compensation account is adjusted periodically to reflect the gains, losses, and dividends associated with the designated investments.

  What We Do 
● Annual election of all directors. 
● Majority vote plus resignation standard in uncontested elections. If a director receives more "WITHHOLD AUTHORITY" votes than "FOR" votes, the director must submit a resignation for the Board to consider. 
● Allow shareholders owning 25 percent of our shares to call a special meeting. 
● Independent board. Our Board is comprised entirely of independent directors, except our CEO.  
● Independent Board Chair. 
● Independent Board committees. Each of our Board committees (audit, compensation, and governance) is made up solely of independent directors. 
● Committee authority to retain independent advisors. Each of our Board committees has the authority to retain independent advisors, which will be paid for by the company. 
● Code of Conduct and Ethics. We are committed to operating with honesty and integrity and maintaining the highest level of ethical conduct. Our Code of Conduct and Ethics applies to all employees, as well as the Board. We also have a separate Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers concerning financial reporting and other related matters. 
● Robust stock ownership guidelines for executive officers and directors.

  What We Don't Do 
● Poison pill. We do not have a shareholders rights plan or poison pill. 
● Hedging of company securities. We do not allow our directors, executives, or employees to hedge company securities. 
● Corporate political contributions. We do not make contributions to candidates for political office, political parties, or committees, or political committees organized to advance political candidates. 
● Supermajority voting. We do not have supermajority voting provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, except to approve (or amend provisions concerning) certain business combinations or mergers.

Board of Directors 
Our bylaws authorize a Board consisting of five to 11 directors, as determined by our Board from time to time. Our Board currently has eight members. 
Board members are elected at each annual meeting to serve for approximately one year, until the next annual meeting of shareholders (or until a successor is able to serve). If any director is not elected or is unable to complete his or her term, the Board may choose a substitute to fill the vacant position or reduce the number of directors on the Board. We believe a limited number of directors helps maintain personal and group accountability. 
Our Board acts as a coherent team within an environment that allows individual insights to contribute to group consensus. Our Board focuses on long-term company success and maintains an effective dialogue with management through constructive relationships which provide timely and appropriate deliberation. 
Each of our directors has exceeded the stock ownership requirements established by our Corporate Governance Guidelines and continues to hold stock in excess of the ownership requirements. For a summary of our stock ownership guidelines, please see the Stock Information / Who owns our stock / Stock Ownership Guidelines section of this proxy statement. Each director also has been recognized as a Governance Fellow by the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD).
Our Board is actively engaged both inside and outside of the boardroom. Our Board members have knowledge and insight that enables them to provide guidance concerning our business, with particular focus on succession planning, corporate strategy, executive compensation, risk management and operating performance. Our Board members spend time in our service territory interacting with our employees, customers and community leaders. They seek and participate in learning opportunities to stay abreast of the latest industry and corporate governance developments affecting their role as directors.
Most of our Board meetings, including the annual meeting, are held throughout our service territory at approximately twelve rotating locations. This practice of rotating meeting locations offers several educational opportunities for our Board members, including attending receptions of community leaders and meetings with employees. These opportunities are intended to inform our Board about the communities we serve and the issues, concerns and successes of our employees. Holding Board meetings in our service territory allows our Board to gain a broader understanding of various areas of our company and permits non-management employees to make presentations to the Board that highlight their work.
Our Board considers attendance at Board and Shareholder meetings and participation by directors in determining continued service on the Board. Attendance and participation is reviewed as part of an annual self-evaluation process. The Board held eight meetings in 2018. With one exception, all of our current directors attended all board meetings and the annual meeting of shareholders in April 2018. Ms. Johnson was excused from attending half of our meetings due to personal reasons.

Board Diversity
Our Board values the diversity of its members. When considering director nominees, our Board strives to identify nominees that will provide insight to our Board from a number of perspectives, with equal importance placed on gender, age, ethnicity, skills and background, as well as location of residence. Our Board believes diversity is important because varied perspectives expand the Board's ability to provide relevant guidance to our business. As depicted below, our slate of director nominees demonstrates diversity.
Our individual Board members also have varied expertise and bring extensive professional experience from both within and outside our industry. This diversity of experience provides our Board with a vast collective skill set which is advantageous to the Board's oversight of our company. While the industry-specific expertise possessed by certain of our Board members is essential, we also benefit from the viewpoints of our directors with expertise outside our industry. A high level overview of the skills and backgrounds of our director nominees follows.

Director Succession Planning
Over the past several years, our Governance Committee has led our Board through a director succession planning process. The Governance Committee initiated the process to allow for a smooth and gradual transition from our directors who were in the final third of their 15-year term limit to new directors with the right skills for our company's future, while preserving the culture of the Board. 
The process began with a review of the individual skill sets of current members and consideration of additional skills that could be beneficial for the Board in the future, with a particular focus on the company's strategy and emerging risks. The Governance Committee also reviewed tenure limits regarding each existing Board member and discussed potential timing for inviting new members to join the Board. With that background analysis, the Governance Committee began developing a general transition timeline and assembling a list of potential candidates who were identified through a combination of personal relationships, industry knowledge, and research. This foundational work regarding director succession planning proved beneficial with the retirement of three directors since April 2016. Additionally, with two current Board nominees nearing the end of their 15-year term limits, our Board's succession planning work will continue.
Director Candidate Evaluation
Our Governance Committee evaluates each director candidate to determine whether the Board should recommend such candidate as a director nominee. In considering new individuals for nomination as directors, the Governance Committee typically solicits recommendations from its current directors and is authorized to engage third-party advisers, including search firms, to assist in the identification and evaluation of candidates, if necessary.
Our goal is to maintain a diverse Board that operates cohesively and challenges management in a constructive way. The Governance Committee has not established specific minimum qualifications for director nominees or set forth specific qualities or skills that the committee believes are necessary for one or more directors to possess. Instead, in considering director candidates, the Governance Committee considers the diversity of our Board (with equal importance placed on gender, age, ethnicity, skills and background, as well as location of residence) and takes into account whether the Board as a whole has the skills, experience, and background that add to and complement the range of skills, experience, and background of each director, based on the following: integrity, accomplishments, business acumen, experience and education, commitment, representation of shareholders, industry knowledge, independence, and financial literacy. With the exception of the company's CEO, all of our directors are independent, as required by our Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
When nominating persons to serve on our Board, the Governance Committee considers individuals who can add value to the strategic policymaking and oversight responsibilities of the Board. A director's ability and available time to contribute to the Board and his or her participation on other boards also are considered because we believe these are important factors that enhance the quality of the Board's decision-making, its oversight of management, and our business overall. The Governance Committee believes that the nominees for election at this year's annual meeting collectively possess the experience, skills, and attributes necessary to lead the company to a long and successful future.
Our Governance Committee also has the responsibility for considering nominees for directors properly recommended by shareholders. A shareholder who wishes to submit a candidate for consideration at the annual meeting of shareholders must notify our Corporate Secretary in writing not less than 90 days and no more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting. The shareholder's written notice must include information about each proposed nominee, including name, age, business address, principal occupation and other information required in proxy solicitations. The nomination notice also must include the nominating shareholder's name and address, the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned by the shareholder and any arrangements or understandings between the nominee and the shareholder. The shareholder also must furnish a statement from the nominee indicating that the nominee wishes and is able to serve as a director. 
The manner in which the Governance Committee evaluates candidates recommended by shareholders is generally the same as candidates from other sources. However, the Governance Committee also will seek and consider information concerning the relationship between the recommending shareholder and the candidate to determine 
[BEGIN TABLE] Corporate Governance 
[END TABLE]
if the candidate can represent the interests of all of the shareholders. The Governance Committee will not evaluate a candidate recommended by a shareholder unless the shareholder notice states that the potential candidate has indicated a willingness to serve as a director, to comply with the expectations and requirements for Board service publicly disclosed by NorthWestern and to provide all of the information required to conduct an evaluation.
Director Resignation Vote Policy
The Board has in place a Majority Plus Resignation Vote Policy for the election of directors. The policy provides that, in an uncontested election, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of "WITHHOLD AUTHORITY" votes from his or her election than votes "FOR" such election (or a Majority Withheld Vote) shall promptly offer his or her resignation following certification of the shareholder vote.
Under this policy, the Governance Committee shall promptly make a recommendation to the Board regarding the resignation offer and possible responses based on the circumstances that led to the Majority Withheld Vote, if known. The Board must act on the Governance Committee's recommendation within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote. Thereafter, the Board will promptly disclose its decision-making process and decision regarding whether to accept the director's resignation offer (or the reason(s) for rejecting the resignation offer, if applicable) in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Any director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this policy shall not participate in the Governance Committee's recommendation or Board action regarding whether to accept the resignation offer. However, if each member of the Governance Committee receives a Majority Withheld Vote at the same election, then the independent directors who did not receive a Majority Withheld Vote shall appoint a committee among themselves to consider the resignation offers and recommend to the Board whether to accept them. If the only directors who did not receive a Majority Withheld Vote in the same election constitute three or fewer directors, all directors may participate in the action regarding whether to accept the resignation offers, with each director recusing himself or herself from consideration of his or her resignation offer.
Board Independence
Independent Board Chair
Our Board has placed the responsibilities of Chair with an independent member of the Board, which we believe provides optimum accountability between the Board and our management team. We believe it is beneficial to have an independent Chair whose sole responsibility is leading our Board members as they provide leadership to our executive team. 
In 2018, our Board members elected Mr. Stephen P. Adik, former Chair of the Audit Committee, to serve as the Board's Chair following our 2018 annual meeting and the concurrent retirement of our former Board Chair, E. Linn Draper, Jr. The Board members selected Mr. Adik because of his experience as an executive in the utility industry and his active participation on our Board, particularly with respect to his role leading our Audit Committee for nearly 14 years.
Our Chair is responsible for providing leadership to the Board and facilitating communication among the directors; setting the Board meeting agendas in consultation with the CEO; presiding at Board meetings, executive sessions and shareholder meetings; and serving as an ex-officio member of each Board committee. This delineation of duties allows the CEO to focus his attention on managing the day-to-day business of the company. We believe this structure provides strong leadership for our Board, while positioning our CEO as the leader of the company in the eyes of our customers, employees, and other stakeholders.
Each regularly scheduled Board and committee meeting provides the opportunity for executive sessions of the non-employee directors without management in attendance. These executive sessions are chaired by our Board Chair or the independent Chair of the respective committee. 
[BEGIN TABLE] Corporate Governance 
[END TABLE]
Determination of Independence and Family Relationships
All of our directors are independent, with the sole exception of our CEO. A director is considered independent if he or she qualifies as "independent" under (1) NYSE standards and any applicable laws and (2) he or she (a) has never been an employee of the company or any of its subsidiaries, (b) is not a close relative of any management employee of the company, (c) provides no services to the company, and is not employed by any firm providing major services to the company, other than as a director, and (d) receives no compensation from the company other than director fees and benefits. The Board's determination of independence is based upon a review of the questionnaires submitted on an annual basis by each director, the company's relevant business records, publicly available information and the applicable SEC and NYSE requirements.
Based on its review, the Board determined that all of the non-employee directors (Messrs. Adik, Clark, Dykhouse, and Horsfall and Mses. Ide, Johnson, and Sullivan) are independent as defined in the listing standards noted above. Our final director, Mr. Rowe, is an executive officer of the company and, therefore, is not independent.
In addition to the independence assessment of our current directors, our Board reviewed the family relationships of our current directors and executive officers to determine the existence of any family relationships not more remote than first cousins. Based on this review, our Board determined that no such family relationships exist, except current directors Dana J. Dykhouse and Jan R. Horsfall are first cousins.

Other Governance Practices
Code of Conduct
Our Board adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics (Code of Conduct) which it reviews annually. Our Code of Conduct embodies the standards that form our culture and sets forth expectations of conduct for all of our officers, directors, and employees, including all full- and part-time employees and certain persons that provide services on our behalf. Our Code of Conduct focuses on our corporate vision, mission and values. You may review our Code of Conduct on our website at NorthWesternEnergy.com under Our Company / Investor Relations / Corporate Governance. We intend to post on our website any amendments to, or waivers from, our Code of Conduct. In addition, our Board adopted a separate Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer or controller (or persons performing similar functions), which includes complaint procedures that specifically apply to this separate code. Our Board also annually reviews this separate code of ethics, which is available on our website at the location noted above. We intend to post on our website any amendments to, or waivers from, this special code of ethics.
Risk Oversight of the Company
Our Audit Committee is primarily responsible for overseeing the company's risk management processes on behalf of the full Board by monitoring company processes for management's identification and control of key strategic, operational, financial, regulatory, compliance, and security risks. The Audit Committee receives reports from management at least quarterly regarding the company's assessment of risks. The Compensation Committee oversees risks in compensation plans, and the Governance Committee oversees risks in corporate governance and social responsibilities including environmental, health and safety matters. In addition, the Audit Committee reports regularly to the full Board, which also considers the company's risk profile. The Audit Committee and the full Board focus on the most significant risks facing the company and review the corporate risk appetite in evaluating strategic alternatives and business development opportunities. The Board oversees the company's risk management, and our CEO and executive Enterprise Risk Management Committee act to ensure that our enterprise risk management and business continuity programs (ERM) achieve their objectives. While management is responsible for the day-to-day risk management processes, we have structured our ERM reporting relationship through our Chief Audit and Compliance Officer who has a direct reporting relationship to the Audit Committee. We believe this division of responsibilities is the most effective approach for addressing the risks facing our company and that our Board leadership structure supports this approach.

[END TABLE]
Cyber and Physical Security Oversight
Our company provides critical infrastructure to meet the needs of states and communities we serve. We recognize the importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, employees, regulators, and shareholders, and our Board devotes significant time and attention to oversight of cyber and physical security risk. In 2016, we updated our Audit Committee's charter to make explicit the Committee's oversight responsibilities concerning cyber and physical security, as well as steps taken by management to understand and mitigate such risks. Our Board and Audit Committee each receive regular reporting on cyber and physical security topics. In 2018, our Audit Committee received quarterly updates on cyber security risk. Cyber security has been a topic addressed in connection with our past four annual NACD-provided director education sessions.
Transactions with Related Persons
Our Audit Committee has adopted a written Related Persons Transaction Policy. The policy requires that any related person transaction be reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee based on its consideration of all available relevant facts and circumstances. The Audit Committee approves a related person transaction only if it determines in good faith that such transaction is in, or is consistent with, the best interests of the company and its shareholders. No material related person transactions were identified during 2018. 
Under the policy, a "related person" is an officer, director, director nominee, or five percent or more shareholder of the company, as well as any immediate family member of such individuals or any entity which is owned or controlled by any of such individuals; and a "related person transaction" is a transaction involving (1) the company, (2) a related person and (3) an aggregate annual amount in excess of $120,000.
The policy also provides ratification procedures for approval of transactions that have been commenced or consummated prior to any knowledge of the involvement of a related person and for the annual review of ongoing related person transactions to ensure that such transactions continue to remain in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. The policy is available on our website at NorthWesternEnergy.com under Our Company / Investor Relations / Corporate Governance.
Hedging and Pledging Our Securities
Our Insider Trading Policy prohibits all of our directors, officers, and employees from engaging in certain transactions involving our securities, including hedging or other monetization transactions and publicly traded options. Specifically, the policy prohibits transactions involving publicly traded options, such as puts, calls, and other derivative securities, as well as hedging and monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars and forward sales contracts. Our policy aims to align the interests of a director, officer, or employee with our and our shareholders' interests and prohibits publicly traded option and hedging and monetization transactions because such transactions could create the appearance that a director, officer, or employee is trading on material non-public information, is focused on short-term performance, or otherwise misaligned. The Insider Trading Policy also prohibits our directors, officers, and employees from pledging any of our securities as collateral for a loan, unless pre-cleared by our general counsel. None of our directors or executive officers have pledged any of our securities as collateral for a loan. The policy is available on our website at NorthWesternEnergy.com under Our Company / Investor Relations / Corporate Governance.
Political Contributions Policy
As a public utility, we are subject to various laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels; and changes to these laws can affect our business, employees, communities and shareholders. Accordingly, we are committed to being an active and responsible corporate citizen. 
We use our resources, through legally permissible participation in the political process, to advance matters of public policy that are consistent with our values, our legal obligations and our Code of Conduct. We also encourage our employees to be active in civic and community activities, including by participating in the political and democratic process.
[BEGIN TABLE] Corporate Governance 
[END TABLE]
We have a formal political contributions policy. We do not make (and our policy prohibits) corporate contributions to candidates for political office, political parties, or committees, or political committees organized for the advancement of political candidates, whether federal, state, or local.
State and local ballot initiatives and referenda on important policy issues do have the potential to impact our business and our stakeholders. Accordingly, the policy permits corporate contributions in connection with such matters, as well as lobbying efforts and contributions to trade and local associations. In addition, the policy allows individual employees to make personal contributions to political action committees. The policy is available on our website at NorthWesternEnergy.com under Our Company / Investor Relations / Corporate Governance.

You may contact our Board, Board Chair or independent directors, individually or as a group, by sending your communication to our Corporate Secretary at NorthWestern Corporation, 3010 West 69th Street, Sioux Falls, South Dakota 57108.

Stock Ownership Guidelines
We believe it is important that our interests are aligned with the interests of our shareholders. Accordingly, our Board has established robust stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors and executive officers. Our stock ownership guidelines are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines on our website at NorthWesternEnergy.com under Our Company / Investor Relations / Corporate Governance.
Under our stock ownership guidelines, each non-employee director must retain at least ten times the value of his or her annual cash Board and committee chair retainer(s) in common stock or deferred stock units within five years of commencing service on our Board.
For executives, the stock ownership guidelines range from six to two times base salary as summarized in the table below. Each executive is restricted, absent a hardship and prior Board approval, from selling stock until his or her guideline amount is achieved and must continue to maintain the required ownership level once it is obtained. 
Our Board instituted stock ownership guidelines to require its members and our executives to hold a meaningful financial stake in the company to align our interests with those of our shareholders. As summarized in the table below, all of our directors and named executive officers have satisfied the applicable stock ownership guideline.

The company does not have any other outstanding class of voting stock. Shareholders whose shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee (i.e., in "street name") will need to obtain a proxy from the broker, bank, or other nominee that holds their shares authorizing them to vote at the annual meeting.

  ? Voting in Person at the Annual Meeting. If you attend the annual meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the annual meeting. Please note, however, that if your shares are held in street name by a broker, bank, or other nominee and you wish to vote at the annual meeting, you must bring to the annual meeting a proxy from the record holder of the shares authorizing you to vote at the annual meeting. Submitting your vote by proxy will not affect your right to attend the annual meeting and to vote in person.   
  r Revoking Your Proxy or Your Voting Instructions to Your Proxy Holders. If you are a record holder of our common stock, you can change your vote at any time before your proxy is voted at the annual meeting by again voting by one of the methods described above or by attending the annual meeting and voting in person.

[END TABLE]
Quorum
At the close of business on the record date, there were 50,409,297 shares of NorthWestern Corporation common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the annual meeting. Each outstanding share is entitled to one vote.
A quorum, which is a majority of the outstanding shares as of the record date, is necessary to hold a valid annual meeting. A quorum will be present at the annual meeting if the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date are present in person or represented by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes are included for determining whether a quorum is present. If a quorum is not present at the annual meeting, we expect that the annual meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies. 
Broker Non-Votes
Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), certain shareholder nominees (such as brokers) have the discretion to vote shares on routine matters, such as the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, when they do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner. They do not have authority to vote on non-routine matters (such as the election of directors, the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation, and the advisory vote on the frequency of advisory votes on executive compensation) unless they receive instruction from the beneficial owner. 
A "broker non-vote" occurs when your broker submits a proxy for your shares but does not indicate a vote for a particular proposal because the broker does not have authority to vote on that proposal and has not received voting instructions from you. Broker non-votes are not counted as votes for or against the proposal in question or as abstentions, and are not counted to determine the number of votes present for the particular proposal.
Under the rules of the NYSE, if your broker holds shares in your name and delivers this proxy statement to you, the broker is entitled to vote your shares on Proposal 2 — Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm even if the broker does not receive voting instructions from you. Without your instructions, the broker is not entitled to vote your shares on Proposal 1 — Election of Directors or Proposal 3 — Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation. We encourage you to provide instructions to your broker, bank, or other nominee. This ensures your shares will be voted at the annual meeting. 
Required Vote and Method of Counting
The required vote and method of counting votes for the various business matters to be considered at the annual meeting are described in the table on the following page. If you sign and return your proxy card without indicating your vote, your shares will be voted "FOR" each of the nominees for director, "FOR" ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, and "FOR" the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation and in accordance with the recommendations of our Board on any other matters properly brought before the annual meeting for a vote.

Householding; Receipt of Multiple Notices
Under the rules of the SEC, a single Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or set of annual reports and proxy statements may be sent to any household at which two or more shareholders reside if they appear to be members of the same family. Each shareholder continues to receive a separate proxy card. This procedure, referred to as householding, reduces the volume of duplicate information shareholders receive and reduces mailing and printing expenses. In accordance with a notice sent to certain shareholders who shared a single address, only one annual report and proxy statement were sent to that address unless any shareholder at that address requested that multiple sets of documents be sent. However, if any shareholder who agreed to householding wishes to receive a separate annual report or proxy statement for 2019 or in the future, he or she may call (800) 542-1061 or write to Broadridge Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717, and the company will deliver promptly upon such written or oral request a separate Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or annual report or proxy statement. Shareholders sharing an address who wish to receive a single set of reports may do so by contacting their banks, brokers, or other nominees, if they are beneficial holders, or by contacting Broadridge at the address set forth above, if they are record holders.
Available Information
We file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. These filings are available through a website maintained by a third-party and accessible through our company website at NorthWesternEnergy.com under Our Company / Investor Relations / SEC Filings. Our public filings also are available to the public from document retrieval services and the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov. 
Future Shareholder Proposals
Shareholder Proposals for Inclusion in Next Year's Proxy Statement. To be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement for our annual meeting to be held in 2020, shareholder proposals submitted under Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 must be received by the corporate secretary of NorthWestern Corporation not later than November 8, 2019. Such proposal must comply with all applicable SEC requirements that a shareholder must meet in order to have a shareholder proposal included in the company's proxy statement. 
Other Shareholder Proposals for Presentation at the 2020 Annual Shareholders' Meeting. For nominations of persons for election as a director or for any proposal that is not submitted for inclusion in next year's proxy statement, but is instead sought to be presented directly from the floor of the 2020 Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the company's bylaws require that timely notice must be given to the corporate secretary.
