PROXY STATEMENT
INTRODUCTION
The enclosed Proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders. This Proxy Statement and the enclosed Proxy will be mailed on or about March 22, 2019, to shareholders of record of the Company's Common Stock and Class B Common Stock as of the close of business on February 22, 2019.
At the Annual Meeting, holders of the Company's Common Stock, $3.00 par value per share ("Common Stock"), and Class B Common Stock, $3.00 par value per share ("Class B Common Stock"), will be asked to: (i) elect seven (7) individuals to the Board of Directors for a term of one year each, (ii) cast an advisory vote on the Company's executive compensation for its named executive officers; (iii) cast an advisory vote on the frequency of the shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation; (iv) ratify the appointment of Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP to serve as independent registered public accountants of the Company for 2019, and (v) transact any other business that may properly come before the meeting.
The Board of Directors recommends that the Company's shareholders vote (i) FOR electing the seven (7) nominees for director; (ii) FOR approving the Company's executive compensation of its named executive officers; (iii) FOR setting the frequency of the shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation at an annual vote; (iv) FOR ratifying the appointment of Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP to serve as independent registered public accountants of the Company for 2019.
RECORD DATE, VOTE REQUIRED AND RELATED MATTERS
The Board has fixed the close of business on February 22, 2019, as the Record Date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. In accordance with the Company's Charter, each outstanding share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote, and each outstanding share of Class B Common Stock is entitled to 20 votes, exercisable in person or by properly executed Proxy, on each matter brought before the Annual Meeting. Cumulative voting is not permitted. As of February 22, 2019, 15,522,588 shares of Common Stock, representing 15,522,588 votes, were held of record by approximately 2,800 shareholders (including an estimated 2,400 shareholders whose shares are held in nominee names) and 839,304 shares of Class B Common Stock, representing 16,786,080 votes, were held by 10 individual shareholders, together representing an aggregate of 32,308,668 votes.
Shares represented at the Annual Meeting by properly executed Proxy will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated therein unless such Proxy has previously been revoked. If no instructions are indicated, such shares will be voted (i) FOR electing the seven (7) nominees for director; (ii) FOR approving the Company's executive compensation of its named executive officers; (iii) FOR setting the frequency of the shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation at an annual vote; (iv) FOR ratifying the appointment of Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP to serve as independent registered public accountants of the Company for 2019.
Any Proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked at any time by the shareholder giving it by (i) delivering to the Corporate Secretary of the Company a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the Proxy, (ii) submitting a later-dated, properly executed Proxy, or (iii) revoking the Proxy and voting in person at the Annual Meeting. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, in and of itself, constitute a revocation of a Proxy. Any written notice revoking a Proxy should be sent to The Dixie Group, Inc., P.O. Box 2007, Dalton, Georgia 30722-2007, Attention: Derek Davis.
The persons designated as proxies were selected by the Board of Directors and are Daniel K. Frierson, Lowry F. Kline and Michael L. Owens. The cost of solicitation of Proxies will be borne by the Company.
The presence, in person or by Proxy, of the holders of a majority of the aggregate outstanding vote of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. In accordance with Tennessee law, Directors are elected by the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast in person or by Proxy at the Annual Meeting. Approval of the Company's executive compensation for its named executive officers will be deemed to have been obtained if the number of votes properly cast in favor of such compensation exceeds the number of votes cast against such compensation. 
With respect to the advisory vote on the frequency of say-on-pay advisory votes, the option that receives the highest number of votes will be deemed to have been selected by shareholders. 
Ratification of the appointment of Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP to serve as independent registered public accountants of the Company for 2019 will be approved if the votes properly cast favoring ratification exceed the votes cast opposing ratification.
Shares covered by abstentions and broker non-votes, while counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the Annual Meeting, are not considered to be affirmative or negative votes. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect upon the election of a nominee for director, so long as such nominee receives any affirmative votes. 
A copy of the Company's Annual Report for the year-ended December 29, 2018, is enclosed herewith.
The Board is not aware of any other matter to be brought before the Annual Meeting for a vote of shareholders. If, however, other matters are properly presented, Proxies representing shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock will be voted in accordance with the best judgment of the proxy holders.

(1) Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and for the purposes of these disclosures, a person is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if that person has or shares "voting power," which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or "investment power," which includes the power to dispose or to direct the disposition of such security. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities. The Class B Common Stock is convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of Common Stock, and accordingly, outstanding shares of such stock are treated as having been converted to shares of Common Stock for purposes of determining both the number and percentage of class of Common Stock for persons set forth in the table who hold such shares.

Frierson is a fiduciary and for which Bank of America, N.A. serves as Trustee. Participants in the 401(k) Plan may direct the voting of all shares of Common Stock held in their accounts, and the Trustee must vote all shares of Common Stock held in the 401(k) Plan in the ratio reflected by such direction. Participants may also direct the disposition of such shares. Accordingly, for purposes of these disclosures, shares held for participants in the 401(k) Plan are reported as beneficially owned by the participants.

The Shareholder's Agreement relates only to shares of Class B Common Stock held by each of the parties to the agreement. Pursuant to the agreement Daniel K. Frierson is granted a proxy to vote such shares of Class B Common Stock so long as they remain subject to the agreement. The Class B Common Stock is convertible on a share for share basis in to shares of Common Stock; however, upon conversion such shares are no longer subject to the agreement. Nevertheless, the parties to the agreement may be deemed to be members of a "group" for purposes of Section 13(d) of the act and for purposes of reporting beneficial ownership of the Common Stock of The Dixie Group, Inc., and accordingly Daniel K.

Considerations with Respect to Nominees
In selecting the slate of nominees for 2019, the independent directors of the Board considered the familiarity of the Company's incumbent Directors with the business and prospects of the Company, developed as a result of their service on the Company's Board. The Board believes that such familiarity will be helpful in their service on the Company's Board. With respect to all nominees, the independent directors of the Board noted the particular qualifications, experience, attributes and skills possessed by each nominee. These qualifications are reflected in the business experience listed under each nominee's name, above. In order of the list of nominees, such information may be summarized as follows: Mr. Blue is an experienced investment banker having been Vice Chairman of Wells Fargo Securities and involved with capital formation, mergers, acquisitions and financing of various types of ventures. Mr. Brock is experienced in establishing new businesses having been involved in the establishment of both Foxmark Media and CapitalMark Bank and Trust. Mr. Daniel K. Frierson has served with the Company in several management and executive capacities his entire adult life, and has been Chief Executive Officer since 1980 and a Board member since 1973.

Additionally, Mr. Frierson has experience as a board member of other public companies as well as significant trade group experience relevant to the Company's business.

Meetings of the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors of the Company met five (5) times in 2018.
Committees, Attendance, and Directors' Fees
     The Company has a standing Executive Committee, Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee. Copies of the Charters of the Company's Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominations and Corporate Governance Committees may be found on the Company's website at www.dixiegroup.com/Investor.
Members of the Executive Committee are Daniel K. Frierson, Chairman, William F. Blue, Jr. and Lowry F. Kline.  Except as otherwise limited by law or by resolution of the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee has and may exercise all of the powers and authority of the Board of Directors for the management of the business and affairs of the Company, which power the Executive Committee exercises between the meetings of the full Board of Directors. The Executive Committee met one (1) time in 2018.
Members of the Audit Committee are Michael L. Owens, Chairman, William F. Blue, Jr., Charles E. Brock, Walter W. Hubbard, Lowry F. Kline, and Hilda S. Murray. All of the members of the Audit Committee are "independent directors" as that term is defined by applicable regulations and rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"). The Audit Committee evaluates audit performance, handles relations with the Company's independent auditors, and evaluates policies and procedures relating to internal accounting functions and controls. The Audit Committee has the authority to engage the independent accountants for the Company. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to an Audit Committee Charter adopted by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has implemented pre-approval policies and procedures related to the provision of audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditors. Under these procedures, the Audit Committee approves the type of services to be provided and the estimated fees related to those services.
The Audit Committee met four (4) times in 2018.
Members of the Compensation Committee are Lowry F. Kline, Chairman, William F. Blue, Jr., and Walter W. Hubbard. The Compensation Committee administers the Company's compensation plans, reviews and may establish the compensation of the Company's officers, and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors concerning such compensation and related matters. The Compensation Committee acts pursuant to a written Charter adopted by the Board of Directors.
The Compensation Committee may request recommendations from the Company's management concerning the types and levels of compensation to be paid to the Company's executive officers. Additionally, the Compensation Committee is authorized to engage compensation consultants and may review and consider information and recommendations of compensation consultants otherwise engaged by the Company or the Board of Directors in connection with the assessment, review and structuring of compensation plans and compensation levels. For a description of the Compensation Committee actions with respect to Compensation of Executive Officers in 2018, see Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Compensation for 2018.
Annually, the Compensation Committee reviews the performance of the Chief Executive Officer against goals and objectives established by the Committee as part of the process of determining his compensation. The Compensation Committee reports to the Board on its performance review.
The Compensation Committee met one (1) time in 2018.
The members of the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee in 2018 were Hilda S. Murray, Chairman, Charles E. Brock, and Michael L. Owens. The Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee develops and recommends for board approval corporate governance guidelines.
The Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee's Charter includes the duties of a nominating committee. Nominees approved by a majority of the Committee are recommended to the full Board. In selecting and approving director nominees, the Committee considers, among other factors, the existing composition of the Board and the mix of Board members appropriate for the perceived needs of the Company. The Committee believes continuity in leadership and board tenure increase the Board's ability to exercise meaningful board oversight. Because qualified incumbent directors provide stockholders the benefit of continuity of leadership and seasoned judgment gained through experience as a director of the Company, the Committee will generally give priority as potential candidates to those incumbent directors interested in standing for re-election who have satisfied director performance expectations, including regular attendance at, preparation for and meaningful participation in Board and committee meetings. The Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee also considers the following in selecting the proposed nominee slate:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• at all times at least a majority of directors must be "independent" in the opinion of the Board as determined in accordance with relevant regulatory and NASD standards; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• at all times at least three members of the Board must satisfy heightened standards of independence for Audit Committee members; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• at all times the Board should have at least one member who satisfies the criteria to be designated by the Board as an "audit committee financial expert". 
[END TABLE]
In selecting the current slate of director nominees, the Committee considered overall qualifications and the requirements of the makeup of the Board of Directors rather than addressing separate topics such as diversity in its selection. The Board considered the value of the incumbents' familiarity with the Company and its business as well as the considerations outlined above under the heading Considerations with Respect to Nominees.
The Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee met one (1) time in 2018.
Board Leadership Structure
Mr. Daniel K. Frierson currently serves as the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board are combined. Executive sessions of the Board are chaired by the chairman of the Compensation Committee, Lowry F. Kline, who, as noted above, has extensive management and Board experience independent of his experience with the Company. Mr. Kline and the independent directors set their own agenda for meetings in executive session and may consider any topic relevant to the Company and its business. The Company believes that regular, periodic, meetings held in executive session, in the absence of management members or management directors, provide the Board an adequate opportunity to review and address issues affecting management or the Company that require an independent perspective. Additionally, the Company's Audit Committee holds separate executive sessions with the Company's independent registered public accounts, internal auditor and management. The Audit Committee also sets its own agenda and may consider any relevant topic in its executive sessions.
Director Attendance
During 2018, no director attended fewer than 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and any Committee of the Board of Directors on which he served. All directors are invited and encouraged to attend the annual meeting of shareholders. In general, all directors attend the annual meeting of shareholders unless they are unable to do so due to unavoidable commitments or intervening events.
Director Compensation
Directors who are employees of the Company do not receive any additional compensation for their services as members of the Board of Directors. Non-employee directors receive an annual retainer of $36,000, payable one-half in cash and one-half in value of Performance Units (subject to a $5.00 per share minimum value for determination of the number of performance units to be issued). Performance Units are redeemable upon a director's retirement for an equivalent number of shares of the Company's Common Stock. In addition to the annual retainer, directors who are not employees of the Company receive $1,500 for each Board meeting attended and $1,000 for each committee meeting attended. Chairmen of the Audit and Compensation committees receive an additional annual payment of $8,000 and the Chairmen of the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee receives an additional annual payment of $4,000. For an additional discussion of Director Compensation, see the tabular information below under the heading, "Director Compensation."
Independent Directors
The Board has determined that William F. Blue, Jr., Charles E. Brock, Walter W. Hubbard, Lowry F. Kline, Hilda S. Murray, and Michael L. Owens are independent within the meaning of the standards for independence set forth in the Company's corporate governance guidelines, which are consistent with the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules and NASDAQ standards.
Executive Sessions of the Independent Directors
The Company's independent directors meet in executive session at each regularly scheduled quarterly meeting of the Board, with the chair of the Compensation Committee serving as chair of such executive sessions. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and regulations of the SEC thereunder, require the Company's executive officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock, as well as certain affiliates of such persons, to file initial reports of such ownership and monthly transaction reports covering any changes in such ownership with the SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers. Executive officers, directors and persons owning more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with all such reports they file. Based on its review of the copies of such reports received by it, the Company believes that, during fiscal year 2018, all filing requirements applicable to its executive officers, directors, and owners of more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock have been met.
Management Succession
Periodically, the Board reviews a succession plan, developed by management, addressing the policies and principles for selecting successors to the Company's executive officers, including the Company's CEO. The succession plan includes an assessment of the experience, performance and skills believed to be desirable for possible successors to the Company's executive officers.
Certain Transactions between the Company and Directors and Officers
The Company's Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee has adopted written policies and procedures concerning the review, approval or ratification of all transactions required to be disclosed under the SEC's Regulation S-K, Rule 404. These policies and procedures cover all related party transactions required to be disclosed under the SEC's rules as well as all material conflict of interest transactions as defined by relevant state law and the rules and regulations of NASDAQ that are applicable to the Company, and require that all such transactions be identified by management and disclosed to the committee for review. If required and appropriate under the circumstances, the committee will consider such transactions for approval or ratification. Full disclosure of the material terms of any such transaction must be made to the committee, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the parties to the transaction and their relationship to the Company, its directors and officers; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the terms of the transaction, including all proposed periodic payments; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the direct or indirect interest of any related parties or any director, officer or associate in the transaction. 
[END TABLE]
To be approved or ratified, the committee must find any such transaction to be fair to the Company. Prior approval of such transactions must be obtained generally, if they are material to the Company. If such transactions are immaterial, such transactions may be ratified and prior approval is not required. Ordinary employment transactions may be ratified.
Certain Related Party Transactions
During its fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, the Company purchased a portion of its product needs in the form of fiber, yarn, and carpet from Engineered Floors, an entity substantially controlled by Robert E. Shaw, a shareholder of the Company. Mr. Shaw has reported holding approximately 7.2% of the Company's Common Stock, which, as of year-end, represented approximately 3.5% of the total vote of all classes of the Company's Common Stock. Engineered Floors is one of several suppliers of such products to the Company. Total purchases from Engineered Floors for 2018 were approximately $8.2 million; or approximately 2.6% of the Company's cost of goods sold in 2018. In accordance with the terms of its charter, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company's supply relationship with Engineered Floors. The dollar value of Mr. Shaw's interest in the transactions with Engineered Floors is not known to the Company. REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed of seven members, each of whom is an independent, non-employee director. The Audit Committee operates under a written Audit Committee Charter adopted and approved by the Board of Directors. The Charter is reviewed at least annually by the Committee. While the Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in its written charter, it is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct audits. This function is conducted by the Company's management and its independent registered public accountants.
The Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 29, 2018 (the "Audited Financial Statements"). In addition, the Committee has discussed with Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP all matters required by applicable auditing standards.
The Committee also has received the written report, disclosure and the letter from Dixon Hughes Goodman required by PCAOB Rule 3526, "Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence", and the Committee has reviewed, evaluated, and discussed with that firm the written report and its independence from the Company. The Committee also has discussed with management of the Company and Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP such other matters and received such assurances from them as the Committee deemed appropriate.
Based on the foregoing review and discussions and relying thereon, the Committee has recommended to the Company's Board of Directors the inclusion of the Company's Audited Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2018, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT
The Board has determined that Michael L. Owens, Chairman of the Audit Committee, is an audit committee financial expert as defined by Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is independent within the meaning of Rule 10A-3(b)(l) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. For a brief list of Mr. Owens' relevant experience, please refer to Mr. Owens' biographical information as set forth in the Election of Directors section of this proxy statement.  Additionally, the Board believes the remaining members of the Audit Committee would qualify as audit committee financial experts, within the meaning of applicable rules, based on each individual's qualification and expertise. COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The Compensation Committee sets compensation for the Company's executive officers, and its decisions are reported to and reviewed by the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee currently consists of three independent directors chosen annually by the Board.
Compensation of the Company's executive officers is intended to be competitive with compensation offered by other companies generally similar to the Company in size and lines of business. In determining what types and levels of compensation to offer, the Committee may review relevant, publicly available data and, from time to time, it may receive advice and information from professional compensation consultants.
The Elements of Executive Officer Compensation
Compensation for each of the Company's executive officers consists generally of base salary, retirement plan benefits and other customary employment benefits, as well as potential cash incentive awards and stock plan awards pursuant to an annual incentive plan reviewed and adopted by the Committee at the beginning of each year. The annual incentive plan is customarily structured so that a significant portion of each executive's potential annual compensation may consist of equity awards, the award value of which is tied to accomplishing both financial and non-financial goals and objectives.
Compensation for 2018.
Effective February 19, 2018, the Compensation Committee selected performance goals and a range of possible incentives for the Company's 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2018 Plan"). Pursuant to the 2018 Plan, each executive officer had the opportunity to earn a Cash Incentive Award, a Primary Long-Term Incentive Award of restricted stock, and an award of restricted stock denominated as "Career Shares." The potential range of cash incentives and conditions to vesting of the restricted stock awards are described below.
No incentive awards were awarded to the Company's executive officers for 2018. Incentive awards earned with respect to results for 2017 were, however, paid in the first quarter of 2018, in accordance with past practice. 
For 2018, each executive officer also received customary retirement plan benefits and other customary employment benefits, as in prior years.
Salary for 2018. The base salaries for the executive officers were not adjusted during 2018. See the 2018 Summary Compensation Table for a tabular presentation of the amount of salary and other compensation elements paid in proportion to total compensation for each named executive officer.
Potential Incentive Awards for 2018. The CEO and all executive officers whose responsibilities primarily relate to corporate level administration had the opportunity to earn a cash payment ranging from 15% to no more than 105% of such executive's base salary (from 45% to 105% for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and from 30% to 90% for the Chief Financial Officer and from 15% to 75% for all other officers). Fifty percent of the amount of the potential award was based on achievement of specified levels of operating income from continuing operations for the Company, as adjusted for unusual items, 30% of the amount was based on achievement of specified levels of operating income of the Company's residential business operations, as adjusted for unusual items, and 20% of the amount was based on achievement of specified levels of the Company's commercial business operating income, as adjusted for unusual items.
Executive officers whose responsibilities primarily relate to one of the Company's business units, had the opportunity to earn a cash payment ranging from 15% to no more than 75% of such participant's base salary. Fifty five percent of the amount was based on achievement of specified levels of their annual business unit operating income, as adjusted for unusual items, 30% was based on the achievement of specified levels of the Company's consolidated operating income, as adjusted for unusual items, and 15% was based on achievement of specified levels of the annual operating income of the Company's other business units, as adjusted for unusual items.
Primary Long-Term Incentive Share Awards and Career Shares Awards for 2018. The incentive plan provided for two possible awards of restricted stock: Primary Long-Term Incentive Share Awards and Career Share Awards. Receipt of the Primary Long-Term Incentive Share Awards was contingent on the Company's achievement of minimum levels of adjusted operating income and, in the case of Career Share Awards was contingent on the Company's having a profitable operating income, as adjusted.
The Primary Long-Term Incentive Share Award was designed as a possible award of restricted shares, in value equal to no more than 35% of the executive's base salary as of the beginning of 2018 plus any cash incentive award paid for such year.  Any Primary Long-Term Incentive Share Awards, if earned, vest ratably over three years.
Career Shares were designed as a possible award of restricted stock valued at 20% of each executive officer's base salary as of the beginning of the year, excluding the Company's Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The level of career share awards was set at 35% and 30%, respectively, of the Chief Operating Officer's and Chief Financial Officer's base salary for 2018. In accordance with past practice, any such award, if earned, would be granted in 2019. For participants age 61 or older, the Career Share Awards vest ratably over two years from the date of the grant. For the participants age 60 or younger, shares vest ratably over five years from the date of grant after the participant reaches age 61.
 Additionally, all Share Awards are subject to vesting or forfeiture under certain conditions as follows: death, disability or a change in control will result in immediate vesting of all Share Awards; termination without cause will also result in immediate vesting of all Career Share Awards and in immediate vesting of that portion of Long-Term Incentive Share Awards that have been expensed; voluntary termination of employment prior to retirement, or termination for cause will result in forfeiture of all unvested awards; to the extent that the Company has recognized compensation expense related to the shares subject to the awards, such amounts vest at retirement age and are paid out by March 15th of the subsequent year.
All awards of restricted stock are subject to a $5.00 minimum price per share when determining the number of shares awarded. The Compensation Committee retained the discretion to reduce any award by up to 30% of the amount otherwise earned based on the participant's failure to achieve individual performance goals set by the committee.
No 2018 Incentive Awards. No awards were granted under the 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan.
Incentive Compensation Applicable to 2019. Following year-end, the Committee adopted an incentive plan for 2019 providing for possible cash incentive awards and restricted stock awards in the form of Long-Term Incentive Share Awards and Career Share awards, as in prior years, and similar in structure to the annual plan adopted for 2018. Any such awards, if earned, will be paid, in the case of the cash award, or granted, in the case of the restricted stock awards, in March 2020.
Retirement Plans and Other Benefits. The Company's compensation for its executive officers also includes the opportunity to participate in two retirement plans, one qualified and one non-qualified for federal tax purposes, and certain health insurance, life insurance, relocation allowances, and other benefits. Such benefits are designed to be similar to the benefits available to other exempt, salaried associates of the Company, and to be comparable to and competitive with benefits offered by businesses with which the Company competes for executive talent.
Executive officers may elect to contribute a limited amount of their compensation to the qualified plan and make deferrals into the non-qualified plan (up to 90% of total compensation). Although the plans permit the Company to make discretionary contributions in an aggregate amount equal to up to 3% of the executive officer's cash compensation, for 2018 the Company made a contribution of 1% to the qualified plan, while no Company contributions were made to the non-qualified plan.
In 2015, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Daniel K. Frierson, was awarded a 100,000 share retention grant with both a continued service condition and a performance condition. The performance condition was not met at the year end of 2018, and in accordance with the terms of the award, it was forfeited. 
Compensation Considerations for 2018 and 2019. The tax effect of possible forms of compensation on the Company and on the executive officers is a factor considered in determining types of compensation to be awarded. Similarly, the accounting treatment accorded various types of compensation may be an important factor used to determine the form of compensation. The deductibility, for tax purposes, of compensation paid to named executive officers is subject to limits imposed by Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Annual compensation exceeding $1 million is non-deductible. Accordingly, all compensation in excess of $1 million paid to any of the Company's named executive officers (and the Chief Financial Officer) in any given year will be non-deductible. 
The Company held a "Say on Pay" vote at its annual meeting in 2018.  At that meeting, in excess of 98% of the votes were cast "For" approval of our executive compensation as described in the Proxy Statement for that meeting. The Committee intends to consider these results as part of its ongoing review of executive compensation.
Termination Benefits. Upon a Participant's reaching retirement age (as defined in the plan), all Long-Term Incentive Plan and Career Share restricted stock awards vest to the extent such awards have been expensed in the Company's financial statements. As of year-end, Daniel K. Frierson, and Mr. E. David Hobbs were the only Named Executive Officers eligible for retirement in accordance with the terms of the restricted stock awards. If Mr. Frierson had retired at year end, the number of shares subject to such awards that would have vested and the value of such shares would have been 22,359 shares and $15,652. If Mr. Hobbs had retired at year end, the number of shares subject to such awards that would have vested and the value of such shares would have been 7,664 shares and $5,365. For purposes of valuing the foregoing awards, the Company used the year-end market value of the Company's Common Stock, which was $0.70/share. Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, set forth above, with management.
Based on our review and the discussions we held with management, we have recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company's Proxy Materials.
Respectfully submitted,

 PROPOSAL TWO
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
As required under recent amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our stockholders may cast an advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, as described in this proxy statement.
Our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate, and retain our Named Executive Officers, who are critical to our success. Please read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis for additional details about our executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal 2018 compensation of our Named Executive Officers.
We are asking our Shareholders to indicate their approval of our Named Executive Officer compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our Named Executive Officers' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our Named Executive Officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement.
We recommend that stockholders vote, on an advisory basis, "FOR" the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as discussed and disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the executive compensation tables and related narrative executive compensation disclosure in this proxy statement."
The above resolution will be deemed to be approved if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast on Proposal Two at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered to be votes cast and, accordingly, will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. As this vote is an advisory vote, the outcome is not binding on us with respect to future executive compensation decisions, including those relating to our named executive officers. Our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee, however, value the opinions of our stockholders, and to the extent there is any significant vote against the Named Executive Officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, the Compensation Committee will consider our stockholders' concerns and will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.
The Board of Directors recommends that the Company's shareholders vote FOR the approval of Proposal Two.
PROPOSAL THREE
ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF FUTURE ADVISORY SAY-ON-PAY VOTES
Our stockholders also have the opportunity to indicate how frequently we should seek an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. By voting on Proposal Three, stockholders may indicate whether they would prefer an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation once every one, two, or three years. You will have the opportunity to vote on this issue at least once every six years.
Our Board of Directors has determined that an advisory vote on executive compensation that occurs every year is the most appropriate alternative for our company. Accordingly, our Board of Directors recommends that you vote for a one-year interval for the advisory vote on executive compensation.
You may cast your vote on your preferred voting frequency by choosing the option of one year, two years, or three years. You may also abstain from voting. The option that receives the highest number of advisory votes by shareholders will be the frequency for the advisory vote on executive compensation deemed to have been selected by stockholders. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote.
As the vote is advisory and not binding, the Board of Directors may decide that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation more or less frequently than the option selected by our shareholders (but not less often than once every three years). However, we value the opinions of our shareholders and will consider the outcome of the advisory vote in deciding how often to hold the advisory vote on executive compensation in future years.
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the frequency of the say-on-pay advisory vote to be "one year". PROPOSAL FOUR
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS FOR 2019
The firm of Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP served as independent registered public accountants for the Company for fiscal year 2018. Subject to ratification of its decision by the Company's shareholders, the Company has selected the firm of Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP to serve as its independent registered public accountants for its 2019 fiscal year. A representative of Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if he so desires and to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders.
The Board of Directors recommends that that the Company's shareholders vote FOR Proposal Four.
In the event that the Company's shareholders do not ratify the selection of Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP as independent registered public accountants for fiscal 2019, the Board of Directors will consider other alternatives, including appointment of another firm to serve as independent registered public accountants for fiscal 2019.
