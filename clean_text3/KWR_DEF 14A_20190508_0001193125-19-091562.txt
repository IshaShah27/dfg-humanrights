Proxy Statement 
This proxy statement is being furnished to our shareholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of our Board of Directors for use at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and at any and all adjournments of the meeting, for the purpose of considering and acting upon the matters referred to in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and which are discussed below. The Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held at our headquarters, located at One Quaker Park, 901 E. Hector Street, Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428, at 8:30 A.M., local time, on May 8, 2019. The terms "we," "our," "us," the "Company" and "Quaker," as used in this proxy statement, refer to Quaker Chemical Corporation. 
This proxy statement, the accompanying form of proxy and a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 are first being mailed to our shareholders on or about April 3, 2019. 
Information Concerning the Annual Meeting 
What matters will be voted on at the meeting? 
At the meeting, shareholders will vote on three proposals and any other business properly brought before the meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Election of three nominees to serve on our Board of Directors;  
• Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to implement a majority voting standard for uncontested elections  of directors; and  
• Ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for  2019.  
[END TABLE]
How does the Board recommend I vote on the proposals? 
The Board recommends that you vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR each of the three nominees named in this proxy statement;  
• FOR approval of an Amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, as amended; and  
• FOR the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm  for 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Who is entitled to vote? 
Shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 4, 2019, the record date for the meeting, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting and any adjournments of the meeting. 
How do I cast my vote if I am a shareholder of record? 
You can cast your vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in person, by attending the Annual Meeting of Shareholders;  
• via the Internet, by visiting www.proxyvote.com and following the instructions provided;  
• by telephone, using the toll-free number listed on the proxy card; or  
• by mail, if you mark, sign and date the proxy card enclosed with this proxy statement, and return it in the postage-paid  envelope provided.  
[END TABLE]
How do I cast my vote if I am a beneficial owner of shares held in street name? 
You can cast your vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in person, by first obtaining a voting instruction form issued in your name from your broker and bringing that voting  instruction form to the meeting, together with a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date and valid identification;  
• via the Internet, by visiting www.proxyvote.com and following the instructions provided;  
• by telephone by using the toll-free number found on the voting instruction form; or  
• by mail, if you mark, sign and date the voting instruction form and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided by your  broker.  
[END TABLE]
If I have given a proxy, can I revoke that proxy? 
Your presence at the meeting will not in itself revoke any proxy you may have given. If your shares are held in your own name (i.e., you are the shareholder of record), you may revoke your proxy at any time (to the extent it has not already been voted at the meeting), but a revocation will not be effective until it is received. Your proxy will be revoked (to the extent it has not already been voted at the meeting) if you: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• give written notice of the revocation to Quaker's Corporate Secretary, Robert T. Traub, One Quaker Park, 901 E. Hector  Street, Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428, or give electronic notice to Mr. Traub at traubr@quakerchem.com;  
• submit a properly signed proxy with a later date; or  
• vote in person at the meeting as described above.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in street name through a broker, bank or other nominee for your benefit, you should contact the record holder to obtain instructions if you wish to revoke your vote before the meeting. 
How will my proxy be voted? 
If you are a registered holder and your proxy is properly executed, returned and received before the meeting and is not revoked, it will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If you return your signed proxy but do not mark the boxes to show how you wish to vote on a proposal, the shares for which you have given your proxy will, in the absence of your instructions to the contrary, be voted as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 1: "FOR" the election of each of the three nominees named in this proxy statement to serve on our Board  of Directors;  
• Proposal 2: "FOR" approval of an Amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, as amended;   
• Proposal 3: "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered  public accounting firm for 2019; and  
• In the discretion of the proxies on other matters properly brought before the meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in street name through a broker, bank or other nominee for your benefit and your voting instruction form is properly executed, returned and received before the meeting and is not revoked, it will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If you have not furnished voting instructions within a specified period before the meeting, under current New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules, brokerage firms and nominees that are members of the NYSE may vote their customers' unvoted shares on "routine" matters but not on non-routine matters. Under the NYSE rules, routine matters include the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm but do not include the other proposals on the ballot. 
The voting instruction form also grants the proxy holders discretionary authority to vote on any other business that may properly come before the meeting as well as any procedural matters. As of the date of this proxy statement, we do not know of any other matters that will be presented at the meeting.

        PROXY STATEMENT          
[END TABLE]
What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card? 
If you hold your shares in more than one account or with more than one broker and/or our transfer agent, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please complete and return each of the proxy cards you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted. 
How many votes are required to approve each proposal, and what are the effects of abstentions and broker non-votes? 
The following table summarizes the vote required for approval of each proposal and the effect on the outcome of the vote of abstentions, uninstructed shares held by brokers (which result in broker non-votes when a beneficial owner of shares held in street name does not provide voting instructions and, as a result, under the NYSE rules, the institution that holds the shares may not vote those shares on certain proposals) and signed but unmarked proxy cards.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Abstentions and broker non-votes are included in determining whether a quorum is  present.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  If you are the shareholder of record and complete your proxy card properly, but do not provide instructions on your proxy  card as to how to vote your shares, your shares will be voted as shown in this column and in accordance with the judgment of the individuals named as proxies on the proxy card as to any other matter properly brought before the annual meeting.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Under Section 1103 of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended, abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as "votes cast." The "majority of votes cast" standard for approval requires that the number of votes cast "for" the proposal exceed the number of votes cast  "against" the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
What if a director nominee is unwilling or unable to serve? 
We do not expect that to occur. If it does, proxies will be voted for a substitute director nominee designated by our Board of Directors. 
Are dissenters' rights applicable to any of the matters to be voted on at the meeting? 
No. Dissenters' rights do not apply to any of the matters to be voted on at the meeting. 
Who will count the vote? 
The Judge of Election appointed at the meeting, together with a representative of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., will serve as the inspector of election. 
How many shares can be voted at the meeting and what is the total number of votes that can be cast? 
As of March 4, 2019, the record date for the meeting, 13,332,871 shares of Quaker common stock were issued and outstanding. Every holder of Quaker common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held of record on the record date; therefore, at the annual meeting, a maximum of 13,332,871 votes can be cast. 
How many votes may I cast at the meeting? 
You will be entitled to cast one vote for each share of common stock you held on March 4, 2019, the record date for the meeting. 
What is a "quorum"? 
The presence of shareholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on a particular matter will constitute a "quorum" for the purpose of considering that matter. For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, the votes of a shareholder will be counted if the shareholder is present in person or by proxy. Shares that are the subject of abstentions or broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining a quorum. 
Who can attend the Annual Meeting? 
All shareholders of Quaker who owned shares of record on March 4, 2019 may attend the meeting. If you want to vote in person and you hold Quaker common stock in street name (i.e., your shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee), you must obtain a proxy card issued in your name from your broker and bring that proxy card to the meeting, together with a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date and valid identification. If you hold stock in street name and want to attend the meeting but not vote in person at the meeting, you must bring a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date and valid identification. 
How will voting on any other business be conducted? 
We do not know of any business to be considered at the meeting other than the proposals described in this proxy statement. However, if any other business is properly presented at the meeting, the proxy being solicited by the Board of Directors will give authority to Michael F. Barry and Robert T. Traub to vote on such matters at their discretion and they intend to do so in accordance with their best judgment. 
Who will pay the cost of this proxy solicitation and how will the solicitation be conducted? 
We will pay the expenses of soliciting proxies in the form included with this proxy statement, including the cost of preparing, assembling and mailing material in connection with the solicitation. In addition to the use of the mail, our directors, executive officers and employees may, without additional compensation, solicit proxies by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail and personal contact. We will also reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy materials and Quaker's Annual Report on Form 10-K, to any beneficial holder of Quaker common stock. 
Does the Company utilize "householding" for mailing of its proxy materials? 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") permits companies and intermediaries (such as brokers and banks) to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivery of a single proxy statement and annual report to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," is intended to reduce the volume 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        PROXY STATEMENT          
        PROXY STATEMENT          
[END TABLE]
 of duplicate information shareholders receive and also reduce expenses for companies. Quaker has instituted householding for its registered shareholders; some intermediaries may also be householding Quaker's proxy materials and annual report. Once you have received notice from the Company, your broker or another intermediary that they will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you or another shareholder who shares your address provides contrary instructions. 
If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement and annual report, you should contact Victoria K. Gehris, Assistant Secretary, at 1-610-832-4246, or inform her in writing at Quaker Chemical Corporation, Shareholder Services, One Quaker Park, 901 E. Hector Street, Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428. If you hold shares through an intermediary and no longer wish to participate in householding, you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee record holder. 
Shareholders who share an address and are receiving multiple copies of annual reports or proxy statements but would like to receive a single copy can contact Victoria K. Gehris at the telephone number or address noted above. 
We undertake to deliver promptly to any shareholder at a shared address, upon written or oral request, a copy of Quaker's proxy statement and annual report. You may request these documents by calling the telephone number or writing to the address noted above. 
Proposal 1 – Election of Directors and Nominee Biographies 
What is the makeup of the Board of Directors? 
The Quaker Articles of Incorporation divide our Board of Directors into three classes, each consisting, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the directors. The shareholders elect the members of one class each year to serve for a term of three years. Directors elected to fill vacancies and newly created directorships serve for the balance of the term of the class to which they are elected. Currently, there are eight directors, two directors in Class I, and three directors in each of Class II and Class III. The current terms of the Class III directors expire at the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. At the 2019 annual meeting, three Class III directors are to be elected with each member to serve a three-year term expiring in 2022 and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. 
Are there any members of the class of directors to be elected at the meeting who are not standing for reelection? 
No. 
Who are the Board's nominees this year? 
Messrs. Mark A. Douglas and William H. Osborne, and Ms. Fay West are the nominees for election to the Board of Directors as Class III members. Each nominee, if elected, would hold office until our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.

Corporate Governance 
Leadership Structure 
Quaker's business is conducted by its officers, managers and associates under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and with oversight by the Board of Directors. The Company's CEO is also the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Board has long held that, given Quaker's size and management structure, it is best to combine the roles of Chairman of the Board and CEO. The Board believes having one leader serving as both Chairman and CEO provides decisive and effective leadership. 
The Board of Directors has also appointed an independent Lead Director. The Lead Director rotates on a biennial basis unless the Board determines that the reappointment of the Lead Director at the end of a two-year term is in the best interests of the Company. The Lead Director serves as the liaison between the Chairman/CEO and the Board of Directors. The Lead Director also ensures that the respective responsibilities of the directors and the Chairman/CEO are understood; collaborates with the Chairman/CEO to ensure the appropriate flow of information to the Board; works with the Chairman/CEO to develop the agendas for Board meetings; coordinates and develops the agenda for and presides over sessions of the Board's independent directors; ensures appropriate minutes are kept of such meetings and, as appropriate, communicates to the Chairman/CEO the substance of such discussions. Mr. Donald R. Caldwell is currently the Lead Director, having been reappointed to the position for a two-year term on May 9, 2018. 
Director Independence 
In accordance with NYSE rules, the Board affirmatively determines the independence of each director and nominee for election as a director in accordance with guidelines it has adopted which include all elements of independence set forth in the NYSE listing standards. The Company's director independence standards are described in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
On an annual basis, each director and executive officer is obligated to disclose, among other things, any transactions with the Company in which the director (or any organization of which the director is a partner, shareholder or officer) or executive officer, or any member of his or her immediate family, have a direct or indirect material interest. Based on the Company's adopted independence standards and the information provided by the directors, the Board determined at its meeting held on February 26, 2019, that all non-employee directors who served in fiscal 2018, as well as each nominee for director and those non-employee directors who will continue to serve after our 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, are independent within our guidelines and have no material relationship with the Company as defined by our guidelines. The Company's independent non-employee directors are Donald R. Caldwell, Robert E. Chappell, Mark A. Douglas, Jeffry D. Frisby, William H. Osborne, Robert H. Rock and Fay West. William R. Cook, who served on the Board in 2018 until his retirement on May 9, 2018, was also an independent non-employee director. 
Based on the Company's independence standards, the Board has affirmatively determined that Michael F. Barry is not independent because he currently serves as an executive officer of the Company. There are no family relationships between any of the Quaker directors, executive officers or nominees for election as directors. 
Governance Committee Procedures for Selecting Director Nominees 
The Governance Committee's goal is to assemble a Board that brings to Quaker a variety of perspectives and skills derived from high quality business and professional experience. The current composition of the Board includes directors (including those nominated for reelection this year) with complementary skills, expertise and experience such that the Board, on the whole, has competence and experience in a wide range of areas. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        CORPORATE GOVERNANCE          
        CORPORATE GOVERNANCE          
[END TABLE]
Quaker's Board includes eight directors who are or have served as chief executive officers or in other senior management roles, six directors with specialized accounting and finance knowledge, three directors with experience in the chemical industry or other technology or science areas, seven directors who have served on the boards of other public companies, eight directors with international business experience and four directors with experience in industries served by Quaker. The Governance Committee will continue to evaluate the needs of Quaker and its shareholders to ensure that the competency of the Board, as a whole, is relevant and robust. 
In evaluating director nominees, the Governance Committee considers the appropriate size of Quaker's Board of Directors and the needs of Quaker and its shareholders with respect to the particular talents, experience and capacities of its directors, including: experience in industries similar to Quaker's; managerial and other leadership experience; business acumen and other particular expertise; business development experience; strategic capability; independence of judgment; familiarity with corporate governance and the responsibilities of directors and the ability to fulfill those responsibilities; standing and reputation as a person of integrity; the potential contribution of each individual to the diversity of backgrounds, experience and competencies that the Governance Committee desires to have represented; and ability to work constructively with the CEO and the Board. In considering nominees for the Board of Directors, the Governance Committee considers the entirety of each candidate's credentials and the anticipated contributions of the individual as a member of the Board. 
Under Quaker's Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors who also serve as CEOs or in equivalent positions should not serve concurrently on more than three other boards of public companies in addition to the Quaker Board, and directors who do not serve as CEOs or in equivalent positions should not serve concurrently on more than four other boards of public companies in addition to the Quaker Board. Under the listing standards of the NYSE, without specific approval from the Board, no member of the Audit Committee may serve on more than two public company audit committees in addition to Quaker's Audit Committee. The Board has determined that Mr. Caldwell's simultaneous service on the audit committees of more than two public companies in addition to Quaker's does not impair his ability to effectively serve on Quaker's Audit Committee. 
When identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the Governance Committee first examines whether current members of the Board are willing to continue their service. Current members of the Board with skills and experience that are relevant and who are willing to continue to serve are considered for renomination, balancing the value of continuity of service with that of obtaining a new perspective. If a current member does not choose to stand for reelection, the Governance Committee will not recommend that director for reelection. If the Governance Committee recommends an increase in the membership of the Board, it will identify the experience and personal capacities desired and will seek suggestions as to nominees from the current Board membership. In addition, and as has been done in the past, the Governance Committee may engage third parties to assist in the identification or evaluation of potential director nominees.

Although we do not have a formal policy regarding diversity and do not have constituent or representative directors, diversity is one important factor, among many, in our nomination process. The Governance Committee considers a variety of factors, including age, gender, race, executive and professional experience, and perspectives of the candidate and how the candidate's qualifications will enhance the composition of the Board of Directors as a whole. 
All but one of our directors are independent and our Board has a mix of relatively newer and longer-tenured directors. The charts below show board makeup by various characteristics: 
Shareholder Nominations and Recommendations 
The Company's Restated By-Laws ("By-Laws") describe how shareholders may nominate candidates for election to our Board of Directors. For our 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, shareholders may nominate a candidate for election to our Board only by sending written notice to our Corporate Secretary at our principal office at One Quaker Park, 901 E. Hector Street, Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428. This notice must be received on or before February 8, 2020, but no earlier than January 9, 2020 (except that if the date of the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the anniversary date of the 2019 annual meeting, this notice must be received no earlier than the close of business on the 120th day before the date of the 2020 annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day before the date of the 2020 annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of the 2020 annual meeting is less than 100 days before the date of the meeting, by the 10th day after the public announcement). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        CORPORATE GOVERNANCE          
        CORPORATE GOVERNANCE          
[END TABLE]
The notice to our Corporate Secretary must contain or be accompanied by the information required by Sections 3.15 and 2.13 of our By-Laws, including, among other things: (i) the name, age, principal occupation and business and residence address of each person nominated; (ii) the class and number of shares of our stock which are directly or indirectly owned beneficially and/or of record by each person nominated; (iii) the name and record address of the shareholder making the nomination and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made; (iv) the class and number of shares of our stock which are directly or indirectly owned beneficially and/or of record by the shareholder making the nomination and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made; (v) a description of any direct and indirect compensation and other monetary agreements, arrangements and understandings, and any other material relationships (including any familial relationships) between the shareholder giving notice (and the beneficial owner) and the nominee and any respective affiliates, associates or others with whom any of them are acting; and (vi) a description of any hedging or other transaction that has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement or understanding (including, without limitation, any put, short position or any borrowing or lending of shares) that has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk of share price changes for, or to increase or decrease the voting power of, the shareholder or any shareholder associated person (as defined in the By-Laws) with respect to any share of our stock, as well as certain other information. This list of required information is not exhaustive. A copy of the full text of the relevant By-Law provisions, which includes the complete list of all information that must be submitted to nominate a director, may be obtained upon written request directed to our Corporate Secretary at our principal office. A copy of our By-Laws is also posted on the Investor Relations/Corporate Governance section of our website at https://www.quakerchem.com. 
In addition to a shareholder's ability to nominate candidates to serve on our Board as described above, shareholders also may recommend to the Governance Committee a prospective nominee for its consideration. The Governance Committee will consider timely recommendations received from shareholders regarding director nominee candidates and accompanied by sufficient information to enable the Governance Committee to assess the candidate's qualifications, along with confirmation of the candidate's consent to serve as a director if elected. Such recommendations should be sent to our Corporate Secretary at our principal office. Any recommendation received from a shareholder after January 1 of any year is not assured of being considered for nomination in that year. The Governance Committee applies the same criteria in evaluating candidates nominated by shareholders as it does in evaluating candidates identified by Company sources. No shareholder or group of shareholders recommended a director nominee for election at Quaker's 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. 
Board Oversight of Risk 
While the Board has the ultimate oversight responsibility for risk management, consistent with Quaker's By-Laws, the Board has delegated much of the responsibility for risk management to the standing Committees of the Board. The Audit Committee has oversight over financial risks, such as financial reporting and internal controls; compliance risks, including oversight of the compliance program and disposition of certain complaints and/or violations of the Code of Conduct and Financial Code of Ethics; and operational risk, such as loss of property, cyber-security, business interruption and other exposures traditionally mitigated through insurance products. 
In addition, the Compensation/Management Development Committee is responsible for developing a balanced compensation system for all employees, including appropriate long-term and short-term incentive compensation targets that encourage a level of risk-taking behavior consistent with the overall financial/strategic goals of the Company, as well as oversight of the management, development and succession processes. Finally, from time to time, Quaker faces other risks material to its business and, in those circumstances, the Board (or at times, the Executive Committee) is regularly informed and provides input and advice on actions being considered to mitigate exposures associated with those risks. As appropriate, the Board considers specific risk topics, including risks associated with our strategic plan, our capital structure and our development activities. Further, the Board is routinely informed of developments at and affecting the Company that could affect our risk profile or other aspects of our business through reports from our business units and otherwise. This oversight by the Board is designed to maintain an appropriate level of risk and to address new risks as they arise. 
Communications with the Board of Directors; Corporate Governance Guidelines 
Shareholders or other interested parties may communicate with any of our directors, including non-management directors, by writing to them c/o Robert T. Traub, Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, at the address set forth above. All communications received will be forwarded to the Governance Committee and the addressee. The Board believes it is management's role to speak for Quaker and, accordingly, any such communication received will be shared with the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers, as appropriate. The Company has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines and other governance materials. Our Code of Conduct, Financial Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, Corporate Governance Guidelines and Audit, Compensation/Management Development and Governance Committee Charters have been posted on and are available free of charge by accessing the Investor Relations/Corporate Governance section of our website at https://www.quakerchem.com or by written request addressed to Quaker Chemical Corporation, One Quaker Park, 901 E. Hector Street, Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428, Attention: Victoria K. Gehris, Assistant Secretary.

Code of Conduct 
The Company has a compliance program, the governing documents of which include a Code of Conduct (which is applicable to all of the Company's directors, executive officers and employees) and a Financial Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers (which is applicable to the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Global Controller, Senior Treasury Analyst, each Controller at majority-owned affiliates, Assistant Controller, and other individuals performing similar functions designated by the Board). The Company's compliance program embodies the Company's global principles and practices relating to the ethical conduct of the Company's business and its longstanding commitment to fairness, honesty, integrity and full Company compliance with all laws affecting the Company's business. 
The Company's compliance program includes a means for employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and other interested parties to submit confidential and anonymous reports of suspected or actual violations of the Company's Code of Conduct or the Financial Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers relating, among other things, to:

Meetings and Committees of the Board 
Our Board of Directors has four standing committees, the Audit, Compensation/Management Development, Executive and Governance Committees. Each member of the Audit, Compensation/Management Development and Governance Committee is independent as defined for members of the respective committee in the listing standards of the NYSE and Quaker's Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Audit Committee is established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"). The Board has affirmatively determined that three of the four members of the Audit Committee, including its current Chair, Fay West, meet the criteria for an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC and that William H. Osborne, although not currently a member of the Audit Committee, also meets this financial expert criteria. The Board of Directors has adopted a charter for each of these committees other than the Executive Committee. Each committee reports its actions to the full Board at the Board's next regular meeting. A summary of the principal duties of each committee follows the table below.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
The individuals who served as members of the Compensation/Management Development Committee during the year ended December 31, 2018 are Robert H. Rock (Chair), Donald R. Caldwell, Jeffry D. Frisby and William H. Osborne, each of whom is an "independent" director. No member of the Compensation/Management Development Committee was, during 2018, or had previously been, an officer or employee of Quaker or its subsidiaries nor had any material interest in a transaction with Quaker or a business relationship with, or any indebtedness to, Quaker, in each case that would require disclosure under applicable rules of the SEC. During 2018, no executive officer of Quaker served as a director or a member of the compensation committee of another company, one of whose executive officers served as a member of Quaker's Board of Directors or Compensation/Management Development Committee. 
Proposal 2 – Approval of an Amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, as amended 
On February 26, 2019, the Board of Directors voted unanimously to submit for shareholder approval a proposed amendment (the "Amendment") to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, as amended, intended to enhance the Company's corporate governance. The Amendment, if approved, will implement a majority voting standard in the election of directors in uncontested elections. The Board of Directors has declared the Amendment to be advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and recommends that the shareholders approve the Amendment. 
Currently, even in uncontested elections, directors are elected by a plurality vote pursuant to applicable law. This means that if three directors are nominated, for example, the three nominees receiving the most "for" votes would be elected or re-elected, even if one of those nominees only received one vote in favor of election. 
Upon implementation of a majority voting standard, a nominee must receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that nominee. Each shareholder would be entitled to only one vote per share for each nominee in an uncontested election of directors and each director nominee would be voted upon separately. Abstentions and broker non-votes would not be counted as votes cast. Under the Amendment, if an incumbent director who is a candidate for re-election is not elected, the director will be deemed to have tendered his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board of Directors on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken, and the Board of Directors will be required to act on the Governance Committee's recommendation and disclose its decision and the rationale for the decision. 
The adoption of a majority voting standard is consistent with the Company's desire to more closely align the interests of the shareholders with the accountability of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors believes the Amendment is in the shareholders' long-term best interests and would help ensure that each director represents the interests of all shareholders, rather than a minority shareholder or special constituency. 
This summary of the Amendment is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Amendment, which is included in the Articles of Amendment attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. The current Articles of Incorporation, including the most recent previous Amendment dated September 7, 2017, can be found as Exhibits 3(i)(a) and 3(i)(b) of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2019, incorporated by reference from their initial filings on Current Reports on Form 8-K filed July 31, 2013 and September 11, 2017, respectively. 
If the Amendment is approved, it will become effective upon the filing of Articles of Amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation with the Department of State of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast by the Company's shareholders at the Annual Meeting is required for approval of this Proposal 2. Abstentions or broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of an Amendment for the Company's Articles of Incorporation, as amended. 
Executive Compensation 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Introduction 
The purpose of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis section is to explain to shareholders how and why compensation decisions are made for the executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table below. When we use the term "executive officers," we mean the Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2018, who are Michael F. Barry, Mary Dean Hall, D. Jeffry Benoliel, Wilbert Platzer and Joseph A. Berquist, as well as the Company's other senior officers. 
Executive Summary 
Quaker's Compensation/Management Development Committee (the "Committee") has implemented executive compensation programs designed to reward performance. The Company is engaged in a highly specialized business with a broad global footprint, requiring a management team with specific skills and knowledge. The Committee believes that our compensation programs must be competitive in order to attract and retain high-performing executives with the requisite skill set and performance orientation. 
In fiscal 2018, Quaker's executive team successfully managed the Company to post record sales, record cash flow from operating activities, and record non-GAAP earnings and adjusted EBITDA results. Net sales increased by 6% over the prior year, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share increased by 21% as compared to fiscal 2017. Cash flow from operating activities increased by 22%, and the Company's adjusted EBITDA increased 9% year-over-year to a record $125.6 million, exceeding $100 million for the fourth year in a row and for only the fourth time in Company history. Our average stock price in 2018 was $168.20 per share compared to $142.29 per share in the prior year and $94.74 per share in 2016, an almost $26 increase over prior year and another record share price. 
In this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, we refer to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. A full discussion of our use of non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA to enhance a reader's understanding of the financial performance of the Company, and a reconciliation of these measures to earnings per diluted share and net income, respectively, can be found on pages 30 to 33 in "Non-GAAP Measures" of Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, provided with this proxy statement. 
In making decisions about fiscal 2018 salaries and performance targets, the Committee also considered fiscal 2017 corporate performance. Factors affecting the key components of our executive compensation programs for fiscal 2018 were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted Net Income. Adjusted net income is a key metric for the corporate component of the Company's annual cash  incentive awards (the adjustments to net income for purposes of setting these targets are explained in greater detail below). Performance with respect to this metric for fiscal 2018 was well above target level and resulted in a payout representing  66% of the maximum payment for the corporate component of the total annual cash incentive awards for the Named Executive Officers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Quaker's Stock Performance. Long-term incentives make up a significant portion of each of the Named Executive  Officers' compensation. In order to align the Named Executive Officers' incentives with our shareholder returns, the value to be earned on our long-term awards is directly linked to the performance of our stock. The equity component of  these incentives is tied to stock performance and the amount payable on our cash awards is based on our total shareholder return (which we define as the year-over-year stock price increase or decrease plus dividends paid) as compared to a specific  peer group. Our Named Executive

        COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Officers' long-term incentive compensation for 2018 comprised of equity awards was slightly higher than in 2017, and the cash component paid out at a similar rate as compared to the prior  three years. For the cash component of this long-term incentive, Quaker's three-year total shareholder return of 168% resulted in a peer group ranking at the 98th percentile. This three-year  total shareholder return resulted in a cash payout of 100% of the maximum amount provided for the three-year period ended in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Benchmarking. Based on our review of competitive benchmarking for compensation and our results of operations in 2017, we  rewarded our Named Executive Officers with salary and/or incentive compensation increases in 2018 as described further below.  
[END TABLE]
Quaker's overall compensation strategy and specific programs have not changed over the past several years as we have strived to maintain a consistent year-over-year approach to ensure that our compensation remains predictable and competitive to the market, as well as fair and reasonable. In particular, we have continued to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Use benchmarks for total direct compensation and long-term compensation to mitigate the possibility of inappropriate risk  taking on the part of executives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align senior level compensation with the long-term success of the Company by ensuring that the higher the position within  management the more compensation is incentive-pay dependent and the more incentive pay is long-term oriented; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reward long-term performance with cash compensation measured by total shareholder return and stock-based compensation in  order to align the interests of management directly with our shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
Consistent with this approach, we have sought and have received approval from our shareholders regarding incentive plans that are used to attract, motivate, retain and reward our executives. In fact, when two of our incentive plans were presented to the shareholders for approval at the 2016 annual meeting of shareholders, they overwhelmingly approved both plans. 
The Committee continually reviews our executive compensation programs to ensure they achieve the desired goals of aligning our compensation practices to performance and pay practices in the Company's industry and prudent risk taking to achieve sustainable shareholder value creation. The Committee has again determined that the Company's current compensation programs are not likely to encourage excessive risk taking because the metrics in the Company's compensation plans are linked to corporate performance as it relates to set budgetary targets and because the plans are measured against identified peer comparison groups. 
In addition, at the Company's 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, the shareholders overwhelmingly voted, on an advisory basis, to approve the Company's compensation of our Named Executive Officers. At the same 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, the shareholders also voted to recommend an advisory vote on the Company's compensation once every three years and the Company has followed this recommendation. Given the significant level of support received in the 2017 advisory vote, the Board of Directors and Committee have not made any material changes to our executive compensation policies and decisions since that time. 
General Philosophy 
Quaker, like many companies of similar size, relies on a small group of managers who have the requisite skills and knowledge to enable us to achieve our business strategies, operate as a globally integrated whole and deliver value to our shareholders. 
To attract and retain talented senior level managers, we have adopted a compensation approach that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provides opportunities for highly competitive levels of total compensation when merited by performance;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• creates incentives to perform over a multiple-year period; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• aligns interests of the management team with those of our shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
Quaker compensates its executive officers (who for 2018 include our Chairman, CEO and President and our vice presidents) through a total compensation package. This package consists of a mix of base salary, an annual cash incentive bonus, long-term incentives comprising both equity awards and cash payments and a competitive benefits package comprising medical, life, disability and retirement using both qualified and non-qualified programs, where appropriate. 
Administrative Practices 
The Committee is responsible for overseeing and developing the compensation and management development programs for the Company. Consistent with its charter, the Committee is composed solely of "independent" members of our Board of Directors under our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the listing standards of the NYSE. Four members of our Board, Donald R. Caldwell, Jeffry D. Frisby, William H. Osborne and Robert H. Rock (Chair) currently sit on the Committee. The Committee's responsibilities include the evaluation of, approval of, and recommendation to Quaker's Board of Directors with respect to the plans, policies and programs related to the compensation of the Company's executive officers and, in the Committee's discretion, the engagement of an outside compensation consultant. The Committee works closely with members of management in fulfilling its duties. Management provides the necessary information and coordinates with the Committee's outside consultants, when appropriate, to ensure that the Committee is sufficiently informed when taking action or recommending action on compensation matters. As discussed below, benchmarking data is used prior to making any such decisions. The Committee's charter describes in full the Committee's authority, responsibilities and specific powers and can be accessed on the Company's website at https://www.quakerchem.com under the heading Investors/Corporate Governance. 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code") precludes Quaker from taking a Federal income tax deduction for compensation paid in excess of $1 million to certain of our executive officers. While the Committee generally attempts to structure the compensation paid to executive officers so that it is fully deductible for Federal income tax purposes, the Committee believes that the primary purpose of our compensation is to support Quaker's business strategy and the long-term interests of Quaker's shareholders. Accordingly, the Committee may choose to provide compensation that is not deductible in order to retain or to secure the services of key executives when it determines that it is in Quaker's best interests to do so. Recent tax legislation has eliminated the exception under Section 162(m) for performance-based compensation, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Thus, all compensation to certain of our executive officers over the $1 million limit will now be nondeductible starting in 2018 (subject to exceptions for certain grandfathered arrangements entered into before November 2, 2017). While Quaker's shareholder-approved bonus and incentive plans were previously structured to provide that certain awards could be made in a manner intended to qualify for the performance-based compensation exception, that exception will no longer be available other than with respect to certain grandfathered arrangements. For 2018, despite the elimination of the performance-based compensation exception, the compensation paid to our executive officers (other than Mr. Barry) did not exceed the Section 162(m) limitation. Compensation paid to Mr. Barry exceeded the Section 162(m) limitation and a portion of this compensation is not deductible by Quaker. 
Benchmarking Data 
The Committee has the authority to engage independent advisors to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. To assist Quaker in establishing a total direct compensation package comprising base salary, an annual cash incentive bonus and long-term incentives, the Committee has engaged Willis Towers Watson ("WLTW"), a leading global professional services company with specific expertise in the areas of benefits, talent management, rewards and risk and capital management, as an independent consultant on compensation issues. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          
        COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          
[END TABLE]
 In addition, WLTW has, from time to time, provided the Committee with executive compensation studies and analyses, as well as benchmarking data and counsel on compensation issues as needed or desired. 
WLTW provided no other services to the Company in fiscal 2018 other than advising the Committee on various executive compensation matters. Management had no role in selecting the Committee's compensation consultant. The Committee has assessed the independence of WLTW pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission rules and concluded that WLTW's work for the Committee and the Governance Committee does not raise any conflict of interest. 
Due to our size and diversity of our businesses around the world, we have not identified one specific peer group that is appropriate to use in defining market total direct compensation for our executive officers. Our primary benchmarks for 2018 total direct compensation for our executive officers were derived from compensation information provided by WLTW that is a blend of Peer Group (as defined below) compensation data and broader group data comprising a composite of credible, published executive compensation surveys. The Peer Group data reflects the Peer Group developed by a previous compensation consultant as well as WLTW. This Peer Group includes data for 13 publicly traded firms in the chemicals industry, similar in size (as measured by revenue and market capitalization) to Quaker. The Peer Group companies are: Aceto Corporation, American Vanguard Corporation, Buckeye Technologies Inc., Cabot Microelectronics Corporation, Calgon Carbon Corporation, Hawkins, Inc., Innophos Holdings, Inc., Innospec Inc., Landec Corporation, LSB Industries, Inc., OM Group, Inc., OMNOVA Solutions Inc. and Rogers Corporation (collectively, the "Peer Group"). Data for international Managing Directors is derived from surveys for their respective geographies. Though the Committee closely analyzes the data provided by WLTW, it exercises its discretion in the weight it assigns to this data in making compensation decisions. 
We generally aim to benchmark total direct compensation to the market 50th percentiles. We believe the philosophy of targeting total direct compensation to the market 50th percentiles reduces the possibility of excessive risk taking on the part of executives in order to achieve performance targets at the maximum levels. This approach is the starting point of the analysis as other factors are taken into consideration, including experience, breadth of responsibilities, tenure in the position, whether the position held is for succession planning purposes, overall individual performance and internal equity. We do not assign a particular weight to any of these factors but exercise discretion in this regard. 
In determining 2018 compensation for the Named Executive Officers, the Committee used the benchmarking data WLTW had previously provided and various other factors, as described above. Ms. Hall's and Mr. Berquist's targeted total direct compensation for 2018 was between the 25th and 50th percentiles of WLTW's comparative data. Messrs. Barry's, Benoliel's and Platzer's targeted total direct compensation for 2018 was at or near the 50th percentile of benchmark levels based on U.S. data. Total compensation earned in 2018 for each Named Executive Officer is reflected in the Summary Compensation Table below. 
Allocating Between Current and Long-Term Compensation 
The Committee, in seeking to ensure the appropriate focus on performance and risk, has developed, in consultation with WLTW, guidelines for executive officers for allocating the desired total direct compensation package among base salary, an annual cash incentive bonus and long-term incentives. As a general philosophy, these guidelines provide that the higher the position within management the more total compensation is dependent on incentive pay and the more the incentive pay is long-term oriented. This is done to better align senior level compensation with the long-term success of the Company. These guidelines are reviewed regularly to ensure their marketplace competitiveness. 
In the case of Mr. Barry, the guidelines for base salary range from 27% to 41% of total compensation, for annual cash incentive bonus from 20% to 22% of total compensation and for long-term incentives from 39% to 51% of total compensation. The applicable guidelines for our other executive officers for base salary range from 50% to 68% of total compensation, for annual cash incentive bonus from 15% to 21% of total compensation and for long-term compensation from 15% to 30% of total compensation. 
Base Salary 
Each year, the Committee reviews and discusses the base salaries of our executive officers. The Committee's final determination of salary increases depends on a number of factors, including market data reported by WLTW, specific position responsibilities and scope, experience and tenure, current job performance and Quaker's overall financial results. In the case of some of our foreign-based executive officers, salary increases may be a result of legal mandates of a particular country or region which influence the final determinations of the Committee even when similar increases were not granted to officers of comparable positions residing in the United States. Based on its analysis of all of the factors referenced above, in 2018, the Committee recommended, and the Board approved, salary increases for each of the Named Executive Officers, effective March 11, 2018, except for Mr. Platzer whose salary increase was effective March 1, 2018. Mr. Barry's salary increase is described below under the heading "Chief Executive Officer Compensation." The other Named Executive Officers' base salary increases and total base salary received for 2018 are described in the table below:

 achieving individual objectives. The Committee determined that the higher potential individual objective percentage for the CEO is warranted due to his heightened responsibility and experience, and after considering relevant market data. To achieve the maximum regional bonus, regional operating income must exceed budgeted levels and other regional financial and non-financial goals must be met. In addition, because the total amount of an individual's GAIP bonus can never exceed his or her overall maximum bonus opportunity, if the sum of the actual corporate bonus earned and the regional bonus earned exceeds the overall maximum opportunity, the regional bonus earned is limited to the individual's overall maximum opportunity. The rationale for providing this opportunity to regional executive officers is to reward them with up-side potential in years where there is strong performance in the applicable region but overall corporate performance is lower due to weakness in other regions or other factors negatively impacting the corporate component of the bonus. The specific corporate financial goals and individual goals, respectively, for performance during 2018 are discussed below under the headings "Corporate Financial Goals" and "Individual Goals." 
The following chart shows, as a percentage of base salary, the maximum potential bonus and the bonus amounts payable on target achievement and maximum achievement, allocated between corporate and individual objectives for 2018. The table also shows the percentage and amount of base salary actually paid as a result of achievement during 2018.

(3)  The Company determined that Messrs. Barry, Benoliel, and Platzer and Ms. Hall each achieved their individual  (personal) goals and, therefore, awarded them 100% of the target portion of the GAIP bonus attributable specifically to individual goals. (For non-regional associates, no more than the target amount may be  achieved for individual goals.)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  In 2018, Mr. Barry's maximum annual incentive award opportunity was 200% of his base salary. The applicable  maximum annual incentive award opportunity for our other Named Executive Officers was 93.5% of their base salary. The Committee determined that the CEO be provided with a higher GAIP maximum bonus opportunity based on benchmarking of market data for  similar CEO positions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  The performance of Mr. Berquist for his individual regional goals was at a level equal to 139% of the target  regional opportunity he could have earned, as explained in detail below.  
[END TABLE]
Corporate Financial Goals 
The corporate financial goals for the 2018 GAIP bonuses were based on the Company's consolidated net income and were set at $64.7 million of net income at threshold (the level at which the bonus pool began to accumulate), $71.9 million of net income at target and $79 million of net income at maximum. The Committee selected these net income levels, which were approved by the Board, because of their correlation to the 2018 budgeted adjusted net income of $71.9 million, the level of improvement over 2017 adjusted net income and the difficulty of achieving these targets in a very challenging business environment. 
When the Committee set the 2018 GAIP targets, it also approved certain significant non-budgeted business circumstances for which adjustment could be made by the Committee to the reported net income for purposes of calculating the award. They included site consolidation expenditures for consolidating U.S. operations beyond budgeted amounts; customer bankruptcies or customer plant shutdowns; change in accounting principles; unusual factors driving an increased tax rate; non-recurring adjustments to income such as asset write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and related charges and first-year acquisition costs/losses; adverse legal judgments, settlements, litigation expenses, and legal (including value-added-tax ("VAT") assessments) and environmental reserves; expenditures for discretionary Board initiated or approved corporate actions, plans or major initiatives, including individual personnel actions; changes in foreign exchange rates; and interest expense from the Company's share repurchase program. To be "significant" an individual effect must have a pre-tax impact of at least $200,000, or the pre-tax equivalent for tax adjustments. No adjustment to earnings is applied unless the aggregate total of all effects is at least $1 million on a pre-tax basis. 
In 2018, reported net income was $59.5 million, which includes the Company's GAIP bonus accrual. The Company's net income adjusted for this GAIP bonus accrual would have exceeded the threshold net income level referenced above. Under this adjusted net income level, a corporate award equal to 11% of the corporate maximum would be earned. The Committee considered six non-budgeted items in determining the actual payout percentage. These six non-budgeted items mainly, but not exclusively, reflect non-GAAP items outlined in our reported financial results for fiscal 2018. The Committee used its discretion to adjust the net income amount downward to exclude the equity income from a captive insurance company, to exclude the proceeds related to the liquidation of an inactive legal entity, and to exclude the income received related to a litigation settlement. The Committee also adjusted the net income upward to adjust for Houghton International, Inc. ("Houghton") combination costs, the effect of certain favorable tax impacts, as well as adjusting for the currency conversion impacts of certain hyper-inflationary economies. Accordingly, taking into account the adjustments made by the Committee, all participants earned an award equal to 66% of the maximum potential for the corporate component of the overall GAIP bonus. 
Individual Goals 
When setting the individual goals under the GAIP, the Committee receives specific input from the CEO and reviews the approved operating plan for the upcoming fiscal year. The CEO also recommends the goals for the other Named Executive Officers and works with the Committee to determine his own individual goals. The Committee works closely with the CEO to review and analyze the selected performance metrics and the probabilities and risks of achieving these metrics. Ultimately, the Committee approves the individual goals for the CEO and the other Named Executive Officers. For 2018, the Committee determined that these goals were difficult for the Named Executive Officers to achieve but achievable with substantial effort by each of them. 
In 2018, Mr. Barry's individual goals included, among other things, achieving the 2018 financial plan (with focus areas including sales, cash flow from operating activities, and EBITDA (which we defined as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) per the approved budget); executing the Company's strategic 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          
        COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          
[END TABLE]
 plan for each business segment (with focus areas including achieving established goals for the key account management program and customer relations management system); strengthening the Company for the future (including continued work on a business transformation project in one of the Company's regions); completing additional North America sites for the Company's Responsible Care initiative; completing major Company programs (including the Company's safety and sustainability initiatives and the finalization of the Company's "economic value added" performance analysis for each region globally); and providing appropriate governance and risk management for the Company (including having no material weaknesses or restatements to earnings in 2018 and completing and reviewing with the Board the Company's enterprise risk management program). 
Because the Committee determined that Mr. Barry had met 100% of his established individual GAIP goals, he was awarded 100% of his individual objectives portion of the GAIP bonus. The majority of Mr. Barry's goals were qualitative in nature, however, Mr. Barry's goals did have quantitative components. The 2018 financial plan included the key metrics of sales, cash flow from operating activities, and EBITDA growth as areas of focus. Despite the challenging global economic environment, sales and adjusted EBITDA results in 2018 were records for the Company with adjusted EBITDA results surpassing the results from both 2016 and 2017. Net sales increased by 6% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA was up 9% from 2017, exceeding $100 million for the fourth consecutive year and for only the fourth time in Company history. Cash flow from operating activities was a record $78.8 million, an increase of 22% from prior year. Our average stock price in 2018 was $168.20 per share compared to $142.29 per share in the prior year, an almost $26 increase year-over-year and an all-time record share price. 
The individual goals of the other executive officers were a mix of limited quantitative performance objectives (for the regional associates) and managerial goals, such as achieving regional business and operating budgets; achieving capital expenditure targets; achieving certain contribution margin levels; achieving certain net cash flow targets; ensuring that strategic plans are properly executed for his or her area of responsibility; continuing to implement Company safety programs to strengthen the safety culture; and upgrading the Company's enterprise risk management processes and programs. Three of the corporate Named Executive Officers (Messrs. Benoliel and Platzer and Ms. Hall) achieved 100% of their maximum opportunity on their individual components of the annual bonus as they achieved their individual goals as outlined below. Mr. Berquist, the one regional Named Executive Officer for 2018, earned 139% of his regional target bonus opportunity. Mr. Berquist's region was above the target goal on regional profitability, and he met many of his other regional goals (including in compliance and certain budgetary areas as explained below) to earn this percentage. 
For 2018, the Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Barry) had the following individual or regional goals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ms. Hall had quantitative goals of increasing the Company's overall contribution margin (defined as the overall  selling prices of Company products minus all variable costs) and meeting or exceeding certain budgeted financial targets, including achieving budgeted net income, EBITDA and cash flow targets and six qualitative individual goals: (i) ensuring  all finance and information technology critical functions are operational on day one of the closing of the anticipated Houghton combination with no disruptions in reporting or other requirements; (ii) maintaining reporting and disclosure  quality and ensuring no significant deficiencies, material weaknesses or recurring Sarbanes-Oxley ("SOX") issues as part of the Company's internal controls testing; (iii) co-leading of the  implementation of a business transformation project in one of the Company's regions and achieving expected efficiency benefits; (iv) maintaining investor relationships and developing plans to expand analyst coverage post-closing of the  Houghton combination; (v) establishing a consistent and reliable global process for banking and hedging requirements; and (vi) managing interest expense to reduce costs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Benoliel had a main quantitative goal of increasing the contribution margin (defined as the overall selling prices  of Company products minus all variable costs) of his various global businesses and numerous qualitative individual goals that focused on business strategy and strategic planning for both global and

[BEGIN TABLE]
     regional businesses, product research and development and technology processes across the organization and for certain specific business segments, specifically including the metalworking, can,  mining, and tube and pipe business. Additional goals included updating certain key strategic initiatives for the business segments, certain organizational projects in such business segments, and certain other projects related to our joint ventures  and other strategic relationships.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Platzer had six principal goals for the function he supervised in 2018: (i) achieving the 2018 budgeted global  manufacturing cost and capital expense targets; (ii) continuing to strengthen the safety culture and meeting certain targets in this area; (iii) achieving recertifications for various Company locations for the Company's Responsible  Care Program; (iv) achieving additional certifications for several additional locations for such Program; (v) ensuring SOX compliance (with no material weaknesses, significant deficiencies or recurring issues); and (vi) meeting  certain agreed upon developmental actions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Berquist had thirteen principal goals for the region he supervised: (i) achieving the 2018 budgeted net  income and net cash flow targets; (ii) increasing the contribution margin in his region to certain budgeted percentages; (iii) achieving working capital and capital expenditure budgeted targets; (iv) maintaining all key customer  business and managing customer churn; (v) fully evaluating the "economic value added" performance analysis and recommendations and having appropriate action plans in place by customer and segment; (vi) achieving global expansion  of certain product lines and businesses; (vii) meeting certain budget targets for core markets and particular key strategic initiatives and specific business segments and product lines; (viii) continuing to strengthen the safety culture  and meeting specific targets in this area; (ix) establishing key account management protocols and establishing a three-year calendar for strategic planning; (x) ensuring SOX compliance (with no material weaknesses, significant deficiencies  or recurring issues); (xi) monitoring compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and continuing the monitoring, auditing and training programs; (xii) implementing the 2018 corporate social responsibility program goals; and  (xiii) successfully achieving the account management program 2018 goals. Mr. Berquist achieved 139% of his regional bonus opportunity. His region was above the target goal on profitability and contribution margin, and he met various of his  other regional goals, including, but not limited to, strengthening the safety culture and meeting certain targets, meeting certain budget targets for core markets and particular key strategic initiatives, and ensuring SOX compliance.

Long-Term Incentives 
Our shareholders approved the 2016 Long-Term Performance Incentive Plan ("LTIP") at our 2016 annual meeting of shareholders and the long-term incentive awards discussed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement were awarded under the LTIP. 
Under the LTIP, stock options, restricted stock, long-term cash payments and other types of awards can be made to participants. This plan is intended to assist us in attracting, retaining and motivating employees, non-employee directors and consultants through the use of compensation that rewards long-term performance. The use of stock-based compensation in our long-term incentive plan balances the cash-based annual incentive bonus and cash portion of our long-term performance plan. The Committee believes that stock ownership by management and equity-based performance compensation arrangements are useful tools to align the interests of management with those of Quaker's shareholders. Under the LTIP, a three-year performance period is used. Generally, employees selected as award recipients hold key positions impacting the long-term success of Quaker and its subsidiaries. These awards are based on overlapping three-year performance periods, so a new program starts each year and a payment is made each year, if earned. 
Under the Company's LTIP, in 2016, Mr. Barry and the other Named Executive Officers were awarded options, time-based restricted stock and a target cash award for the 2016-2018 performance period. Payment of the cash award was dependent upon achieving a pre-determined targeted performance over the three-year period based on the Company's relative total shareholder return ("TSR") as compared to the TSR of the S&P SmallCap 600 (Materials Group). The threshold for the TSR target was relative performance at the 30th percentile of the 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          
        COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          
[END TABLE]
 comparison group, target was at the 50th percentile and maximum was at the 85th percentile. For this period, Quaker's TSR of 168% equated to a peer group ranking in the 98th percentile of the comparison group warranting a payout at maximum. For these purposes, TSR is calculated by using the one-month average stock price at the end of the performance period, divided by the one-month average stock price at the beginning of the performance period, plus any dividends paid over that period. 
The Committee reviewed current trends in long-term compensation practices with WLTW. The most recent review confirmed that Quaker's practices were generally consistent with those of other public companies and are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide for three types of awards (cash, restricted stock and options) to senior executives, including the Named Executive  Officers, but limit awards for lower level executives and senior management to cash and restricted stock.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The cash portion of the Company's LTIP is performance-based. The performance criteria for the cash payment is a single  metric, relative TSR over the applicable period as compared to the S&P SmallCap 600 (Materials Group). By tying the cash award to shareholder value, it allows a market metric to be used as a performance measure without accounting complications.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted stock is time based and vests at the end of three years assuming continued employment of the grantee. These  restricted shares are eligible for dividends payable, prior to and after vesting, at the time dividends are paid generally.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Options are time based and vest in three approximately equal installments over a three-year period commencing with the  anniversary of the date of grant.  
[END TABLE]
The relative value of each of the three categories of awards is roughly equal at the time of grant assuming target performance for the cash portion. The starting point for determining the Named Executive Officers' LTIP award is to first determine the percentage of base pay for each position at the 50th percentile of market comparables. 
Similar to the other components of total direct compensation, other factors in determining the actual percentage of base salary are taken into consideration such as experience, breadth of responsibilities, tenure in the position, whether the position held is for succession planning purposes, overall individual performance and internal equity. Based on recommendations from the Committee's outside compensation consultants as to typical plan design, in recent years (including 2018) the Committee has divided the total LTIP award into three components, allocated equally (based on fair value) to stock options, restricted stock and a target cash award. 
In the first quarter of 2018, the Committee selected participants for the 2018-2020 performance period, including all of the Named Executive Officers. The specific amount of each award was determined based on market data provided by WLTW, as well as the relative position and role of each executive officer within the Quaker organizational structure, influence on long-term results, past practice, performance factors independent of the terms and amounts of awards previously granted and policy targets for the mix of compensation between base salary, annual and long-term incentives. The Committee determined that the use of the percentage of base salary has at times caused internal inequity issues. To mitigate this dynamic, the Committee has begun to use market data related to a percentage of base salary with application of an absolute value in making awards determination for similarly valued positions of Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Vice President and Managing Director – North America; Vice President – Global Operations, EHS and Procurement; and Vice President and Global Leader – Metalworking, Can and Mining. The Committee agreed with the proposed recommendations for total LTIP valuation of each executive. The target award for Mr. Barry was 220% of base salary while for the other Named Executive Officers the range was 46% to 51% of base salary. The comparative data indicated that the CEO's LTIP target awards percentage should be higher than the other Named Executive Officers because his leadership role in the global organization and level of responsibility and experience warrants the greater percentage opportunity. 
Under the LTIP, with respect to the 2018-2020 performance period, Mr. Barry received a long-term incentive grant consisting of a target cash award opportunity of $623,333, 4,107 shares of restricted stock and 20,251 options. Ms. Hall and Mr. Berquist each received a target cash award opportunity of $76,667, 505 shares of restricted stock and 2,490 options. Mr. Platzer received a target cash award opportunity of $56,667, 373 shares of restricted stock and 1,841 options. Mr. Benoliel received a target cash award opportunity of $170,000. 
The exercise price of options awarded under the LTIP is not less than 100% of the "fair market value" of a share of Quaker common stock on the date the option was granted, which is defined as the last sale price for a share of common stock as quoted on the NYSE for that date or, if not reported on the NYSE for that date, as quoted on the principal exchange on which the common stock is listed or traded, and if no such sales are made on that date, then on the next preceding date on which there are such sales.

 accrual-based formula providing for annual credits of 3% to 7% of an employee's salary depending on age and service, with interest on the balance accruing based on the average rate of interest on 30-year treasury bonds (or 3.79%, if more). The pension benefit is currently calculated based on the benefit accrued under the old formula as of December 31, 2000, and then under the new formula commencing January 1, 2001. In 2005, the pension plan benefits were frozen for all non-union participants, including all U.S. based executive officers, resulting in no further increase in pension benefits for compensation or service after such date. In 2013, the pension plan benefits were frozen for union participants. In November 2018, the Board resolved to terminate the plan. Quaker is in the process of taking various actions to effect the complete termination of the pension plan including applying to the Internal Revenue Service for a favorable determination letter on the termination, drafting plan communications to participants and selecting an annuity provider and/or an insurance company for any amounts for which annuities need to be purchased. Quaker currently expects to complete the termination process by 2020. 
Foreign Plans
Mr. Platzer's retirement benefits are provided under a defined benefit pension plan maintained by the Company's Netherlands operating subsidiary. 
The salary ceiling for the calculation of Mr. Platzer's retirement benefits remains at E.U. Euros 250,000. Since 2004, the Netherlands plan has had a career average pay formula that provides for a target retirement benefit of 80% of career average salary assuming employment of 40 years. In 2004, the formula was modified freezing salary levels at then current levels for pension purposes, with annual increases aligned with the wage index. To the extent the increase in inflation exceeds 3%, half of the excess will be added to the assumed rate of annual increases with a maximum of 4%. Prior to 2004, the plan was a final salary plan and provided 70% of final salary assuming employment of 40 years. For pension purposes, pensionable salary is defined as 14.02 times monthly salary. Pension liabilities under this plan are funded through an insurance policy. 
Nonqualified Supplemental Retirement Income Program 
We also provide supplemental retirement income to certain of our U.S. based executive officers. Executive officers are designated by the Committee to participate in the Supplemental Retirement Income Program ("SRIP"). 
At this time, Messrs. Barry and Benoliel are the only active executive officers participating in the SRIP. It provides an annual benefit of 50% of the participant's pre-tax "average annual compensation," reduced by three offsets and further reduced if the participant completes fewer than 30 years of service. This benefit is generally payable over the participant's lifetime, starting within seven months after the participant's retirement (on account of disability or after attaining age 62), or starting after the participant's 65th birthday (if the participant's employment terminates after five years of participation but before retirement). Other benefit forms are 36 monthly installments (if payments start after the participant attains age 65) or monthly payments over the lifetime of the participant with a lump sum payable to his surviving beneficiary. However, benefits are payable in a lump sum if the present value of the participant's benefit does not exceed a Code limit ($18,500 for distributions in 2018) or if the participant dies or a change in control occurs. 
Average annual compensation is defined for this program as the average of the participant's annual base compensation and annual bonuses paid in the three calendar years (of the last ten) in which such amounts were the highest. The offsets are the participant's annual Social Security benefit (based on certain assumptions), the annual benefit payable to the participant over his lifetime under the qualified defined benefit retirement plan discussed above, and the aggregate amount of the qualified non-elective contributions made on the

[END TABLE]
 participant's behalf under the Quaker Chemical Corporation Retirement Savings Plan (plus assumed earnings) expressed as an annual benefit payable over the participant's lifetime. The service reduction is equal to 3.333% for each year (or partial year) of service fewer than 30 completed by the participant. 
For the two remaining active participants in SRIP, their accrued benefit is the greatest of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  the benefit payable under the formula set forth in the SRIP as in effect prior to January 1, 2005, based on the  participant's salary plus bonus and years of employment when he attained age 55; or

[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  the sum of the benefit the participant would have accrued as of December 31, 2006, under the formula set forth in  the SRIP as in effect prior to January 1, 2005, based on the participant's salary plus bonus and years of employment at December 31, 2006, plus the benefit the participant accrues under the new formula, described above, but  disregarding service completed before 2007; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  the amount determined under the new formula described above.  
[END TABLE]
It is anticipated that from December 2018 onwards the new formula will yield the highest benefit. 
Mr. Barry is entitled to receive additional service and age credit (18 months, in the case of termination other than on account of death, "disability" or by us for "cause" or a "covered termination," as the latter term is defined in his Change in Control Agreement and 24 months in the event of a "covered termination," as such term is defined in his Change in Control Agreement) for all purposes under the SRIP, including for purposes of determining Mr. Barry's eligibility for the "age 55" formula described in 1, above. 
Severance and Change in Control Benefits 
The Committee believes that appropriate severance and change in control benefits are an important part of the total compensation benefits package because they enhance our ability to compete for talent and foster stability in our management. Quaker has entered into employment agreements with each of our Named Executive Officers, pursuant to which severance benefits are payable to each of them and has also entered into change in control agreements with each of them pursuant to which the executive officers will receive certain benefits if they are terminated within a specified period following (or with respect to Mr. Platzer, a specified period before) a change in control of Quaker. In determining amounts payable, the Committee seeks to provide severance benefits sufficient to allow our executives time to find a comparable position elsewhere and change in control benefits sufficient to induce our executives to support a change in control transaction fully and remain with us despite any risk of termination after the transaction. 
Mr. Barry's Employment Agreement 
Mr. Barry is employed pursuant to an employment agreement that automatically renews for one-year terms unless either Quaker or Mr. Barry gives 90 days' prior notice of non-renewal. In accordance with the terms of the employment agreement, the Committee reviews and adjusts Mr. Barry's annual base salary each year. The total base salary Mr. Barry received for 2018 was $845,192. Mr. Barry is eligible to participate in our GAIP and LTIP, as well as certain other benefit programs as discussed earlier in this proxy statement. 
Mr. Barry's employment agreement provides that upon the termination of his employment for any reason, except for death or "disability," or by us for "cause," or a "covered termination," as this latter term is defined in his Change in Control Agreement, Quaker will pay him 18 monthly severance payments that, in the aggregate, are equal to 150% of his base salary at the time of termination plus a bonus equal to the average annual bonus paid to him under Quaker's annual incentive compensation in the applicable three-year period, excluding from the average any year in which no amounts were paid. In general, this three-year period would be expected to be the year of termination and the two preceding years (if Mr. Barry received a bonus in the year of his termination), or otherwise, the three calendar years prior to his termination of employment. 
In addition to the payments described above, Mr. Barry is entitled to 18 months of medical and dental coverage at a level equal to the coverage provided before his date of termination of employment and the severance allowance will be taken into account in determining his retirement benefit under the SRIP. In addition, an additional 18 months of service and age will be credited in determining this retirement benefit. See the discussion under the caption "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" in this proxy statement. Mr. Barry's severance payments are contingent upon signing a form of release satisfactory to Quaker. 
"Cause" is defined under Mr. Barry's employment agreement as willful and material breach of the terms of his employment agreement (after having received notice thereof and a reasonable opportunity to cure or correct) or dishonesty, fraud, willful malfeasance, gross negligence or other gross misconduct, in each case relating to the performance of Mr. Barry's duties to Quaker that is materially injurious to the Company, or a conviction of or guilty plea to a felony. A "covered termination" is termination of Mr. Barry's employment within two years following a change in control by the Company without cause or by Mr. Barry for "good reason" (as defined in the change of control agreement between the Company and Mr. Barry). 
In the case of termination of employment because of disability, Mr. Barry will be entitled to at least 50% of applicable pay during the period that benefits are payable under our long-term disability plan. In the case of termination of employment because of death, Mr. Barry's beneficiary would receive in a lump sum the higher of two times his annual base salary for the year in which his death occurred or the death benefit (as a multiple of base salary) to which any other executive officer would be entitled. The Company currently has a program in which all Named Executive Officers participate entitling each to a death benefit equal to 100% of base salary in the year of death and 50% of base salary in each of the four years thereafter. Mr. Barry would be entitled to this death benefit as it provides a greater benefit than that provided under his employment agreement. See the discussion under the caption "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" in this proxy statement. 
In the case of a termination (other than for death, disability, by us for "cause," or by Mr. Barry other than for "good reason") within two years following a change in control, Mr. Barry would, instead of the payments described above, be entitled to payment equal to two times the sum of his highest annualized base salary during his employment plus an amount equal to the greater of (i) the average of the annual amounts paid to him under all applicable annual incentive plans during the applicable three calendar-year period described in Mr. Barry's change in control agreement, excluding from the average any year in which no amounts were paid, or (ii) the target bonus which would have otherwise been payable to Mr. Barry for the calendar year in which the change in control transaction occurred. In general, this three-year period would be expected to be the year of termination and the prior two years (if Mr. Barry received a bonus in the year of his termination) or, otherwise, the three calendar years prior to his termination of employment. 
In addition, Mr. Barry would be entitled to receive (i) his earned but unpaid base salary through the date of termination at the current rate, or if higher, at the rate in effect at any time during the 90-day period preceding the change in control; (ii) any unpaid bonus or annual incentive payable to him in respect of the calendar year ending prior to termination; (iii) the pro rata portion of any and all unpaid bonuses and annual incentive awards for the calendar year in which the termination occurs which would have been payable had the target level of performance been achieved for the calendar year; and (iv) the pro rata portion of any and all awards under the LTIP for the performance period(s) in which the termination occurs, which would have been payable had the target level of performance been achieved for the performance period. In addition, Mr. Barry's severance allowance will be taken into account in determining his retirement benefit under the SRIP and an additional 24 months of service and age will be credited in determining this retirement benefit. Mr. Barry is also entitled to one-year outplacement services and participation in our medical, dental and life insurance programs as if still 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          
        COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          
[END TABLE]
 employed for a period of two years. To the extent the severance allowance, together with any other payments contingent upon a change in control, exceed the limits under Code section 280G (generally, three times Mr. Barry's average annual compensation for the prior five years), the severance allowance will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid the disallowance of a deduction under Code section 280G or imposition of the excise tax under Code section 4999 (assuming reduction of the severance allowance is the least economically detrimental to him). The Committee believes that providing benefits for Mr. Barry's termination within two years following a change in control is fair because he has the broadest responsibility and accountability in ensuring the success of our business and would be crucial to retain in any change in control. This is consistent with our philosophy of tying compensation to level of responsibility and influence over the Company's results and performance. See the discussion under the caption "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" in this proxy statement. These benefits will be paid or provided only if Mr. Barry signs a general release of claims unless prohibited by local law. 
Mr. Barry's employment agreement contains a confidentiality and an 18-month non-competition provision, in the event of termination for any reason. In addition, Mr. Barry's change in control agreement contains a confidentiality and a 24-month non-competition provision, in the event of termination for any reason. If a court were to determine that he breached these provisions, the Company's obligations to make payments under the agreements would terminate. 
Other Named Executive Officers 
Messrs. Benoliel, Platzer and Berquist and Ms. Hall are each entitled to severance under their respective employment agreements if the Company terminates their employment (other than in the case of termination for "cause" (for those agreements where "cause" is defined), disability, death or retirement) equal to 12 months base salary at their then current rate of salary. In addition, Mr. Platzer is entitled to severance prescribed by law in certain foreign jurisdictions which, if greater, would be in lieu of any severance due under any agreements with Quaker. "Cause" is defined in Mr. Platzer's employment agreement as: (i) willful and continued failure (following written notice) of the executive to perform his duties under the employment agreement; or (ii) the willful engaging by the executive in a continued course of misconduct which is materially injurious to Quaker, monetarily or otherwise. In the case of Messrs. Benoliel and Berquist and Ms. Hall, "cause" generally means: (i) willful and material breach of their memorandum of employment; (ii) dishonesty, fraud, willful malfeasance, gross negligence or other gross misconduct, in each case relating to the performance of duties which is materially injurious to Quaker; or (iii) conviction of or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony. Messrs. Benoliel, Platzer and Berquist and Ms. Hall are also entitled to reasonable outplacement assistance under their respective employment agreements. Messrs. Benoliel's, Platzer's and Berquist's and Ms. Hall's severance payments are contingent upon signing a form of release satisfactory to Quaker. None of the Named Executive Officers are entitled to severance under their employment agreements if they terminate their employment voluntarily, even if for good reason. Under their respective employment agreements, Messrs. Benoliel and Berquist and Ms. Hall would receive any severance payments in semi-monthly installments and Mr. Platzer would receive any severance payments in a lump sum. See also the discussion under the caption "Termination Other than for Cause, Disability, Death or Retirement" in this proxy statement. 
Following mutually agreeable discussions with Mr. Benoliel during 2017, it was decided that as part of the Company's integration planning for its combination with Houghton, Mr. Benoliel's current position would be restructured. After subsequent discussions, Mr. Benoliel left the Company effective March 1, 2019. Mr. Benoliel will receive severance and other benefits that will be substantially similar to those he would have received in connection with a termination of employment following a change in control of the Company pursuant to his existing change in control agreement with the Company. 
Quaker has entered into change in control agreements with each of its Named Executive Officers. Under these agreements (Mr. Barry's is described above), the officers other than Mr. Barry are entitled, if terminated (other than for disability, death, by us for "cause," or by the executive officer other than for "good reason") within two years following (or also within six months before, with respect to Mr. Platzer) a change in control, to severance in an amount equal to 1.5 times the sum of highest annualized base salary plus an amount equal to the average of the total annual amounts paid to the executive under all applicable annual incentive compensation plans during the applicable three calendar-year period described in the change in control agreements, excluding from the average any year in which no amounts were paid. In general, this three-year period would be expected to be the year of termination and the prior two years (for Messrs. Benoliel and Berquist and Ms. Hall, if the executive received a bonus in the year of the executive's termination of employment) or, otherwise, the three calendar years prior to the year of his or her termination of employment. See the discussion under the caption "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" in this proxy statement. In addition, these executive officers are entitled to receive (i) earned but unpaid base salary through the termination at the rate in effect on the date of termination or, if higher, at the rate in effect at any time during the 90-day period preceding the change in control; (ii) any unpaid bonus or annual incentive payable to the executive in respect of the calendar year ending prior to the termination; (iii) the pro rata portion of any and all unpaid bonuses and annual incentive awards for the calendar year in which the termination occurs based on target performance for Messrs. Benoliel, Platzer and Berquist and for Ms. Hall; and (iv) the pro rata portion of any and all awards under the Company's LTIP for the performance period(s) in which the termination occurs, which would have been payable had the target level performance been achieved for the performance period. 
In addition to the amounts described above, our other Named Executive Officers are also entitled to one-year outplacement services and participation in our medical, dental and life insurance programs as if still employed for a period of 18 months. Mr. Platzer is also entitled to receive additional payments as prescribed by the law in the foreign jurisdiction in which he is located. These benefits will be paid or provided only if the executive officer signs a general release of claims unless prohibited by local law. In addition, the benefits and payments will be discontinued if the executive officer violates the confidentiality provisions of his or her respective change in control agreement (at any time) or the non-compete provisions of the change in control agreement (during employment or the one-year period thereafter). To the extent the severance allowance, together with any other payments contingent upon a change in control, exceed the limits under Code section 280G (generally, three times the individual's average annual compensation for the prior five years), the severance allowance will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid the disallowance of a deduction under Code section 280G or imposition of the excise tax under Code section 4999 (assuming reduction of the severance allowance is the least economically detrimental to the executive). 
In the change in control agreements "cause" generally means: (i) the willful and material breach of the employment agreement between the executive and Quaker (after having received notice and the reasonable opportunity to correct); (ii) dishonesty, fraud, willful malfeasance, gross negligence or other gross misconduct, in each case relating to the performance of the executive's employment with Quaker which is materially injurious to Quaker; or (iii) conviction of or plea of guilty to a felony. "Good reason" includes, other than by reason of executive's death or disability: (i) any reduction in the executive's base salary from that provided immediately before the "covered termination" or, if higher, immediately before a change in control; (ii) any reduction in the executive's bonus opportunity (including cash or noncash incentives) or increase in the goals or standards required to accrue that opportunity, as compared to the opportunity and goals or standards in effect immediately before the change in control; (iii) a material adverse change in the nature or scope of the executive's authorities, powers, functions or duties from those in effect immediately before the change in control; (iv) a reduction in the executive's benefits from those provided immediately before the change in control, disregarding any reduction under a plan or program covering employees generally that applies to all 
[BEGIN TABLE]

        COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS          
[END TABLE]
 employees covered by the plan or program; or (v) the executive being required to accept a primary employment location which is more than 25 miles from the location at which he or she was primarily employed during the 90-day period prior to a change in control. 
Other Benefits on Termination 
In addition to the payments and benefits discussed above, the executive officers are entitled to the payments and benefits that are available to all employees on termination of employment, including vested benefits under the Company's qualified defined benefit retirement plan and 401(k) plan, short-term and long-term disability benefits (in the event of disability) and life insurance benefits (in the case of death). 
Perquisites and Other Benefits 
As a general matter, the Company does not provide perquisites to its executive officers, other than an allowance for financial planning services. In Asia and Europe, consistent with regional compensation practices, cars are provided to mid and upper level managers. For more details on these perquisites, please refer to footnote 4 to the Summary Compensation Table.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
We describe below estimated amounts payable to each of our Named Executive Officers under certain situations, assuming the termination of employment and, where applicable, that a change in control occurred on December 31, 2018. For purposes of this section, the term "change in control" generally means: (a) any person who, subject to certain exceptions, is or becomes the beneficial owner of securities of Quaker representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of Quaker's then outstanding securities or such lesser percentage of voting power (but not less than 15%), as determined by the independent members of the Board of Directors; (b) during any two-year period, directors of Quaker in office at the beginning of such period plus any new director whose election by the Board of Directors or whose nomination for election by Quaker's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office (who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) shall cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; (c) the consummation of (i) any consolidation or merger of Quaker in which Quaker is not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which Quaker's voting common shares would be converted into cash, securities, and/or other property, other than a merger of Quaker in which holders of Quaker common shares immediately prior to the merger have the same proportionate ownership of voting shares of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger as they had in the common shares immediately before; or (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, or other transfer of all or substantially all the assets or earning power of Quaker; or (d) the approval of the liquidation or dissolution of Quaker by its shareholders or the Board of Directors. 
Except for the Supplemental Retirement Income Program, the amounts shown are estimated amounts, and have not been calculated as a present value or otherwise adjusted for varying payment dates. For information on material assumptions used in quantifying the present value of the Supplemental Retirement Income Program benefit, see Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The amounts shown are estimates of the amounts that would be paid; the actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of the executive's separation from the Company (or a change in control, if applicable). Also, see the discussions under the headings "Severance and Change in Control Benefits" through "Other Benefits on Termination" in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement. As previously disclosed, Mr. Benoliel's employment with the Company terminated on March 1, 2019. Mr. Benoliel will receive severance and other benefits that will be substantially similar to those he would have received in connection with a termination of employment following a change in control of the Company.

Termination Other than for Cause, Disability, Death or Retirement Not Involving a Change in Control 
Under the terms of their employment agreements, the Named Executive Officers are entitled to severance benefits and, with the exception of Mr. Barry, certain outplacement services if the Company terminates their employment (for other than cause, disability, death or retirement) and the termination is not in connection with a change in control. In addition, Ms. Hall is entitled to 12 months of continued medical and dental coverage after termination at Quaker's cost, Mr. Berquist is entitled to continuation of medical and dental coverage consistent with Quaker's severance program in place at the time of termination, and Mr. Barry is entitled to participate in Quaker's medical and dental plans for 18 months after termination on the same basis as an active employee. In the case of such a termination, Mr. Barry is entitled to a multiple of 1.5 times his base salary and bonus paid to him during a three-year period as described in his employment agreement. In the case of such a termination, Messrs. Benoliel, Platzer and Berquist and Ms. Hall are entitled to severance equal to 12 months of base salary as of the termination date. The estimated aggregate severance amounts payable under such circumstances are as follows: $2,503,142 (Mr. Barry); $385,000 (Ms. Hall); $370,159 (Mr. Benoliel); $308,824 (Mr. Platzer); and $347,000 (Mr. Berquist). Mr. Barry will be paid his severance in eighteen monthly installments commencing on the 60th day after his separation; Messrs. Benoliel and Berquist and Ms. Hall will respectively be paid their severance in twenty-four semi-monthly installments; and Mr. Platzer will be paid his severance in accordance with Dutch legal practice. 
Termination as a Result of Death or Disability 
If employment were terminated on December 31, 2018, as a result of death or disability (as defined in the respective plan), the amounts shown above for Annual Bonus (assuming target performance is attained), Restricted Stock Awards (time-based vesting) and Stock Options would be paid. In the case of death on December 31, 2018, a death benefit would be paid for 2018 (in 2019) of $850,000 (Mr. Barry), $385,000 (Ms. Hall), $370,159 (Mr. Benoliel), $308,824 (Mr. Platzer) and $347,000 (Mr. Berquist), plus 50% of base salary during each of 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 (Mr. Barry, $425,000; Ms. Hall, $192,500; Mr. Benoliel, $185,080; Mr. Platzer, $154,412; and Mr. Berquist, $173,500). 
Pay Ratio Disclosure 
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the regulations of the SEC, we are providing the following information about the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our CEO, Michael F. Barry. For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company and its consolidated subsidiaries (other than  our CEO) was $47,298; and  
• The annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table presented elsewhere in this proxy  statement, was $4,848,181.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Barry, our CEO, to the median of the total compensation of all employees was 103 to 1. This pay ratio information has been calculated in a manner consistent with SEC regulations. 
Methodology 
There has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly affect our pay ratio disclosure. As such, we are using the same methodology and median employee in our pay ratio calculation as we used in last year's proxy statement. 
To identify the median of annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the "median employee," the methodology and material assumptions, adjustments and estimates that we used were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  We determined that as of October 1, 2017, our employee population consisted of 2,177 individuals working at our  company and its consolidated subsidiaries. We selected October 1, 2017 to allow sufficient time to conduct the necessary analysis given the global scope of our operations, which includes employees in 25 countries.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  Our employee population, after the adjustments permitted by SEC rules (as described below), consisted of 2,131 employees.  In establishing the relevant portion of our employee population, as permitted by the SEC rules, we excluded less than 5% of our employees, including the employees in Argentina, Uzbekistan and Thailand, which together represent 46 employees, or 2.1%,  of our total employee population (17 in Argentina, 7 in Uzbekistan and 22 in Thailand). Of the remaining 2,131 employees, 633 are located in the U.S. and 1,498 are located outside the U.S.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  For each of the 2,131 employees, we used their annualized salary as of October 1, 2017 as their base salary to  determine the median employee group. Because the commissions and bonuses for 2017 for each employee were not yet determined, bonus and commission information for 2016 were used. In determining the median employee group, all non-U.S. currencies were converted to U.S. Dollars at the exchange rate applicable on October 1, 2017. Based on this information, the median group of employees was determined.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  After determining the median group, the compensation of these employees was calculated using actual 2017 compensation  data in line with the requirements of Regulation S-K for each median group employee. After calculating actual 2017 compensation data for the median group, we selected the median employee who is an operator in  one of our U.S. plants and had a total annual compensation of $45,623 in 2017. In 2018, the median employee's total annual compensation was $47,298.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  5.  With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount in the "total" column (column (j))  of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement.  
[END TABLE]
Director Compensation 
The Governance Committee is charged with reviewing and making recommendations to the Board of Directors with respect to director compensation. The Company uses a combination of cash and stock-based compensation to attract and retain candidates on the Board. Director compensation is targeted at the median of the relevant comparison groups (discussed below) consistent with the positioning of executive officer compensation. In the past, in making this determination, the Governance Committee used certain industry-wide data obtained by Quaker's management to set compensation. 
For the 2018-2019 Board year, each independent director received an annual cash retainer of $55,000 and a time-based restricted stock award equal to $60,000 in accordance with the Company's LTIP, issued in June 2018, which vests in a single installment a year from the date of issuance assuming continued Board membership. In addition, each independent director received $1,250 for each Board and Board committee meeting he or she attended, and the chairperson of each Board committee received the following additional compensation: Audit Committee, $12,000; Compensation/Management Development Committee, $8,000; Executive Committee, $4,000; and Governance Committee, $8,000. The Lead Director received an additional annual retainer of $15,000. 
After reviewing comparative market data received from various sources, the Company's Board, based on the Governance Committee's recommendation, approved certain adjustments to director compensation on February 26, 2019. Effective with the 2019-2020 Board year, each independent director will receive an annual cash retainer of $65,000 and a time-based restricted stock award equal to $85,000, issued in June 2019, which will vest in a single installment a year from the date of issuance assuming continued Board membership. The Board also decided, given current trends for director compensation, to eliminate the fees for Board and Committee attendance and instead provide an annual fee to each specific committee member as follows: each Audit Committee member will receive $7,500, each Compensation/Management Development Committee member will receive $5,000, and each Governance Committee member will receive $4,000. In addition, the chairperson of each Board Committee will receive the following compensation: Audit Committee, $20,000; Compensation/Management Development Committee, $15,000; Executive Committee, $5,000; and Governance Committee, $10,000. The Lead Director will receive an annual retainer of $20,000. 
The 2013 Director Stock Ownership Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors of the Company on March 6, 2013 and approved by the shareholders at the 2013 annual meeting. Presently, under the terms of the Plan, each independent director is required to beneficially own on May 1 of the applicable calendar year shares of Quaker common stock equal to the Threshold Amount, which is defined as the quotient obtained by dividing (i) 400% of the annual cash retainer for the applicable calendar year by (ii) the average of the closing price of a share of Quaker common stock for the previous calendar year. If an independent director's share ownership falls below the Threshold Amount, 75% of the annual cash retainer payable will be paid in shares of Quaker common stock and the remaining 25% of the annual cash retainer will be paid in cash, unless the director elects to receive a greater percentage of Quaker common stock (up to 100%). If a director's share ownership meets or exceeds the Threshold Amount, the director may irrevocably elect to receive common stock in payment of a percentage (up to 100%) of the annual cash retainer for the applicable year.

Compensation Policies and Practices – Risk Assessment 
The Compensation/Management Development Committee conducted a risk assessment in 2018 to consider whether any of our compensation practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or operations. In order to assess risk as it relates to compensation, management conducted a global audit of all compensation practices, including base pay philosophies and corporate and regional bonus plans. This global audit consisted of an examination of both the Company's regional pay practices and bonus plans and the corporate-wide compensation programs. Management, including the Vice President – Human Resources, reported the results of this audit to the Committee. After review, the Committee concluded that none of the Company's current compensation programs would be reasonably likely to encourage excessive risk taking because the metrics in the Company's compensation plans are linked to corporate performance as it relates to set budgetary targets and because the plans are measured against identified peer comparison groups. After a discussion with management about these findings, the Committee thereafter determined that the Company's compensation practices were not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business or operations.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  Represents 2.4% of all votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, based on information available on March 4, 2019.   
[END TABLE]
Based solely on (i) our review of reports submitted to us during and with respect to the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act, including any amendment thereto and (ii) written representations of Quaker's directors and officers, Quaker believes that all reports required to be filed under Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act, with respect to transactions in Quaker's common stock through December 31, 2018, were filed on a timely basis. 
The Board recognizes that related party transactions may present a heightened risk of conflicts of interest and/or improper valuation or the perception thereof. Nevertheless, the Board also recognizes that there are situations when related party transactions are consistent with the best interests of the Company. Accordingly, the Governance Committee, on the Board's authority, has adopted a written policy to govern the review and approval of all related party transactions involving the Company. 
The policy requires all related party transactions involving $50,000 or more be reviewed by the Governance Committee. Related parties are defined as any director, nominee for director, senior officer (including all Named Executive Officers), a beneficial owner of more than five percent of the Company's voting securities and any immediate family member of the foregoing. Prior to entering into a transaction with Quaker subject to the Governance Committee's review, the related party must make a written submission to Quaker's General Counsel setting forth the facts and circumstances of the proposed transaction, including, among other things, the proposed aggregate value of such transaction, the benefits to Quaker, and an assessment of whether the proposed transaction is on terms comparable to those available from an unrelated third party. The Governance Committee (or, when urgent action is required, that Committee's Chair) will evaluate all of the foregoing information to determine whether the transaction is in the best interests of Quaker and its shareholders, as the Committee (or Chair) determines in good faith. 
There were no related party transactions in 2018. 
Proposal 3 – Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Board of Directors has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. There is no requirement that the Board's selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be submitted to our shareholders for ratification or approval. The Board, however, believes that Quaker's shareholders should be given an opportunity to express their views on the selection. While the Board is not bound by a vote against ratifying PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Board may take a vote against PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP into consideration in future years when selecting our independent registered public accounting firm. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited our financial statements since at least 1972. 
We anticipate that representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be present at the meeting and, if present, we will give them the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. We also anticipate that the representatives will be available to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders. 
Audit Fees 
Audit fees charged to us by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for audit services rendered during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 for the integrated audit of our financial statements and our internal controls over financial reporting included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, the review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and foreign statutory audit requirements totaled $1,768,928 and $1,953,356, respectively. 
Audit-Related Fees 
Audit-related fees charged to us by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for audit-related services rendered, primarily related to foreign statutory audit-related assistance, certifications and other audit-related services, during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, totaled $167,258 and $132,000, respectively. 
Tax Fees 
Tax fees charged to us by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for tax services rendered, primarily related to tax compliance, during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, totaled $498,954 and $784,000, respectively. 
All Other Fees 
The fees billed to us by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for all other services rendered, primarily related to accounting research and disclosure software purchased by the Company from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, during the years ended December  31, 2017 and 2018, totaled $6,840 and $7,000, respectively. 
Pre-Approval Policy 
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy governing the pre-approval of services provided by Quaker's independent registered public accounting firm. The policy expressly prohibits non-audit services for which engagement is not permitted by applicable law and regulations, including internal audit outsourcing and "expert services." A list of prohibited and permitted services is set forth in the policy. Permitted services under the policy include audit and audit-related services, internal control-related consulting, tax-related services and consulting services not related to information systems design and implementation. Audit and audit-related services include, among other things, services related to securities filings, accounting and financial reporting consultations, statutory audits, acquisition and divestiture-related due diligence and benefit plan audits.

        PROPOSAL 3          
        PROPOSAL 3          
[END TABLE]
Internal control-related consulting is limited to assessing and recommending improvements to Quaker's internal control structure, procedures or policies. Tax-related services are limited to tax compliance and planning. All services provided by Quaker's independent registered public accounting firm must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee though the committee's authority may be delegated to one or more of its members. 
All of the fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with its pre-approval policy. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote "FOR" ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
Report of the Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee of Quaker's Board of Directors oversees Quaker's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors and acts pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter, which is available at https://www.quakerchem.com by accessing the Investor Relations/Corporate Governance section of our website. The Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each member of the Audit Committee qualifies as an "independent" director under the current listing standards of the NYSE and Quaker's Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
As stated in its charter, the Audit Committee's job is one of oversight. It is not the duty of the Audit Committee to prepare Quaker's financial statements or plan or conduct audits to determine that Quaker's financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or that Quaker's internal controls over financial reporting are adequate. Financial management (including the internal auditing function) of Quaker is responsible for preparing the financial statements and maintaining internal controls and the independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for the audit of the annual financial statements and the internal controls and rendering an opinion as to the foregoing. In carrying out its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee is not providing any special assurance as to Quaker's financial statements or internal controls or any professional certification as to the outside auditor's work. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management Quaker's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee has also discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Quaker's independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which includes, among other items, matters related to the conduct of the audit of Quaker's financial statements. The Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning its independence from Quaker and its related entities, and has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP its independence from Quaker and its related entities. 
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to Quaker's Board of Directors that Quaker's audited financial statements be included in Quaker's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

This list of required information is not exhaustive. A copy of the full text of the relevant By-Law provisions, which includes the complete list of all information that must be submitted to us before a shareholder may submit a proposal at the 2019 annual meeting, may be obtained upon written request directed to our Corporate Secretary at our principal office.

We did not receive any such proposals with respect to the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
All proposals should be submitted in writing to: Quaker Chemical Corporation, One Quaker Park, 901 E. Hector Street, Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

This Article 7 shall not apply to an election of directors by holders of any class of stock (other than Common Stock) issued by the Corporation who have the right, voting separately as a class or otherwise, to elect directors. 
(b) In a contested election of directors, the candidates receiving the highest number of votes, up to the number of directors to be elected in such election, shall be elected. Shareholders shall not have the right to vote against a nominee in a contested election of directors. 
(c) For purposes of this Article 7, a contested election is one in which the number of candidates exceeds the number of directors to be elected. The number of candidates for an election shall be determined in accordance with these Articles of Incorporation, the Corporation's By-Laws, including any advance notice provisions of each, and applicable law. 
(d) If an incumbent director who is a candidate for re-election is not elected, the director shall be deemed to have tendered his or her resignation to the Board to be effective as of the adjournment of the meeting of the Board at which a decision on whether to accept the resignation is made by the Board. The Nominating Committee, if any, will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board shall act on the Nominating Committee's recommendation and disclose its decision and the rationale therefor within 90 days after the date of the certification of the election results. The director who is deemed to have tendered his or her resignation shall not participate in the decisions of the Nominating Committee or of the Board with respect to his or her own resignation.
