     PROXY SUMMARY               
     PROXY SUMMARY               
[END TABLE]
Fiscal 2018 Review 
Fiscal 2018 was marked by substantial accomplishments on key strategic initiatives, as the Company largely completed its transformation to an asset-light, single-brand organization while operating in a highly competitive restaurant industry. However, the Company did not meet our annual financial targets which directly impacted annual incentive payouts. 
Returns to Stockholders 
2018 was our fifth consecutive year of returning more than $300 million to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, which have totaled nearly $1.8 billion over those five years. For fiscal 2018 our cumulative total shareholder return (TSR) declined 16%. However, our TSR over the past five years increased at a compound annual rate of 17.5%. 
Financial and Operational Results 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Systemwide same-store sales increased 0.1% over prior year, marking the eighth consecutive year of positive growth.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restaurant-Level EBITDA(1) increased by 220 basis points to 26.4%  of company restaurant sales.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restaurant Operating Margin(1) ("ROM") increased 260  basis points to 22.7% of company restaurant sales.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Operating Earnings Per Share(2) ("Operating EPS") of  $3.79 per share increased over 9% from the prior year.  
[END TABLE]
Strategic Initiatives 
The Company made progress on key strategic initiatives, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Completing our refranchising initiative which increased our franchise mix to our desired end-state of 94% at FYE 2018  (from 88% at 2017 fiscal year-end), resulting in higher and more predictable levels of franchise revenues in the form of royalties and rental income while lowering our future capital spending requirements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Completing the sale of our Qdoba brand effective March 21, 2018 for approximately $305 million in cash.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reducing our corporate general and administrative expenses ("G&A") by 20 basis points to 2.2% of system  sales.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achieving key milestones toward ultimately increasing the Company's leverage to five times EBITDA.   
[END TABLE]
Incentive Compensation Outcomes 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Jack in the Box Operating Earnings Before Interest and Taxes ("Operating EBIT")(3) result was 39% of target goal, and Jack in the Box ROM performance was 82% of target goal. Together, these metrics accounted for 80% of target incentive opportunity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Management made substantial progress on the four strategic initiatives, as described above, which will better position  the Company over the long-term. These four strategic initiatives together accounted for 20% of target incentive.  
[END TABLE]
For fiscal 2018, the CEO and other NEOs received annual incentive payouts of 69.1% of target incentive (except for Ms. Allen who separated in February 2018 and did not receive an incentive). Mr. Rebel's annual incentive was pro-rated based on his time employed with the Company during fiscal 2018. 
Other 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company hired a new Chief Financial Officer to replace our former long-term CFO who retired during 2018. The  Company also hired a new Chief Operating Officer in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   Restaurant-Level EBITDA (earnings from operations on a GAAP basis adjusted to exclude depreciation and  amortization allocated to company restaurant operations and other operating expenses, such as general and administrative expenses, which include the costs of functions such as accounting, finance and human resources, and other costs such as pension  expense, share-based compensation, impairment and other charges, net, and gains or losses on the sale of company-operated restaurants); and Restaurant Operating Margin (defined by the Company as company restaurant sales less expenses incurred  directly by our restaurants in generating those sales (food and packaging costs, payroll and employee benefits costs, and occupancy and other costs)) are non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to earnings from operations, the most  comparable GAAP measure, please see "Appendix A — Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results."  
(2)   Operating EPS is a non-GAAP measure, and is defined by the Company as diluted EPS from continuing operations on a  GAAP basis excluding gains or losses on the sale of company-operated restaurants, restructuring charges, the non-cash impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the excess tax benefits from share-based compensation arrangements which are now recorded  as a component of income tax expense versus equity previously. For a reconciliation of this measure to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, the most comparable GAAP measure, please see "Appendix A — Reconciliation of  Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results."  
(3)   Operating EBIT is defined and explained in Section VI.b of the Compensation Discussion & Analysis of this  Proxy Statement.

PROXY STATEMENT 
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
March  1, 2019 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
Proxy Materials and Voting Information 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  Why am I receiving these materials?  
[END TABLE]
We sent you these proxy materials because the Board of Directors (sometimes referred to as the "Board") of Jack in the Box Inc. (sometimes referred to as the "Company," "Jack in the Box," "we," "us," or "our") is soliciting your proxy to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") and at any postponements or adjournments of the Annual Meeting. The Annual Meeting will be held on March 1, 2019, at 8:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time at our corporate headquarters located at 9330 Balboa Avenue, San Diego, CA 92123. If you held shares of our common stock on January 25, 2019 (the "Record Date"), you are invited to attend the Annual Meeting and vote on the proposals described below under the heading "What are my voting choices for each of the items to be voted on at the 2019 Annual Meeting?" However, you do not need to attend the Annual Meeting to vote your shares. Instead, you may complete, sign, date, and return the enclosed proxy card. You may also vote over the Internet or by telephone. 
The Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Notice"), Proxy Statement, the enclosed proxy card, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, will be mailed to stockholders on or about January 28, 2019. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  Who can vote at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
If you were a holder of Jack in the Box common stock (the "Common Stock") either as a stockholder of record or as the beneficial owner of shares held in Street name as of the close of business on January 25, 2019, the Record Date for the Annual Meeting, you may vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were approximately 
 25,806,804 shares of Common Stock outstanding, excluding treasury shares. Company treasury shares will not be voted. Each stockholder has one vote for each share of Common Stock held as of the Record Date. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially in Street name. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  What does it mean to be a "stockholder of record"?  
[END TABLE]
If, on the Record Date, your shares were registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, Computershare, then you are a "stockholder of record." As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual 
 Meeting or vote by proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we urge you to fill out and return the enclosed proxy card, or vote by telephone or Internet, to ensure your vote is counted. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  What does it mean to beneficially own shares in "Street name"?  
[END TABLE]
If, on the Record Date, your shares were held in an account at a broker, bank, or other financial institution (we will refer to those organizations collectively as "broker"), then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "Street name" and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by that broker. The broker holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker on

 how to vote the shares in your account. As a beneficial owner, you are invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not a stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker giving you the legal right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting, as well as satisfy the Annual Meeting admission criteria set out in the Notice. Under the rules that govern brokers, your broker is not permitted to vote on your behalf on any matter to be considered at the Annual Meeting (other than the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accountants for fiscal 2019) unless you provide specific instructions to the broker as to how to vote. As a result, we encourage you to communicate your voting decisions to your broker before the date of the Annual Meeting to ensure that your vote will be counted.

8.  What does it mean if I received more than one proxy card?  
[END TABLE]
If you receive more than one proxy card, your shares are registered in more than one name or are registered in different accounts. Please complete, sign and return each proxy card to ensure that all of your shares are voted. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
9.  How are votes counted?  
[END TABLE]
Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed for the Annual Meeting, who will separately count "FOR," "AGAINST," abstentions and broker non-votes. A "broker non-vote" occurs when your broker submits a proxy for your shares of Common Stock held in Street name, but does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker has not received voting instructions from you and does not have the authority to vote on that matter without instructions. Under the rules that govern brokers who are voting shares held in Street name, brokers have the discretion to vote those shares on routine matters but not on non-routine matters. 
For purposes of these rules, the only routine matter in this Proxy Statement is the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accountants. Therefore, if you hold your shares in Street name and do not provide voting instructions to your broker, your broker does not have discretion to vote your shares on any of the proposals at the Annual Meeting except the ratification of the appointment of independent registered public accountants. However, your shares will be considered present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum, as provided below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal   Number   Item        Votes Required for Approval   Abstentions   Uninstructed Shares 
 Proposal   Number   Item        Votes Required for Approval   Abstentions   Uninstructed Shares

10.  How many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to hold a valid annual meeting. A quorum will be present if the holders of at least a majority of the total number of shares of Common Stock entitled to vote are present, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and shares represented by broker non-votes are counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. If there are insufficient votes to constitute a quorum at the time of the Annual Meeting, we may adjourn the Annual Meeting to solicit additional proxies.

Vote Required for Approval 
In the election of directors, you may vote FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN. The Company's Bylaws require that, in an election such as this, where the number of director nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, each director will be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast (in person or by proxy) with respect to the director. A "majority of votes cast" means that the number of shares cast "FOR" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "AGAINST" that director. For purposes of determining the votes cast, only those votes cast "FOR" or "AGAINST" are included. Neither a vote to ABSTAIN nor a broker non-vote will count as a vote cast FOR or AGAINST a director nominee and, as a result, will have no direct effect on the outcome of the election of directors. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. 
In an uncontested election, a nominee who does not receive a majority of the votes cast will not be elected. An incumbent director who is not elected because he or she does not receive a majority of the votes cast will continue to serve, but shall tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee will take action to determine whether to accept or reject the director's resignation, or whether other action is appropriate, and will make a recommendation to the Board. Within ninety (90) days following the date of the certification of the election results, the Board will act on the Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale for such decision. 
ON PROPOSAL ONE, ELECTION OF DIRECTORS, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" ALL NOMINEES.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
We operate within a comprehensive corporate governance structure driving and expecting the highest standards of professional and personal conduct. Our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices, our ethics Code of Conduct: "The Integrity Playbook," the charters for our Audit, Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and Governance Committees, and other corporate governance information, are available at http://investors.jackinthebox.com. These materials are also available in print to any stockholder upon written request to the Company's Corporate Secretary, Jack in the Box Inc., 9330 Balboa Avenue, San Diego, CA 92123. The information on our website is not a part of this Proxy Statement and is not incorporated into any of our filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Directors' Independence 
The Jack in the Box Inc. Director Independence Guidelines provide that a director is not independent if he or she is: (a) a director, executive officer, partner or owner of 5% or greater interest in a company that either purchases from or makes sales to our Company that total more than one percent of the consolidated gross revenues of such company for that fiscal year; (b) a director, executive officer, partner or owner of 5% or greater interest in a company from which our Company borrows an amount equal to or greater than one percent of the consolidated assets of either our Company or such other company; or (c) a trustee, director or executive officer of a charitable organization that has received in that fiscal year discretionary donations from our Company that total more than 1% of the organization's latest publicly available national annual charitable receipts. 
The Board has analyzed the independence of each Director. It has determined that all but Mr. Comma are independent directors under the NASDAQ Listing Rules, as well as the additional Director Independence Guidelines adopted by the Board. As part of its analysis, the Board determined that none of these Directors have a material relationship with the Company. Mr. Comma is our current Chief Executive Officer and an employee, and therefore he is not considered "independent" as that term is defined by the relevant listing rules and governance guidelines. 
Board Meetings, Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and Attendance 
In fiscal 2018, each director attended more than 75% of the meetings of the Board and of the committees on which he or she served. The Board held eight meetings in fiscal 2018. 
All of the directors standing for election in 2019 attended the 2018 Annual Meeting, and we currently expect all of our directors standing for election to be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Determination of Current Board Leadership Structure 
The Nominating and Governance Committee's Charter provides that the Committee will annually assess the leadership structure of the Board and recommend a structure to the Board for approval. In November 2018, the Board of Directors, with input from the Nominating and Governance Committee, conducted this assessment, including assessing whether (i) the roles of Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chairman of the Board should continue to be combined, and (ii) the Board should continue to have an independent Lead Director. Based on the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Board believes that continuing with a combined Chairman/CEO is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
The Board determined that having one individual serve in both roles provides for clear leadership, accountability, and alignment on corporate strategy. The Board believes that combining the roles of Chairman and CEO puts Mr. Comma in the best position to use his in-depth knowledge of our industry, our business and its challenges, and our stakeholders, including our stockholders, employees, franchisees and guests, to provide the Board with the information and leadership needed to set agendas and direction for the Company. The Board does not believe that having an independent Chairman would make the Board's risk oversight processes more effective. The Board noted that, during Mr. Comma's tenure as Chairman and CEO, and Mr. Goebel's service as Lead Director, the Board has received timely and relevant information regarding the Company's business.

[END TABLE]
In reaching its conclusion, the Board also considered the longstanding policies and practices at Jack in the Box Inc. for strong, independent oversight, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a Board with a high degree of independence, including only one non-independent  member;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Board Committees (other than the Executive Committee) that are composed entirely of independent directors;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Board Committee Chairs who review and approve agendas before Committee meetings;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an annual evaluation of the performance of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer by the Compensation Committee,  which evaluation is then discussed with the independent directors of the Board in executive session;   
• regular executive sessions held by the Board and key Board Committees, attended only by independent directors;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the ability of the independent directors to call meetings of the Board and recommend agenda topics to be considered by  the Board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a strong, independent Lead Director who has oversight responsibility for executive sessions and information flow to the  Board.  
[END TABLE]
Based on these factors, the Board has concluded that retaining the current Board leadership structure provides valuable stability and effective leadership. 
Lead Director 
The independent directors have appointed Mr. Goebel to serve as Lead Director. Our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices provide for the Lead Director to fulfill the following functions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• set agendas for the executive sessions of the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• serve on the Executive Committee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• preside at the executive sessions of the independent directors held following each scheduled board meeting;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• act as a key communication channel between the Board and the CEO;   
• lead the Board in determining the format and adequacy of information the directors receive;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide the Chairman with input on agendas for Board meetings and the schedule of meetings in order to assure  sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• call meetings of independent directors; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if requested by major stockholders, ensure that he or she is available for consultation and direct communication.   
[END TABLE]
The Lead Director may perform other functions as the Board may direct. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Management is responsible for the Company's day-to-day risk management. The Board's role is to provide oversight of the processes designed to identify, assess and monitor key risks and risk mitigation activities. The Board fulfills its risk oversight responsibilities through (i) quarterly reports from the Head of Internal Audit (Internal Audit Head) to the Audit Committee relating to risk management and oversight; (ii) annual enterprise risk management discussions by the full Board with the Internal Audit Head and Company leadership; (iii) receiving reports directly from managers responsible for the management of particular business risks; and (iv) reports by each Committee Chair regarding the respective Committee's oversight of specific risk topics. 
The Board reviews cybersecurity risk with the Chief Information Officer regularly and has delegated oversight of other specific risk areas to Committees of the Board. For example, the Audit Committee discusses with Management the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps Management has taken to monitor and mitigate those risks. As another example, the Compensation Committee discusses with its independent consultant, Management and the Compensation Risk Committee the risks arising in connection with the design of the Company's compensation programs and succession planning. The risk oversight responsibility of each Board Committee is described in its committee charter available at http://investors.jackinthebox.com. 
A more detailed discussion of the Compensation Committee's oversight of compensation risk is found in the Section "Compensation Risk Analysis" contained later in this proxy.

[END TABLE]
The Board's Role in Succession Planning 
The Board expects Management to have an ongoing program for effective senior leadership development and succession. As reflected in our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices, the Board's practice is to have the CEO review annually with the full Board the abilities of the key senior managers and their likely successors. The Board also considers management succession issues when meeting in executive session at each Board meeting. Additionally, the 
 Board oversees ongoing plans for management development and retention, as well as executive succession, including CEO succession. At times, the Board will delegate to the Compensation Committee responsibility to review and advise on succession planning, in which case the Board expects the Committee to review such plans with Management and the Board and to make recommendations to the Board with respect thereto. 
Committees of the Board 
The Board of Directors has five standing committees: Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance, Finance, and Executive. The Board considers new committee and chair assignments, and the designation of a Lead Director, effective each February. Effective February 2018, the Board of Directors approved the Board Committee assignments for the year and re-designated David Goebel as the Lead Director. The current committee makeup is provided in the "Board Nominees" table in the Proxy Summary. In November 2018, the Board approved updates to the Committee assignments which will take effect following the 2019 annual meeting. 
The authority and responsibility of each Committee is summarized below. A more detailed description of the functions of the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and Finance Committees is included in each Committee charter available at http://investors.jackinthebox.com. 
Executive Committee. The Executive Committee is authorized to exercise all powers of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Company while the Board is not in session. The Executive Committee did not meet in fiscal 2018. 
Audit Committee. As more fully described in its charter, the Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors with overseeing: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the integrity of the Company's financial reports;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the independent registered public accountant's performance, qualifications and independence;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the performance of the Company's internal auditors; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Company's processes for identifying, evaluating, and addressing major financial, legal, regulatory compliance,  and enterprise risks.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has sole authority to select, evaluate, and, when appropriate, replace the Company's independent registered public accountants. The Audit Committee has appointed KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as its independent registered public accountants for fiscal 2019 and is asking the stockholders to ratify this appointment in Proposal 2. In the event the stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider the selection to determine, in its discretion, whether to retain KPMG or to select a different registered public accountant. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent auditing firm at any time during the year. 
The Audit Committee meets at least each quarter with KPMG, Management and the Company's Internal Audit Head, to review the Company's annual and interim consolidated financial results before the publication of quarterly earnings press releases and the filing of quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee also meets at least each quarter in private sessions with KPMG, Management, and the Internal Audit Head. The Audit Committee also oversees the Company's Business Ethics Program, which includes receiving a quarterly report from the Ethics Officer. The Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Audit Committee qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules. 
The Audit Committee held six meetings in fiscal 2018. Additional information regarding the Audit Committee is set forth in the "Report of the Audit Committee" section of this proxy. 
Compensation Committee. As more fully described in its charter, the Compensation Committee assists the Board in discharging the Board's responsibilities relating to Director and executive officer compensation, and it oversees the performance evaluation of Management. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the Company's compensation philosophy, and the compensation of executive officers, including short- and long-term goals, and metric and compensation components (e.g., cash, equity and other forms of compensation). The Compensation Committee discusses with Management and reports to the Board any significant risks associated with the design and administration

 of the Company's compensation programs and succession planning, and actions taken by Management to mitigate such risks. The Committee has approved the disclosures in the Company's "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement. The Compensation Committee held six meetings in fiscal 2018. 
Finance Committee. As more fully described in its charter, the Finance Committee assists the Board in advising and consulting with Management concerning financial matters of importance to the Company. Topics considered by the Committee include the Company's capital structure, financing arrangements, stock repurchase programs, capital investment policies, investment performance oversight for the Company's retirement plans, the budget process, and the financial implications of major acquisitions and divestitures. The Finance Committee discusses with Management and reports to the Board major risk exposures and the monitoring and mitigation activities undertaken by Management in connection with the matters overseen by the Committee, including proposed major transactions, capital structure, investment portfolio including employee benefit plan investments, financing arrangements, and share repurchase programs. The Finance Committee held seven meetings in fiscal 2018. 
Nominating and Governance Committee. As more fully described in its charter, the Nominating and Governance Committee duties include assessing the makeup and diversity of the Board, identifying and recommending qualified candidates to be nominated for election as directors at the Annual Meeting or to be appointed by the Board to fill an existing or newly created vacancy on the Board; recommending members of the Board to serve on each Board committee; and annually reviewing and recommending the leadership structure of the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee discusses with Management and reports to the Board major risk exposures in connection with matters overseen by the Committee. Its activities include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
All nominees for election as directors currently serve on the Board of Directors and are known to the Nominating and Governance Committee in that capacity. The Nominating and Governance Committee held four meetings in fiscal 2018. 
Committee Member Independence 
The Board has determined that each member of the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and Finance Committees is an independent director for purposes of the NASDAQ Listing Rules as well as under the additional Director Independence Guidelines adopted by the Board. In addition, the members of the Audit Committee are all independent as required under Rule 10A-3(b)(1)(ii) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the members of the 
 Compensation Committee meet the definitions of (i) a "non-employee director" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) an "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("IRC"), and (iii) the requirements of Rule 10C-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
Executive Sessions 
Our independent, non-employee Directors meet in executive session without Management present at each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board. Mr. Goebel is currently designated by the Board to act as the Lead Director for such executive sessions. 
The Audit Committee also holds executive sessions at each regularly scheduled meeting, and the other Committees of the Board meet in executive session as they deem appropriate. 
Board Composition and Refreshment 
Policy Regarding Consideration of Director Candidates and Makeup and Diversity of the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee has the responsibility to identify, screen, and recommend qualified candidates to the Board for nomination as directors. In evaluating director candidates, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers the

 qualifications listed in the Jack in the Box Inc. Corporate Governance Principles and Practices, which are available at http://investors.jackinthebox.com. 
The following are some of the factors generally considered by the Nominating and Governance Committee in evaluating director candidates: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the appropriate size of the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the perceived needs of the Company for particular skills, background, and business experience;

[BEGIN TABLE]
• the skills, background, reputation and experience of the nominees, including whether those qualities add to a diversity  of experiences, backgrounds, individuals, viewpoints and perspectives on the Board;

[BEGIN TABLE]
• interpersonal and communications skills and the benefits of a constructive working relationship among directors; and   
• the desire to balance the considerable benefits of continuity with the periodic injection of the fresh perspective  provided by new members.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Governance Committee may also consider such other factors as it may deem are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
Retirement Policy. The Board has adopted a retirement policy under which directors may not stand for election or be appointed after age 73. The Board does not believe it should establish term limits which could disadvantage the Company by forcing out directors whose tenure and experience continue to add value to the workings of the Board. 
Board Tenure Review Policy. The Company has a tenure review policy pursuant to which any director who has served more than 12 years on the Board shall submit to the Committee his or her voluntary offer to resign from the Board. The Committee undertakes a thorough review of any such director's continued effectiveness and appropriateness for service, and recommends to the full Board that it either accept or reject the offer of resignation; in the latter event, the long-tenured director may continue to serve on the Board and must re-submit his or her resignation offer every three years for subsequent review. 
Stockholder Recommendations and Board Nominations 
In order to be evaluated pursuant to the Nominating and Governance Committee's established procedures, stockholder recommendations for candidates for the Board must be sent in writing to the following address at least 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the previous year's Annual Meeting of Stockholders: 
Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of 
Directors c/o Office of the Corporate Secretary 
Jack in the Box Inc. 
9330 Balboa Avenue 
San Diego, CA 92123 
Any recommendation submitted by a stockholder to the Nominating and Governance Committee must include the same information concerning the potential candidate and the recommending stockholder as would be required under Article III, Section 3.16 of the Jack in the Box Inc. Bylaws if the stockholder wished to nominate the candidate directly. 
The Committee considers all candidates regardless of the source of the recommendation. In addition to stockholder recommendations, the Committee considers recommendations from current directors, Company personnel and others. The Company generally retains a search firm to assist it in identifying and screening candidates, and in conducting reference checks. The Committee applies the same standards in evaluating candidates submitted by stockholders as it does in evaluating candidates submitted by other sources. 
A candidate nominated by a stockholder for election at an Annual Meeting of Stockholders will not be eligible for election unless the stockholder proposing the nominee has provided timely notice of the nomination in accordance with the deadlines (at least 120 days and no more than 150 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the previous year's Annual Meeting of Stockholders) and other requirements set forth in the Company's Bylaws. Article III, Section 3.16 of the Company's Bylaws provides that, in order to be eligible for election as a director, a candidate must deliver to the Corporate Secretary statements indicating whether the candidate: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is a party to any voting commitment that has not been disclosed to the Company;

The foregoing is a summary of provisions of the Company's Bylaws, and is qualified by reference to the actual provisions of Article III, Section 3.16. 
Code of Conduct 
Jack in the Box Inc. is committed to establishing and maintaining an effective ethics and compliance program that is intended to increase the likelihood of preventing, detecting, and correcting ethical lapses and violations of law or Company policy. In 1998, the Company adopted a Code of Conduct (the "Code") which applies to all officers, and employees, as well as to our Board of Directors. The Company also provides our franchisees and significant vendors with our Code and with procedures for communicating any ethics or compliance concerns to the Company. The Code is revised from time to time, most recently in May 2018, following the sale of Qdoba Restaurant Corporation. 
The Code (also called "The Integrity Playbook") is available on the Company's website at http://investors.jackinthebox.com. We will disclose amendments to, or waivers of our Code that are required to be disclosed under the securities rules, by posting such information on the Company's website, www.jackintheboxinc.com. Any waiver of our Code for directors or executive officers must be approved by the Board of Directors. The Company did not grant any such waivers in fiscal 2018 and does not anticipate granting any such waiver in fiscal 2019. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No member of our Compensation Committee is an officer, former officer, or employee of the Company. During fiscal 2018, no member of the Compensation Committee had any relationship with the Company requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. During fiscal 2018, no interlocking relationship existed between any of our executive officers or Compensation Committee members, on the one hand, and the executive officers or Compensation Committee members of any other entity, on the other hand. 
Additional Corporate Governance Principles and Practices 
The Company has adopted Corporate Governance Principles and Practices which contain general principles and practices regarding the functioning of the Board of Directors and the Board Committees. The Nominating and Governance Committee regularly reviews the Principles and Practices and recommends revisions if and as appropriate. The full text of the Principles and Practices may be found at http://investors.jackinthebox.com. The Principles and Practices address many of the items discussed above, and also include the following items: 
Limitation on Other Board Service. Non-employee directors may not serve on the boards of more than three other public companies. Our Corporate Officers are generally limited to serving on no more than one outside public company board, taking into consideration the time commitment and potential business conflicts inherent in such service. 
Review of Director Skill Matrix. The Nominating and Governance Committee annually utilizes a skill matrix to assess the capabilities of the current directors and any needs for the Board as a whole. The matrix itself is updated if and as necessary to assure that it remains relevant to the evolving needs of the Company and the Board. 
Board, Committee, and Individual Director Evaluations. The directors annually participate in a robust evaluation process focusing on an assessment of Board operations as a whole and the service of each director. Additionally, each of the Audit, Compensation, Finance, and Nominating and Governance Committees conducts a separate evaluation of its own performance and the adequacy of its charter. The Nominating and Governance Committee coordinates the evaluation of individual directors and of the Board operations, and reviews and reports to the Board on the outcome of these self-evaluations. As part of the evaluation process most years, the Lead Director will meet individually with each director to generate and discuss any ideas for improving the effectiveness of the director and/or the Board. 
New Director Orientation and Continuing Education. The Board works with Management to schedule new-director orientation programs and continuing education programs for directors. Orientation is designed to familiarize new directors with the Company and the franchise restaurant industry as well as Company personnel, facilities, strategies and challenges, and corporate governance practices, including board ethics. Continuing education programs may include in-house and third-party presentations and programs.

     DIRECTOR COMPENSATION AND STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES               
[END TABLE]
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION AND STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") is responsible for reviewing and recommending to the Board the form and amount of compensation for our non-employee directors. The following discussion of compensation and stock ownership guidelines applies only to our non-employee directors and does not apply to Mr. Comma. Mr. Comma is an employee of the Company, compensated as an executive officer, and does not receive additional compensation for service as a director. 
The Board believes that total compensation for directors should reflect the work required in both (i) their ongoing oversight and governance role and (ii) their continuous focus on driving long-term performance and stockholder value. The compensation program is designed to provide pay that is competitive with directors in the Company's Peer Group. (The methodology used in determining the companies in the Peer Group, and the companies in the Fiscal 2018 Peer Group are described in Section III.b of the Compensation Discussion & Analysis ("CD&A") in this Proxy Statement). The program consists of a combination of cash retainers and equity awards in the form of time-vested restricted stock units ("RSUs"). "Competitive" is defined as approximating the 50th percentile of pay of Peer Group directors. 
Director Compensation Program Review and Changes 
Director compensation is reviewed periodically with an independent compensation consultant. Any changes to director cash retainers and/or annual stock award values generally occur only after such review. 
During 2018, the Committee engaged the services of an independent consulting firm (other than its regular independent executive compensation consultant) to evaluate director compensation for future fiscal years. No changes to director compensation are planned for fiscal 2019. 
Annual Compensation Program a. Cash Retainers 
Each director receives an annual cash retainer for his or her service on the Board, service on Board committees, service as chair of a Board committee, and service as Lead Director, as applicable. There are no meeting fees. Retainers are paid in a single installment on the first business day of the month following the Annual Stockholder Meeting each year. Each new director receives a prorated retainer that is paid on the first business day of the month following his or her appointment to the Board.

c. Annual Equity Grant — Restricted Stock Units 
Each director receives an annual grant of RSUs under the Jack in the Box Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan ("2004 Stock Incentive Plan"). We grant RSUs for the following reasons: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• RSUs cause the value of directors' share ownership to rise and fall with that of other stockholders, serving the  objective of alignment with stockholder interests.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• RSUs are a prevalent form of director compensation among the Company's Peer Group.  
[END TABLE]
The Company determines the number of RSUs to be granted by dividing the annual equity award value of $90,000 by the closing price of Common Stock on the date of the annual grant, which is shortly after the annual meeting of stockholders, provided the director is providing services to the Company on the date of grant. RSUs vest on the earlier of the first business day 12 months from the date of grant (unless deferred) or upon the director's termination of service with the Board. Directors may elect to defer receipt of shares issuable under RSU awards to termination of their Board service; and beginning with the February 2015 RSU awards, shares that have vested and been deferred earn a dividend (in the form of Common Stock equivalents) to the same extent the Company pays a dividend on outstanding shares. 
Director Ownership and Stock Holding Requirements 
The Board believes that all directors should maintain a meaningful personal financial stake in the Company to align their long-term interests with those of our stockholders. Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices, the Board desires that, within a reasonable period after joining the Board, each non-employee director hold Common Stock with a value of at least three times the annual cash Board service retainer. Direct holdings, unvested and deferred RSUs, and Common Stock equivalents count toward ownership value. In addition, each director is required to hold at least 50% of the shares resulting from RSU grants until termination of his or her Board service. The table below shows each non-employee director's ownership value as of fiscal year-end 2018, based on a closing stock price of $83.83 on the last trading day of fiscal 2018, September 28, 2018. Each of our directors meets the stock holding requirement, except Ms. Yeung who joined the board in April 2017 and is still within the transition period for compliance.

                 REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE   
[END TABLE]
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The following is the report of the Audit Committee with respect to Jack in the Box Inc.'s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the annual consolidated financial statements with Management and KPMG LLP ("KPMG"), the Company's independent registered public accounting firm (the "independent auditor"). Management is responsible for the financial reporting process, the system of internal controls, including internal control over financial reporting, risk management and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The independent auditor is responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, as well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the independent auditor. The Audit Committee met on six occasions in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. The Audit Committee met with the independent auditor, with and without Management present, to discuss the results of its audit and quarterly reviews of the Company's financial statements. The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent auditor the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Statement on Auditing Standards No. 16 Communications with Audit Committees. The Audit Committee also received from the Company's independent auditor the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding their communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent auditor its independence from the Company. The Audit 
 Committee also has considered whether the provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with the independence of the independent auditor. 
In connection with the Company's sale of Qdoba that closed in March 2018, the Audit Committee approved the scope and fees for the engagement of KPMG to perform audit services in connection with the Qdoba business on a separate, carved-out basis. 
In performing its functions, the Audit Committee acts only in an oversight capacity and necessarily relies on the work and assurances of the Company's Management and internal audit group as well as the Company's independent auditor whose reports express opinions on the conformity of the Company's annual financial statements with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. 
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, and the reports of KPMG, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors approved, the inclusion of the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

PROPOSAL TWO — RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 
The Audit Committee has appointed the firm of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accountants for fiscal year 2019. Although action by stockholders in this matter is not required, the Audit Committee believes it is appropriate to seek stockholder ratification of this appointment. 
KPMG LLP has served as the Company's independent auditor since 1986. One or more representatives of KPMG LLP is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement and to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders present at the meeting. The following proposal will be presented at the Annual Meeting: 
Action by the Audit Committee appointing KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accountants to conduct the annual audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending September 29, 2019, is hereby ratified, confirmed and approved. 
Vote Required for Ratification 
Ratification requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on such proposal. Abstentions will be included in the number of shares present and entitled to vote, and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" this proposal. Brokers have discretionary authority to vote uninstructed shares on this matter. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS.

     PROPOSAL THREE — ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                 
[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL THREE — ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
As required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), stockholders have the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers ("NEOs") as disclosed in the CD&A, the compensation tables, narrative disclosures, and related footnotes included in this Proxy Statement. This "Say on Pay" vote is advisory, and therefore nonbinding on the Company; however, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which is comprised entirely of independent directors, values the opinions of our stockholders and will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. We received a 98.2% favorable vote on Say on Pay at our February 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
The Compensation Committee engages the services of an independent compensation consultant to advise on executive compensation matters, including competitive compensation targets within the marketplace, and Company performance goals and analysis. 
As discussed in more detail in the CD&A, our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain a talented team of executives who can deliver on our commitment to build long-term stockholder value. The Compensation Committee believes our program is competitive in the marketplace, links pay to performance by rewarding our NEOs for achievement of short-term and long-term financial and operational goals (and, in some years, strategic goals), and aligns our NEOs' interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders by providing a mix of performance and service-based equity awards. Specifically, a significant portion of compensation paid to our NEOs is based on the Company's business performance. 
Our fiscal 2018 NEOs include our Chief Executive Officer (CEO); current and former Chief Financial Officers (CFO); Chief of Staff and Strategy; Chief Legal and Risk Officer; Senior Vice President of Finance, Controller and Treasurer; and former Jack in the Box Brand President. 
The Compensation Committee believes stockholders should consider the following key components of our compensation programs and governance practices when voting on this proposal: 
Pay for Performance Orientation
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competitive, Targeted Pay. We target executive base salary, total cash compensation, and total direct  compensation to deliver competitive pay for performance that meets expectations, and the opportunity for higher pay only if performance exceeds expectations.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay Mix. Our executive compensation program includes a mix of fixed and variable compensation, with a  significant portion of target compensation in the form of annual and long-term incentives that directly tie to achievement of key Company goals and drive long-term stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-Term Incentives ("LTI"). Annual equity awards for our NEOs included a mix of stock options,  and performance shares ("PSUs") and time-vested restricted stock units ("RSUs") with holding requirements. The PSUs vest three years after the grant, depending on the Company's achievement of goals over a three-fiscal year  period. The grant guidelines, goals, and performance metrics for the PSU awards granted in December 2017 for the performance period fiscal 2018-2020 are further described in the CD&A.   
• 2018 Annual Incentives. In 2018, our NEOs' annual incentive opportunity was based on (1) Jack in  the Box Operating Earnings Before Interest and Taxes ("Operating EBIT"), (2) Jack in the Box Restaurant Operating Margin ("ROM"), and (3) Strategic goals (subject to meeting minimum threshold Operating EBIT performance)  that were tied to business model transformation, including (a) refranchising, (b) completing the sale of Qdoba and implementing its separation, (c) organizational restructuring on path to reducing G&A, and (d) capital  structure and borrowing capacity optimization. The incentive payout was based on the Company performing between threshold and target performance on the two financial targets (Jack in the Box Operating EBIT and ROM), and above target performance on  the strategic goals, as determined by the Compensation Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Messrs. Tucker and Rebel, who were employed for less than the full fiscal year received a prorated annual incentive  payout based on Company performance and time employed. Ms. Allen, who separated from the Company in February 2018, did not receive an annual incentive payment.

                 PROPOSAL THREE — ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION     
[END TABLE]
Alignment with Long-Term Stockholder Interests 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity Awards. The largest portion of our NEOs' total pay is delivered in equity awards (including  options, PSUs and RSUs), with such equity awards accounting for 69% of the CEO's targeted total direct compensation in fiscal 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Option awards and time-vested RSUs have multi-year vesting; performance awards are typically based on achievement of  financial goals over a three-fiscal year period. All RSUs, and earned PSUs beginning with the fiscal 2016 PSU award are subject to a holding requirement under which our NEOs and other executive officers must hold at least 50% of after-tax net shares until termination or retirement.   
• Stock Ownership Requirement. Our NEOs and other executive officers are required to own a significant amount  of the Company's stock, based on a multiple of salary.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Evergreen – No Repricing. We do not have an evergreen plan, and we  prohibit repricing equity awards without stockholder approval.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Pledging or Hedging. We prohibit Section 16 officers (including our NEOs and other executive officers)  from pledging Company stock as collateral for any obligation or engaging in hedging transactions involving our stock.   
[END TABLE]
Recommendation 
With the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee has thoughtfully developed our executive compensation programs, setting NEO compensation that links pay to performance and provides an appropriate balance of short-term and long-term incentives that are aligned with long-term stockholder interests. Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote in favor of the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that Jack in the Box Inc. stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as described in the Company's Compensation Discussion and Analysis, tabular disclosures, and other narrative disclosures in this Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders." 
Approval of the Say on Pay proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on such proposal. Abstentions will be included in the number of shares present and entitled to vote, and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal. Broker non-votes will not count as votes cast "FOR" or "AGAINST" the proposal, and will not be included in calculating the number of votes necessary for approval for this proposal. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Jack in the Box is committed to responsibly building long-term stockholder value. Our executive compensation program is designed to deliver on this commitment by using a balanced performance measurement framework that is aligned with the key drivers of Company performance and stockholder value creation. This executive summary provides an overview of our fiscal 2018 performance, compensation framework and pay actions, targeted total direct compensation, and CEO pay for performance alignment. 
a. Fiscal 2018 Review 
Fiscal 2018 was marked by substantial accomplishments on key strategic initiatives, as the Company largely completed its transformation to an asset-light, single-brand organization while operating in a highly competitive restaurant industry. However, the Company did not meet our annual financial targets which directly impacted annual incentive payouts. 
Returns to Stockholders 
2018 was our fifth consecutive year of returning more than $300 million to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, which have totaled nearly $1.8 billion over those five years. For fiscal 2018 our cumulative total shareholder return (TSR) declined 16%. However, our TSR over the past five years increased at a compound annual rate of 17.5%.

b. Fiscal 2018 Compensation Framework and Key Pay Actions 
Our executive compensation program is designed to motivate, engage, and retain a talented executive leadership team and to appropriately reward them for their contributions to our business. Our performance measurement framework consists of a combination of financial and operational performance metrics, varying time horizons, and multiple equity vehicles. The largest portion of our executives' compensation is variable and is directly tied to the achievement of annual and longer-term financial and operating goals. In combination, these metrics and variables provide a balanced and comprehensive view of performance, and drive the Committee's executive compensation decisions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   As set forth in Notes 1 and 2 in the Proxy Summary, Restaurant-Level EBITDA, ROM and Operating EPS are non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, please refer to Appendix A.

[END TABLE]
Consistent with the fundamental principle that compensation programs should align pay with performance, the Company's fiscal 2018 performance directly impacted compensation decisions and pay outcomes, as shown in the chart below that summarizes the compensation framework, key fiscal 2018 performance measures and 2018 pay actions. 
Performance Measurement Framework with 2018 Pay Actions Base Salary Our NEOs received salary increases in December 2017, ranging from 2.4% to 2.8% (average of 2.5%, which was aligned with increases for the broader staff and restaurant management population)_ These increases were given to maintain market competitiveness, and to recognize individual performance, skills, experience, and criticality of the position_ Mr. Rebel and Ms. Allen, who left the Company during fiscal 2018 , did not receive pay increases. Annual Incentive Financial Goals JIB Operating EBIT from Continuing Operations (50%) JIB Restaurant Operating Margin (ROM) (30%) Strategic Goals Business Model Transformation (20%), subject to meeting minimum threshold Operating EBIT performance: Refranchising Qdoba sale and separation Organization restructure/G&A targets Capital structure and borrowing capacity Fiscal 2018 Results Annual incentives were paid at 69.1% of target payout, based on the weighted results below: JIB Operating EBIT performance was above threshold and below target, resulting in 39.0% of target payout for this goal JIB ROM performance was just under target, resulting in 82.0% of target payout for this goal Strategic goals: the Compensation Committee determined 125% of target payout based on the Company's performance against the goals and the achievement of the minimum threshold JIB Operating EBIT goal Long-Term Incentive 34% Stock Options 33% vesting per year over three years, 7 year term 33% Performance Shares (PSUs) Vesting based on PSU goal achievement over three-fiscal year performance period, with 50% holding requirement 33% Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) 25% vesting per year over four years, with 50% holding requirement ROIC Goal (33%) Return on Invested Capital From Operations (ROIC") Sales Goal (67%) Systemwide Sales 2018 Actions For the FY 2018-2020 PSU grant, the Committee set only a Systemwide Sales Growth goal, with the intention to set a second goal, adjusted ROIC from Operations, in November 2018, based on the third fiscal year of the performance period (FY 2020). The two PSU goals are typically weighted equally; however, the Committee applied a different practice in 2018 for the reasons described in CD&A section Vl.c. "Fiscal 2018 Compensation - Long Term Incentive Compensation." For the FY 2016-2018 PSU grant, the Committee certified goal achievement and approved a payout of 72.5% of target PSUs granted based on performance during the three-fiscal year performance period, as described in CD&A section VI.c.

c. Fiscal 2018 Targeted Total Direct Compensation Mix 
The chart below shows the percentage breakdown of targeted total direct compensation ("TDC") (consisting of base salary, target annual incentive, and target long-term incentive) for each NEO employed at fiscal year-end. Target TDC is set within a competitive range of the median of "Market" compensation based on market data and advice provided by the Committee's independent consultant (as described in CD&A Section III.a "Compensation Competitive Analysis"). Consistent with our objective of pay for performance alignment (described in Section II "Compensation Principles and Objectives"), the largest portion of compensation is variable, at-risk pay in the form of annual and long-term incentives, including annual incentive, stock options and PSUs. In fiscal 2018, 61.0% of our CEO's pay was at risk, and 45%-54% of pay for our other NEOs (excluding new CFO Tucker who joined the Company mid-fiscal year). 
61.0% at-risk Comma CEO Tucker (1) Blankenship Rudolph Melancon Bace Salary Annual Incentive Stock Options PSUs Time-Vested RSUs 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  For Mr. Tucker, who was hired in March 2018, the breakdown reflects his prorated base salary and incentive,  and a new hire RSU grant in April 2018.    
  (2)  The targeted TDC does not include (1) the conditional bonus for Mr. Melancon or (2) special RSU awards to  Dr. Blankenship and Mr. Rudolph made during 2018 outside our regular compensation program for the circumstances described in Sections VI.b "Performance-Based Annual Incentive Compensation (Cash)" and VI.c "Long-Term  Incentive Compensation", respectively.    
[END TABLE]
CEO - 2018 Total Direct Compensation 
For fiscal 2018, the Committee determined that the target TDC for our CEO would be $5.85 million (consisting of base salary of $925,000, target annual incentive of $925,000, and target long-term incentive of $4.0 million), which was approximately 5% below the TDC Market median. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Salary    $ 925,000      $ 919,711   
 Annual Incentive    $ 925,000      $ 639,175   
 Long-Term Incentive (LTI)    $ 4,000,000      $ 3,358,592   
 Fiscal 2018 Annual TDC    $ 5,850,000      $ 4,917,478   
[END TABLE]
The SCT column at left shows the CEO's actual TDC-- as reflected in the "Summary Compensation" ("SCT") and "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" tables. The difference between Target and SCT compensation is attributable to: (a) on the Annual Incentive, Mr. Comma's fiscal 2018 payout amounting to only 69.1% of target (due to the Company under-performing overall target performance on its goals); and (b) on the LTI: (i) the difference in stock price of the long-term incentive awards between the price on the actual grant date and the earlier 60-day average price used by the Committee to establish the number of options, RSUs and PSUs to be granted; and (ii) the SCT use of the grant date fair value for RSU and PSU awards, as described in the footnotes to those tables. 
The LTI components are described in detail in proxy Section VI.d "Fiscal 2018 Compensation — Long-Term Incentive Compensation."

d. CEO Compensation and Pay for Performance Alignment 
Each year, the Committee assesses our CEO's actual compensation relative to the Company's performance. The following graph shows the relationship of our CEO's actual TDC (as reflected in the SCT) compared to our cumulative total shareholder return (TSR) performance in each of the last five fiscal years. Actual TDC in this chart includes base salary, actual annual incentive earned for the year, and the long-term incentive value based on the stock price at the time of grant, as detailed in the section immediately above. 
As illustrated, pay and performance are generally aligned— with higher pay in the earlier years given strong financial and TSR performance, and lower pay when financial performance did not meet goals (in fiscal 2017 and 2018) and TSR declined (in fiscal 2018).

  (1)   The graph above shows the cumulative return to holders of the Company's Common Stock at September 30th of each year assuming $100 was invested on September 30, 2013, and assumes reinvestment of dividends. The Company began paying dividends in fiscal 2014.    
  (2)   2016 Special Retention Award: In fiscal 2016, the CEO was awarded a special stock award (reflected in the top  portion of the FY 2016 bar) to recognize the criticality of his role and the Company's strong performance under his leadership, and to incentivize him to remain with the Company while providing measured increases to ongoing, target TDC. This one-time RSU grant (detailed in our 2017 Proxy Statement) cliff vests 50% four years from the grant date and the remaining 50% five years from grant.

e. Say-on-Pay Feedback from Stockholders 
In 2018, we sought an advisory vote from our stockholders regarding our executive compensation program and received a 98.2% favorable vote supporting the program. Each year, the Committee considers the results of the advisory vote as it completes its annual review of each pay element and the compensation provided to our NEOs and other executives. Given the significant level of stockholder support and our stockholder outreach throughout the year, the Committee concluded that our executive compensation program continues to align executive pay with stockholder interests and provides competitive pay that encourages retention and effectively incentivizes performance of talented NEOs and executives. Accordingly, the Committee determined not to make any significant changes to our programs as a result of the vote. The Committee will continue to consider the outcome of our say-on-pay votes and our stockholders' views when making future compensation decisions for the NEOs and executives.

[END TABLE]
II. COMPENSATION PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES 
The Committee focuses on the following principles and objectives in determining and measuring the various components of our executive compensation programs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competitive target pay structure, including base salary, annual incentive, and long-term incentives that enable  us to attract and retain talented, experienced executives who can deliver successful business performance and drive long-term stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay for performance alignment, with the largest proportion of executive pay in the form of annual and long-term  incentives that directly tie payouts, if any, to the achievement of corporate goals and strategies.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Comprehensive goal setting, with financial, operational, and/or strategic performance metrics that drive  long-term stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentivizing balanced short-term and long-term executive decision making, through variable compensation  components (cash and stock) using varying timeframes.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executive alignment with stockholder interests, through stock ownership and holding requirements that build and  maintain an executive's equity investment in the company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sound governance practices and principles in plan design and pay decisions, with the Committee considering both  what and how performance is achieved.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Management of compensation risk, by establishing incentive goals that avoid placing too much emphasis on any one  metric or performance time horizon, thereby discouraging excessive or unwise risk-taking.  
[END TABLE]
Internal Pay Equity 
Our compensation programs are designed so that potential compensation opportunities are appropriate relative to each executive's level of responsibility and impact. While program design is similar for executives at the same level, actual pay may vary based on job scope and individual performance over time. In fiscal 2018, our CEO's targeted TDC was approximately 3.35 times higher than the next highest paid executive.

III. COMPENSATION COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS 
a. Competitive Analysis 
Each year the Committee relies on multiple data points to assess the competitiveness of our executive compensation program and the individual compensation of our executives. Information the Committee uses to perform this analysis includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's performance against its financial and operational goals;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The mix of short-term and long-term compensation in the form of cash and equity-based compensation;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company's financial performance relative to our Peer Group.   
[END TABLE]
b. Fiscal 2018 Peer Group 
We use a Peer Group to assess the competitive pay levels of our NEOs and other executives, and to evaluate program design elements. The Committee believes the Peer Group should consist of a combination of restaurant and retail companies because these are the primary companies with which we compete for executive talent. 
Our practice in selecting Peer Group companies is to look for companies in the restaurant industry that are comparable in size (GAAP revenue, market capitalization and systemwide sales) generally between 0.5x and 2.0x Jack in the Box Inc. The Committee also considers number of locations, business models and consumer focus. In reviewing systemwide sales comparisons, the Committee focuses on the eleven restaurant companies in the Peer Group (for which comparative data is applicable). Given the small number of public restaurant companies that met the above criteria, our Peer Group also included retail companies, using the same criteria described above. 
For 2018, the Committee's independent consultant recommended that no changes be made to the Peer Group. At the time the Committee re-affirmed using the same Peer Group for fiscal 2018, the Peer Group members' median trailing four-quarter revenue was $2.4 billion and the median market capitalization (as most recently reported) was $2.0 billion, compared with projected Jack in the Box Inc. trailing four-quarter revenue of $1.6 billion and market cap of $2.9 billion. For the Peer Group restaurant companies, median systemwide sales (as of their most recently completed fiscal year) was $3.8 billion, compared to $4.4 billion projected for Jack in the Box Inc. (Jack in the Box and Qdoba brands.)

The Committee has retained Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC ("Semler Brossy" or the "Consultant") as its independent compensation consultant since January 2010. The Consultant reports directly to the Committee and performs no other work for the Company. The Committee has analyzed whether the work of Semler Brossy as a compensation consultant raises any conflict of interest, taking into consideration the following factors: (i) whether Semler Brossy provides any other services to the Company; (ii) the amount of fees paid by the Company to Semler Brossy as a percentage of Semler Brossy's total revenue; (iii) Semler Brossy's policies and procedures that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest; (iv) any business or personal relationship of Semler Brossy or the individual compensation advisors employed by the firm with any executive officers of the Company; (v) any business or personal relationship of the individual compensation advisors with any member of the Committee; and (vi) any stock of the Company owned by Semler Brossy or the individual compensation advisors whom it employs. The Committee has determined, based on its analysis of the above factors, that the work of Semler Brossy and the individual compensation advisors employed by Semler Brossy as compensation consultants to the Committee has not created any conflict of interest. 
The Consultant does the following for the Committee:

c. Role of the CEO in Compensation Decisions 
When making decisions on executive compensation, the Committee considers input from the Company's CEO, who reviews the performance of the other NEOs and executives and provides his recommendations to the Committee on NEOs' and other executives' compensation. The Company's Chief of Staff and Strategy, compensation and benefits department, and the CFO and finance department also provide information and answer the Committee's questions regarding Company financial targets and projections. The CEO meets privately with the Committee and its Consultant to discuss his executive pay recommendations, and provides his insight and perspectives to the Committee on the reports and recommendations of the Committee's Consultant relating to plan design and strategies, goal setting, payout structure, stock grants and holding requirements, and related topics.

b. Performance-Based Annual Incentive Compensation (Cash) 
In December 2017, the Committee approved the annual incentive goals for fiscal 2018 consistent with the Company's fiscal 2018 operational plan and budget approved by the Board. The annual goals were based on: (1) Jack in the Box Operating EBIT(1); (2) Restaurant Operating Margin (ROM)(2), and (3) strategic goals related to the Company's business model transformation (detailed in the chart at bottom), weighted as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Jack in the Box Operating EBIT      50%   
 Jack in the Box ROM      30%   
 Strategic Goals      20%   
[END TABLE]
When setting fiscal 2018 annual incentive goals, the Committee used a rigorous process to set challenging, yet reasonably attainable goals aimed at ensuring appropriate and competitive levels of payout relative to performance achievement. The process included consideration of: (1) the Company's fiscal 2018 operational plan and budget that included then-current economic conditions; (2) current and projected performance of the restaurant industry in general and companies within our peer group, and other potential internal and external events that could impact future sales and earnings levels; (3) a sensitivity analysis of Company and brand performance results relative to the incentive targets; and (4) the advice of the Committee's Consultant. Based on this review, the Committee set goals based on key financial and other metrics that it believed would increase stockholder value if achieved, with target and higher goals set at challenging, yet reasonable levels. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Jack in the Box Operating Earnings Before Interest and Taxes ("Operating EBIT") (1)    This is a key performance metric for measuring operational performance. In fiscal 2018, the metric excluded gains/losses from refranchising, restructuring costs, and shared services and unallocated costs due to the ongoing process  of separating Qdoba and supporting transition services agreements. 
 Jack in the Box Restaurant Operating Margin (ROM) (2)    ROM measures how effectively the Company manages its business operations and costs, and is a key performance metric for alignment with our franchise operators, our franchising strategy, and our stockholders and potential  investors. 
 Strategic Goals: 1. Jack in the Box Refranchising 2. Sale of Qdoba and transition services agreements 3. Organization restructure and G&A targets 4.

Qdoba Sale Related Bonus 
Mr. Melancon was provided a one-time conditional bonus of $200,000 in 2018 for taking on significant additional responsibilities related to the evaluation of Qdoba strategic alternatives, and to assure his continued employment through any potential sale or disposition of the Qdoba business and related transition and restructuring activities. This amount, equal to 60% of his base salary, was determined in consultation with the Committee's independent consultant and set to reflect an amount commensurate with the scope and additional time and effort required. The bonus was earned and paid in two equal installments, the first in November 2017 following the significant efforts of Mr. Melancon in the sale due diligence process, and the second in April 2018 based on Mr. Melancon's continued employment though such date and satisfactory coordination of the Qdoba transition services.

c. Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
In fiscal 2018, the LTI program for all our Company NEOs was comprised of 34% stock options, 33% performance shares ("PSUs"), and 33% restricted stock units ("RSUs"). The Committee chose these forms of equity awards and weightings to (a) provide options which align executive pay with the creation of value for our stockholders through stock price appreciation, (b) provide PSUs that directly link executive pay to achievement of longer-term Company financial and operational goals, and (c) provide time-vested RSUs to facilitate stock ownership and retention. Equity awards were not granted to Mr. Rebel or Ms. Allen who separated from the Company in fiscal 2018. 
Each year, the Committee's Consultant advises the Committee on the LTI grant guidelines that reflect approximately the median of Market TDC when combined with base salary and the target annual incentive. For the fiscal 2018 grant, the Committee considered the equity grant guidelines, the Company's overall performance, recommendations from the CEO (except with regard to his own compensation), and input from the Consultant to determine the actual grant value for each NEO. The chart below illustrates our LTI structure and the key elements of each type of award granted to our NEOs and other executives for fiscal 2018.

Performance Shares 
PSUs are granted annually and vest after three years based on achievement of performance metrics that are established for the three-fiscal year performance period ("Performance Period"). The Committee sets specific performance goals (including minimum, target, and maximum) either (a) at the beginning of the Performance Period, or (b) annually at the beginning of each fiscal year of the Performance Period, depending on the goal; in the latter case, the threshold performance goals set for the second and third years of the Performance Period generally may not be lower than the threshold set for the first year. The Committee believes that for some metrics, setting annual performance goals improves its visibility into the relative attainability and difficulty of the goals and, as a result, better aligns performance and payouts. Vesting ranges from 0% to 150% of the target number of shares granted; the threshold payout (50% of target) requires achieving an established minimum performance requirement (there is no payout if performance doesn't meet the minimum requirement). 
PSUs Granted in Fiscal 2018: In November 2017, the Committee granted PSU awards to our NEOs and executives for the fiscal 2018-2020 Performance Period. Typically, the PSU grants are based on two equally-weighted metrics: (a) adjusted ROIC from Operations and (b) Systemwide Sales Growth, with the Committee setting the three-year ROIC goal at the beginning of the three-year performance period, and setting each annual sales goal at the beginning of each fiscal year. However, in November 2017, the Committee set only a systemwide sales goal for the first year. The Committee believed this was necessary due to the Company having just entered into an agreement to sell Qdoba and not yet having certainty the deal would close, which impacted the Committee's ability to set an appropriate forward-looking ROIC goal until— if and when— the deal closed. 
The following year, in November 2018, the Committee set an ROIC goal for the remainder of the performance period, 
 (measured at FYE 2020), weighted 33% for the entire 3-year grant). At that time, the Committee also followed its standard practice of setting the second year annual sales goal. The remaining fiscal 2020 sales goal will be set at the beginning of fiscal 2020. 
These two metrics, systemwide sales and ROIC, support the critical drivers of our success: growing top-line profitable sales, and encouraging prudent deployment of capital to drive the business. For each metric, the Committee believes the goals set are appropriately challenging, yet reasonably attainable. The actual goals are not being disclosed before the end of the Performance Period because we believe such disclosure would be competitively harmful. 
PSUs Vested in 2018: PSUs granted in November 2015 (based on the three-year fiscal 2016-2018 Performance Period) vested and were payable in November 2018. Consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, the payout level was determined based on the average of (a) the performance level attained in each fiscal year of the Performance Period for the Systemwide Sales measure (both brands in 2016 and 2017, and the Jack in the Box brand only in 2018, weighted 50%) and (b) the performance level attained on the ROIC measure set at the beginning of the three-year Performance Period for fiscal 2018, the third year of the Performance Period (weighted 50%).The threshold, target and maximum goals, weighting and payout are shown on the chart below. The achievement level on the ROIC from Operations goal was just above the target ROIC goal of 16.0% (or 104.3% of target). Achievement on the Systemwide Sales goal was above threshold but below target in each of fiscal 2016 and 2017, and below threshold in fiscal 2018 (resulting in an average achievement level of 20.4% on the sales goals). Together, this resulted in a weighted payout of 72.5% of the target number of PSUs granted to NEOs employed for the full Performance Period.

2018 Special Equity Awards 
During fiscal 2018, the Committee approved special equity awards for three NEOs as described below, with each grant and amount determined in consultation with the Committee's independent consultant: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To new CFO, Mr. Tucker, who joined the Company mid-year, a grant of 4,486  RSUs in recognition of his forfeiture of equity grants and bonus from his prior employment, and to provide him an equity stake in the Company prior to the next annual grant in fiscal 2019. The Committee determined the RSU grant was necessary and  appropriate to induce Mr. Tucker to join the Company (giving consideration to, among other things, Market compensation, his experience and the compensation he would be foregoing at his prior employment) and retain and incentivize Mr. Tucker in his critical role as CFO.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To CSS Dr. Blankenship, a one-time grant of stock valued at $200,000  (2,110 RSUs) in recognition of serving as interim Chief Operating Officer ("COO") while a search for a COO was underway, granted February 27, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To CLO Mr. Rudolph, a one-time grant of stock valued at $200,000 (2,215  RSUs) in recognition of his critical role in driving the activities that culminated in the sale of Qdoba, granted March 23, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Each of the special equity awards vests over three years and is detailed in the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table. 
d. Cash Perquisite Allowance 
Executives receive an annual cash perquisite allowance, which was instituted in 2011 to replace reimbursements under the prior executive medical reimbursement program and to consolidate multiple allowances (in addition to eliminating administrative expenses to the Company). This benefit is intended to contribute to the executive's financial planning expenses and use of their personal automobile and cell phone for business purposes, and has not increased since 2011. The annualized allowance, shown in the following table, is paid bi-weekly and is taxable to each executive, with no tax gross-up. NEOs employed for less than a full fiscal year receive a prorated portion of the allowance based on the time of employment with the Company during fiscal 2018.

VII. ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION INFORMATION 
a. Executive Stock Ownership and Holding Requirements 
Our senior vice presidents and higher, including our NEOs, are subject to stock ownership guidelines. The guidelines are intended to assure that these executives maintain a meaningful financial stake in the Company in order to promote a long-term perspective in managing the business, and to align their long-term financial interests with those of our stockholders. Our stock ownership guidelines consist of (1) an ownership requirement set as a multiple of salary and (2) a holding requirement.

c. Retirement Plans 
The Company's retirement plans are designed to provide our employees, including our NEOs and other executives, with some retirement income security. These plans reward for service and provide an additional incentive for our employees to build long-term careers at Jack in the Box. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Defined Benefit Pension Plan ("Retirement Plan"). All employees hired before 2011 (including five of  our NEOs) are participants in a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. This plan was closed to new employees hired on or after January 1, 2011, and "sunset" on December 31, 2015. This  means that participants no longer accrue additional benefits based on additional pay and service as of that date. Participants may begin receiving their accrued benefit on or after retirement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"). The SERP is unfunded and not qualified for tax  purposes. The SERP was established in 1990 to address IRC limitations on pension benefits that could be accrued under our tax-qualified pension plan. Effective January 1, 2007, the SERP was closed to new  participants. Three of our NEOs are participants in the SERP.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Qualified 401(k) Plan ("401(k) Plan"). The qualified defined contribution plan, the 401(k) Plan, is  available to all Company employees, and offers employees who participate in the plan by deferring eligible compensation, a Company matching contribution equal to 100% of the first four percent of compensation deferred, with immediate vesting. Our  NEOs became eligible to defer base salary and annual incentive compensation through the 401(k) Plan beginning effective January 1, 2016 (prior to that time, our executive officers and other highly compensated employees were excluded from  participating). All of our NEOs participated in the 401(k) Plan during fiscal 2018.   
• Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan ("EDCP"). In light of  IRC limits imposed on the 401(k) Plan, we sponsor the EDCP into which our executive officers and other highly compensated employees may also defer up to 50% of their base salary and up to 85% of their annual incentive compensation. In coordination  with the 401(k) Plan changes that took effect January 1, 2016, the EDCP Company matching contribution (previously 100% of the first three percent of compensation deferred) was replaced with a "restoration matching contribution." This  means the Company will match up to the full four percent potential matching contribution for participants whose compensation or deferrals to the 401(k) Plan (and related Company matching contributions) are limited due to the IRC limits applicable to  the 401(k) Plan. A participant must be employed on the last day of the calendar year to receive the restoration matching contribution, which is then 100% vested. Company matching contributions made prior to January 1, 2016 vested at a rate of  25% per year (such that the match fully vests after completion of four full years of service with the Company). Participants choose from an array of investment options, and their accounts are credited based upon the performance of the investment  options. These obligations under the EDCP represent an unsecured claim against the Company. All of our NEOs, except Mr. Tucker, participated in the EDCP during 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Enhanced EDCP. Due to the closure of the SERP in 2007, employees hired or promoted into a Corporate Vice  President position or above between January 1, 2007 and May 7, 2015 receive a supplemental contribution to their EDCP account of four percent of base salary and annual incentive each year for up to ten years. During fiscal 2018, two of our  NEOs, received the enhanced EDCP.  
[END TABLE]
d. Prohibition of Pledging and Hedging Transactions 
The Company prohibits directors and Section 16 officers from engaging in certain derivative transactions in Company stock, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Trading in "puts", "calls", or other derivative vehicles involving the Company's securities  (often referred to as hedging transactions);   
• Engaging in zero-cost collars, forward sales contracts or other hedging  transactions in Company securities;

e. Executive Compensation Recovery ("Clawback") Policy 
The Company's compensation recovery policy provides that in the event Jack in the Box Inc. materially restates all or a portion of its financial statements due to fraud or intentional misconduct, either committed by a Corporate Officer or knowingly permitted by a Corporate Officer, the Committee may take action to recover incentive cash compensation and performance-based equity awards that were based on the achievement of financial results that were subsequently restated. For purposes of this policy, a Corporate Officer is defined as an employee with the title of Corporate Vice President or above, as well as former Corporate Officers who were employed by the Company at the time of any fraud or intentional misconduct. 
Executive compensation subject to recovery and/or cancellation may include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
i)  Annual incentive or incentive cash compensation paid to the Corporate Officer, plus a reasonable rate of interest,   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
ii)  Economic gains realized from the sale of shares awarded under a performance-based equity plan, and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
iii)  Restricted stock or units, deferred stock awards or units, and outstanding stock options to the extent vesting of  such awards is performance-based.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee has the sole discretion to determine what action to take in the event of a restatement, including soliciting recommendations from the Audit Committee and the full Board and retaining outside advisors to assist in making its determinations. Any actions taken by the Committee would be independent of consequences imposed by law enforcement agencies, regulators or other authorities. 
Since November 2015, all PSU grant agreements contain specific terms providing that the award is subject to recoupment in accordance with any clawback policy that the Company adopts pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which the Company's securities are listed or as is otherwise required by the Dodd-Frank Act or other applicable law. The Committee will continue to review potential changes to its policies, as appropriate in light of the Dodd-Frank Act final regulations. 
f. Termination of Service 
None of the 2018 NEOs have (or had during fiscal 2018) employment agreements that provide for benefits upon termination of service, except (a) in the event of a change in control ("CIC") as described in the "Compensation and Benefits Assurance Agreements" discussion in the next section; and (b) former JIB President Ms. Allen's 2014 employment offer letter providing for one year's base pay on termination. In connection with Ms. Allen's 2018 separation, and the elimination of the JIB President role due to the restructuring of the business following the planned sale of Qdoba, and in exchange for providing a general release of claims, she received the offer letter one year's pay, and an additional cash payment representing the value of one year of COBRA medical premiums and cancelled equity awards that would have vested in 2018 and 2019. These benefits are described in the SCT and "Potential Payments on Termination of Employment or Change in Control" section. 
When an NEO terminates employment with the Company, the NEO will receive amounts according to the specific terms and provisions of each compensation plan or benefit plan in which he or she participates. Such amounts may include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Amounts contributed to and distributed under the Company's qualified and  non-qualified deferred compensation plans (subject to the specific terms and requirements of IRC Section 409A).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Under the Company's equity incentive plan and standard equity agreements, upon a CIC: (a) vesting of PSUs  based on actual levels achieved for completed performance periods and target level for incomplete periods, and   
       (b) accelerated vesting of RSUs and options only upon both a qualified CIC and qualifying termination, as described in the "Compensation & Benefits Assurance Agreements"  section below.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Amounts accrued and vested in the Company's pension plans (Retirement Plan for five NEOs; plus the SERP for  Dr. Blankenship and Messrs. Rebel and Melancon only).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If termination is after the end of the fiscal year but before payment, the annual cash incentive award, subject to the  Company's achievement of performance goals.  
[END TABLE]
If eligible to retire under a Company-sponsored retirement plan, in addition to the above, and consistent with the terms of our standard equity agreement, Corporate Officers (including all NEOs) are entitled to the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Accelerated vesting of options equal to 5% additional vesting for each full year of service with the Company.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In accordance with the vesting schedule of each award, prorated vesting of PSUs; and, full vesting of time-vested RSUs  granted in fiscal 2018 and earlier.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A prorated annual cash incentive award based on the number of full reporting periods worked in the fiscal year before  retirement, subject to the Company's eligibility requirements and achievement of performance goals.

 subject to the number of periods completed during the performance period and actual performance achieved).The values of additional potential payments to the NEOs are provided in the section entitled "Potential Payments on Termination of Employment or Change in Control" of this Proxy Statement. 
g. Compensation & Benefits Assurance (Change in Control) Agreements 
The Committee believes that Compensation & Benefits Assurance Agreements (otherwise known as a Change in Control or "CIC" Agreements) benefit stockholders by providing an important incentive to executive officers to remain focused on running the business in the case of a pending or actual CIC event. Accordingly, each of the NEOs in position at fiscal year-end and six other current officers have a CIC Agreement providing for compensation in the form of a lump sum payment and other benefits in the event of a qualifying termination within 24 months of the effective date of the CIC of the Company (a "double-trigger" agreement). (Mr. Rebel and Ms. Allen's CIC Agreements terminated upon their separation from the Company in May 2018 and February 2018, respectively.) 
In 2009, in line with market practices, the Committee ceased entering into compensatory agreements with executives that obligate the Company to provide tax gross-up payments intended to offset the cost of excise taxes imposed on 
 "excess parachute payments." Accordingly, no CIC Agreements with any current executives include gross-up provisions. 
The Company's current form CIC agreement includes a "best after-tax" provision where benefits would be reduced only if doing so would result in a better after-tax economic position for the affected executive. Under this provision, there are no gross-ups payable; the executive is solely responsible for payment of excise taxes and other applicable federal, state, and local income and employment taxes. The Committee plans to continue to monitor the costs and appropriate terms and conditions of CIC Agreements in the future. 
A detailed discussion of the provisions of the CIC Agreements and associated monetary values is provided in the sub-section following the compensation tables entitled Compensation & Benefits Assurance Agreements.
h. Tax and Accounting Information 
Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) 
The Committee and its Consultant consider the IRC Section 162(m) implications of all compensation decisions for our NEOs and other executives. Section 162(m) places a $1 million limit on the amount of compensation that the Company can deduct in any one taxable year for certain covered employees. Historically, certain performance-based pay has been excluded from this limit. However, the performance-based pay exemption has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to certain covered employees in excess of $1 million per taxable year will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017 (the "Section 162(m) Transition Relief"). 
Our compensation programs have generally been designed to provide the largest portion of an executive's compensation through programs intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), including our annual performance incentive plan and long-term incentive plan in the form of stock options and performance shares. However, any such compensation will not qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) unless it qualifies for the Section 162(m) Transition Relief. Furthermore, in many cases, corporate objectives may not have necessarily aligned with the requirements to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m). Accordingly, the 
 Committee had (and continues to have) the discretion to grant awards or enter into compensation arrangements under which payments are not deductible under Section 162(m). For example, time-based restricted stock awards do not qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) and, accordingly, are subject to the $1 million deductibility limit. Despite the Committee's efforts to structure certain compensation in a manner intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) and therefore not subject to its deduction limit, no assurance can be given that such compensation in fact will qualify for the Section 162(m) Transition Relief, and therefore, be eligible for exemption from the $1 million deductibility limit. Further, the Committee may modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are consistent with our business needs. The Committee will continue to monitor the applicability of Section 162(m) to the Company's ongoing compensation arrangements. 
Internal Revenue Code Section 409A 
Under IRC Section 409A, amounts deferred by an employee under a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (such as the SERP and EDCP) may be included in gross income when deferred and be subject to a 20% additional federal tax, unless the plan complies with certain requirements related to the timing of deferral election and distribution decisions.

The Company administers the SERP and EDCP intending to comply with Section 409A. The Company intends that its stock options are exempt from Section 409A. 
Expensing of Stock and Option Awards 
The Company accounts for compensation expense associated with stock and option awards in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") 
 authoritative guidance on stock compensation, and it uses a Black Scholes valuation model to determine the "fair value" of our stock options at grant. For further details regarding the accounting for the compensation expense associated with stock and option awards, refer to Note 12, Share-Based Employee Compensation in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

[END TABLE]
VIII. CEO PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE 
Under SEC rules, we are required to calculate and disclose the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Comma, our CEO, to the annual total compensation of our median employee. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in accordance with applicable SEC rules. 
The majority of our employee population consists of hourly part-time restaurant employees, where we provide work schedule flexibility to accommodate each individual's personal schedule. 
To identify the median employee, we used gross base wages and target incentive potential ("total cash compensation") of all full-time and part-time employees (and did not annualize for employees employed for less than the fiscal year), other than Mr. Comma, who were employed by the Company on September 23, 2018. 
For fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our median employee was identified as a restaurant Team Member who worked an average of 21.4 hours per week. After  identifying the median employee, using the same methodology we use for our NEOs as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for fiscal 2018, the annual total compensation of such employee was $14,968; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual total compensation of Mr. Comma, our CEO, as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for  fiscal 2018, was $5,043,921.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for fiscal 2018, the ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to our median employee's annual total compensation was 337:1.

     COMPENSATION RISK ANALYSIS               
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION RISK ANALYSIS 
The Committee has engaged in a thorough risk analysis of our compensation plans, programs, policies, and practices for all employees. This includes advice from the Committee's independent Consultant regarding executive programs, and a detailed report, prepared by a Company Internal Compensation Risk Committee, describing the risk mitigation characteristics of the Company's annual and long-term incentive programs. For the following reasons, the Committee believes that the design of our compensation programs, the governance of our programs, and our risk oversight process guard against imprudent risk taking that could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Compensation Program Design Protections 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our base pay programs consist of competitive salaries that provide a fixed level of income on a regular basis. This  mitigates incentives on the part of our executives and employees to take unnecessary or imprudent risks.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board approves the Company's strategic plan, capital budget, and long-term financial and operational plans  that serve as the basis for setting short and long-term incentive goals. Goals are intended to drive stockholder value and are set relative to the approved budget, historical and future expected performance, and a reasonable amount of stretch so  that they do not encourage imprudent risk taking.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our annual incentive programs provide variable pay opportunities for certain position levels based on achievement of  multiple annual performance goals including both financial, operational, and, for some years, strategic goals. Goals are set at reasonable levels and payouts are managed as a percentage of pay.   
• The maximum awards that may be paid to executive officers under the annual and long-term incentive programs are capped,  and the Committee retains the discretion to reduce payouts under the plans.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The largest amount of executive incentive compensation opportunity is tied to long-term incentive compensation that  emphasizes sustained Company performance over time. This reduces incentive for executives and other employees to take risks that might increase short-term compensation at the expense of longer term Company results.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity awards have multi-year vesting, and RSU and PSU awards for executives have holding requirements until  termination of service. This aligns the long-term interests of our NEOs and executives with those of our stockholders, and discourages taking short-term risks at the expense of longer-term performance.   
[END TABLE]
Structural Governance Protections 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Committee has adopted a clawback/compensation recovery policy that allows the Committee to take action to recover  both cash compensation and performance-based equity awards for all NEOs and executives in the event of a material restatement based on fraud or intentional misconduct.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company has strong internal controls over the measurement and calculation of performance goals designed to keep  them from being susceptible to manipulation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Company policy also:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Prohibits directors and executive officers from engaging in hedging transactions involving our stock, which prevents  executives from insulating themselves from poor stock performance by betting against our success;   
• Prohibits directors and officers from pledging Company stock or holding Company stock in margin accounts. This reduces  the risk that executives might create incentives to focus on short-term performance at the expense of long-term performance; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Has a formal ethics code of conduct and an ethics helpline, and provides ethics training and communications to  employees. The ethics program is intended to reinforce a culture of integrity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company also has a Compensation Risk Committee that includes functional experts tasked specifically with evaluating  potential unintended or unforeseen consequences of our compensation programs and their component parts.

Grants of Plan-Based Awards 
The following table provides information on fiscal 2018 cash and equity incentive awards granted to our NEOs. Cash incentive awards are based on fiscal year performance under our annual incentive plan ("AIP").

(1)   All annual grants were approved at the December 2017 Committee meeting, with a grant date of December 20,  2017 for PSUs/RSUs and February 26, 2018 for stock options, the second business day of the Company's next open trading window, as is the Company's standard practice. The new hire grant  ("RSU-NH") for Mr. Tucker and special RSU awards ("RSU-SP") for Dr. Blankenship and Mr. Rudolph were approved by the Committee on the  respective dates shown above. In accordance with ASC 718, the "grant date" is shown for the portion of the PSUs awarded in fiscal 2018 that relate to the fiscal 2018 performance period, and the portion of the PSUs awarded in fiscal 2016  and 2017 related to the fiscal 2018 performance period, as further described in Footnote 7 to this table.  
(2)   For PSU awards, this column shows the three fiscal years of the PSU performance period.  
(3)   This column shows the potential payouts under the fiscal 2018 annual incentive plan ("AIP"), which could  have been earned based on performance in fiscal 2018. The threshold payout is zero, target payout represents the amount payable for achieving the target level of performance, and maximum payout is capped at two times target payout. Incentive payouts  are prorated between performance levels, and the payout values are calculated using the executive's annual salary rate as specified at the time performance goals are approved by the Committee. The SCT for fiscal 2018 shows the actual incentive  compensation earned by our NEOs for fiscal 2018 performance. Messrs. Rebel and Tucker received prorated incentive payments based on Mr. Rebel's mid-year retirement and Mr. Tucker's mid-year start of employment. Ms. Allen, who separated from the Company in February 2018, did not receive an incentive payment.  
(4)   This column shows the threshold, target, and maximum potential share payout levels for the PSUs under the  Company's long-term incentive plan for the fiscal 2018-20 PSU award and for the fiscal 2018 performance period of the 2016-18 and  2017-19 PSU awards. The amount for the 2018-20 PSU award represents the fiscal 2018 performance period for one metric only (consolidated systemwide sales) for the  reasons explained in Footnote 7. Threshold payout for all of the PSUs reflected above is 50% of target and requires achieving an established minimum performance requirement (there is no payout if performance doesn't meet the minimum  requirement). Maximum payout is 150% of target.  
(5)   This column shows the number of RSUs granted on December 20, 2017 that vest 25% per year over four years  on each anniversary of the grant date to the executives in position at that time, the new hire grant for Mr. Tucker (RSU-NH), and the special awards for Dr. Blankenship and Mr. Rudolph (RSU-SP) that vest 33% per year over three years on each anniversary of the grant date.  
(6)   This column shows the number of stock options granted on February 26, 2018 that vest 33% per year over  three years on each anniversary of the grant date. The options expire seven years from the grant date. The exercise price is the closing price of Common Stock on the grant date ($90.06).

(7)   For stock options, the value represents the grant date fair value computed in accordance with ASC 718, which is a  theoretical value at grant using a valuation model that requires the input of assumptions, including the expected volatility of our stock price. As such, the values may not reflect the actual amounts that our NEOs will realize; rather the actual  amount realized will depend on the Company's stock price relative to the exercise price. The values of PSUs and RSUs also represent the grant date fair values, as computed in accordance with ASC 718, based on the closing price of the  Company's Common Stock on the grant date discounted by the present value of the expected dividend stream over the vesting period, as applicable, which for the annual grants was $98.60 for PSUs and $98.60 for RSUs; and, for  Mr. Tucker's new hire RSU grant, $82.56; Dr. Blankenship's special RSU award, $88.67; and Mr. Rudolph's special RSU award, $82.25. The grant date fair values of all awards were determined based on the assumptions  and methodologies set forth in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K (Note 12, Share-Based Employee Compensation). PSU awards, which cliff vest after three years, are made annually and  vest based on the Company's performance during the succeeding three-fiscal year period. The performance metrics are established at the beginning of the three- fiscal year period when the grant is made; while the specific performance goals  are either set by the Committee (a) at the time of grant (or at a later time) for the full (or remaining) performance period or (b) at the beginning of each fiscal year for that portion of the performance period; in accordance with SEC  rules and ASC 718, the values shown on each of the three rows for the PSUs reflect the grant date fair value of the fiscal 2018 performance period (total or portion, as applicable) of the award based on probable outcome (target level performance) of  each of the PSU awards.

Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End 2018 
The following table provides information on all outstanding option awards and unvested stock awards held by each of the NEOs at the end of fiscal 2018. Ms. Allen is not included in the table because she did not have any outstanding option awards or unvested stock awards at the end of fiscal 2018. Each option grant is shown separately and the vesting schedule is shown as Footnote 1 to the table. The market value of the stock awards is based on the closing price of Jack in the Box Inc. Common Stock as of the last trading day of the fiscal year, September 28, 2018, which was $83.83.

Option Exercises and Stock Vested in Fiscal 2018 
The following table provides information on stock option exercises and shares acquired on the vesting of stock awards by the NEOs during fiscal 2018. Option award value realized is calculated by subtracting the aggregate exercise price of the options exercised from the aggregate fair market value of the shares of Jack in the Box Inc. stock acquired on the date of exercise. Stock award value realized is calculated by multiplying the number of shares shown in the table by the closing price of our stock on the date the stock awards vested.

Retirement Plan Benefits 
The following table provides information on the pension benefits for the NEOs under each of the following pension plans: 
Retirement Plan 
The Retirement Plan is a Company-funded and tax-qualified retirement plan that was offered to eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2011 that had reached age 21 and completed one year of service (at least 1,000 hours/year). Five NEOs who were hired prior to 2011 participate in the plan, including former CFO, Mr. Rebel, who retired during 2018. Participants are 100% vested after completing five years (1,000 hours per year) of service. As of December 31, 2015, the Retirement Plan was "sunset" and employees no longer accrue additional benefits based on additional pay and service. The plan provides that a participant retiring at the normal retirement age of 65 will receive benefits based primarily on the formula described below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  1% of the average of the five highest consecutive calendar years of pay (base salary and annual incentive out of the  last ten years of eligible service (referred to as "Final Average Pay"), multiplied by the number of full calendar years and months while an eligible employee.  
[END TABLE]
PLUS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  0.4% of Final Average Pay in excess of Covered Compensation (average of the Social Security taxable wage bases)  multiplied by the number of full calendar years and months while an eligible employee (up to a maximum of 35 years).  
[END TABLE]
A participant in the Retirement Plan who has at least ten years of vesting service may elect to begin receiving reduced payments as early as age 55. Note: Prior to 1989, benefits are subject to grandfathered minimum benefit accruals under the previous plan. Retirement plan benefits are (i) not permitted to be paid to participants while actively employed with Jack in the Box Inc. and (ii) typically paid in the form of a monthly annuity unless the present value of the accrued benefit is equal to or less than $20,000 at termination and in such event, may be paid in the form of a lump sum payment. 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) 
Effective January 1, 2007, the SERP was closed to new participants. Executives and certain "highly compensated employees" who were hired or promoted into such position prior to January 1, 2007 (including three NEOs) are eligible to participate in the SERP. The SERP, established in 1990, provides for retirement benefits above amounts available under the Company's Retirement Plan due to IRC limits that restrict benefits available under the Company's tax-qualified plan. The SERP is unfunded and not qualified for tax purposes. 
The SERP provides that a participant retiring at the normal retirement age of 62 will receive a benefit equal to a target replacement income, based on final average pay and service. When combined with other amounts payable under the Company's tax-qualified pension benefit, and other qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation programs, the target replacement income is up to 60% of Final Average Pay and subject to the following conditions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Under the SERP, Final Average Pay is defined as the average of the five highest calendar years of pay (base salary and  annual incentive) out of the last ten years of employment with the Company.

• Service is defined as the entire period of employment in calendar years and months while an eligible employee.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• There is no reduction in the target replacement income (60%) if a participant has 20 or more years of service. For  participants with less than 20 years of service, the target replacement income percentage is determined by multiplying the number of years of service times 3%, up to a maximum of 20 years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To receive a retirement benefit under the SERP, a participant must attain the earlier of (i) age 62 or  (ii) age 55 with ten years of service while employed at Jack in the Box or while disabled. A participant may begin receiving payments as early as age 55 subject to a reduction in benefits (equal to 5/12 of 1% for each month by which  commencement of benefit payments precedes the participant's attainment of age 62).   
• Benefits under the SERP are only available to retirees as monthly payments and cannot be received in a lump sum.

The following table provides information on the actuarial present value of the NEOs' accumulated pension and SERP benefits as of the end of fiscal 2018 (September 30, 2018), using fiscal 2018 earnings (base salary and annual incentive). The maximum amounts used for the Retirement Plan do not exceed the IRS-prescribed limit applicable to tax-qualified plans ($265,000 for 2015, the year the Retirement Plan was sunset). Present values were calculated using the interest rate and mortality assumptions used in the Company's financial statements for fiscal year 2018.

(1)   Messrs. Comma, Rudolph, and Melancon and Dr. Blankenship participate in the Retirement Plan;  additionally, Mr. Melancon and Dr. Blankenship are the only NEOs who participate in the SERP. Mr. Rebel is a vested participant in both the Retirement Plan and SERP.  
(2)   As of the end of fiscal 2018, all four Retirement Plan participants are vested in the Plan, and  Dr. Blankenship and Mr. Melancon have met the service and minimum age requirements for vesting in the SERP. The actuarial present value of accumulated benefits under the Retirement Plan and the SERP is based on discount rates of 4.395% and  4.365% respectively, as of September 30, 2018. The RP-2014 Mortality Table is used for both the Retirement Plan and the SERP calculations (the SERP uses a white collar adjustment). Both Plans use the MP-2017 generational scale projected from 2006, modified to use 15 year convergence to an ultimate rate of 0.75%. Participants are assumed to retire at the latest of current age and the plan's earliest  retirement date with unreduced benefits. No pre-retirement mortality, retirement, or termination has been assumed for the present value factors.  
(3)  Effective June 1, 2018, Mr. Rebel receives monthly benefits from the SERP, subject to a six-month delay pursuant to 409A regulations; the payment amount represents four months in fiscal 2018, subject to the six-month delay. The present value of  Mr. Rebel's benefit under the SERP as of September 30, 2018 is based on his actual retirement date (May 1, 2018) and is reduced to reflect that his benefit will start before normal retirement age.  
[END TABLE]
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation 
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (EDCP) 
In addition to eligibility to participate in the 401(k) Plan, the NEOs and other highly compensated employees are eligible to defer up to 50% of base salary and up to 85% of annual incentive pay to the EDCP, an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan, with benefits paid by the Company out of its general assets. The plan is subject to IRC Section 409A for all deferred compensation earned on or after January 1, 2005; deferred compensation earned prior to 2005 is not subject to Section 409A requirements and continues to be governed under the terms of the plan and tax laws in effect on or before 
 December 31, 2004, as applicable. In conjunction with the 401(k) Plan changes that took effect January 1, 2016, the EDCP Company matching contribution (previously 100% of the first three percent of compensation deferred) was replaced with a "restoration matching contribution." This means the Company will match up to the full four percent potential matching contribution for participants whose deferrals to the 401(k) Plan (and related Company matching contributions) were limited due to the IRC limits applicable to the 401(k) Plan. A participant must be employed on the last day of the calendar year to receive the restoration matching contribution, which is then 100% vested.

 Company matching contributions made prior to January 1, 2016 vest at a rate of 25% per year (such that the match fully vests after completion of four full years of service with the Company). Participants choose from an array of investment options. 
Enhanced EDCP — Beginning January 1, 2007, new Corporate Vice Presidents and above who otherwise would have been eligible for the SERP receive an additional annual Company contribution of 4% of base salary and annual incentive to their EDCP account for up to ten years. The ten-year period during which Mr. Comma and Mr. Rudolph received the additional 4% Company EDCP contribution came to an end in January 2017 and November 2017, respectively, at which time they ceased receiving these contributions. Participants become vested in the supplemental contribution at the rate of 25% per year (such that they are fully vested after completing four full years of service with the Company). The Enhanced EDCP was closed to new participants as of May 7, 2015. 
The following table provides information on the contributions, earnings, withdrawals and distributions in the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan during fiscal 2018 and the account balances as of the end of fiscal 2018.

Potential Payments on Termination of Employment or Change in Control 
Compensation & Benefits Assurance Agreements (CIC Agreements). The Company provides CIC Agreements because it considers it in the best interest of its stockholders to encourage continued employment of key management in the event of a CIC transaction. These agreements help facilitate successful performance by key executives during an impending CIC, by protecting them against the loss of their positions following a change in the ownership or control of the Company, and ensuring that his or her expectations for long-term incentive compensation arrangements will be fulfilled. Generally, under the agreements, a Company CIC is defined to include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(i)  the acquisition by any person or group of 50% or more of the outstanding stock or combined voting power of the  Company (excluding acquisitions by the fiduciary of the Company benefit plans or certain affiliates);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(ii)  circumstances in which individuals constituting our board of directors generally cease to constitute a majority of  the board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(iii)  certain stockholder-approved mergers, consolidations, sales of assets or liquidation of the Company.   
[END TABLE]
These CIC Agreements provide certain specified benefits to the executive if, within twenty-four (24) full calendar months following the effective date of a CIC, his or her employment is terminated ("Qualifying Termination"): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(i)  involuntarily other than for cause (which is defined in the agreements and includes acting deliberately and in bad  faith or committing fraud), death, or disability, or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(ii)  voluntarily for good reason. Voluntary termination for good reason is generally defined as the executive's  resignation due to: (a) the assignment of the executive to duties or responsibilities inconsistent with his or her status, or a reduction or alteration in the nature or status of his or her duties or responsibilities in effect as of 90 days  prior to the CIC event; (b) the acquiring company's requirement that the executive be based at a location in excess of 50 miles from his or her location immediately prior to a CIC; (c) a material reduction in base salary; (d) a  material reduction in the Company's compensation, health and welfare, retirement benefit plans, or any perquisites, unless an alternative plan is provided of a comparable value; or (e) the Company's failure to require any successor to  assume the CIC Agreement benefits.

CIC benefits under the CIC Agreements are not provided in the event of terminations by reason of death, disability, voluntary termination without good reason, or the Company's involuntary termination of the executive's employment for cause. CIC benefits under the CIC Agreements are also not provided in the event of a CIC when there is not a corresponding Qualifying Termination. In the event of a CIC of the Company and Qualifying Termination of an executive covered under a CIC Agreement as described above, the executive is entitled to the following severance benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  A lump sum cash payment equal to his or her accrued but unpaid annual salary and unreimbursed business expenses.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  A lump sum cash amount equal to a multiple of the executive's then-current annual salary, based on his or her  position, as follows:

  *Applied  prior to the NEO's termination.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  A lump sum cash incentive award equal to the multiple above times the greater of: (a) the average annual  incentive percentage for the last three fiscal years prior to the CIC times annual salary; or (b) the average dollar amount of the annual incentive paid for the last three fiscal years prior to the CIC. If an executive does not have three full  years of incentive awards, the Company will apply the target incentive award percentage for each missed year.

4.  Continuation of health insurance coverage at Company expense at the same cost and same coverage level as in effect as  of the executive's Qualifying Termination date (subject to changes in coverage levels applicable to all employees generally) for a specified coverage period as provided below, to run concurrently with any coverage provided under COBRA. If an  executive receives health insurance coverage with a subsequent employer prior to the end of 18 months, the continuation of health insurance coverage under the agreement is discontinued.

6.  Vesting of unvested restricted stock and RSUs, PSUs, and in-the-money stock options, in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement and stock incentive plan.   
     Since 2014, all options and RSU awards provide that unvested units that continue after a CIC are "double-trigger", requiring both a CIC and Qualifying Termination for vesting to  accelerate. (For grants prior to 2014, and for PSU grants, no Qualifying Termination is required.) Since 2014, the terms of PSU awards provide for accelerated vesting upon a CIC that pays out at actual levels achieved for completed performance  periods and at target level for incomplete periods. See Footnote 4 to the following table.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.  No outstanding CIC agreements provide for any excise tax gross up for excess parachute payments under IRC  Section 280G. (Mr. Rebel's pre-2009, grandfathered agreement had provided for a such a gross-up in certain situations but was terminated upon his  separation during 2018.) The remaining NEOs (excluding Ms. Allen whose agreement also terminated upon her separation in 2018) are parties to a CIC agreement, which provides for payment of the greater of: (i) the aggregate parachute  payments reduced to the maximum amount that would not subject the executive to relevant excise taxes; or (ii) the aggregate parachute payments, with the executive paying the relevant excise taxes and such other applicable federal, state and  local income and employment taxes. Under this "best after tax" provision, the executive is solely responsible for payment of excise taxes and other applicable federal, state, and local income and employment taxes.  
[END TABLE]
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. For the three NEOs who are SERP participants, in the event of an involuntary termination (or material diminution in duties or responsibilities or material downward change of title) within 24 months following a CIC, the SERP provides for payment to the participant of the actuarial equivalent of his accrued early retirement benefit unreduced for early commencement, in the form of three annual installments commencing on termination. 
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation. In the event of a CIC, in accordance with the EDCP, a participant shall become 100% vested in any Company contributions without regard to service requirements. Accounts shall be distributed in accordance with the participant's existing distribution election (on termination of employment or under a scheduled in-service withdrawal). 
Termination of Employment Without Change in Control. In the event of a termination not related to a CIC, NEOs will receive amounts under the terms and provisions of the specific plans in which they are a participant, including the Retirement Plan, the SERP and the EDCP. 
Dr. Blankenship and Mr. Melancon are the only current NEOs who are SERP participants and eligible to retire under that plan. Messrs. Rudolph, Melancon and Dr. Blankenship are all eligible to retire under the Retirement Plan.

Potential Payments on Termination of Employment or Change in Control 
The following table helps illustrate the potential payments and benefits our current NEOs would be entitled to as of fiscal 2018 year-end: (1) in the event of a termination of employment not related to a CIC, including termination due to death or disability; (2) in the event of a CIC and a Qualifying Termination, and (3) in the event of a CIC without a corresponding termination of employment. All references to "CIC" refer to a "Company CIC" as defined in the Compensation & Benefits Assurance Agreements section. The potential payments assume that the termination and/or 
 CIC occurred on the last day of fiscal 2018, September 30, 2018, and, where applicable, use the closing price of our Common Stock of $83.83 on September 28, 2018 (the last market trading day in the fiscal year). The actual amounts to which an NEO may be eligible to receive can only be determined at the time of such termination or CIC, and therefore, the actual amounts will vary from the estimated amounts in the table below. (The benefits actually paid to Mr. Rebel and Ms. Allen upon their separations from the Company during 2018 are described following the table.)

(5)   Pension and SERP: Annual benefit amounts listed for each NEO are subject to the eligibility and vesting  provisions of the Retirement Plan (Messrs. Comma, Rudolph, Melancon and Dr. Blankenship) and the SERP (Dr. Blankenship and Mr. Melancon), which are described above in the sections of this Proxy Statement titled Retirement Plan,  Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and Pension Benefits Table, and accompanying footnotes. All values shown represent present values and are based on the following:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  a)  In the event of a voluntary/involuntary termination (for any reason) or death, benefit values are based on accrued  benefits as of fiscal year-end payable at normal retirement. Benefit values were calculated as of September 30, 2018, based on a discount rate of 4.395% for the qualified pension plan and 4.365% for the  SERP. The RP-2014 Mortality Table is used for both the Retirement Plan and the SERP calculations (the SERP uses a white collar adjustment). Both Plans use the MP-2017  generational scale projected from 2006, modified to use 15 year convergence to an ultimate rate of .75%. Under the SERP, which applies only to Mr. Melancon and Dr. Blankenship, in the event of death, the amount of the survivor benefit  would be the greater of one times the participant's compensation or the actuarial equivalent lump sum present value of the participant's supplemental retirement benefit. In the event of death while actively employed, the amount of the  benefit under the Retirement Plan would be the accrued actuarial equivalent pension benefit as determined on the date of death. Such benefit is not subject to any reduction of benefits.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  b)  Disability benefits shown assume an NEO terminates employment with the Company due to disability and remains  continuously disabled until reaching normal retirement age. Benefit values are based on accrued benefits as of the NEOs normal retirement age and were calculated as of September 30, 2018 based on a discount rate of 4.395% for the qualified  pension plan and 4.365% for the SERP and the RP-2014 Mortality Table as described above.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  c)  In the event of an involuntary termination (or material diminution in duties or responsibilities or material  downward change of title) within 24 months following a CIC, a participant would become 100% vested in the SERP. Benefit values are based on accrued benefits as of fiscal year-end and were calculated as of  September 30, 2018. The SERP values are based on an interest rate of 6.0% and the RP-2000 Mortality Table, projected ten years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  d)  As described in the "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation  Section" above, four of the NEOs received a 3% Company match on their contributions made to the non-qualified deferred compensation (EDCP) prior to January 1, 2016, and an annual restoration match of  up to 4% for contributions made after January 1, 2016. In addition, Messrs. Comma and Rudolph, who are not eligible to participate in the SERP, received an additional 4% Company contribution to their EDCP accounts for a maximum of ten years,  which ceased in January 2017 for, Mr. Comma and in November 2017 for Mr. Rudolph. As of the end of fiscal 2018, four of the NEOs, except Mr. Tucker who was hired in March 2018, are 100% vested in the Company matching contributions.  Accordingly, these amounts are not included here, but are described in the "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Section" above.

Former CFO, Mr. Rebel, retired in May 2018. In connection with his separation, under the terms of his equity awards, he received benefits totaling $627,235, consisting of: (1) accelerated vesting of stock options, which would be valued at $49,736, had he exercised them on his separation date based on the difference between the closing price of our Common Stock on that date, May 1, 2018 ($89.41), and the exercise price of the options accelerated; and (2) accelerated vesting of RSUs valued at $577,499, based on the May 1, 2018 closing price of our Common Stock of ($89.41). In addition, as a result of his retirement, Mr. Rebel's monthly payment distributions of his SERP benefits began (under which the estimated total that could be distributable to him during his lifetime is $6,606,005); and he will receive distribution of his Retirement Plan account in accordance with the

OTHER INFORMATION 
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each executive officer, each director, and each beneficial owner of more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock is required to file certain forms with the SEC. A report of beneficial ownership of the Company's Common Stock on Form 3 is due at the time such person becomes subject to the reporting requirements and a report on Form 4 or Form 5 must be filed to reflect changes thereafter. Based on written statements and copies of forms provided to us by persons subject to the reporting requirements, we believe that all such reports required to be filed by such persons during fiscal 2018 were filed on a timely basis. 
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
It is the Company's policy that the Audit Committee approve or ratify transactions involving the Company and its directors, executive officers or principal stockholders or members of their immediate families or entities controlled by any of them or in which they have a substantial ownership interest in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and that are otherwise reportable under SEC disclosure rules.

APPENDIX A—RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASUREMENTS TO GAAP RESULTS 
This Proxy Statement contains information regarding Operating Earnings Per Share, Restaurant Operating Margin, Restaurant-Level EBITDA, and Operating EBIT, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measurements, when viewed with the Company's results of operations in accordance with GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations in the tables below, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period changes, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of the company's core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, Restaurant Operating Margin and Operating EBIT were used by the Compensation Committee in determining annual incentive targets further discussed in the Proxy Statement. 
However, Operating Earnings Per Share, Restaurant Operating Margin, Restaurant-Level EBITDA, and Operating EBIT are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to earnings from operations, net earnings, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company encourages investors to rely upon its GAAP numbers but includes these non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental metrics to assist investors. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
Below is a reconciliation of non-GAAP Restaurant Operating Margin and Restaurant-Level EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, earnings from operations (in thousands).

As such, restaurant  operating margins and franchise margins are not indicative of the overall results of the Company and are considered Non-GAAP financial measures. Restaurant operating margin and franchise margin should be  considered a supplement to, not as a substitute for, earnings from operations, net earnings or other financial measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP, or other similarly titled measures of other companies.  
(3)   Percentages are calculated based on a percentage of total franchise revenues.  
(4)   Percentages are calculated based on a percentage of company restaurant sales.
