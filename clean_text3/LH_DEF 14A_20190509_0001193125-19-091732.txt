Dear Shareholder: 
I am pleased to report that Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings had another record year in 2018, with strong operational and financial performance across a broad range of measures. We are also seeing that the power of our integrated Diagnostic-Drug Development business is translating into unique solutions for patients, customers, and partners, positioning us to deliver healthcare innovation, growth and shareholder value in the years ahead. 
I hope you will join us for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, which will be held on Thursday, May 9, 2019 at 9:00 a.m. The 2019 Annual Meeting will be a virtual meeting of shareholders to be held over the Internet, during which you will be able to vote your shares electronically and submit your questions during the live webcast of the meeting. 
At the 2019 Annual Meeting, we will ask you to (1) elect nine director nominees named in the attached proxy statement to our Board of Directors, (2) approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, executive compensation, and (3) ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. We will also discuss any other business matters properly brought before the meeting. 
In reviewing the Proxy Statement, you will find detailed information beginning on page 21 about the qualifications of our director nominees and why we believe they are the right people to represent you. 
As discussed in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which begins on page 28, we continue to maintain an executive compensation program that creates strong alignment between our executives' pay and the performance of the Company. Our compensation program continually evolves to better align with our changing business and industry, as well as to reflect input we have received from our shareholders. The Board believes our current compensation program, which is focused on performance-based and variable compensation, incentivizes our management team to execute on our strategic goals and is strongly aligned with the interests of our shareholders. 
As part of our ongoing shareholder engagement efforts, since our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, senior management engaged with shareholders representing more than 75 percent of the Company's outstanding shares. Discussions with our shareholders were primarily focused on a review of our performance and differentiated capabilities, our transformational strategy to become a leading global life sciences company, our corporate governance practices, including tenure, diversity and environmental practices, cybersecurity and our executive compensation program. We value our shareholders' input and perspectives and we continuously strive to increase our level of shareholder engagement, including by involving our Lead Independent Director as well as other members of the board of directors in meetings with our largest shareholders. Our directors who do not directly participate in these meetings still receive the benefit of our shareholders' perspectives because we regularly report to our Board on the input received. 
Your vote is very important to us. Whether or not you plan to participate in the 2019 Annual Meeting, it is important that your shares are represented and voted at the meeting. I urge you to promptly vote and submit your proxy via the Internet, by phone, or, if you receive paper copies of the proxy materials by mail, by following the instructions on the proxy card or voting instruction card. 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to express our appreciation for your continued investment in LabCorp. We look forward to your participation during the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Sincerely, 
David P. King 
Chairman of the Board, 
President and Chief Executive Officer

Executive Compensation (page 28; 47) 
Pay for Performance (page 30) 
LabCorp's executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain executives in a highly competitive environment. Our executive compensation philosophy is to pay for performance by rewarding the achievement of specific short-term and long-term operational and strategic goals. 
The Company seeks to achieve outstanding performance for our shareholders through a focus on increased revenue, adjusted earnings per share ("EPS"), adjusted operating income, and relative total shareholder return compared to the peer group of companies we use for compensation purposes. Our compensation program rewards our executives for achieving strategic objectives. A majority of the value of our executives' compensation opportunity (57-60%), including performance-based cash compensation and performance shares, is subject to the achievement of Company and individual objectives, which provides a strong incentive to drive Company performance and increase shareholder value. 
Last year, our annual advisory vote on executive compensation received support from approximately 95 percent of the shares represented at the 2018 Annual Meeting and entitled to vote. We are committed to refining our compensation program to incentivize our leaders and align with our strategy, the key value drivers of our business and the expectations of our shareholders. We regularly seek input from our shareholders and this input is incorporated in the Compensation Committee's annual review of our compensation program. 
PROXY SUMMARY 
2018 Executive Total Compensation Mix (page 30) 
The Compensation Committee takes several factors into consideration when setting executive compensation levels, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• alignment of compensation with growth drivers of the Company's business;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• competitive data and emerging best practices in executive compensation presented by its independent consultant; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• input from shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
While the Committee sets total target compensation (base salary plus the target amounts under our annual cash incentive and long-term incentive arrangements) to be competitive in relation to the median peer compensation as reflected in data provided by its independent consultant, the Committee places greater emphasis on the variable or at-risk portion of compensation versus fixed compensation. 
For 2018, approximately 75 percent of Mr. King's total target compensation was performance-based and at-risk. For the other Named Executive Officers ("NEOs"), approximately 69 percent of the average total target compensation was performance-based and at-risk. In 2018, an additional approximately 15 percent of our CEO's total target compensation and an additional approximately 12 percent of the average total target compensation for our other NEOs was variable and based on the performance of the Company's stock. The charts below show the mix of pay elements included in total compensation opportunities for 2018 for our Chief Executive Officer and an average for our other NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Pay mix totals do not include a special retention restricted stock award with an approximate value of $2,000,000 to Mr.  Ratliff.  
[END TABLE]
Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation (page 59) 
We ask that our shareholders approve the advisory resolution on executive compensation. The Compensation Committee has continuously evolved our compensation program to enhance the alignment of our program with the strategic goals of the Company and reflect the input we have received from our shareholders. The Compensation Committee continuously improves the compensation program by designing management incentives that create strong alignment between compensation, the performance of the Company and the interests of shareholders. In 2017, for instance, the Company for the first time since 2012 included in its mix of long-term equity awards non-qualified stock 
PROXY SUMMARY 
options, to further align long-term incentive compensation with our shareholders' interest in stock price appreciation. We have also adopted many market-leading compensation practices to further align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders: 
Auditors (page 62) 
We ask that our shareholders ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditor for the year ending December 31, 2019. Below is summary information about PricewaterhouseCoopers' fees for services provided in fiscal years 2018 and 2017. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Audit Fees include fees incurred for the audit of the Company's annual statements, review of financial statements  included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. This category  also includes fees billed for the audits of one of the Company's businesses in connection with its sale.  
(2)  Audit Related Fees include fees incurred for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance  of the audit or review of the Company's financial statements but are not otherwise included as Audit Fees. Audit Related Fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were primarily for certain accounting  consultations and other assurance services.  
(3)  Tax Fees for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were related to general tax consulting,  tax compliance, including expatriate tax services and preparation of tax returns, tax planning insights, and tax advice. The 2018 and 2017 fees related to tax planning in conjunction with the acquisition of Chiltern.  
(4)  All Other Fees are fees incurred for any services not included in the other categories of fees. All Other Fees  consisted of accounting research software and other services.

Proxy Statement 
LabCorp is providing you with these proxy materials in connection with its 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "2019 Annual Meeting"). The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice"), this Proxy Statement and LabCorp's 2018 annual report on Form 10-K (the "2018 Annual Report") were first mailed to shareholders of record on or about March 29, 2019. As used in this Proxy Statement, "LabCorp," the "Company" and "we" may refer to Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings itself, one or more of its subsidiaries, or Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries, as applicable. 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
LabCorp's 2019 Annual Meeting is scheduled to occur on Thursday, May 9, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time. The 2019 Annual Meeting will be a virtual meeting and will be webcast live at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/LH2019. We believe that conducting the 2019 Annual Meeting as a virtual meeting will encourage higher levels of shareholder participation while also helping us reduce the financial and environmental costs associated with the 2019 Annual Meeting. Shareholders at the virtual-only meeting will have the same rights as at an in-person meeting, including the rights to vote and ask questions through the virtual meeting platform. 
All owners of LabCorp's common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the "Common Stock"), on March 22, 2019, the record date (the "Record Date"), are eligible to receive notice of, and to vote electronically at, the 2019 Annual Meeting over the Internet by using the 16-digit control number included in the Notice, proxy card or the voting instructions that accompanied these proxy materials. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent auditor for LabCorp for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, will be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
The virtual meeting platform is fully supported across browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari) and devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, and cell phones) running the most updated version of applicable software and plugins. Participants should ensure that they have a strong internet or WiFi connection wherever they intend to participate in the 2019 Annual Meeting. Participants should also give themselves plenty of time to dial-in to the conference call or log in and ensure that they can hear audio prior to the start of the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
If you encounter any technical difficulties with the virtual meeting platform on the meeting day, please call 855-449-0991 (Toll Free) or 720-378-5962 (International Toll) or email to investor@labcorp.com. Technical support will be available starting at 8:30 a.m. EDT on May 9, 2019. 
If you wish to submit a question, you may do so in a few ways. If you want to submit a question before the meeting, then beginning March 29, 2019 and until 11:59 p.m. on May 8, 2019, you may log into www.proxyvote.com and enter your 16-digit control number. Once past the login screen, click on "Question for Management," type in your question or comment, and click "Submit." Alternatively, if you want to submit your question or make a comment during the meeting, log into the virtual meeting platform at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/LH2019, type your question into the "Ask a Question" field, and click "Submit" or send your question or comment via email to investor@labcorp.com. Any emailed questions or comments will need to include your 16-digit control number in order to be addressed at the meeting. 
Questions and comments submitted via the virtual meeting platform that are pertinent to meeting matters will be addressed during the meeting. It has been LabCorp's policy to address all pertinent questions and comments during the meeting and, historically, management has been successful in doing so. In the unlikely event that the volume of questions increases to the point that time constraints prohibits LabCorp from answering all questions, then questions will be addressed by email. Consistent with LabCorp's approach when the annual meetings were held in person, questions or comments that are not related to the proposals under discussion, are about personal concerns not shared by shareholders generally, or use blatantly offensive language may be ruled out of order. LabCorp will, however, respond to questions or comments that are not related to the proposals under discussion or are about personal concerns not shared by shareholders generally via email after the meeting. 
A webcast of the 2019 Annual Meeting will be archived and accessible through December 31, 2019. 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Shareholder Meeting To Be Held on May 9, 2019 
Pursuant to the "notice and access" rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), LabCorp has elected to provide access to its proxy materials and the 2018 Annual Report over the Internet and sent the Notice to shareholders of record as of the Record Date on or about March 29, 2019. The Notice is not a form for voting and presents only an overview of the more complete proxy materials, which contain important information about the 2019 Annual Meeting. All shareholders may access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice (www.proxyvote.com) and we encourage shareholders to do so prior to submitting their votes. Shareholders may request to receive a printed set of the proxy materials by following the instructions provided in the Notice. 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
Shareholders may also request to receive future proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by e-mail on an ongoing basis by following the instructions on your proxy card or at www.proxyvote.com. Choosing to receive proxy materials by e-mail will save LabCorp the cost of printing and mailing documents and will reduce the impact of LabCorp's annual meetings on the environment. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by e-mail, you will receive an e-mail next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials by e-mail will remain in effect until you terminate it. 
Matters Subject to a Vote of the Shareholders 
Current Proposals 
The following matters are subject to a vote of the shareholders at the 2019 Annual Meeting: 
Board Recommendations 
The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") unanimously recommends that shareholders vote as follows: 
Other Business 
The Board does not intend to bring any other business before the 2019 Annual Meeting and is not aware of any other matters to be brought before the meeting. See the section "Other Matters" on page 67 for information about presenting proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting. Please also see the section "Identification and Evaluation of Director Candidates" on page 13 for information about shareholder nominations to the Board. 
Voting Procedures and Solicitation of Proxies 
Quorum and Voting Requirements 
The Board is soliciting your vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting or at any later meeting should the scheduled annual meeting be adjourned or postponed for any reason. By using a proxy, which authorizes specific people to vote on your behalf, your shares can be voted whether or not you attend the 2019 Annual Meeting. At least a majority of the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the Record Date must be present in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting for a quorum to be established. At the close of business on the Record Date, there were 98,678,210 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. 
Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote on each of the director nominees and one vote on each other matter that is properly presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting. In accordance with LabCorp's Amended and Restated By-Laws (the "By-Laws"), director nominees in an uncontested election must receive a majority of the votes cast to be elected, which under the By-Laws means that the number of shares voted "FOR" a director must exceed 50 percent of the votes cast with respect to that director. The Board has adopted a policy under which a director who does not receive the required vote for election as provided in the By-Laws will submit his or her resignation for consideration by the Board. The affirmative vote of a majority of shares of Common Stock represented at the 2019 Annual Meeting and entitled to vote is required for approval of the other proposals noted above. Abstentions will have no effect on the election of the directors but will have the same effect as a vote against the other proposals scheduled for the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
Voting by Record Holders 
If your name is registered in LabCorp's shareholder records as the owner of shares, there are four ways that you can vote your shares: 
You may change your vote or revoke a proxy at any time prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting by: 
All proxies duly executed and received by LabCorp will be voted in accordance with the instructions provided by the person executing the proxy or, in the absence of any instruction, will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendations on each proposal. Proxies will have the discretion to vote on any other matters that come before the 2019 Annual Meeting that are not otherwise specified in the Notice. 
Voting by Holders in Street Name 
If you hold shares through a bank, broker or other custodian (referred to as shares held in "street name"), the custodian will provide you with a copy of the Proxy Statement and a voting instruction form. Brokers and other holders of record have discretionary authority to vote shares without instructions from beneficial owners only on matters considered "routine" by the New York Stock Exchange, such as the advisory vote on the selection of the independent auditors. On non-routine matters, such as the election of directors, these banks, brokers, and other holders of record do not have discretion to vote uninstructed shares and thus are not "entitled to vote" on such proposals, resulting in a broker non-vote for those shares. We encourage you to provide voting instructions so that your shares can be counted in the election of directors and the other matters to be considered at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Even if your shares are held in street name, you may participate in the virtual 2019 Annual Meeting and vote your shares during the meeting by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/LH2019, listening to the live webcast and casting your vote online. See "2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders" for information about participating in the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Proxy Expenses 
LabCorp will bear the expenses to prepare proxy materials and to solicit proxies for the 2019 Annual Meeting. LabCorp expects to reimburse banks, brokers, and other persons for their reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses in handling proxy materials for beneficial owners. LabCorp has also retained Morrow Sodali LLC for solicitation of holders 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
of record as well as non-objecting beneficial owners. LabCorp paid Morrow Sodali LLC a fee of approximately $9,000 for these services, plus reimbursement of expenses. These solicitations may be made personally or by mail, facsimile, telephone, messenger, email or otherwise. 
Results of the 2019 Annual Meeting 
The voting results of the 2019 Annual Meeting will be disclosed no later than four business days after the 2019 Annual Meeting in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
We have a long-standing commitment to strong corporate governance practices. These practices provide an important framework within which our Board and management pursue the strategic objectives of LabCorp and ensure the Company's long-term vitality for the benefit of our shareholders. 
Shareholder Engagement 
In 2018, we continued our active shareholder engagement program, which included participation by both management and members of our Board. In addition to our ongoing engagement with shareholders regarding operational results and business strategy, we have continued our practice of shareholder engagement to specifically discuss corporate governance, executive compensation and other matters important to our shareholders. In 2018, we engaged with shareholders that represented more than 75 percent of the Company's outstanding shares, including over 200 one-on-one meetings and calls, to review and receive input on our corporate governance practices and executive compensation program, our performance, our differentiated and innovative solutions, and our progress in executing on our strategic priorities as a leading global life sciences company. Input received from our shareholder engagement program is reviewed with management and the Board. The Board uses this input as it considers long-term business strategy, executive compensation, corporate governance and other emerging areas of shareholder concern.

Board Composition 
The cornerstone of our governance philosophy is an independent and highly qualified board of directors. All directors are elected annually by a majority of votes cast by shareholders. All Board committees are composed entirely of independent directors. 
LabCorp's By-Laws provide for a Board of no fewer than one and no more than fifteen directors and our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide for a Board size ranging from no fewer than nine directors to no more than fifteen directors. There are currently ten members of the Board, and each member is standing for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting other than Mr. Mittelstaedt. Mr. Mittelstaedt has reached the mandatory retirement age pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines and is retiring from the Board upon conclusion of his term ending May 9, 2019. For more details about the nominees for directors and their biographies, please see "Proposal One: Election of Directors" (page 21). 
The Board carefully evaluates each incoming director candidate based on selection criteria and overall priorities for Board composition that are periodically reviewed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with input from the rest of the directors. As our directors' commitments change, the Board revisits their situations to ensure that they can continue to serve the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. We believe that a range of tenure among Board members from a variety of backgrounds ensures a balanced mix of longer tenured directors with deep perspectives on our business with fresh and diverse perspectives in the boardroom. Five of the eight non-employee director nominees joined the Board within the last six years. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The following charts provide information on the expected composition of our Board if the current nominees are elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
We expect high standards of ethical conduct from our directors and management as described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Conduct and Ethics. Our governance principles are available under the Corporate Governance tab of the Investor Relations page of our website at www.labcorp.com. We have included some highlights from these principles and a summary of key policies below. 
Board Independence 
The Board believes that a substantial majority of its members should be independent, non-employee directors. The Board has established guidelines for determining director independence that are consistent with the current listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the "Listing Standards"). In addition, director affiliations and transactions are regularly reviewed to ensure that there are no conflicts or relationships that might impair a director's independence from the Company, senior management and our independent registered accounting firm as defined in the Listing Standards. Other than Mr. King, all of our current Board members and all of the nominees for director qualify as "independent" as defined in the Listing Standards. 
Board Leadership 
The Chairman of the Board leads the Board and oversees Board meetings and the delivery of information necessary for the Board's informed decision making. The Chairman also serves as the principal liaison between the Board and our management. The Board determines whether the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should be separated or combined based on its judgment as to the structure that best serves the interests of the Company. The Board believes that at this time, the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should be held by the same person as this combination has and continues to serve the Company well by providing unified leadership and direction in the management of the Company, contributing to an effective long-term strategy and delivering superior performance for our shareholders. 
Since 2009, the Board has also required that an independent director serve as Lead Independent Director when the Chief Executive Officer also serves as Chairman or the Chairman otherwise is not an independent director. The Lead Independent Director, among other tasks assigned in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, presides at executive sessions of the Board, serves as a liaison between the Chairman and the other directors, and advises the Chairman with respect to the schedule, agenda and information for Board meetings. The Board believes that appointing a Lead Independent Director provides an efficient and effective leadership model for the Company by fostering clear accountability, effective decision-making, alignment on corporate strategy between the Board and management and a cohesive public face for the Company's independent Board members. From 2009 – 2018, Mr. Mittelstaedt served as our Lead Independent Director. Effective January 2, 2019, Mr. Schechter became our Lead Independent Director and meets regularly with Mr. King to review Board agendas, operations and strategic issues discussed with the Board and other matters relating to the Board's oversight functions. 
The Board holds executive sessions without Company management and non-independent director participation. These sessions are generally held at each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board and at each special meeting upon the request of a majority of the independent directors attending the special meeting. The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the independent directors shall meet on a periodic basis, but no fewer than five times a year on the same day as the regularly scheduled Board meetings. In 2018, Mr. Mittelstaedt, in his capacity as the Lead Independent Director, chaired five meetings of the independent and non-employee directors to discuss strategy, compensation, succession planning and other matters. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Annual Board Self-Assessment 
The Board conducts an annual self-assessment of its performance and effectiveness. The purpose of the self-assessment is to determine whether the Board and its committees are functioning effectively and to improve the performance of the Board as a unit. The self-assessment process fosters frank exchanges between directors and helps guide suggested changes or additions to committee responsibilities and operations. As part of the assessment, each director completes a detailed questionnaire developed by the Lead Independent Director. The results of the questionnaire and interview process are discussed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and are then presented to the full Board for review and discussion. In addition, each Board Committee conducts a similar self-assessment of its performance focused on the Committee's key responsibilities. Feedback from the Committees' self-assessments is reviewed in the applicable Committee and also presented to the full Board for review and discussion. These processes allow for each director to individually reflect on Board and Committee effectiveness as well as a collaborative discussion on performance, providing a meaningful tool to focus on individual and collective areas for improvement. 
Board's Role in Risk Management 
The Board oversees management's establishment and maintenance of the Company's risk management processes and regularly receives direct reports from those responsible for the operations of the Company. The Board delegates certain significant functional areas of risk management to the Board's Committees. Each Committee also conducts its own risk assessment and risk management activities throughout the year, some of which are highlighted in the "Board Committees and Their Functions" section below, and reports its conclusions to the Board. 
Board   Annually assesses risks related to IT security and cybersecurity; legal and regulatory compliance, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and E.U. General Data Protection Regulation; strategic plans, management of operations and financial reporting; medical and scientific standards of care; and human capital management. Audit Committee Assesses major financial risk exposures and steps taken by management to address the same Reviews risks identified during the internal and external auditors' risk assessment procedures Responsible for review of cybersecurity risks, controls and procedures and plans to mitigate cybersecurity risks and respond to data breaches Compensation Committee Reviews compensation plans and practices for consistency with best practices, alignment with the shareholders' interests and support the Company's objective to attract and retain skilled and talented employees Oversees management of risks related to the Company's human capital Quality and Compliance Committee Responsible for overseeing management of risks relating to quality and compliance including operational, environmental, health and safety Oversees risks related to FCPA and data privacy, including evaluating investigation and remediation practices Periodically reviews quality and compliance policy development and training Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Manages risks associated with corporate governance policies and practices Reviews and addresses risks related to Board and management succession planning 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Enterprise Risk Management 
The Board believes that effective enterprise risk management is an integral part of Board and Committee deliberations throughout the year. The Board annually reviews the Company's enterprise risk management process and the comprehensive assessment of key financial, operational, information technology and security, and regulatory risks identified by management, as well as mitigating practices. In addition, the Board discusses risks related to the Company's strategic plan, competitive activities, human capital management and technological developments. The Audit Committee regularly reviews the Company's cybersecurity and other information technology risks, controls and procedures, including plans to mitigate cybersecurity risks and respond to data breaches. The Board receives regular reports directly from officers responsible for management of operations, financial reporting, legal and regulatory compliance, information technology and security (including cybersecurity) and medical and scientific standards of care. The Board also encourages management to promote a corporate culture that integrates risk management into the Company's corporate strategy and day-to-day business operations in a way that is consistent with the Company's targeted risk profile. 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the Company's compensation policies and procedures to ensure that those practices are consistent with emerging best practices, are aligned with the shareholders' interests and support the Company's objective to attract and retain skilled and talented employees. Throughout the year, management reviews compensation policies, practices and changes in applicable regulations with the Compensation Committee, including the impact of the Company's pay practices on the Company's risk profile. The Compensation Committee also works directly with its independent compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook ("FW Cook"), evaluating the Company's compensation philosophy and objectives to identify potential risks in the Company's pay practices. After reviewing FW Cook's analysis and the Compensation Committee's findings, the Board has concluded that our compensation policies and practices are aligned with the interests of shareholders, appropriately reward pay for performance, and do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Identification and Evaluation of Director Candidates 
Identification of Director Candidates 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends a slate of directors to the Board for election by the Company's shareholders at each annual meeting of shareholders and recommends candidates to the Board to fill any vacancies. Members of the Board are encouraged to identify potential candidates and these candidates are regularly reviewed by the committee, which maintains an active list of potential Board candidates. In addition, the committee is authorized to engage professional search firms at the Company's expense to assist with the identification, evaluation and due diligence of potential nominees for the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes it is important to maintain a Board with diverse experiences and expertise, including industry, scientific and medical experience, financial expertise, global business experience, and executive leadership experience. 
Shareholders may also suggest individuals to be considered by the Board as potential nominees for election to the Board. A shareholder may submit an individual for consideration by the Board of Directors in connection with the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders by providing certain information as set forth in the By-Laws, in writing, to the Corporate Secretary of the Company at 358 South Main Street, Burlington, North Carolina 27215. These suggestions for the 2020 Annual Meeting must be received no earlier than the 120th day prior to the anniversary date of the 2019 Annual Meeting (i.e., January 10, 2020) and no later than the 60th day prior to the anniversary date of the 2019 Annual Meeting (i.e., March 10, 2020). Nominees that comply with the foregoing procedures will receive the same consideration as other candidates identified by or to our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
Under the Company's proxy access by-law, eligible shareholders also may submit their own nominations to the Board to be included in the Company's proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The By-Laws permit a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning three percent or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and have included in the Company's proxy materials persons for election to the Board constituting up to 20 percent of the Board, provided that the shareholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy certain requirements specified in the By-Laws. For a shareholder nominee to be included in the 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Company's proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders under the proxy access by-law, the information required by the By-Laws must be received by Sandra D. van der Vaart, Secretary, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, 358 South Main Street, Burlington, North Carolina 27215 no earlier than the close of business on the 150th day prior to the anniversary date of the distribution of this proxy statement (i.e., October 31, 2019) and no later than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the anniversary date of the distribution of this proxy statement (i.e., November 30, 2019).

Mr. Mittelstaedt will retire from the Board this year, pursuant to the Company's mandatory retirement policy for Board members. Our policy states that when a director reaches the age of 75 he or she shall not be eligible to stand for re-election at the next regularly scheduled annual shareholder meeting. We are deeply grateful to Mr. Mittelstaedt for his contributions to the Company.

When evaluating prospective candidates for director, including those nominated by shareholders, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducts individual evaluations of the candidates, taking into account the criteria enumerated in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines (see description below). Among other things, the Committee considers whether prospective candidates have: 
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing with the Board the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members in the context of the Company's business needs and the current composition of the Board. This assessment includes, among other characteristics, diversity, age, background, skills and expertise in the context of the perceived needs of the Board at the time of such assessment. The Company believes that Board membership should reflect diversity in its broadest sense, including persons diverse in geography, gender and ethnicity, and actively considers these factors in its analysis of potential nominees. The Board seeks independent directors who represent a mix of backgrounds and experiences that will enhance the quality of the Board's deliberations and decisions, including experience with publicly traded national, international or multinational companies, executive or financial management experience and/or achievement with distinction in their chosen fields. The Board believes that its composition reflects a balance of skills, experiences, diversity and expertise that provides strong and broad oversight, practical experience and strategic vision to the Company. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Director candidates, other than sitting directors, may be interviewed by the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, other directors, the Chief Executive Officer and the Corporate Secretary. The results of these interviews, as well as any other materials received by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee that it deems relevant, are considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in making its recommendation to the Board. 
Communications with the Board 
Shareholders and interested parties may communicate with the Board, individually or as a group, by submitting written communications to the appropriately addressed Board member(s), c/o Corporate Secretary, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, 358 South Main Street, Burlington, North Carolina 27215. 
All communications with the Board will be reviewed initially by the Corporate Secretary, who will relay all communications to the appropriate director or directors unless the communication is: 
Directors may decide whether any of the communications addressed to their attention should be presented to the full Board, to one or more of its Committees or to the Company's management. Each director also has the discretion to determine whether a response to the person sending the communication is appropriate. Any response will be made through the Company's Corporate Secretary in accordance with the Company's policies and procedures and applicable law and regulations relating to the disclosure of information. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, comprised entirely of independent, non-employee directors, has reviewed and approved the foregoing procedures and is responsible for recommending changes to the procedures as necessary. 
Board Committees and Their Functions 
The Board has four standing Committees that are each composed entirely of independent directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews committee and committee chair assignments annually and recommends committee rosters to the full Board after considering factors such as the directors' business and corporate governance experience, their preferences, criteria for specific committee service, the directors' other responsibilities and scheduling flexibility. Assignments ensure that each committee has an appropriate mix of tenure and experience. Committee membership shown below is as of March 22, 2019:

During 2018, each of the directors attended no less than 92 percent of the total meetings of the Board and the Committees of which he or she was a member. Members of the Board are encouraged to attend our annual meetings and all of the directors, except for Mr. Bélingard, attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
Corporate Governance Policies and Procedures 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
The Board has adopted a set of Corporate Governance Guidelines that address a number of topics, including composition of the Board, director independence, annual self-assessment by the Board and its Committees, retirement of directors and succession planning. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the Corporate Governance Guidelines on a regular basis and any proposed additions or amendments are submitted to the full Board for its consideration. Shareholders may request a printed copy of the Corporate Governance Guidelines from the Corporate Secretary or access a copy on the Investor Relations page under the Corporate Governance tab of LabCorp's website at www.labcorp.com. 
Code of Conduct and Ethics 
The Board has also adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") that is applicable to all directors, officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Code sets forth Company policies and expectations on a number of topics, including but not limited to, conflicts of interest, confidentiality, compliance with laws (including insider trading laws), preservation and use of Company assets, and business ethics. The Code also sets forth procedures for reporting and handling any potential violation of the Code, conflicts of interest and the appearance of any conflict of interest. The Code is regularly reviewed by management, the Audit Committee and the Quality and Compliance Committee and proposed additions or amendments are considered by the full Board. Shareholders may request a printed copy of the Code of Conduct and Ethics from the Corporate Secretary or access a copy under the Corporate Governance tab of the Investor Relations page on LabCorp's website at www.labcorp.com. In addition, any waivers for directors, officers and employees of the Company or amendments to the Code will also be posted on LabCorp's website. 
Related Party Transactions 
In accordance with its charter, the Board's Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the terms and conditions of all related party transactions. The Company's directors and key employees, including all members of senior management, complete annual reports disclosing, or certifying the absence of, any related party transactions. The Audit Committee reviews all potential material transactions involving related persons (as such transactions are defined by Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K as promulgated by the SEC) before allowing the Company to enter into any such transaction. The Company has not adopted a static set of criteria to be applied in evaluating a related party transaction and instead tailors the scope of its review to the particular circumstances presented by each transaction to ensure that any such transaction is thoroughly reviewed and evaluated. Based on the Company's review of its transactions, there have been no transactions or proposed transactions considered to be material related party transactions since January 1, 2018. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The Company's director compensation is designed to attract and retain highly qualified, independent directors to represent shareholders on the Board and act in their best interest. The Compensation Committee, which consists solely of independent directors, has primary responsibility for setting our director compensation. FW Cook, the Committee's independent compensation consultant, assists the Compensation Committee in evaluating our director compensation program. 
Elements of Non-Employee Director Compensation 
Director compensation is designed to align director compensation with emerging best practices and reflect the Board's belief that director compensation should not depend upon the number of meetings held but rather on the ongoing work and role of the directors throughout the year. The 2018 elements of our non-employee director compensation included the following: 
Effective as of October 2, 2018, the annual retainer to each non-employee director was increased to $110,000 from $105,000, resulting in the effective annual retainer for 2018 being $106,250. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       determined by using the closing price of the Company's Common Stock on the grant date ($168.49). The restricted stock units vested fully on February 12, 2019. As described in the  footnotes to the table below, Mr. Bélingard received an additional equity award in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Effective as of February 2019, the annual grant of restricted stock units to each non-employee director was increased in value to approximately $180,000, subject to the requirements of the Company's Director Stock Ownership Program. 
In addition, the Company has a policy of granting to each new director that joins the Board equity awards with a prorated amount of the value of the annual award granted to all directors, with a one-year vesting period. 
The decision in 2018 to increase the directors' cash compensation and equity compensation award was recommended by FW Cook based on their study of non-employee director compensation and was intended to maintain director pay levels with the competitive median of the peer group used for purposes of director compensation comparisons and broader industry benchmarks. 
Director Stock Ownership Program 
Maintaining a significant personal level of stock ownership ensures that each director is financially aligned with the interests of our shareholders. The Board believes that by holding an equity position in the Company, directors demonstrate their alignment with the long-term strategy and initiatives of the Company. In October 2015, the Board revised the Company's Director Stock Ownership Program to more closely align the policy with that of the peer group, by requiring each non-employee director to acquire and maintain a number of shares having a value equal to five times that of the annual cash retainer. 
For purposes of determining whether the stock ownership requirement is satisfied, a calculation is performed for each director annually as of the business day closest to June 30 of each year (the "Measurement Date"), utilizing the average closing price of the Company's Common Stock for the 90-day period ending on the Measurement Date. For 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
new participants, the stock ownership requirement is initially determined as of the date that the director becomes a participant, utilizing the average closing price of the Company stock for the 90-day period ending on that date. 
Until the required level of ownership is met, a director is required to hold 50 percent of any shares of Common Stock acquired upon the lapse of restrictions on any stock grant and upon the exercise of stock options, net of any shares utilized to pay for the exercise price of the option and any tax withholding, if applicable. If a director fails to meet or show progress towards satisfying these requirements, the Compensation Committee may reduce future equity grants to that director. Once satisfied, each director is required to maintain the required level of stock ownership for his or her entire tenure of service on the Board. Each member of our Board is currently in compliance with the director stock ownership program, either through satisfying the required level of ownership, or by satisfying the holding requirement. 
Summary of 2018 Compensation to Non-Employee Directors 
The compensation paid by the Company to the non-employee directors for 2018 is set forth in the table below. Information on compensation for Mr. King is set forth in the "Executive Compensation" section below (page 47).

(3)  This amount includes a one-time discretionary equity award of 3,271 shares  granted on December 4, 2018 at a fair value price of $468,832 by the Board to Mr. Bélingard (the "Extraordinary Award"). The Board made the Extraordinary Award after considering special circumstances that resulted in the  expiration of an option award held by Mr. Bélingard for 5,300 shares at an exercise price of $75.63 in May of 2018 (the "Prior Option"). Mr. Bélingard attempted to exercise the Prior Option before its expiration but  was informed by a company employee that the option term would be extended so that exercise would occur after a LabCorp's trading blackout imposed on directors and officers was lifted. In fact, under the terms of the plan under which the Prior  Option was granted, an extension was not permitted, and the Prior Option expired unexercised. The Board determined that the failure to exercise the Prior Option did not result from any fault or intentional delay on Mr. Bélingard's  part. In determining to make the Extraordinary Award, the Board considered that had Mr. Bélingard exercised and sold the Prior Option on the original expiration date as he intended, he would have netted,  pre-tax, an amount equivalent to $506,044, calculated by multiplying 5,300 by the difference between the closing price of LabCorp's common stock on the Expiration Date ($171.11) and the original exercise  price of the Option ($75.63). The Extraordinary Award was made in accordance with the Company's 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which allows for additional compensation to be granted solely in the Board's discretion to non-employee directors, as long as (x) the aggregate compensation paid to the non-employee director does not exceed $750,000 during a calendar year and (y) the non-employee director receiving such additional compensation does not participate in the decision to award such compensation or in other contemporaneous compensation decisions involving non-employee directors. The Board determined that the Extraordinary Award resulted from extraordinary circumstances and was appropriate under the circumstances given Mr. Bélingard's good faith in  following what he was informed to be company policy. Mr. Bélingard did not participate in this determination or the grant of the Extraordinary Award.  
(4)  Mr. Mittelstaedt will retire from the Board and each Committee on which he serves upon the expiration of his term  at the 2019 Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
The aggregate number of vested and exercisable stock options held by each director as of December 31, 2018 was as follows: Ms. Anderson – 5,700; Mr. Bélingard – 9,400; Dr. Gilliland – 0; Dr. Kong – 0; Mr. Mittelstaedt – 9,400; Mr. Neupert – 0; Ms. Parham – 0; Mr. Schechter – 0; and Dr. Williams – 2,600. Beginning in 2013, as part of the realignment of our long-term incentive compensation, we ceased granting stock options to directors. 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
PROPOSAL ONE – Election of Directors 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the full Board have nominated each of David P. King, Kerrii B. Anderson, Jean-Luc Bélingard, D. Gary Gilliland, Garheng Kong, Peter M. Neupert, Richelle P. Parham, Adam H. Schechter and R. Sanders Williams for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting to hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. All nominees have consented to serve, and the Board does not know of any reason why any nominee would be unable to serve. No director nominee is related to any of our other director nominees or executive officers and there are no arrangements or understandings between a director and any other person pursuant to which such person was selected as a director nominee. If a nominee becomes unavailable or unable to serve before the 2019 Annual Meeting, the Board can either reduce its size or designate a substitute nominee. If the Board designates a substitute, your proxy will be voted for the substitute nominee. 
Mr. Mittelstaedt will retire from the Board this year, pursuant to the Company's mandatory retirement policy for Board members. Our policy states that when a director reaches the age of 75 he or she shall not be eligible to stand for re-election at the next regularly scheduled annual shareholder meeting. We are deeply grateful to Mr. Mittelstaedt for his contributions to the Company. Because Mr. Mittelstaedt has not been nominated for re-election, the Board will reduce its size to nine members effective immediately upon the expiration of Mr. Mittelstaedt's term at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Information about each nominee is included below, including details about the nominee's qualifications, skills and experiences that supported the determination by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board that the person should serve as a director of LabCorp.

Shareholder Engagement and Evolution of Compensation Plan 
Over the last five years, our annual advisory vote on executive compensation has averaged support of approximately 95 percent of the shares voted. Last year, our annual advisory vote on executive compensation received support from approximately 95 percent of the shares represented at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and entitled to vote. We consider this level of approval indicative of the support of the vast majority of our shareholders. We remain committed to a compensation program that incentivizes our leaders and aligns with our strategy, the key value drivers of our business and the expectations of our shareholders. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
To ensure shareholder input is reflected in our programs, we engage with our shareholders throughout the year to discuss their views on our compensation and corporate governance programs as well as other topics of emerging concern and focus. Since our last annual meeting, we have engaged with holders representing more than 75 percent of our shares outstanding. Our shareholder outreach involved members of management and our Board, including our Compensation Committee Chair. We strive to increase our engagement with our shareholders, including by involving our Lead Independent Director as well as other members of our Board in meetings with our largest shareholders. One key area of discussion with our shareholders is our executive compensation program. Input from our shareholders on compensation is shared with our Compensation Committee and discussed as part of the Committee's annual review of our compensation program. Specific comments we have received from investors are reflected in the evolution of our executive compensation program and compensation best practices, as well as our corporate governance practices, such as the adoption of our Clawback Policy. 
Since 2011, we have made several key structural changes to emphasize long-term performance and create stronger alignment with our strategic priorities. 
In addition, we adopted a robust Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy (the "Clawback Policy") in 2018, which generally provides for clawback of cash and equity awards upon an Audit Committee or Compensation Committee finding, as applicable, of an accounting restatement caused by material non-compliance, an overpayment of an award based on an accounting error, or employee misconduct. See "Equity Grant Practices; Clawback Requirement" below for further discussion. 
Our long-term incentives will continue to represent the overwhelming majority of our executives' compensation mix to maintain emphasis on long-term alignment with the interests of our shareholders. With the Compensation Committee's determination to reintroduce the use of stock options in its equity awards in 2017, the long-term incentive mix continues to be primarily performance-based, with 60 percent performance shares, 20 percent restricted stock units and 20 percent non-qualified stock options. The Committee concluded that the current mix is consistent with its commitment to responding to shareholder input, structuring pay for performance and incentivizing executives to achieve superior financial results and create shareholder value. 
Compensation Program Overview and Alignment with Company Performance and Shareholder Interests 
LabCorp's executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain executives in a highly competitive environment. Our executive compensation philosophy is to pay for performance by rewarding the achievement of specific short-term and long-term operational and strategic goals. We believe our executive compensation program discourages unnecessary risk-taking and aligns the interests of our shareholders with the performance of our executives. This program reflects our strong commitment to a results-driven compensation program. 
In support of the Compensation Committee's overarching pay for performance compensation philosophy, our executives' compensation structure is: 
The Committee has structured our executive compensation program to align compensation with performance using three key elements of compensation: (i) annual salary; (ii) annual cash incentive pay; and (iii) long-term incentive awards. The Committee sets total target compensation for these three elements to be competitive in relation to the median peer compensation as reflected in data provided by FW Cook, its independent consultant, while continuing to emphasize the variable or at-risk portion of compensation when establishing the mix among these elements. 
Approximately 61 percent of our CEO's target compensation is based on long-term Company or stock price performance and is in the form of equity. We believe the significant portion of total compensation delivered in equity tightly aligns Mr. King's performance with the Company's objectives and our shareholder's expectations. Over 75 percent of our CEO's compensation is performance-based and at-risk. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
The charts below show the mix of pay elements included in total compensation opportunities for 2018 for our Chief Executive Officer and an average for our other NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Pay mix totals do not include a special retention restricted stock award with an approximate value of $2,000,000 to Mr.  Ratliff.  
[END TABLE]
The Company seeks to achieve outstanding performance for our shareholders through a focus on increased adjusted operating income, revenue, adjusted EPS, and relative total shareholder return (compared against our peer group). Our compensation program rewards our executives for achieving goals set for these financial measures, as well as provides them a direct incentive to both preserve and create shareholder value and increase the Company's stock price. A substantial majority of the executives' 2018 compensation opportunity was in the form of variable and performance-based awards, including performance-based cash compensation under our annual incentive cash plan (the "MIB Plan"), performance shares, stock options and restricted stock units, all of which provide our executives a strong incentive to drive Company performance and increase shareholder value. Incentive compensation is guided by the following principles: 
The Committee believes this program reflects our strong commitment to a results-driven compensation program and the amounts earned in 2018 by our NEOs reflect this approach. For example, most of the Company's financial goals under the MIB Plan were achieved near or above target. As a result of performance on those goals and after taking into account individual goals, Mr, King received a MIB payout at 91.9 percent of target and the 2018 MIB Plan payouts to the other NEOs ranged between 81.6 and 91.9 percent of target. 
Our commitment to paying for performance is demonstrated in the graph below, which shows the total payout of the annual non-equity incentive compensation for Mr. King year over year from 2014 to 2018. During the three-year period ending in 2018, the Company reported significant growth in revenue, earnings, free cash flow, and stock price, driven by organic growth and disciplined acquisitions, including the 2015 acquisition of Covance, Inc., which significantly expanded the Company's offering to the biopharmaceutical industry, increased the Company's international presence and enhanced the Company's long-term profitable growth opportunities.

Strong Compensation Practices 
Consistent with the Company's focus on enhancing the alignment of our executive officers' interests with those of our shareholders, the Company's executive compensation program has the following features: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all executives must meet significant stock ownership requirements that increase with their level of responsibility within  the Company; in 2018 the stock ownership requirements for the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice Presidents were six times base salary and three times base salary, respectively;

The Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for the development, oversight and implementation of the executive compensation plan. The Committee works throughout the year reviewing compensation trends, evaluating emerging best practices and considering changes to the executive compensation program that aligns pay with performance and provide our senior management with an incentive to achieve superior financial results for the Company. In determining whether changes to the executive compensation program are needed, the Committee considers the goals and strategic objectives of the Company, including changes to strategy that should be reflected in the incentive structure 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
of the management team. The Committee also considers the results of prior advisory votes on compensation and direct shareholder input in determining changes to the executive compensation program. The Committee approves changes to each component of executive officer compensation, including merit increases in base salary, annual incentive awards and long-term equity incentive awards. 
Compensation Decisions for Mr. King 
With regard to compensation decisions for Mr. King, our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee considers the results of his performance assessment, including input from all independent non-employee directors, as well as the Company's financial and business performance. In an executive session, the chair of the Compensation Committee leads the independent non-employee directors through a review of Mr. King's annual accomplishments, a review and approval of compensation actions recommended by the Compensation Committee, and a review of performance objectives for the next year. The Board (except for Mr. King) reviews and approves the Committee's decisions with respect to Mr. King's compensation. 
The Role of Management 
Annually, Mr. King is invited to provide input on the Compensation Committee's executive compensation decisions, and the Compensation Committee has delegated to Mr. King the responsibility of determining the individual and strategic goals for the annual incentive plans for each of the other NEOs, subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee. Mr. King's input and compensation proposals for the other NEOs are based on his assessment of past and expected individual performance and contribution. In addition, in her role as the Company's Chief Human Resources Officer, Ms. Uthgenannt generally attends and participates in meetings of the Compensation Committee, including to provide input on the design and implementation of the Company's executive compensation program. 
The Role of the Independent Consultant 
FW Cook, the Committee's independent compensation consultant, plays an integral role in supporting the Compensation Committee in the compensation-setting process, and one of its representatives attends most of the Compensation Committee meetings to serve as a resource for the Committee. FW Cook provides insight and advice related to the Company's compensation plans and policies, and provides recommendations based on compensation trends and regulatory and compliance developments. To encourage independent review and discussion of executive compensation matters, the Compensation Committee and the Committee chair regularly meet with the independent compensation consultant in executive sessions without management present. The Compensation Committee has sole authority to retain or replace the independent compensation consultant. To maintain consultant independence, Compensation Committee pre-approval is required for all services performed by the independent compensation consultant. In 2018, the Committee assessed the independence of FW Cook considering, among other factors, the independence factors established by the New York Stock Exchange. Specifically, FW Cook provides no services to the Company or its management other than the services provided to the Compensation Committee in its capacity as the Committee's independent adviser on executive compensation matters. FW Cook affirmed that no member of the consulting team has any business or personal relationship with the CEO or any member of the Company's Compensation Committee. FW Cook also affirmed that neither FW Cook nor any member of the consulting team serving the Company's Compensation Committee owns any stock of the Company. In addition, the Committee evaluated the work of FW Cook and determined that its work raised no conflict of interest, including under applicable New York Stock Exchange factors. Considering all of these factors, the Compensation Committee concluded FW Cook was independent. 
Use of Peer Group 
In evaluating executive compensation, the Compensation Committee considers both absolute performance of the Company and performance relative to an established peer group, as well as the pay practices of that peer group. With input from FW Cook and recognizing that LabCorp has no directly comparable competitors, the comparative peer group is selected from public companies in the healthcare services industry that are closest to LabCorp in terms of scope of services and are of a similar size in terms of revenue, profitability, cash flow, market capitalization and number of employees. Each year, with the support of FW Cook, the Committee reviews the previous year's peer group to ensure it remains valid for benchmarking purposes and adjusts as needed to reflect changes in business strategy and circumstances (e.g., acquisitions). St. Jude Medical, Inc. was removed from the peer group following its acquisition by Abbott Laboratories in January 2017. Envision Health Care Corporation and MEDNAX, Inc. were added to the peer 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
group as the Committee believes that the size and business mix of each company makes them suitable comparators for LabCorp. The companies included in the 2018 comparative peer group were: 
Annually, FW Cook prepares a review of competitive total compensation for the Company's executives versus total compensation for similar positions at our peer group companies and utilizes national general industry survey data for executives for whom there is insufficient comparable information in the peer company proxy statements. 
Shareholder Input 
In addition to the overall comparative framework and the other factors discussed above and below, we also consider input from our shareholders. We engaged with shareholders representing more than 75 percent of our shares outstanding throughout the year relating to executive compensation matters and will continue our outreach and consideration of input from shareholders. We also consider the outcome of our annual say on pay votes when making executive compensation decisions. See "Proposal No. 2" below for this year's "say on pay" proposal. Last year, approximately 95 percent of the shareholders' votes represented at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and entitled to vote on this proposal were voted in favor of the proposal. The Committee believes that this approval by a substantial majority of our shareholders demonstrates strong support for our approach to executive compensation and, as a result, the Committee will continue to evaluate executive compensation using the same clear principles of performance-based compensation. 
2018 Actions 
Our executive compensation program focuses on three key elements of compensation: (i) annual salary; (ii) annual cash incentive pay; and (iii) long-term incentive awards. The following chart shows how these elements were used by the Committee in 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
BASE SALARY     Effective July 2018, the Committee increased  Mr. King's base pay by 4.3%, which had not been increased in the prior year. The base salaries of other NEOs were increased as follows: Messrs. Eisenberg and Ratliff by 3.1%, Mr. Huff by 3.0%, and Mr. Eberts by 5.8%.  (Mr. Huff declined his 2018 pay increase in light of LabCorp Diagnostics' performance.)

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
In addition to the three main elements of our compensation program, we also provide limited perquisites, severance benefits and post-retirement benefits as part of a standard, competitive compensation package. 
From time to time, the Committee, in its discretion, determines that certain executives should receive additional compensation outside of the annual compensation program. In 2018, the Committee determined that Mr. Ratliff should receive, and in April 2018 granted him, a restricted stock unit award with an approximate value of $2,000,000, with 20 percent vesting on the one year anniversary of the grant date and 30 and 50 percent vesting on the second and third anniversaries of the grant date, respectively, to incentivize Mr. Ratliff to continue as Executive Vice President of the Company and Chief Executive Officer of Covance Drug Development over the long-term. 
Base Salary 
While the Compensation Committee generally targets salary levels of the NEOs at or below the median of the peer group, it retains the flexibility to adjust individual compensation to take into account variations in the individual's job experience and responsibility, including as reviewed and recommended to the Committee by Mr. King. Annual changes in base salaries are determined using several factors, including the peer group's practices, our performance, the individual's performance and increases generally provided to our employees. 
Effective July 2018, the Committee increased Mr. King's base pay by 4.3 percent. Mr. King declined a base pay increase in 2017. The base salaries of certain other NEOs were increased as follows: Messrs. Eisenberg and Ratliff by 3.1 percent and Mr. Eberts by 5.8 percent. Mr. Eberts' salary was increased based on a review of competitive base salaries and Mr. Eberts' performance. Mr. Huff declined his salary increase in light of LabCorp Diagnostics' performance. 
Annual Cash Incentive Pay (MIB Plan) 
Our MIB Plan is designed to compensate our executives for achieving in-year goals that further the Company's strategy and create shareholder value. Target MIB Plan award amounts for 2018 for the NEOs ranged from 70 percent to 150 percent of base salary, depending on the role of the executive and competitive market positioning. As a result of the level of performance on those goals and after taking into account individual goals, Mr. King received a MIB Plan payout below target at 91.9 percent of target. The other NEOs received a MIB payout of approximately 91.9 percent of target on average with the exception of Mr. Ratliff, whose payout was at 91.1 percent of target, and Mr. Huff whose payout was at 81.6 percent of target. 
Company financial goals may be achieved by the NEOs at a threshold, target or superior level. If actual performance measures fall between either the threshold and target levels or the target and superior levels, the payouts are interpolated accordingly. If the threshold level of performance for a particular goal is not achieved, the payout for that goal is zero. Individual and strategic goals are measured based on a yes/no outcome (i.e., the goal was either achieved, triggering a 100 percent target payment, or was not achieved, resulting in no payment). 
Company Financial Goals. For 2018, all of the NEOs shared the following two Company financial goals, which were each weighted at 35 percent for Messrs. King, Eberts and Eisenberg and at ten percent for Messrs. Huff and Ratliff: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consolidated Revenues; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consolidated Adjusted Operating Income  
[END TABLE]
The consolidated revenues and consolidated adjusted operating income performance measures were selected as performance measures because they are top-line and bottom-line measures used by the Company and the investment community to evaluate our operating performance. 
Mr. Ratliff had the following three additional business segment financial goals: 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Mr. Huff had the following two additional business segment financial goals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• LabCorp Diagnostics Segment Revenues (25 percent weighting); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• LabCorp Diagnostics Segment Adjusted Operating Income (25 percent weighting).  
[END TABLE]
In addition to the shared Company financial goals described above, the performance measures used for the remaining 30 percent of each NEO's target amount were directed to specific areas of focus for each NEO for 2018, tying individual performance to strategic goals that were intended to contribute to our overall success. The individual and strategic goals applicable to each NEO under the MIB Plan for 2018 are discussed below under the heading "Summary of MIB Plan Payments by Executive." 
Setting and Evaluating Performance Targets. The threshold, target and superior goals for the consolidated revenues and consolidated adjusted operating income measures were based on various outcomes considered by the Compensation Committee, with the target amounts most closely approximating the Company's operating budget approved by the Board. The achievement of performance measures that are not financially-based was determined by the Committee in its discretion and after discussion with Mr. King. Performance levels are determined annually by the Compensation Committee based upon its collective experience, reasoned business judgment and consultation with FW Cook. The Compensation Committee determines the performance measures, performance targets and allocation for Mr. King. In turn, the Committee has delegated to Mr. King the responsibility of determining the individual and strategic goals for the annual incentive plans for each of the other NEOs, subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Mr. Ratliff 
As Executive Vice President of LabCorp and Chief Executive Officer of Covance Drug Development, Mr. Ratliff had individual goals for 2018 that were based on his responsibility for completing certain strategic operations with respect to LaunchPad and other priorities. As a result of the achievements reflected in the table below, Mr. Ratliff earned an annual incentive cash payment that was approximately 91.1 percent of his 2018 target goal.

Long-Term Incentive Awards 
Long-term incentive awards for 2018 continued to be comprised of a mix of performance share awards (60 percent of target value, based on grant date fair value), time based non-qualified stock options (20 percent of target value, based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model) and restricted stock units (20 percent of target value, based on grant date fair value). 
In setting 2018 long-term compensation, the Compensation Committee determined that a balanced program using performance-based awards, non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units would achieve all of the following: 
Long-term incentive award values for 2018 were structured so that target award opportunities were generally positioned to deliver total direct compensation at the median of the peer group. Mr. King's award values for 2018 were slightly above the median of the peer group and the award values for the balance of the NEOs for 2018 ranged from slightly below the 25th percentile to slightly above the 75th percentile of the peer group. The Compensation 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Committee retains the flexibility to adjust individual award levels, taking into account variations in the individual's job experience and responsibility, including as reviewed and recommended to the Committee by Mr. King for executives other than himself. These values were selected based on the Company's desire to attract and retain executive talent, the Company's stated objective of placing a greater emphasis on long-term incentives and the Committee's assessment of the Company's performance. Non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units generally vest in equal one-third increments over a three-year period beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. 
The Committee has used a relative total shareholder return ("TSR") metric as a modifier on the performance share metrics since 2014. If the three-year cumulative relative TSR falls below the 25th percentile of our peer group, the calculated payout of the performance shares will be reduced by 25 percent. If the three-year cumulative relative TSR is above the 75th percentile, the calculated payout of the performance shares will be increased by 25 percent. The Committee believes the use of a TSR modifier ensures that exceptional or subpar TSR performance appropriately limits or rewards long-term incentive compensation that is based on EPS growth and revenue. The metrics for the long-term performance share program are as follows: 
In 2018, in consultation with our compensation consultant and in consideration of peer group metrics, we revised the enterprise performance metrics for performance share awards, raising the performance target for "superior" and lowering the performance target for "threshold," with the objective of better aligning performance with superior results. 
Mr. Ratliff's retention award, discussed above, was not considered in determining the award size or mix of his long-term incentive awards. 
2018-2020 Performance Shares Granted 
Performance shares granted to each of the NEOs for the 2018-2020 performance period will be earned, if at all, based on three-year average annual EPS growth, revenue growth measured by three-year cumulative revenue, and total shareholder return relative to our peer group, as follows:

Equity Grant Practices; Clawback Requirement 
Generally, the Compensation Committee approves equity grants at the beginning of the year in connection with a regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meeting. The equity grants are awarded under the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, pursuant to which the grant date of an award is the date the Compensation Committee approves the award, and the price is based on the closing market price on the grant date. The Compensation Committee does not time awards with the release of information concerning the Company. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Awards that have been made pursuant to the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan are subject to any recoupment policy adopted by us to comply with the requirements of any applicable laws. In December 2018, the Board adopted the Clawback Policy, which generally provides for clawback of cash and equity awards upon an Audit Committee or Compensation Committee finding, as applicable, of an accounting restatement caused by material non-compliance with any reporting requirement, an overpayment of an award based on an accounting error, or employee misconduct. In addition, awards made under the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan may be annulled if the grantee is terminated for cause (as defined in the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan or in any other agreement with the grantee). 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board believes that requiring executive management to maintain a significant personal level of stock ownership ensures that each executive officer is financially aligned with the interests of our shareholders. Pursuant to the executive stock ownership program, the stock ownership requirement for each senior executive is determined annually, utilizing the executive's base salary as of the business day closest to June 30 of each year (the "Measurement Date") and the average closing price of the Company's Common Stock for the 90-day period ending on the Measurement Date. For new executive officers, the stock ownership requirement is initially determined as of the date that the person becomes an executive officer, utilizing the executive's base salary as of that date and the average closing price of the Company's Common Stock for the 90-day period ending on that date. 
The required level of stock ownership will be adjusted if the executive's position changes and the new position has a different ownership requirement. An executive is required to maintain this level of stock ownership throughout his or her tenure with the Company until near retirement, as explained below. The ownership requirements for each position are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   POSITION       COMPANY STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS AS A MULTIPLE OF BASE SALARY   
   POSITION       COMPANY STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS AS A MULTIPLE OF BASE SALARY

   Chief Executive Officer               6x         
   Chief Executive Officer               6x         
   Executive Vice Presidents               3x         
   Executive Vice Presidents               3x         
   Executive Vice Presidents               3x         
   All Other Executive Officers               1x         
   All Other Executive Officers               1x         
   All Other Executive Officers               1x         
[END TABLE]
Until the required level of ownership is met, an executive is required to hold 50 percent of any shares of Company Common Stock acquired upon the lapse of restrictions on any stock grant and upon the exercise of stock options, net of taxes and shares used to pay the exercise price. If an executive fails to meet or show progress towards satisfying these requirements, the Compensation Committee may reduce future equity grants or other incentive compensation for that executive. Once an executive reaches the age of 62, the ownership requirement is reduced by 50 percent, and once an executive reaches the age of 64, the ownership requirement is reduced by 75 percent. As of December 31, 2018, each of the NEOs was in in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines, either through satisfying the required level of ownership, or by satisfying the holding requirement. 
Ban on Pledging and Hedging Transactions 
The Company maintains an Insider Trading Policy that prohibits executives and key employees from pledging and hedging with respect to Company stock, including the use of "short sales," "puts," "calls" and similar instruments designed to offset the risk of a decline in the value of the Company's stock. 
Perquisites 
The Compensation Committee has determined that financial services, long-term disability, a wellness exam allowance and certain security services are appropriate benefits that help ensure that the Company's executives maintain appropriate fiscal and physical health, which contributes to stable executive leadership for the Company. While historically the use of corporate aircraft for personal travel has been limited to extraordinary circumstances, in December 2017, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, permitted Mr. King to use corporate aircraft for personal travel to increase his time available for business purposes, enhance his productivity and efficiency, and promote safety and security while traveling. The Compensation Committee set a personal travel allowance of $150,000 for Mr. King's use in 2018. Mr. King, however, will not receive tax reimbursement for any imputed income associated with personal travel. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
The Compensation Committee believes that the perquisites are conservative and beneficial to the Company, and there are no tax gross-up payments associated with these perquisites. For more information on perquisites in 2018, including the valuation and amounts, see the "Summary Compensation Table" below. 
Termination and Change-in-Control Payments 
The Company originally adopted a severance program in 1996 to provide participants financial protection in circumstances involving a qualifying termination, with a higher level of payment if the qualifying termination occurs within three years of a change in control (a "double trigger"). The severance program comprised the Amended and Restated Master Senior Executive Severance Plan (the "Amended and Restated Severance Plan") and the Master Senior Executive Change-in-Control Severance Plan (the "Change-in-Control Plan"). The Company originally adopted and continues to maintain the severance program to provide a competitive benefit necessary to attract and retain executives, and so that in the context of a change in control the executive would consider corporate actions that would benefit shareholders without regard to personal finances. 
As a result of amendments over time, we believe that the severance program is appropriately structured and consistent with current market practice. For example, the plans provide for severance payments, a portion of which is based on the executive's average actual MIB payout over a three-year period prior to the termination of employment, rather than target, and the plans do not have tax gross-up payments associated with change-in-control payments. For additional information on the termination and change-in-control benefits under the Amended and Restated Severance Plan and the Change-in-Control Plan, see "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control" on page 54. 
The 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan provides that if awards are assumed or substituted in connection with a change in control, only a qualifying termination event will result in accelerated vesting (i.e. "double trigger"). The plan does not provide for any gross-up. We believe these provisions are consistent with current compensation trends. 
Senior Executive Transition Policy 
In 2004, the Board approved the Senior Executive Transition Policy (the "Transition Policy") to reflect the belief that a strong succession planning process ensures the continued success of the Company while failure to ensure a smooth transition of leadership would have an adverse effect on the Company and its shareholders. Eligibility requirements for the Transition Policy include, (i) being a member of the management Executive Committee ("EC") and designated as a participant by the Chief Executive Officer and the Compensation Committee, (ii) having five years of service as an EC member, (iii) having ten years of service with the Company, and (iv) approval from the Board of a plan that ensures a smooth and effective transition of the departing executive's management team and includes a non-solicit and non-compete agreement. The eligibility requirements of the Transition Policy are designed to ensure the retention of the executive over a period of time, to provide the Company with the ability to limit participation to the most senior executives and to ensure the goal of strong succession planning. The Transition Policy also provides additional protection to the Company in the form of non-compete and non-solicitation obligations on the part of the departing executive, which obligations extend for a period of two years from the date of a departing executive's termination and, with respect to the non-solicitation obligations, apply to any business or entity that was a customer of LabCorp during the one year period preceding the date of a departing executive's termination. The policy sets forth the treatment of long-term incentive awards made under the Company's stock incentive plans in the event of a voluntary termination before age 65. On September 14, 2014, the Compensation Committee decided to end future participation in the Transition Policy. The only individual designated for participation in the Transition Policy is Mr. King. 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
In 2001, the Board approved the Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP"), under which certain of the Company's executives, including the NEOs, may elect to defer up to 100 percent of their annual cash incentive pay and/or up to 50 percent of their annual base salary and/or eligible commissions subject to annual limits established by the federal government. The deferral limits were based on the Compensation Committee's assessment of best practices at the time the DCP was established. The DCP provides executives a tax efficient strategy for retirement savings and capital accumulation without significant cost to the Company. The Company makes no contributions to the DCP. For additional information on the DCP, see "Deferred Compensation Plan" and accompanying table beginning on page 53. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Retirement Plans 
The Company previously adopted a supplemental retirement plan, the Pension Equalization Plan (the "PEP") for executives, including the NEOs who have met the Plan's service requirements. The PEP is an unfunded, non-contributory, non-qualified plan that was designed to provide income continuation benefits at retirement and work in conjunction with the Company's Cash Balance Retirement Plan (the "Cash Balance Plan"), a qualified and funded defined benefit plan available to substantially all employees. The PEP was intended to provide additional retirement benefits to a select group of management employees as an integral part of a total compensation package designed to attract and retain top executive performers. Requirements of participation when the PEP was established included (i) approval of participation by the Chief Executive Officer, (ii) being named as a Senior or Executive Vice President or operating in the capacity of one, or (iii) being named as the President or Chief Executive Officer. Effective January 1, 2010, both the PEP and the Cash Balance Plan were frozen; after that date no new participants have been admitted and no further service credits were awarded to current participants. 
The Company currently offers a defined contribution retirement savings plan (i.e., 401(k) plan) called the Employees' Retirement Savings Plan. Participation in this plan is available to substantially all eligible US-based employees, including executives. Company contribution information for executives is reflected in the "Summary Compensation Table" below. 
Tax and Accounting Treatments 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code") limits the corporate federal income tax deduction for compensation paid, including pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "TCJA"), to the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, and, pursuant to IRS guidance, each of the three other highest-paid employees of public companies to $1 million per year. Prior to December 2017, compensation that was "performance-based" under Section 162(m) and compensation that was paid to the chief financial officer was not subject to this deduction limit. However, following enactment of the TCJA, these exceptions were eliminated. The Compensation Committee believes that tax deductibility is but one factor to be considered in fashioning an appropriate compensation package for executives. As a result, the Compensation Committee exercises its discretion in this area to design a compensation program that serves the long-term interests of the Company and has regularly decided that it is appropriate for the Company to make some compensation awards that are non-deductible. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of the Company has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K (including through incorporation by reference to this Proxy Statement).

(1)  Values reflect the amounts actually paid to the NEOs in each year. Base salary adjustments, if any, typically occur in  February of each year. In 2018, base salary adjustments were effective as of July 1. Base salary adjustments are typically not retroactive to the beginning of the year.  
(2)  Represents the aggregate grant date fair value of options, restricted stock units and performance shares for each NEO  granted during each respective year, computed in accordance with accounting standards for stock-based compensation. Assumptions used in this calculation are included on page F-35 of our 2018 Annual Report on  Form 10-K. The grant date fair value of restricted stock units is based on the closing price of the Common Stock on the applicable grant date. For performance share awards, the grant date fair value is based  on a Monte Carlo simulated fair value for the relative (to the 15 peer companies) total shareholder return component of the performance awards. The Monte Carlo simulation model uses the following assumptions to determine fair value:  (i) expected volatility for the Company of 19.71% and a separate volatility for each company in the peer group based on the historical stock price volatility over the last 2.88 years; (ii) correlation coefficients calculated based on the  price data used to calculate historical volatilities; (iii) a risk-free interest rate of 2.26%; and (iv) a dividend yield for the Company and each member of the peer group of 0%. For this purpose, performance share awards included in the  above totals are valued assuming achievement of the EPS and revenue goals at target, which was the probable outcome determined for accounting purposes at the time of grant. The threshold and superior grant date values of performance share awards  granted in 2018 included above are as follows:

(5)  Includes the value of the following perquisites: financial services; executive long-term disability premiums; personal  liability insurance premiums; travel; and wellness exam pursuant to the policies in effect for a particular year. Also includes certain amounts paid for security for Messrs. King, Eisenberg, Huff and Ratliff. Also includes Company 401(k)  contributions, which are applicable to all eligible employees. Financial services amounts are based on the actual amounts paid by the Company to its third-party vendor for financial services. The Company canceled the personal liability insurance  benefit as of January 1, 2017, so no premiums were due or paid in 2017 or 2018. Mr. Ratliff's wife accompanied him on one flight on the Company aircraft when Mr. Ratliff was traveling for business. As Mr. Ratliff's wife's travel  did not result in any incremental cost to the Company, no amount is shown in the "All Other Compensation" column in connection with this arrangement.  
(6)  Includes (i) a severance payment in the amount of two times (a) $600,000, which is the amount of  Mr. Huff's base salary plus (b) $431,633.50, which represents Mr. Huff's MIB Average Bonus as calculated under the Amended and Restated Severance Plan, and (ii) $641,193.20, which is the amount equal to the value of the 5,164  shares of restricted stock units forfeited by Mr. Huff under the terms of the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan upon his termination. The severance amounts described in (i) above are payable in two installments, with the first installment paid  on January 30, 2019 and the second installment due on January 30, 2020. As further discussed below in the section entitled Gary M. Huff and F. Samuel Eberts III Separation, Mr. Huff's employment with the Company terminated  effective December 31, 2018.

(2)   Each of Messrs. King, Ratliff, Eisenberg and Huff has been instructed by the Board to take certain actions to enhance  his security, which for Mr. King and Mr. Ratliff includes using a specified company vehicle. Rather than disclose a lower amount based on the use of the automobile attributable to what is deemed to be personal use, which is permitted under  applicable rules, this column reflects all the costs, both personal and business, incurred by the Company in 2018 for the vehicle used by Mr. King ($22,286) and Mr. Ratliff ($20,720). Mr. King has also been instructed to use the  corporate aircraft for personal travel in order to enhance his security. The Compensation Committee set a personal travel allowance of $150,000 for Mr. King's use in 2018, however, he will not receive tax reimbursement for any imputed  income associated with personal travel. Mr. King's calculated cost for personal use of the corporate aircraft in 2018 was $117,350, which is calculated using a fixed hourly rate for the aircraft and a fuel variable charge per hour charged  to the Company. In addition, the Company paid $19,663 in 2018 for security improvements to Mr. King's personal residence, $43,300 for security improvements to Mr. Eisenberg's personal residence, $154,586 in 2018 for security  improvements to Mr. Ratliff's personal residence and $56,607 for security improvements to Mr. Huff's personal residence.

(1)  Amounts represent the range of possible payouts denominated in dollars pursuant to the MIB Plan, as established by the  Compensation Committee in February 2018. Actual amounts paid out pursuant to the plan are included in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table above. For a discussion  of the performance criteria applicable to these awards, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Annual Cash Incentive Pay" above.  
(2)  Amounts represent the range of estimated potential shares to be earned under performance share awards. The performance  share awards vest at the end of three years provided that certain performance metrics are met. For a discussion of the performance criteria applicable to these awards, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Long-Term Incentive  Awards" above.  
(3)  Amounts represent stock option awards that vest ratably over three years, beginning on the first anniversary of the  grant date, based on continued service.  
(4)  Amounts represent restricted stock unit awards that vest ratably over three years, beginning on the first anniversary  of the grant date, based on continued service with the exception of Mr. Ratliff's April 3, 2018 restricted stock unit grant that vests 20% on April 3, 2019, 30% on April 3, 2020, and 50% on April 3, 2021.   
(5)  Amounts represent the full grant date fair value of restricted stock unit, stock options and performance share awards  as computed in accordance with accounting standards for stock-based compensation, but excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures. The amounts shown in this column will likely vary from the amount actually realized by any NEO based on a number of  factors, including the number of shares that ultimately vest, the satisfaction or failure to meet any performance criteria, the timing of any exercise or sale of shares, and the price of the Company's Common Stock. The value for stock options  is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The value of the performance share awards as of the grant date if they are achieved at the maximum payout is as follows: Mr. King – $10,011,208; Mr. Eberts – $667,957;  Mr. Eisenberg – $2,225,678; Mr. Huff – $1,668,444; and Mr. Ratliff $4,169,663.  
(6)  Mr. Ratliff received a special restricted stock unit award with an approximate value of $2,000,000 on April 3,  2018 as a retention grant (in connection with his position as Executive Vice President of the Company and Chief Executive Officer of Covance Drug Development) in addition to his respective annual restricted stock unit awards under our long-term  incentive award program. The award vests 20% on April 3, 2019, 30% on April 3, 2020, and 50% on April 3, 2021.

life annuity. If married, the participant has two payment options: (i) ten-year certain and life annuity; or (ii) 50 percent joint and survivor annuity. The ten-year certain and life annuity offers a guaranteed minimum payment for ten years. The 50 percent joint and survivor annuity offers half the annuity payments to the surviving spouse. 
The formula for calculating the amount payable to the participants in the Cash Balance Plan, in conjunction with the PEP, is illustrated as follows (ten-year certain and life annuity payment option): 
[(0.52) x (Final Average Pay) – (0.50) x (Estimated Social Security Benefit)] x (Credited Service up to 25 years) ÷ (25) 
The amount payable could be less if a married participant elected to receive benefits under the 50 percent joint and survivor annuity option. The reduction for the 50 percent joint and survivor annuity is determined using the actuarial basis defined by the pension plans and reflects the possibility that the spouse may outlive the participant, which extends the length of payments. 
The following table shows, as of December 31, 2018, the present value of accumulated benefits under the Company's Cash Balance Plan and PEP for each of the NEOs who were eligible to participate in the plans:

Deferred Compensation Plan 
The DCP offers eligible participants another vehicle to accumulate savings for retirement. See "Compensation Discussion & Analysis – Deferred Compensation Program" above. Amounts deferred by a participant are credited to a bookkeeping account maintained on behalf of each participant, which is used for the measurement and determination of amounts to be paid to a participant, or his or her designated beneficiary, pursuant to the terms of the DCP. Deferred amounts are the Company's general unsecured obligations and are subject to claims by the Company's creditors. The Company's general assets or existing Rabbi Trust may be used to fund payment obligations and pay DCP benefits. 
According to the terms of the DCP, a participant has the opportunity to allocate deferred amounts to one or more of 23 measurement funds offered. The measurement funds are indexed to externally managed funds inside the Company's insurance-backed account. Amounts in these accounts can earn variable returns, including negative returns. Deemed earnings on the deferrals are based on these measurement funds and have no guaranteed rate of return. The Company makes no contributions to the DCP. 
Under the DCP, a participant may make separate distribution elections with respect to each year's deferrals. These distribution elections include the ability to elect a single lump-sum payment or annual installment payments.

Equity Awards: Stock Incentive Plan and Transition Policy 
The treatment of equity awards varies depending on the type of termination. 
The forms of award agreements for the stock options and restricted stock units shown in the table above provide that in the event that an executive's employment terminates by reason of death, disability, normal retirement, or a change in control with a corresponding qualifying termination within 24 months of a change in control, then all stock options and restricted stock unit awards accelerate in full. In the case of an executive's qualifying termination outside of the 24-month window following a change in control or the executive's termination due to early retirement, the executive 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
generally is entitled to accelerated vesting of a partial number of the unvested stock options and restricted stock unit awards. The executive (or his/her heir or executor/executrix, as the case may be) may exercise vested stock options at any time within one year after the date of death, disability, normal retirement, early retirement or a specified termination within 24 months of a change in control. (For other terminations, the executive may exercise vested options within 90 days of his/her termination.) For these types of terminations, the value in the tables was determined by multiplying the gain using the December 31, 2018 closing stock price by the number of unvested shares. 
The forms of award agreements for the performance share awards shown in the table above provide that in the event that an executive's employment terminates by reason of death or disability or a change in control with a corresponding qualifying termination within 24 months of a change of control, then all performance share awards will accelerate in full assuming performance at target. In the event the executive's employment terminates by reason of normal retirement, all performance share awards granted will be eligible to vest subject to their original performance conditions with the exception of the service requirement. In the case of an executive's qualifying termination outside of the 24-month window following a change in control or the executive's termination due to early retirement, voluntary termination for Good Reason, or involuntary termination without Cause, the executive generally is entitled to continue to vest in a prorated number of the unvested performance share awards subject to the satisfaction of their original performance conditions with the exception of the service requirement. 
For purposes of the equity awards, "normal retirement" means retirement at or after the age of 65 with five years of service, and "early retirement" means retirement at or after the age of 55 when the sum of age and years of service is at least 70. None of the NEOs is currently eligible to receive benefits under the "normal retirement" provisions of the equity awards. 
Under the Transition Policy, and provided that the executive's termination of employment otherwise meets the requirements of the Transition Policy, stock options, restricted stock units, and performance shares continue to vest through the vesting period as if the executive were still employed unless there is an alternative treatment specified under the form of award agreement. Valuation in the event of a voluntary termination or early retirement is based on a Black-Scholes valuation for unvested shares and the December 31, 2018 market price of the underlying common stock for restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance share awards. For purposes of the table above, it is assumed that the measures for the performance share awards will be achieved at the target level. Currently, the only individual eligible for participation in the Transition Policy is Mr. King. 
Base Compensation and Annual Incentive Cash Payments 
No additional base compensation amounts are payable for terminations resulting from the following events: voluntary termination by the officer, normal retirement, termination for cause, or termination due to disability or death. A prorated annual incentive cash payment may be made for each of the termination events mentioned in the tables above, except for a voluntary termination or a termination for cause. Provisions for base compensation and annual incentive cash payments in the event of an involuntary not for cause or good reason termination or a termination in connection with a change in control are detailed below. 
Amended and Restated Master Senior Executive Severance Plan and Master Senior Executive Change-in-Control Severance Plan 
The Amended and Restated Severance Plan and the Change-in-Control Severance Plan provide the Company's NEOs (as well as the Company's other executive vice presidents and senior vice presidents) with severance payments upon, respectively, a "qualifying termination" and a "qualifying termination" that occurs within three years following a change in control. A "qualifying termination" is generally defined as an involuntary termination without cause or voluntary termination with "good reason." "Cause" means that the NEO shall have committed prior to termination of employment any of the following acts: an intentional act of fraud, embezzlement, theft, or any other material violation of law in connection with his or her duties or in the course of his or her employment with the Company; the conviction of or entering of a plea of nolo contendere to a felony; alcohol intoxication on the job or current illegal drug use; intentional wrongful damage to tangible assets of the Company; intentional wrongful disclosure of material confidential information of the Company and/or materially breaching the noncompetition or confidentiality provisions covering his activities; knowing and intentional breach of any employment policy of the Company; or gross neglect or misconduct, disloyalty, dishonesty, or breach of trust in the performance of his duties that is not corrected to the Board's satisfaction within 30 days of notice thereof. "Good reason" means a reduction in base salary or targeted 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
incentive cash payment as a percentage of salary, relocation to an office location more than 75 miles from the employee's current office without consent of the employee, a material reduction in job responsibilities or transfer to another job without the consent of the employee. 
For purposes of the Change-in-Control Plan, "change in control" means: (i) any person who is not presently but becomes the "beneficial owner," directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 40 percent or more of the Company's outstanding securities except for any securities purchased by any tax-qualified employee benefit plan of the Company; or (ii) individuals who constituted the Board on February 10, 2009 (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, provided that any person subsequently becoming a director whose election was approved by a vote of at least three-quarters of the directors comprising the Incumbent Board (including any such directors whose election was so approved), or whose nomination for election by the Company's shareholders was approved by the Incumbent Board (including such directors whose election was so approved), is for purposes of this clause (ii), considered as though he or she were a member of the Incumbent Board; or (iii) a plan of reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Company or similar transaction occurs in which the Company is not the resulting entity. 
The severance payments under the Change-in-Control Plan are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     QUALIFYING TERMINATION(a)     CHANGE IN CONTROL + QUALIFYING TERMINATION WITHIN THREE YEARS 
     QUALIFYING TERMINATION(a)     CHANGE IN CONTROL + QUALIFYING TERMINATION WITHIN THREE YEARS

 Executive Vice Presidents    2x (annual salary + average MIB payments)    2x (annual salary + average MIB payments) 
 Senior Vice  Presidents    1x (annual salary + average MIB payments)    1x (annual salary + average MIB payments) 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a)  "Average MIB payments" is the average of the executive's actual MIB payments over the prior three years.   
[END TABLE]
The Change-in-Control Plan does not provide a reimbursement to participants for excise taxes on "excess parachute payments" imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Health and Welfare Benefits 
In the event of a qualifying termination under the Amended and Restated Severance Plan or the Change-in-Control Plan, the executive is also eligible for up to twelve months of Company-paid COBRA. 
In the event a NEO dies while an active employee, his or her beneficiary will receive two times his or her base annual earnings up to a maximum of $1.5 million from the Company's group term life plan. In addition, eligible, enrolled dependents will receive Company-paid COBRA continuation of coverage for the first six months following the executive's death (not included in the tables above). If the executive was traveling on Company business at the time of death, the beneficiary will also receive $1 million of business travel accident insurance; this is not reflected in the tables above. 
If an executive becomes disabled (i.e., he or she is not able to perform the material duties of his or her occupation solely because of disease or injury), the executive is generally eligible for a monthly benefit payable until the earlier of (a) age 65 if the period of disability starts at the age of 60 or under; or (b) if the period of disability starts at age 61 or older, the length of the maximum benefit period for disability as defined by the Disability Plan. For Mr. King, the monthly net benefit is a maximum of $30,000, and for the other NEOs the monthly net benefit is a maximum of $25,000. 
Cash Balance Plan 
Under the Cash Balance Plan, upon a termination of employment the NEOs are entitled to receive the same amounts set forth for each officer in the Present Value of Accumulated Benefit column in the Pension Benefits Table above, regardless of reason, except for death, which pays at 50 percent of such value. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Pension Equalization Plan 
PEP payments are subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and require a six-month waiting period following separation of service before distribution of the first payment. Under the PEP, upon a termination the NEOs are entitled to receive the same amounts set forth for each officer in the Present Value of Accumulated Benefit column in the Pension Benefits Table above, regardless of reason, except for death, which pays at 50 percent of such value. 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
The DCP was amended to grandfather participants prior to December 31, 2004 to remove the six-month waiting period for distributions following separation of service. Distribution elections made after December 31, 2004 require a six-month waiting period following separation of service before distribution of the first payment, as required by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Otherwise, distribution elections include the ability to elect a single lump-sum payment or annual installment payments. Under the DCP, upon termination the NEOs are entitled to receive the same amounts set forth for each officer in the Aggregate Balance column of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table above, regardless of reason for the termination. 
Perquisites 
All perquisites offered to the NEOs immediately terminate upon the executive's termination for executives participating in the Amended and Restated Master Senior Executive Severance Plan or the Master Senior Executive Change-in-Control Severance Plan. 
Gary M. Huff and F. Samuel Eberts III Separation 
On December 21, 2018, the Company and Gary M. Huff, Chief Executive Officer, LabCorp Diagnostics, agreed that Mr. Huff's employment with the Company would terminate effective December 31, 2018. Pursuant to a separation agreement entered into by Mr. Huff and the Company on December 31, 2018, in consideration for certain noncompetition, non-solicitation, duty of loyalty, confidentiality, and release provisions, Mr. Huff is entitled to the following benefits: (i) a severance payment of $2,063,267.00 payable in two installments, less applicable taxes and withholdings, which equals two times (A) $600,000, which is the amount of Mr. Huff's base salary plus (B) $431,633.50, which represents Mr. Huff's MIB Average Bonus as calculated under the Amended and Restated Severance Plan; (ii) $489,330, which is the amount equal to the earned portion of the MIB that Mr. Huff would have received under the Company's MIB Plan had he remained eligible for said bonus; and (iii) continued health care coverage for Mr. Huff and his dependents for a period of 12 months after the separation date. Additionally, Mr. Huff received a lump sum payment equal to the value of 5,164 shares of restricted stock units that he forfeited under the terms of the Company's 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan and his restricted stock unit agreements. Under the applicable terms of the equity awards held by Mr. Huff, he received an additional 12 months of vesting of his restricted stock units and non-qualified stock options and his performance share awards were pro-rated as of the termination date, with the delivery of shares under the performance shares awards subject to achievement of the performance metrics specified in the awards. Mr. Huff is entitled to a PEP benefit. See "Compensation Discussion & Analysis – Retirement Plans" and "Executive Compensation – Retirement Benefits" above. 
On February 15, 2019, Mr. Eberts, Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, retired. Pursuant to a retirement agreement entered into by Mr. Eberts and the Company, Mr. Eberts' received the following benefits: (i) a payment of $900,000 payable in two installments, less applicable taxes and withholdings; (ii) all of his outstanding equity awards vested in full with outstanding performance awards subject to actual performance outcomes at the end of the pre-established performance period, (iii) the earned portion of his 2018 Management Incentive Bonus, or $331,139, and (iv) reimbursement for continued health care coverage for a period of 12 months following the date of his retirement, for himself and his dependents.

CEO PAY RATIO 
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Company is presenting the ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to our median employee's annual total compensation. 
For purposes of identifying our median employee, we used year-to-date taxable income to calculate a reasonable estimate of the annual total compensation for each employee based on our internal records. The employees we used for the foregoing calculations included all our full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees as of November 1, 2018, other than our CEO. This consisted of over 60,000 employees located in 53 countries. As permitted by SEC rules, we excluded from our employee population (x) our contractors and leased employees, (y) the approximately 1,208 employees we gained in connection with our acquisition of Sciformix Corporation in June 2018 and (z) approximately 304 of our employees in Japan. 
As set forth in the Summary Compensation Table appearing on page 47 in this proxy statement, the 2018 annual total compensation for our CEO was $12,264,236. The 2018 annual total compensation for our median employee was $43,230. The ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to our median employee's total compensation for fiscal year 2018 is 284 to 1. This ratio was determined using reasonable estimates as permitted by the SEC's rules and should not be used as a comparison with pay ratios disclosed by other companies. 
PROPOSAL TWO – Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation 
As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Section 14a of the Securities Exchange Act), the Company is seeking shareholder approval, through a non-binding vote, on the Company's executive compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. Pursuant to the vote of the shareholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Company's executive compensation (a "Say-on-Pay" vote) on an annual basis. 
The Compensation Committee works throughout the year reviewing compensation trends, evaluating emerging best practices, engaging with shareholders, and considering changes to executive compensation that will provide our senior management with an incentive to achieve superior financial results for the Company and align pay with performance. 
Compensation Program Overview and Evolution 
LabCorp's executive compensation program, as discussed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section on page 28 is designed to attract, motivate and retain executives in a highly competitive environment. Our executive compensation philosophy is to pay for performance by rewarding the achievement of specific short-term and long-term 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
operational and strategic goals. We believe our executive compensation program avoids unnecessary risk taking and aligns the interests of our shareholders with the performance of our executives. This program reflects our strong commitment to a results-driven compensation program. 
Last year, our annual advisory vote on executive compensation received support from approximately 95 percent of the shares represented at the 2018 Annual Meeting and entitled to vote. We consider this level of approval to indicate the support of the vast majority of our shareholders. We remain committed to a compensation program that incentivizes our leaders and aligns with our strategy, the key value drivers of our business and the expectations of our shareholders. We have a practice of regularly seeking input from our shareholders, and this input is incorporated in the Compensation Committee's annual review of our compensation program. Specific comments we have received from investors has been reflected in the evolution of the executive compensation program and compensation best practices. Since 2011, we have made several key structural changes to emphasize long-term performance and create stronger alignment with our strategic priorities, including the adoption of our Clawback Policy. 
Pay for Performance 
As described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section beginning on page 28 of this Proxy Statement, our executive compensation program is designed to reward the achievement of specific short-term and long-term operational and strategic goals. By paying for performance, we believe our compensation program aligns the interests of our executive officers with those of our shareholders. The Company believes that through an effective executive compensation program, it can be successful in attracting and retaining talented employees who will sustain the Company's financial performance and continue creation of shareholder value. 
In support of the Compensation Committee's overarching pay for performance compensation philosophy, our executives' compensation structure is:

Advisory Resolution 
The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's NEOs, as disclosed pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion in the Company's 2019 Proxy Statement, is hereby APPROVED." 
The vote is advisory and is not binding on the Board. However, the Compensation Committee of the Board expects to take into account the outcome of the vote as it continues to consider the Company's executive compensation program. 
The Board unanimously recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the approval of executive compensation. 
RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
PROPOSAL THREE – Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
The Audit Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers") to audit the accounts of the Company for the year ending December 31, 2019, and the shareholders of the Company are being asked to ratify its appointment. 
In determining whether to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee reviewed the performance and fees of PricewaterhouseCoopers, as well as the firm's independence and objectivity, PricewaterhouseCoopers' capability and expertise in handling the breadth and complexity of the Company's operations, including the expertise and capability of the Lead Audit Partner, and historical and recent performance, including the extent and quality of PricewaterhouseCoopers' communications with the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also considered the fact that the firm has been engaged as the Company's auditor since 1997, the benefits of that tenure, and the controls and processes in place that help ensure PricewaterhouseCoopers' continued independence in light of such tenure, including the rotation in 2018 of the lead audit partner. From the results of this review, the Audit Committee has determined that retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers is in the best interest of LabCorp and its shareholders. 
Shareholder ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is not required by our By-Laws, but the Board has elected to seek such ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. Should the shareholders fail to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, the Audit Committee will consider whether to retain that firm for such year. Even if this appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the interests of the Company. 
Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers will be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company's accounts were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers. To the knowledge of management and the Audit Committee, in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no disagreements with PricewaterhouseCoopers on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope and procedure that, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PricewaterhouseCoopers, would have caused them to make reference to the matter in their reports. PricewaterhouseCoopers' report on the financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2018 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. 
Fees to Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee must approve, in advance, all of PricewaterhouseCoopers' services, whether or not related to an audit. Aggregate fees for professional services rendered for the Company by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are described in the table below. All the services for which fees were paid were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has considered the non-audit-related services rendered and believes that they are compatible with PricewaterhouseCoopers remaining independent. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees(1)      $5,299,000        $3,484,100   
 Audit Related  Fees(2)      $244,530        $377,750

 TOTAL      $6,872,055        $5,954,838   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Audit Fees include fees incurred for the audit of the Company's annual statements, review of financial statements  included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.

(3)  Tax Fees for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were related to general tax consulting,  tax compliance, including expatriate tax services and preparation of tax returns, tax planning insights, and tax advice. The 2018 and 2017 fees related to tax planning in conjunction with the acquisition of Chiltern.  
(4)  All Other Fees are fees incurred for any services not included in the other categories of fees. All Other Fees  consisted of accounting research software and other services.  
[END TABLE]
The Board unanimously recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee of the Board was established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Audit Committee, comprised entirely of non-employee directors, held eight meetings with its independent registered public accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers") and seven executive sessions with PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Internal Audit Department and the independent directors during 2018. The Board considered the "independence" and "financial literacy" of each of the Audit Committee members, as such terms are defined under the Listing Standards and SEC rules and has concluded that each member of its Audit Committee is independent and financially literate in satisfaction of the current requirements of the Listing Standards and the SEC. The Board further concluded that Kerrii B. Anderson and Peter M. Neupert are each an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules and that Ms. Anderson and Mr. Neupert have the "accounting or related financial management expertise" required by the Listing Standards. 
The Audit Committee reviewed the performance and fees of PricewaterhouseCoopers prior to recommending its appointment and met with representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers to discuss the scope and results of the firm's audit work, including the adequacy of internal controls and the quality of financial reporting. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Company's audited financial statements and has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers all matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1301, as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Audit Committee has discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers its independence and has received its written disclosures and certification confirming its independence, as required by applicable requirements of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding its communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. 
Management is responsible for the Company's financial reporting process, including its system of internal controls, and for the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's internal auditors are responsible to the Audit Committee for testing the integrity of the financial accounting and reporting control systems and such other matters as the Audit Committee and the Board determine. PricewaterhouseCoopers is responsible for auditing the Company's financial statements. The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial and accounting functions, controls, reporting processes and audits on behalf of the Board in accordance with the Audit Committee's written charter. The Audit Committee is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight of the integrity and quality of the Company's consolidated financial statements, but it is not responsible for conducting auditing or accounting reviews or procedures. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed with management and the Company's internal auditors the Company's audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and discussed with management and the Company's internal auditors the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles and policies as applied in the Company's financial reporting, the reasonableness of significant judgments and accounting estimates, and the clarity and completeness of disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee, PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Company's internal auditors have full access to one another, including regular meetings without management present. Based on the reviews and discussions referenced above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. 
As part of its duties, the Audit Committee also considers whether the provision of services other than audit services by PricewaterhouseCoopers is compatible with maintaining the accountants' independence. The Audit Committee considered the compatibility of the non-audit-related services performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers and determined that the registered public accounting firm's independence has been maintained.

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's executive officers, directors and persons who own more than ten percent of the Company's equity securities to file reports on ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the securities exchanges on which its equity securities are registered. Additionally, SEC regulations require that the Company identify in its proxy statements any persons for whom one of the referenced reports was not filed on a timely basis during the most recent fiscal year or prior fiscal years. To the Company's knowledge, based solely on a review of reports furnished to it by reporting persons, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its executive officers, directors, and more than ten percent beneficial owners were timely satisfied.
