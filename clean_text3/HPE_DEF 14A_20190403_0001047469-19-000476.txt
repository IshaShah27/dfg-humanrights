[END TABLE]
Fellow Stockholders,
This time last year, I shared with you a message of transformation, marking the end of an era and beginning the next chapter for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Many of you have been with the HPE family every step of the way and some of you have joined us more recently because you are excited about the possibilities before us. As Antonio mentioned, we have indeed made important progress with our transformation over the last year. We have a clear strategy, a more agile structure, a streamlined portfolio, and a strong leadership team. This year, from our enhanced position of strength, we are furthering our investments in our people, our business, and our world. 
Over the past year, we have significantly increased the investment in our people and in the culture we are building at our company. From humble beginnings in a Palo Alto garage to the global industry leader we are today, we have always recognized that people are the heart of HPE. As you read in Antonio's message, in 2018, he declared that the HPE culture was one of his top three priorities for the company. Additionally, the Board of Directors is very committed to HPE's talent and culture agenda, and we are very pleased with the increased engagement across the teams. 
Additionally, Antonio, his leadership team, and our Board have made important investments in our business. Our company has always been an engine of innovation. That spirit is alive and well today, fueled by recent acquisitions like BlueData and Cape Networks; collaborations with innovative startups like Jungla and leading institutions like COSMOS Research Group; and a $4 billion commitment to the Intelligent Edge business. Our customers are advancing leading-edge research, realizing greater efficiencies, and improving outcomes for their customers because of HPE's best-in-class innovations. That's both inspiring and a big part of why the company will continue to drive both customer and stockholder value. 
Finally, one of the most critical ways we invest in our collective future is by strengthening the communities where we live and work. We are proud to have both a legacy and a modern-day commitment to community engagement and support. Last year, we donated to more than 4,300 charities in 41 countries, delivered eHealth solutions to more than 500,000 patients in 18 Indian states, provided more than $14.5 million in loans to entrepreneurs in 85 countries, and launched a global day of service across every geography. We reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 25% and introduced important sustainability goals and smart city partnerships that earned global awards and recognition. 
As we reflect on where the company has been and where we are going, we are excited to invite you to attend the fourth annual meeting of stockholders of HPE on Wednesday, April 3, 2019 at 11:00 a.m., Pacific Time. This year's meeting will again be completely virtual, conducted via live webcast. We are pleased to provide access to our proxy materials over the Internet under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's "notice and access" rules. As a result, we are mailing to many of our stockholders a notice of Internet availability rather than a paper copy of this proxy statement and our 2018 Annual Report. The notice contains instructions on how to access those documents over the Internet as well as how to receive a paper copy of our proxy materials. All stockholders who do not receive a notice will receive a paper copy by mail unless they have previously requested delivery of proxy materials electronically. Continuing to employ this distribution process will conserve natural resources and reduce the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials. Your vote is important to us and we do hope you will vote as soon as possible. 
It has been a pleasure for us, your Board of Directors, to provide independent and expert oversight over the transformative strategies being advanced to create value for our customers. Our investments in building a strong culture and business were all made possible by the investment you, our stockholders, made in us. So, on behalf of our people and our business, I thank you for your continued support of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Corporate governance  
       Corporate governance     
Our Board of Directors (the "Board") is committed to excellence in corporate governance. We know that our long-standing tradition of principled, ethical governance benefits you, our stockholders, as well as our customers, employees and communities, and we have developed and continue to maintain a governance profile that aligns with industry-leading standards. We believe that the high standards set by our governance structure have had and will continue to have a direct impact on the strength of our business. The following table presents a brief summary of highlights of our governance profile, followed by more in-depth descriptions of some of the key aspects of our governance structure. 
      Stockholder outreach and engagement       
We maintain a dynamic, robust, and multi-faceted stockholder outreach program designed to provide continuous and meaningful engagement and participation throughout the entire year. Rather than focusing on short-term results, we maintain the goal of fostering strong stockholder relationships leading to mutual understanding of issues and approaches, ultimately giving the company insight into stockholder support as it designs and implements strategies for long-term growth. 
The key elements of our stockholder outreach program are (i) the Securities Analyst Meeting, (ii) the Board Outreach Program, and (iii) the Annual Stockholders Meeting. Our comprehensive stockholder engagement program is supplemented by our year-round investor relations outreach program that includes post-earnings communications, roadshows, bus tours, one-on-one conferences, group meetings, technology webcasts, and general availability to respond to investor inquiries. The multi-faceted nature of this program allows us to maintain meaningful engagement with a broad audience including large institutional investors, smaller to mid-size institutions, pension funds, advisory firms, and individual investors.

[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Corporate governance 
We recognize that stockholders are the owners of the company and remain committed to stockholder outreach programs that are truly a dialogue. We use every element of the outreach program to provide stockholders with honest, candid information on relevant issues, sharing the rationale for our corporate strategy and the impact of the Board's oversight in key areas of the company, gathering stockholder views and feedback on each area, as well as on the outreach program itself. 
      Securities analyst meeting       
We launch our stockholder outreach program in the fall with our annual Securities Analyst Meeting ("SAM"). At SAM, our leadership team provides an update on strategy and the financial outlook, including detailed information for each business unit, for the upcoming fiscal year. Although the event itself is geared toward the analyst community, a primary purpose of SAM is to give stockholders direct insight into our business, strategy, and outlook, providing those who plan to participate in the off-season engagement an informed basis on which to formulate their views and questions. Accordingly, the entire event is publicly broadcast live, with the recorded videos and transcripts also available on our investor relations website following the event. 
      Board outreach program       
On the heels of SAM comes a cornerstone of our stockholder outreachâ€”our innovative board outreach program. The program consists of focused, one-on-one meetings between stockholders and our directors over a three-month period that are designed to give institutional stockholders an opportunity to better understand the companies in which they invest. These meetings enable our stockholders to better fulfil their fiduciary duties toward their investors and voice any concerns they have about HPE to our directors. This season, we extended our extensive board outreach efforts to holders of nearly 57% of our stock, with holders of more than 45% of our stock electing to participate. 
We maintain clear structural goals for these meetings:

      Virtual stockholder meeting       
Our year-long stockholder outreach program culminates in our annual stockholder meeting, which is conducted virtually through a live webcast and online stockholder tools. We have implemented the virtual annual meeting format in order to facilitate stockholder attendance and participation by enabling stockholders to participate fully, and equally, from any location around the world, at no cost. We believe this is the right choice for a company with a global footprint; not only bringing cost savings to the company and stockholders, but also increasing the ability to engage with all stockholders, regardless of size, resources, or physical location. We remain very sensitive to concerns regarding virtual meetings generally from investor advisory groups and other stockholder rights advocates, who have voiced concerns that virtual meetings may diminish stockholder voice or reduce accountability. Accordingly, we have designed our virtual format to enhance, rather than constrain, stockholder access, participation and communication. For example, the online format allows stockholders to communicate with us in advance of, and during, the meeting so they can ask any questions of our Board or management. We do not place restrictions on the type or form of questions that may be asked; however, we reserve the right to edit profanity or other inappropriate language for publication. During the live Q&A session of the meeting, we answer questions as they come in and address those asked in advance, as time permits. We have committed to publishing and answering each question received, following the meeting. Although the live webcast is available only to stockholders at the time of the meeting, a replay of the meeting is made publicly available on the company's investor relations site. In addition to strong participation from individual stockholders, we have continued to receive positive support from institutional stockholders who have indicated that the virtual format is beneficial and appropriate in the context of our broader direct outreach program. 
We have carefully designed our outreach program to provide continuous and meaningful stockholder engagement and participation. Our committed Board of Directors and management team value these interactions and invest significant time and resources to ensure that they have an open line of communication with stockholders. Stockholders and other stakeholders may directly communicate with our Board by contacting: Secretary to the Board of Directors, 6280 America Center Drive, San Jose, California 95002; e-mail: bod-hpe@hpe.com. 
For more information about the virtual stockholder meeting, see "Questions and answersâ€”Annual meeting information" on page 95. 
   Environmental and social governance through living progress       
Living Progress is our plan to apply the innovation engine of HPE to create sustainable IT solutions. This commitment to environmental and social governance ("ESG") is integrated into our business strategy, increasing the competitiveness and resilience of our business. 
Our customers consider HPE's sustainable and efficient IT solutions to be a strategic differentiator, helping to meet both their financial and sustainability goals. Through innovative product designs and solutions, HPE enables our customers to maximize the efficiency of IT infrastructure, achieving more work for less cost and lower environmental impact. 
Building the operational and reputational resilience of our value chain is also key to meeting and exceeding the expectations of our stakeholders. HPE's proactive approach to managing ESG factors mitigates risks to our company, such as fluctuating commodity prices or tightening regulations, while creating new financial opportunities. 
HPE Living Progress is overseen by the NGSR Committee which reviews, assesses, reports and provides guidance to management and the Board regarding HPE's policies and programs relating to ESG. Living Progress engages at least annually with the Board and Executive Committee as a matter of best practice to drive ESG strategies for continued business success. Our leadership has earned HPE recognition on global rankings including the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, EcoVadis Gold, and  CDP Climate A List. This

      Director candidate selection and evaluation       
   Stockholder recommendations  
The policy of the NGSR Committee is to consider properly submitted stockholder recommendations of candidates for membership on the Board as described below under "Identifying and evaluating candidates for directors." In evaluating such recommendations, the NGSR Committee seeks to achieve a balance of knowledge, experience and capability on the Board and to address the membership criteria set forth on page 28 under "Proposals to be voted onâ€”Proposal No.1 Election of Directorsâ€”Director nominee experience and qualifications." Any stockholder recommendations submitted for consideration by the NGSR Committee should include verification of the stockholder status of the person submitting the recommendation and the recommended candidate's name and qualifications for Board membership and should be addressed to: 
Corporate Secretary  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company  6280 America Center Drive  San Jose, California 95002  Email: bod-hpe@hpe.com
   Stockholder nominations  
In addition, our Bylaws permit stockholders to nominate directors for consideration at an annual stockholder meeting and, under certain circumstances, to include their nominees in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise proxy statement. For a description of the process for nominating directors in accordance with our Bylaws, see "Questions and answersâ€”Stockholder proposals, director nominations and related Bylaws provisionsâ€”How may I recommend individuals to serve as directors and what is the deadline for a director recommendation?" on page 97. 
Identifying and evaluating candidates for directors  
The NGSR Committee, in consultation with the Chair, assesses the appropriate size of the Board, as well as the alignment of director skills with company strategy, and whether any vacancies on the Board are expected due to retirement or otherwise, or whether the Board would benefit from the addition of a director with a specific skillset. The NGSR Committee also considers board refreshment in its annual evaluation of the Board.

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Corporate governance 
We balance our respect for historical knowledge of our company with our regard for fresh perspectives by considering director tenure on a case-by-case basis, rather than imposing arbitrary term limits. 
The NGSR Committee uses a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for director. Candidates may come to the attention of the NGSR Committee through current Board members, professional search firms, stockholders or other persons. Identified candidates are evaluated at regular or special meetings of the NGSR Committee and may be considered at any point during the year. As described above, the NGSR Committee considers properly submitted stockholder recommendations of candidates for the Board to be included in our proxy statement. Following verification of the stockholder status of individuals proposing candidates, recommendations are considered collectively by the NGSR Committee at a regularly scheduled meeting. If any materials are provided by a stockholder in connection with the nomination of a director candidate, such materials are forwarded to the NGSR Committee. The NGSR Committee also reviews materials provided by professional search firms and other parties in connection with a nominee who is not proposed by a stockholder. In evaluating such nominations, the NGSR Committee seeks to achieve a balance of knowledge, experience and capability on the Board that will enable the Board to effectively oversee the business. The NGSR Committee evaluates nominees recommended by stockholders using the same criteria as it uses to evaluate all other candidates. 
We engage a professional search firm on an ongoing basis to identify and assist the NGSR Committee in identifying, evaluating and conducting due diligence on potential director nominees. In each instance, the NGSR Committee considers the totality of the circumstances of each individual candidate. 
      Board and committee meetings and attendance       
Our Board has regularly scheduled meetings and an annual meeting of stockholders each year, in addition to special meetings scheduled as appropriate. During fiscal 2018, our Board held nine meetings. In addition, our five committees held a total of 36 meetings, with the Audit Committee meeting 11 times, the HRC Committee meeting seven times, and the NGSR Committee meeting five times. Each of the five regularly scheduled Board meetings held during fiscal 2018 included an executive session, consisting of only non-management directors. The Board expects that its members will rigorously prepare for, attend and participate in all Board and applicable Committee meetings and each annual meeting of stockholders. In addition to participation at Board and committee meetings, our directors discharged their responsibilities throughout the year through frequent one-on-one meetings and other communications with our Chair, our CEO and other members of senior management regarding matters of interest. 
Each of our incumbent directors who was a director during fiscal 2018 attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board of Directors on which each such director served, during the period for which each such director served. 
Directors are also encouraged to attend our annual meeting of stockholders. Last year, each of our directors was in attendance. 
      Board leadership structure       
The Board is currently led by an independent director, Patricia F. Russo, Chair of the Board. Our Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines permit the roles of Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer to be filled by the same or different individuals, although the Corporate Governance Guidelines express a preference for the separation of the two roles. This flexibility allows the Board to determine whether the two roles should be combined or separated based upon our needs and the Board's assessment of its leadership from time to time. The Board believes that our stockholders are best served at this time by having an independent director serve as Chair of the Board. Our Board believes this leadership structure effectively allocates authority, responsibility, and oversight between management and the independent members of our Board. It gives primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company to our CEO, while the Chair facilitates our Board's independent oversight of management, promotes communication between senior management and our

As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board has 13 directors and the following five standing committees: (1) Audit Committee; (2) Finance and Investment Committee; (3) HR and Compensation Committee; (4) Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee; and (5) Technology Committee. The current committee membership and the function of each of these standing committees are described below. Each of the standing committees operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. All of the committee charters are available on our Governance website at investors.hpe.com/governance#committee-charters. Each committee reviews and reassesses the adequacy of their charter annually, conducts annual evaluations of their performance with respect to their duties and responsibilities as laid out in the charter, and reports regularly to the Board with respect to the committees' activities. Additionally, the Board and each of the committees has the authority to retain, terminate and receive appropriate funding for outside advisors as the Board and/or each committee deems necessary.

      Board risk oversight       
Given today's ever-changing economic, social, and political landscape, structured, conscientious risk management is more important than ever for every public company. Our Board, with the assistance of its committees as discussed below, reviews and oversees our Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") program, which is an enterprise-wide program designed to enable effective and efficient identification of, and management visibility into, critical enterprise risks and to facilitate the incorporation of risk considerations into decision making. The ERM program was established to clearly define risk management roles and responsibilities, bring together senior management to discuss risk, promote visibility and constructive dialogue around risk at the senior management and Board levels and facilitate appropriate risk response strategies. 
Under the ERM program, management develops a holistic portfolio of our enterprise risks by facilitating business and function risk assessments, performing targeted risk assessments and incorporating information regarding specific categories of risk gathered from various internal Hewlett Packard Enterprise organizations. Management then develops risk response plans for risks categorized as needing management focus and response and monitors other identified risk focus areas. Management provides reports on the risk portfolio and risk response efforts to senior management and to the Audit Committee.

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Corporate governance  
The Board oversees management's implementation of the ERM program, including reviewing our enterprise risk portfolio and evaluating management's approach to addressing identified risks. Various Board committees also have responsibilities for oversight of risk management that supplement the ERM program. For example, the HRC Committee considers the risks associated with our compensation policies and practices as discussed below, the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing financial risks and those related to information and cyber security, and the NGSR Committee oversees risks associated with our governance structure and processes. This structure allows specialized attention to and oversight over key risk areas by aligning our carefully crafted committees with risk oversight in their individual areas of expertise. The Board is kept informed of its committees' risk oversight and related activities primarily through reports of the committee chairs to the full Board. In addition, the Audit Committee escalates issues relating to risk oversight to the full Board as appropriate to keep the Board appropriately informed of developments that could affect our risk profile or other aspects of our business. The Board also considers specific risk topics in connection with strategic planning and other matters. 
      Compensation risk assessment       
During fiscal 2018, we undertook an annual review of our material compensation processes, policies and programs for all employees and determined that our compensation programs and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In conducting this assessment, we reviewed our compensation risk infrastructure, including our material plans, our risk control systems and governance structure, the design and oversight of our compensation programs and the developments, improvements and other changes made to those programs, and we presented a summary of the findings to the HRC Committee. Overall, we believe that our programs contain an appropriate balance of fixed and variable features and short- and long-term incentives, as well as complementary metrics and reasonable, performance-based goals with linear payout curves under most plans. We believe that these factors, combined with effective Board and management oversight, operate to mitigate risk and reduce the likelihood of employees engaging in excessive risk-taking behavior with respect to the compensation-related aspects of their jobs. 
      Succession planning       
Among the HRC Committee's responsibilities described in its charter is to oversee succession planning and leadership development. On an ongoing basis, the Board reviews succession plans for the CEO and other senior executive positions. These reviews occur with input from the CEO and EVP, Chief People Officer and the Board also reviews succession plans in executive sessions, with no members of management present. Succession reviews for key executive roles consist of an assessment of internal candidates as well as the review of external talent as identified by executive search partners employed by the Board. 
      Director evaluations       
Our Board maintains a regular and robust evaluation process designed to continually assess its effectiveness. The Board annually conducts a formal evaluation of the Board, each committee, and individual directors. The process involves the NGSR Committee, working with the Board Chair, designing each year's evaluation process, selecting from a variety of elements, which may include external evaluators, individual interviews, written questionnaires, and/or group discussions, taking into account the current dynamics of the Board and of the Company as well as the format of previous annual evaluations. This year, evaluations were completed through a group discussion conducted by the Board Chair, and were intended to gauge effectiveness in board composition and conduct, meeting structure, materials, committee composition and effectiveness; strategic and succession planning; culture and exercise of oversight as well as continued education and access to management. 
      Limits on director service on other public company boards       
We have a highly effective and engaged Board, and we believe that our directors' outside directorships enable them to contribute valuable knowledge and experience to the HPE Board. Nonetheless, the Board is sensitive

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Corporate governance to the external obligations of its directors and the potential for overboarding to compromise the ability of these directors to effectively serve on the Board. HPE's Corporate Governance Guidelines limit each director's service on other boards of public companies to a number that permits them, given their individual circumstances, to perform responsibly all director duties and, in all events, this service may not exceed four other public company boards. Further, the ability of each director to devote sufficient time and attention to director duties is expressly considered as part of the annual board self-evaluation process, which aims to evaluate the effectiveness and engagement of HPE's directors, including in the context of their external commitments. 
While the Board considers its directors' outside directorships during this evaluation process, the Board recognizes that this is one of many outside obligations which could potentially impair a director's capacity to dedicate sufficient time and focus to their service on the HPE Board. As such, the Board evaluates many factors when assessing the effectiveness and active involvement of each director. Such other factors include: 
We schedule our Board and committee meetings up to two years in advance, to ensure director availability and maximum participation. Directors serve for one-year terms; accordingly, there is an opportunity to evaluate annually each director's ability to serve. 
      Director independence       
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a substantial majority of the Board will consist of independent directors and that the Board can include no more than three directors who are not independent directors. These standards are available on our website at  http://investors.hpe.com/governance/guidelines. Our director independence standards generally reflect the NYSE corporate governance listing standards. In addition, each member of the Audit Committee and the HRC Committee meets the heightened independence standards required for such committee members under the applicable listing standards. 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, a director will not be considered independent in the following circumstances:

For these purposes, an "immediate family member" includes a director's spouse, parents, step-parents, children, step-children, siblings, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, and any person (other than tenants or employees) who shares the director's home. 
In determining independence, the Board reviews whether directors have any material relationship with Hewlett Packard Enterprise. An independent director must not have any material relationship with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, nor any relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In assessing the materiality of a director's relationship to Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including consideration of the issues from the director's standpoint and from the perspective of the persons or organizations with which the director has an affiliation, and is guided by the standards set forth above. 
In making its independence determinations, the Board considered transactions occurring since the beginning of fiscal 2016 between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and entities associated with the independent directors or their immediate family members. The Board's independence determinations included consideration of the following transactions:

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Corporate governance any of the previous three fiscal years, exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of Comcast Corporation's consolidated gross revenues. Mr. Angelakis is also the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Atairos Group, Inc. Hewlett Packard Enterprise has entered into transactions for the purchase and/or sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of its business during the past three fiscal years with Atairos Group, Inc. The amount that Hewlett Packard Enterprise paid in each of the last three fiscal years to Atairos Group, Inc., and the amount received in each fiscal year by Hewlett Packard Enterprise from Atairos Group, Inc., did not, in any of the previous three fiscal years, exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of Atairos Group, Inc.'s consolidated gross revenues. 
As a result of this review, the Board has determined the transactions and relationships described above would not interfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The Board has also determined that, with the exception of Ms. Livermore and Ms. Whitman, each non-employee director during fiscal 2018, including Mr. Ammann, Mr. Angelakis, Ms. Carter, Mr. Lane, Mr. Ozzie, Mr. Reiner, Ms. Russo, Mr. Tan, Mrs. Wilderotter and each of the members of the Audit Committee, the HRC Committee and the NGSR Committee, had, and, with respect to current directors, has, no material relationship with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Hewlett Packard Enterprise) and is independent within the meaning of both our and the NYSE director independence standards. The Board has determined that (i) Ms. Livermore is not independent under either standard because she was an employee of Hewlett Packard Enterprise through October 31, 2016 and was an executive officer of our former parent within the last five fiscal years, (ii) Mr. Neri is not independent under either standard because of his status as our current President and CEO, and (iii) Ms. Whitman is not independent because she was an executive officer of Hewlett Packard Enterprise through February 1, 2018.

      Director compensation and stock ownership guidelines       
Non-employee director compensation is determined by the independent members of our Board, acting on the recommendation of the HRC Committee. On an annual basis when determining compensation, the HRC Committee considers market data for our peer group, which is the same peer group used for HPE's executive compensation benchmarking (see "Fiscal 2018 Peer Companies" in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section), and input from Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook"), the third party compensation consultant retained by the HRC Committee, regarding market practices for director compensation. Directors who are employees of the Company or its affiliates do not receive separate compensation for their board activities. 
The HRC Committee intends to set director compensation levels at or near the market median relative to directors at companies of comparable size, industry, and scope of operations in order to ensure directors are paid competitively for their time commitment and responsibilities. Providing a competitive compensation package is important because it enables us to attract and retain highly qualified directors who are critical to our long-term success. As noted above, during fiscal 2018, FW Cook conducted a review of director compensation levels relative to our peer group. Results of their review indicated HPE's current director compensation program is positioned near the median relative to our peer group, and therefore no changes were made compared to the prior year. The HRC Committee intends to continue to conduct director compensation reviews annually. 
During fiscal 2018, non-employee directors were compensated for their service as shown in the chart below:

      Non-employee director stock ownership guidelines       
Under our stock ownership guidelines, non-employee directors are expected to accumulate, within five years of their election to the Board, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock equal in value to at least five times the amount of their annual cash retainer. Service on the HP Inc. (formerly known as Hewlett-Packard Company, also referred to herein as "Former Parent") Board of Directors immediately prior to the separation of HPE from HP Inc. on November 1, 2015, is recognized for purposes of such five year period. Shares counted toward these guidelines include any shares held by the director directly or indirectly, including deferred vested awards. 
All non-employee directors with more than five years of service have met our stock ownership guidelines, and all non-employee directors with less than five years of service have either met, or are on track to meet, our stock ownership guidelines within the expected time based on the trading price of HPE's stock as of October 31, 2018.

   Anti-hedging/pledging policy  
HPE has a policy prohibiting directors from engaging in any form of hedging transaction (derivatives, equity swaps, forwards, etc.) in HPE stock, including, among other things, short sales and transactions involving publicly traded options. In addition, with limited exceptions, HPE's directors are prohibited from holding HPE stock in margin accounts and from pledging HPE stock as collateral for loans. We believe that these policies further align directors' interests with those of our stockholders. 
      Stock ownership information       
      Common stock ownership of certain beneficial owners and management       
The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2018 concerning beneficial ownership by:
The information provided in the table is based on our records, information filed with the SEC and information provided to Hewlett Packard Enterprise, except where otherwise noted. 
The number of shares beneficially owned by each entity or individual is determined under SEC rules, and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under such rules, beneficial ownership includes any shares as to which the entity or individual has sole or shared voting or investment power and also any shares that the entity or individual has the right to acquire as of March 1, 2019 (60 days after December 31, 2018) through the exercise of any stock options, through the vesting and settlement of RSUs payable in shares, or upon the exercise of other rights. Beneficial ownership excludes options or other rights vesting after March 1, 2019 and any RSUs vesting or settling on or before March 1, 2019 that may be payable in cash or shares at Hewlett Packard Enterprise's election. Unless otherwise indicated, each person has sole voting and investment power (or shares such powers with his or her spouse) with respect to the shares set forth in the following table.

      Section 16(a) beneficial ownership reporting compliance       
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, requires our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 10% of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's stock to file reports with the SEC regarding their ownership and changes in ownership of our securities. Based upon our examination of the copies of Forms 3, 4, and 5, and amendments thereto furnished to us and the written representations of our directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, we believe that, during fiscal 2018, our directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements, except that, due to a delay in the receipt of his Edgar filer codes, Philip Davis was unable to timely submit his Form 4 on March 1, 2018, which was filed on March 2, 2018. 
   Related persons transactions policies and procedures       
We have adopted a written policy for approval of transactions between us and our directors, director nominees, executive officers, beneficial owners of more than five percent (5%) of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's stock, and their respective immediate family members where the amount involved in the transaction exceeds or is expected to exceed $120,000 in a single 12-month period and such "related persons" have or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than ten percent (10%) beneficial owner of another entity). 
The policy provides that the NGSR Committee reviews certain transactions subject to the policy and decides whether or not to approve or ratify those transactions. In doing so, the NGSR Committee determines whether the transaction is in the best interests of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In making that determination, the NGSR Committee takes into account, among other factors it deems appropriate:

The NGSR Committee has delegated authority to the chair of the NGSR Committee to pre-approve or ratify transactions where the aggregate amount involved is expected to be less than $1 million. A summary of any new transactions pre-approved by the chair is provided to the full NGSR Committee for its review at each of the NGSR Committee's regularly scheduled meetings. 
The NGSR Committee has adopted standing pre-approvals under the policy for limited transactions with related persons. 
Pre-approved transactions include: 
A summary of transactions covered by the standing pre-approvals described in paragraphs 3 and 4 above is provided to the NGSR Committee for its review as applicable. 
      Fiscal 2018 related person transactions       
We enter into commercial transactions with many entities for which our executive officers or directors serve as directors and/or executive officers in the ordinary course of our business. All of those transactions were pre-approved transactions as defined above or were approved or ratified by the NGSR Committee or our Former Parent's NGSR Committee. Hewlett Packard Enterprise considers all pre-approved or ratified transactions to have been at arm's-length and does not believe that any of our executive officers or directors had a material direct or indirect interest in any of such commercial transactions.

Proposals to be voted on  
On the recommendation of the NGSR Committee, the Board has nominated the 12 persons named below for election as directors this year, each to serve for a one-year term or until the director's successor is elected and qualified. 
   Director nominee experience and qualifications       
The Board annually reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics required of directors in the context of the current composition of the Board, our operating requirements, and the long-term interests of our stockholders. The Board believes that its members should possess a variety of skills, professional experience and backgrounds in order to effectively oversee our business. In addition, the Board believes that each director should possess certain attributes, as reflected in the Board membership criteria described below. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines contain the current Board membership criteria that apply to nominees recommended for a position on the Board. Under those criteria, members of the Board should have the highest professional and personal ethics and values, consistent with our long-standing values and standards. They should have broad experience at the policy-making level in business, government, education, technology or public service. They should be committed to enhancing stockholder value and should have sufficient time to carry out their duties and to provide insight and practical wisdom based on experience. In addition, the NGSR Committee takes into account a potential director's ability to contribute to the diversity of background and experience represented on the Board, and it reviews its effectiveness in balancing these considerations when assessing the composition of the Board. Directors' service on other boards of public companies should be limited to a number that permits them, given their individual circumstances, to perform responsibly all director duties. Each director must represent the interests of all of our stockholders. Although the Board uses these and other criteria as appropriate to evaluate potential nominees, it has no stated minimum criteria for nominees. 
The Board believes that all the nominees named below are highly qualified and have the skills and experience required for effective service on the Board. The nominees' individual biographies below contain information about their experience, qualifications and skills that led the Board to nominate them. 
All of the nominees have indicated to us that they will be available to serve as directors. In the event that any nominee should become unavailable, the proxy holders, Antonio F. Neri, Tarek Robbiati and Rishi Varma, will vote for a nominee or nominees designated by the Board, or the Board may decrease the size of the Board. 
There are no family relationships among our executive officers and directors. 
      Recommendation of the board of directors

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Proposals to be voted on  
The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed, and as a matter of good corporate governance, is requesting ratification by the stockholders of, Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated and combined financial statements for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2019. During fiscal 2018, Ernst & Young LLP served as our independent registered public accounting firm and also provided certain other audit-related and tax services. See "Principal accounting fees and services" on page 85 and "Report of the Audit Committee of the board of directors" on page 87. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to participate in the annual meeting, where they will be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if they desire, to make a statement. 
      Vote required       
Ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to be voted at the annual meeting. If the appointment is not ratified, the Board will consider whether it should select another independent registered public accounting firm.

Our Board and HRC Committee are committed to excellence in corporate governance and to executive compensation programs that align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. To fulfill this mission, we have a pay-for-performance philosophy that forms the foundation for all decisions regarding compensation. Our compensation programs have been structured to balance near-term results with long-term success, and enable us to attract, retain, focus, and reward our executive team for delivering stockholder value. Below is a summary of key elements of our fiscal compensation programs relative to this philosophy.

The Executive Compensation portion of this proxy statement contains a detailed description of our compensation philosophy and programs, the compensation decisions made under those programs with regard to our named executive officers ("NEOs") for fiscal 2018, and the factors considered by the HRC Committee in making those decisions. We believe that we maintain a compensation program deserving of stockholder support. Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends stockholder approval of the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this proxy statement.

As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on HPE, the Board, or the HRC Committee.

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Proposals to be voted on  
We received a stockholder proposal from John Chevedden (the "Proposal"). The proponent has requested we include the Proposal and supporting statement in this proxy statement, and, if properly presented, the Proposal will be voted on at the annual meeting. We will provide the proponent's address and the number of shares that he beneficially owns upon oral or written request of any stockholder. This Proposal and supporting statement are quoted verbatim in italics below. 
The Board opposes adoption of the Proposal and asks stockholders to review the Board's response, which follows the proponent's Proposal. 
    STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL        THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE   AGAINST THE FOLLOWING STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL         
   Proposal 4â€”Right to Act by Written Consent         
Resolved, Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any topic for written consent consistent with applicable law.
Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. Taking action by written consent in plcace of a meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle.
This proposal topic won impressive 47%-support at the 2018 HPE annual meeting. Thus it most likely won more than 50%-support from the large shareholders who have ready access to independent information (as opposed to only the biased management information) on the importance of this topic.
Dozens of Fortune 500 companies provide for both shareholder rightsâ€”to act by written consent and to call a special meeting. Our higher 25% threshold for shareholders to call a special meeting is one more reason that we should have the right to act by written consent.
It is especially important to gain a shareholder right, such as written consent, to make up for our management abruptly taking away an important shareholder rightâ€”the right to an in-person annual meeting. For decades shareholders had a once-a-year opportunity to ask our $8 million CEO and directors (who earn about $30,000 a week for the time they devote to HPE) questions in person.
This includes Lip-Bu Tan, a potentially distracted director (serving on 4 boards), who got 12% in negative votes in 2018 (when certain HPE directors received less than 1% in negative votes) and Raymond Lane who got 19% in negative votes.
Now our directors can be on the golf course during the annual meeting as long as they turn on their phones for a few minutes.
Investor relations can take control of the annual meeting. Investor relations can screen out the difficult questions and can spoon-feed vague answers to our CEO. There is no way a shareholder can ask for

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Proposals to be voted on clarification of a vague or misleading answer on an important issue such as the announced $7 billion share buyback program.
The lack of an in-person annual meeting means that a board meeting can be scheduled months after the virtual meetingâ€”by which time any serious issues raised by shareholders will be long forgotten by the directors. Plus a virtual meeting guarantees that there will be no media coverage for the benefit of all shareholders.
   Please vote yes:  
  Right to Act by Written Consentâ€”Proposal 4         
     Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition         
The Board has carefully considered the proposal for stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting (the "Proposal") and, for the reasons outlined below, the Board believes that it is not in the best interests of HPE and its stockholders. Therefore, the Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "AGAINST" this Proposal. 
      Stockholder meetings offer important protections and advantages that are absent from the written consent  process under this Proposal         
The Board is committed to robust corporate governance and believes in maintaining policies and practices that serve the interests of all stockholders. The Board understands that corporate governance is not staticâ€”and continually monitors trends and developments in corporate governance and compares and evaluates them against our current practices. The Board recognizes that some stockholders may view the ability to act by written consent as an important right. However, the Board believes that HPE's existing Bylaws provision that provides stockholders with the right to call special meetings offers a more transparent and equitable mechanism for stockholders to raise matters for consideration by the Company. 
HPE's stockholders have the right to call a special meeting at a 25% threshold, which is the prevalent threshold among S&P 500 companies that provide their stockholders with that right. This right to call a special meeting, along with our established stockholder communication and engagement practices, provides stockholders with opportunities to raise important matters and propose actions for stockholder consideration outside the annual meeting process. The protections and advantages of stockholder meetings include:

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Proposals to be voted on 
      In contrast, the written consent process does not promote transparent decision making and could  disenfranchise stockholders         
The Board recommends that stockholders vote against this Proposal because it believes the transparency and fairness of the annual or special meeting process better serve stockholder's interests. Proposing action by written consent deprives stockholders of a forum for discussion or opportunity to have a meaningful and structured exchange of views with the Board and other stockholders before acting. Unlike written consents, taking action at annual or special meetings allows for accurate and complete information about the proposed stockholder action to be widely distributed, ensuring well-informed discussion and consideration of the merits of the proposed action. 
Matters that are so important as to require stockholder approval should be communicated in advance so they can be properly considered and voted upon by all stockholders. In contrast, this Proposal would allow holders of a bare majority of shares to approve critical actions on their own, without notice to other stockholders or to the Company and without an opportunity for discussion at a stockholder meeting. This Proposal, if adopted, could therefore disenfranchise many stockholders and may deprive them of these rights, while enabling a small group of stockholders (including special interest investors and those who accumulate a short-term voting position through the borrowing of shares), with no fiduciary duties to the other stockholders, to approve their own proposed actions. Accordingly, stockholder action by written consent could be used by a group of stockholdersâ€”no matter how small of an ownership position they representâ€”to pursue individual agendas or significant corporate actions that are not in the best interests of all stockholders. 
Additionally, the written consent process has the potential to create confusion because multiple groups of stockholders would be able to solicit written consents at any time and as frequently as they choose on a range of issues, some of which may be duplicative or conflicting. Addressing such actions could impose significant administrative and financial burdens on the Company with no corresponding benefit to stockholders. The Board believes that these possible outcomes are contrary to principles of stockholder democracy, fair and accurate disclosure, and good corporate governance. 
      HPE's stockholder-friendly corporate governance practices empower stockholders and promote Board  accountability         
The Board believes the Company's existing strong corporate governance practices make adoption of this Proposal unnecessary. In addition to the right of stockholders to call special meetings at a 25% threshold as mentioned above, the following corporate governance provisions empower stockholders to express their views or take action and enhance Board accountability:

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Proposals to be voted on 
      Summary         
The Board believes that the implementation of this Proposal is not in the best interests of stockholders or the Company and is unnecessary, given the ability of stockholders to call special meetings and the Company's strong corporate governance practices and policies. This Proposal would circumvent the protections, procedural safeguards and advantages provided to all stockholders by stockholder meetings. Accordingly, the Board recommends that you vote AGAINST this Proposal. 
      Vote required       
Approval of this Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of HPE common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to be voted on the Proposal at the annual meeting. 
      Recommendation of the board of directors

      Compensation discussion and analysis       
      Executive summary       
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is a global technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture, analyze, and act upon data seamlessly from edge to cloud. We enable customers to accelerate business outcomes by driving new business models, creating new customer and employee experiences, and increasing operational efficiency today and into the future. Our legacy dates back to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard, and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our dedication to providing innovative technological solutions to our customers. 
Antonio F. Neri was promoted to CEO on February 1, 2018 upon the retirement of Margaret C. Whitman, who had served in that position since our spinoff from HP Inc. on November 1, 2015. Mr. Neri joined the Company in 1995 and possesses a deep understanding of technology, our products, and our service offerings. Under his leadership, we have continued our multi-year transformation and have delivered substantial improvements in operating results versus the prior year. As described later in this discussion, Mr. Neri's compensation upon promotion to CEO was positioned below the median of our peers and well below Ms. Whitman's, who had extensive experience as CEO at both our predecessor company and elsewhere. Assuming Mr. Neri delivers strong and sustained performance, it is the HRC Committee's intent to close the gap in compensation within a reasonable period of time as Mr. Neri gains experience in the CEO role. 
During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we launched an initiative called HPE Next. This initiative involves simplifying our operating model, and streamlining our offerings and business processes to quicken the pace and efficiency of execution. In addition, we continue to shift our investments in innovation towards high growth and higher margin solutions. 
Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, HPE implemented organizational changes to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. 
HPE's four primary business segments are: 
 Hybrid ITâ€”provides a broad portfolio of services-led and software-enabled infrastructure and solutions including secure, software-defined servers, storage, data center networking, and HPE Pointnext services, thereby combining HPE's hardware, software, and services capabilities to make hybrid IT simple for its customers. 
 Intelligent Edgeâ€”consisting of enterprise networking and security solutions for businesses of any size, offering secure connectivity for campus and branch environments, operating under the Aruba brand. The primary business drivers for Intelligent Edge solutions are mobility and Internet of Things ("IoT"). 
 Financial Servicesâ€”provides flexible investment solutions, such as leasing, financing, IT consumption, and utility programs and asset management services for customers that facilitate unique technology deployment models and the acquisition of complete IT solutions, including hardware, software, and services from Hewlett Packard Enterprise and others. 
 Corporate Investmentsâ€”includes Hewlett Packard Labs and certain business incubation projects. 
In addition, we made three primary strategic acquisitions in fiscal 2018 to strengthen our portfolio: Cape Networks, RedPixie, and Plexxi. Each are highly complementary to our core business and operate in high-growth markets with strong margins. We also continued our organic investment strategy with numerous exciting products and service offerings, most notably our HPE OneSphere and HPE GreenLake. 
These efforts and initiatives position HPE to successfully deliver on our vision and the three key pillars of our strategy:

Below is a summary of HPE's financial and strategic highlights, as well as their corresponding impact to executive compensation for fiscal 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  FINANCIAL   HIGHLIGHTS â€‹       Â• Increased net revenue  by 7% from $28.9 billion in 2017 to $30.9 billion in 2018            Â• Increased non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations by 63% from $0.96 in 2017 to $1.56 in  2018, also above the previously provided outlook of $1.50 to $1.55 per share             * GAAP diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2018 was below the previously provided outlook of $1.85 to $1.90 per share,  primarily due to non-cash impacts of U.S. tax reform introduced in early fiscal 2018, including a reduction in our deferred tax asset balance and higher transition tax expense expectations.      Â• Increased cash flow  from operations by 122% from $1.3 billion in 2017 to $3.0 billion in 2018              Â• Increased returns to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends by 39% from $3.0 billion in 2017 to $4.1 billion in 2018      â€‹   Annual Incentive Program   Â• The calculated annual incentive achievement as a percent of target for NEOs was determined using a preset formula that included revenue and operating profit goals plus a   management by objectives ("MBO") modifier directly tied to HPE Next cost savings goals. We overachieved both the revenue and operating profit goals, resulting in a payout before application of the MBO modifier of 146.5% of target. We also   overachieved the preset, formulaic HPE Next cost savings goals and this resulted in a modifier of +20%, yielding an overall payout equal to 175.8% of target. In fiscal 2017, the HRC Committee exercised discretion to reduce the calculated bonus payout   for our NEOs to zero as a result of the underachievement of our fiscal 2017 financial performance overall. Due to strong execution in fiscal 2018, no negative discretion was exercised (see details in the "Fiscal 2018 PfR Program Annual Incentive   Payout" table).    Long-term Incentive Program   Â• Fiscal 2017 Performance-contingent Stock   Options ("PCSOs"), granted on December 7, 2016, have achieved two of three rigorous stock price performance goals due to our strong performance in fiscal 2018.

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Executive compensation (CD&A) 
      Oversight and authority over executive compensation       
   Role of the HRC Committee and its advisors  
The HRC Committee oversees and provides strategic direction to management regarding all aspects of HPE's pay program for senior executives. It makes recommendations regarding the compensation of the CEO to the independent members of the Board for approval, and it reviews and approves the compensation of the remaining Section 16 Officers. Each HRC Committee member is an independent non-employee director with significant experience in executive compensation matters. The HRC Committee engages its own independent compensation consultant as well as its own independent legal counsel. 
The HRC Committee continued to retain both FW Cook as its independent compensation consultant and Vedder Price, P.C. ("Vedder Price") as its independent legal counsel in fiscal 2018. 
In fiscal 2018, FW Cook provided analyses, market comparator benchmarking, and recommendations that informed the HRC Committee's decisions. All modifications to the compensation programs for our NEOs and other Section 16 Officers were assessed by FW Cook on behalf of the HRC Committee, and were discussed and approved by the HRC Committee. Pursuant to SEC rules, the HRC Committee assessed the independence of all its advisors, and concluded each is independent and that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent FW Cook or Vedder Price from independently providing service to the HRC Committee. 
Neither FW Cook nor Vedder Price perform other services for the Company, and neither will do so without the prior consent of the HRC Committee Chair. Both Vedder Price and FW Cook regularly attend HRC Committee meetings and engage with the HRC Committee Chair and the HRC Committee members outside the presence of management. 
The HRC Committee met seven times in fiscal 2018. The HRC Committee's independent advisors participated in most of those meetings, as well as preparatory meetings and executive sessions. 
   Role of management and the CEO in setting executive compensation  
Management leads the development of our compensation programs and considers market competitiveness, business results, business strategy, experience, and individual performance in evaluating NEO and other Section 16 Officer compensation. The EVP, Chief People Officer and other members of our human resources organization, together with members of our finance and legal organizations, work with the CEO to design and develop compensation programs and implement the decisions of the HRC Committee. Management also recommends changes to existing plans and programs applicable to NEOs and other Section 16 Officers, as well as financial and other performance targets to be achieved under those programs, and prepares analyses of financial data, peer comparisons, and other briefing materials to assist the HRC Committee in making its decisions. During fiscal 2018, management continued to engage Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian") as its compensation consultant. Because Meridian is engaged by management, the HRC Committee has determined that it is not independent. This was taken into consideration when any information or analyses were provided by Meridian, all of which were also reviewed by FW Cook on behalf of the HRC Committee. 
For fiscal 2018, while fomer CEO, Ms. Whitman provided input to the HRC Committee regarding performance metrics and the setting of appropriate company-wide and business-specific performance targets. 
Ms. Whitman also recommended target individual MBO goals for the NEOs, including Mr. Neri, and the other senior executives who reported directly to her. Neither Ms. Whitman, nor our current CEO, Mr. Neri, were involved in deliberations regarding their own compensation. Mr. Neri was subject to the same financial performance goals as the executives who led global functions, and his MBOs and compensation were approved by the independent members of the Board upon his appointment to CEO. Ms. Whitman did not participate in HPE's fiscal 2018 annual or long-term incentive programs as a result of her retirement from the Company on February 1, 2018.

The Compensation Discussion and Analysis or "CD&A" describes the material elements of compensation for the fiscal 2018 NEOs, who are listed below: 
   Components and mix of compensation  
As illustrated in the charts below, our primary focus in compensating executives is on the longer-term and performance-based elements of target total direct compensation. Under the executive compensation program, over 90% of Mr. Neri's fiscal 2018 target total direct compensation as CEO was variable, and on average, 86% was variable for our other NEOs.

      Process for setting and awarding fiscal 2018 executive compensation       
The Board and the HRC Committee regularly explore ways to improve our executive compensation program. Fiscal 2018 target compensation levels for HPE executives were determined by the HRC Committee based on recommendations from our former CEO. In making changes for fiscal 2018, the HRC Committee considered the evolution of HPE's business and business needs, as well as appropriate levels of compensation in comparison to HPE's peer companies. The objectives were to encourage strong performance, pay commensurately with performance, and align the interests of HPE's executives with those of HPE's stockholders. 
The HRC Committee and the Board considered a broad range of facts and circumstances in setting our overall executive compensation levels. Among the factors considered for our executives generally, and for the NEOs in particular, were market competitiveness, our former CEO's recommendations for all NEOs excluding herself, internal equity, and individual performance. The weight given to each factor may differ from year to year, is not formulaic, and may differ among individual NEOs in any given year. For example, when we recruit externally, market competitiveness, experience, and the circumstances unique to a particular candidate may weigh more heavily when determining compensation levels. In contrast, when determining year over year compensation for current NEOs, internal equity and individual performance may weigh more heavily in the analysis.

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Executive compensation (CD&A) 
Because such a large percentage of NEO pay is performance based, the HRC Committee spent significant time discussing and determining the appropriate metrics and goals for HPE's annual and long-term incentive programs. For fiscal 2018, management made an initial recommendation of goals, which were assessed by FW Cook, and then were discussed and approved by the HRC Committee. Major factors considered in setting goals for each fiscal year include business results from the most recently completed fiscal year, business-specific strategic plans, macroeconomic factors, competitive performance results and goals, conditions or goals specific to a particular business, and strategic initiatives. 
In addition, the HRC Committee considered feedback from our stockholders and the results of our fiscal 2016 Say on Pay vote (which was the most current vote at the time fiscal 2018 compensation was set). Our fiscal 2017 Say on Pay vote reflected 94.9% support from our stockholders, based on the percentage of shares voted. The HRC Committee believes this indicates that our stockholders support the philosophy, strategy, objectives, and administration of our executive compensation programs. 
In setting incentive-based compensation for the NEOs, the HRC Committee generally did not consider the effect of past changes in stock price, expected payouts, or earnings under other programs. In addition, incentive compensation decisions were made without regard to length of service or awards in prior years. 
Following the close of fiscal 2018, the HRC Committee reviewed actual financial results and MBO performance against quantifiable and preset objective goals under our incentive compensation programs for the year. Actual payouts were determined by reference to performance against the established goals. In addition, the HRC Committee met in executive session without members of management present, to review the MBO results for Mr. Neri, which were then approved by the independent members of the Board. 
Because overall performance was strong in fiscal 2018, unlike fiscal 2017 when the Committee exercised discretion to eliminate payouts as a result of the underachievement of our fiscal 2017 financial performance overall, no negative discretion was applied in fiscal 2018. 
      Compensation program enhancements for fiscal 2018       
The fiscal 2018 annual and long-term incentive programs remained largely consistent with those from the prior year, but three enhancements were made to better align executive and stockholder interests: 
      Annual Incentive Program         
      Long-term Incentive Program

      Determination of fiscal 2018 executive compensation       
   Fiscal 2018 base salary  
Consistent with a philosophy of linking pay to performance, our executives received a small percentage of their target total direct compensation in the form of base salary. The NEOs are paid an amount of base salary sufficient to attract qualified executive talent and maintain a stable management team. The HRC Committee targeted executive base salaries to be at or near the market median for comparable positions at our peer companies, and to generally comprise approximately 10% to 15% of the NEOs' overall target total direct compensation, which is consistent with the practice of our peer-group companies. 
As part of HPE's annual compensation-management process, Ms. Whitman recommended, and the HRC Committee reviewed and approved, the following fiscal 2018 base salary increases to more closely align our NEOs with similar executives of HPE's peer companies. The independent members of our Board increased Mr. Neri's salary to $1 million upon his promotion to CEO, effective February 1, 2018.

   Fiscal 2018 annual incentives  
   Pay-for-Results ("PfR") program design  
The NEOs, excluding Mr. Davis, were eligible to earn an annual incentive under our 2015 Stock Incentive Plan for fiscal 2018. The target annual incentive awards for fiscal 2018 were set at 150% of base salary for Mr. Neri, and 125% of base salary for the other NEOs. Because of her impending retirement, Ms. Whitman was not eligible for an annual incentive award for fiscal 2018. 
The fiscal 2018 annual incentive program, illustrated above, consisted of two core financial metrics of revenue and operating profit. Both corporate revenue and profitability continued to be important annual measures to drive stockholder value through company strategy and business results. The achievement of certain individual performance-based financial MBO goals resulted in either a 20% increase or 20% decrease to financial funding to determine the final annual incentive payout for each participating NEO. The MBO goals were established at the beginning of the performance period and were measured objectively and formulaically at year-end. 
The specific metrics, their linkage to corporate or business results, as applicable, and the weighting that was placed on each, were chosen because the HRC Committee believed:

These financial performance metrics are defined and explained in greater detail below: 
Consistent with prior years, and in consideration of HPE's continued business transformation and the considerable impact of foreign exchange rates, the HRC Committee approved plan mechanics in the beginning of the performance period to non-discretionarily revise any internal financial goals for business transformation transactions that have a material impact to HPE's revenue, and to limit foreign exchange impact on actual performance results to no more than +/â€“ 5%. The HRC Committee continues to have negative discretion to the extent it decides against revising the performance goals, and can review and approve adjustments below the initially set guidelines in special cases 
   Fiscal 2018 Financial Results  
Shortly after the completion of the fiscal year, the HRC Committee reviewed and determined performance against the corporate financial metrics as follows:

   Discussion of Fiscal 2018 MBOs  
As discussed earlier, HPE launched the HPE Next initiative in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This initiative is designed to simplify our operating model, streamline our offerings and business processes, shift our investments in innovation toward high growth and higher margin solutions and services, and achieve significant net cost savings. The HRC Committee approved fiscal 2018 MBO goals aligned solely to the performance-based financial achievement of rigorous HPE Next cost savings targets to drive accountability for the HPE Next initiative and HPE's long-term success. The MBO goals were tied directly to the initiative's 3-year estimated gross cost savings of $1.5 billion. However, the Company does not disclose specific HPE Next MBO targets because this information is not otherwise publicly disclosed, and the Company believes it would cause competitive harm to do so. For fiscal 2018, all NEOs participating in the PfR program met or exceeded their formulaic HPE Next cost savings goals, resulting in a 20% increase to the financial funding of their annual incentive payouts. 
Based on the fiscal 2018 financial performance and MBO achievement described above, the annual incentive payouts for the NEOs under the PfR program were as follows:

Within the first 90 days of fiscal 2018, the HRC Committee established an "umbrella" pool under which a maximum bonus was determined in order to permit awards to be eligible to be considered qualified performance based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as amended (the "Code"). Under the umbrella formula, each NEO who was a covered employee for purposes of Code Section 162(m) was allocated a pro rata share of 1.0% of operating profit based on his or her target annual incentive award, subject to a maximum bonus of 200% of each covered

employee's target bonus, and the maximum $10 million cap under the PfR program. After certifying the size of the pool and the individual allocations, which were each in excess of the maximum potential bonus for the covered employees, the HRC Committee determined actual payouts based upon financial metrics and MBOs established by the HRC Committee for Section 16 Officers and by the independent members of the Board for Mr. Neri, as described above. Although Mr. Davis was a covered employee for purposes of Code Section 162(m) for fiscal 2018, because he did not participate in the PfR program from fiscal 2018, he was not subject to the "umbrella" pool. As a result, amounts paid to him under his sales incentive plan are not considered to be performance-based compensation for purposes of Code Section 162(m). In addition, as a result of the passage of the so-called "Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017," the performance-based exception to the $1 million deduction limit for covered employees that was previously available under Code Section 162(m) will be largely or entirely unavailable beginning in fiscal 2019. 
      Sales Incentive Plan         
Mr. Davis was appointed HPE's President of Hybrid IT and became a Section 16 Officer in February 2018. Mr. Davis retained his former position as HPE's Chief Sales Officer and remained exclusively on his sales incentive plan for the remainder of fiscal 2018. There were no compensation actions taken in fiscal 2018 in recognition of his promotion to President of Hybrid IT. 
Mr. Davis's sales incentive plan measured achievement of specific Hybrid IT and HPE Aruba products revenue, Hybrid IT profit, and HPE Pointnext and HPE Aruba Services order targets for fiscal 2018. Under the terms of his sales incentive plan, Mr. Davis received monthly payouts based on the year-to-date financial achievement with any overachievement based on a set of payout accelerators for incremental achievement above target, and underachievement resulting in below target payouts. The financial targets pertaining to Mr. Davis's sales incentive plan are not being disclosed because we believe such disclosure would cause us competitive harm and we consider this information to be confidential business information. However, we believe his targets were difficult to achieve and were set at levels necessary to drive stockholder value. Pursuant to Mr. Davis's sales incentive plan, he received total sales incentive payments in the amount of $619,834, which reflected performance above fiscal 2018 targets. For fiscal 2019, Mr. Davis will participate exclusively in HPE's standard PfR program, similar to other NEOs.

   Fiscal 2018 Award Mix  
The HRC Committee maintained a fiscal 2018 LTI design for our NEOs that consisted of a value-based mix of two equity vehicles illustrated in the following chart: 
   Fiscal 2018 LTI Grant Values  
The HRC Committee, and in the case of Mr. Neri, the independent members of the Board, approved the value of fiscal 2018 annual LTI awards for the NEOs based on factors such as competitive market data, internal equity, individual performance, and the executives' potential future contributions. Ms. Whitman did not receive a fiscal 2018 LTI award. Messrs. Robbiati and Davis were not executive officers at the time of the fiscal 2018 annual LTI awards and, therefore, did not receive

These values represent the target dollar value of awards granted. The actual grant date fair value may vary. For more information on NEO grants of PARSUs and RSUs during fiscal 2018, see the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2018" table. 
   Fiscal 2018 PARSUs  
The PARSUs were structured to have two- and three-year performance periods that began at the start of fiscal 2018 and continue through the end of fiscal 2019 and 2020, respectively. Under this program, fifty percent of the PARSUs are eligible for vesting based on performance over two years with continued service, and fifty percent are eligible for vesting based on performance over three years with continued service. The two- and three-year performance measures are each based on HPE's non-GAAP net income results and a modifier dependent upon relative TSR performance against the S&P 500 constituents. 
The PARSUs granted to our NEOs measure net income to drive accountability for all aspects of revenue, costs, expenses, depreciation on past capital expenditures, and taxes, which we believe are all key drivers of stockholder value. Internal net income goals were set after consideration of historical performance, internal budgets, and external expectations. 
Effective for fiscal 2019 and as described in more detail in our discussion under "Accounting and Tax Effects," changes made by the so-called "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017" generally eliminated the tax deduction exception for performance-based compensation under Code Section 162(m). We, however, intend to continue to grant performance-based awards. 
Additional details regarding the fiscal 2018 PARSU design are illustrated and further described below.

       Other fiscal 2018 LTI awards       
In October 2017, Mr. Davis received a performance-based strategic cash retention award in the amount of $2 million as a result of the promotion to his former non-Section 16 Officer role as Chief Sales Officer. The award was to be paid in two installments over a period ending on November 1, 2019, subject to maintaining a satisfactory level of individual performance and continued employment. The first installment was paid on November 1, 2018. Subject to a satisfactory level of individual performance and continued employment, the second installment is scheduled to be paid on November 1, 2019. As discussed earlier, Mr. Davis subsequently became President of Hybrid IT, at which time, no additional fiscal 2018 compensation actions were taken. 
      Benefits       
Our NEOs receive health and welfare benefits (including retiree medical benefits if eligibility conditions are met) under the same programs and subject to the same eligibility requirements that apply to our U.S. employees generally. However, in order to facilitate coverage of his family abroad, Mr. Davis has, since his relocation from Singapore to the United States in early fiscal 2018, participated in an international health insurance plan arranged by the Company for select relocated employees. Otherwise, we do not provide our executives, including the NEOs, with special or supplemental U.S. defined benefit pension or health benefits. 
The NEOs, along with other executives who earn base salary or annual incentives in excess of certain limits under the Code, were eligible in fiscal 2018 to participate in the HPE Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "EDCP"). This plan was maintained to permit executives to defer a portion of their compensation and related taxation on such amounts. This is a standard benefit plan also offered by the majority of our peers, and is more fully described in the "Narrative to the Fiscal 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table" section. Amounts deferred or matched under the EDCP are credited with notional investment earnings based on investment options selected by the participant from among mutual and proprietary funds available to employees under the HPE 401(k) Plan. No amounts in the EDCP earn above-market returns. 
      Perquisites       
Consistent with the practices of our peer group companies, we provide limited perquisites to our senior executives, including the NEOs, as discussed below. 
We provide our NEOs with financial counseling services to assist them in obtaining professional financial advice, which is a common benefit among our peers. This helps increase the understanding and effectiveness of our executive compensation program, and also increases productivity by limiting distractions from Company responsibilities to attend to personal financial matters. The value of these services is taxable to our executives. 
Our CEO may use company aircraft for personal purposes in the CEO's own discretion and, at times, is advised to use company aircraft for personal travel for security reasons. The other NEOs may use company aircraft for personal purposes under certain limited circumstances, if available and approved in advance by the CEO. The NEOs, including the CEO, are taxed on the value of this personal usage according to applicable tax rules. There is no tax gross-up paid on the income attributable to this value. 
For details on perquisites received during fiscal 2018, see the "Summary Compensation Table" below.

   Use of comparative compensation data and compensation philosophy  
The HRC Committee reviewed Section 16 Officer compensation and compared it to that of executives in similar positions with HPE's peers for purposes of benchmarking target pay levels. As a result of the HRC Committee's annual review of our peer group, EMC Corporation was removed for fiscal 2018 due to its acquisition by Dell Inc. The HRC Committee reviewed and approved the following peer group, which informed decision making for fiscal 2018 target pay levels:

For fiscal 2018, FW Cook used the following screening criteria to develop a pool of potential peers:
HPE is positioned in a reasonable range around peer median on several size characteristics (e.g., revenue, operating income, and total assets). At the time the fiscal 2018 peer group was approved, the Company was above the 50th percentile for revenue and below the 25th percentile for market capitalization, despite the removal of several large companies from its prior peer groups. 
In reviewing comparative pay data from these companies against pay for our Section 16 Officers, the HRC Committee evaluated data, using regression analysis where necessary to adjust for size differences between HPE and the peer group companies. Exclusions were made for particular data points of certain companies if they were anomalous and not representative of market practices. The HRC Committee continued to set target total direct compensation levels for fiscal 2018 that were generally at or near the market median, although in some cases it was higher for attraction and retention purposes. 
In fiscal 2018, the HRC Committee completed its annual review of our fiscal 2019 peer group and found there to be appropriate additions and deletions to bring HPE into closer alignment with the median of our peers on both revenue and market capitalization. Flex Ltd., Jabil, Juniper Networks, and NetApp were added to our peer group for fiscal 2019, while Boeing, Oracle, and Texas Instruments were removed. 
The HRC Committee will continue to review HPE's peer group annually to assess the appropriateness for competitive benchmarking of executive pay and compensation design. 
      EXECUTIVE STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES         
HPE has stock ownership guidelines designed to align executives' interests more closely with those of our stockholders, and to mitigate the potential for taking excessive risk that could affect the value of HPE stock. Under the guidelines, within five years of assuming a designated position, the CEO is expected to attain and hold an investment position in our stock equal to seven times base salary, and all other NEOs are expected to attain and hold an investment position equal to five times base salary. Shares counted toward the guidelines include those

held by the executive directly or through a broker, shares held in the HPE 401(k) Plan, shares held as unvested restricted stock, shares underlying time-vested RSUs, and shares underlying vested but unexercised stock options (fifty percent of the in-the-money value of such options is used for this calculation). All NEOs who were actively employed at that time held the expected investment position in HPE's stock as of the end of fiscal 2018. 
      ANTI-HEDGING/PLEDGING POLICY         
We have a policy prohibiting HPE's executive officers and directors from engaging in any form of hedging transaction (derivatives, equity swaps, forwards, etc.) in HPE stock, including, among other things, short sales and transactions involving publicly-traded options. In addition, with limited exceptions, HPE's executive officers are prohibited from holding HPE stock in margin accounts and from pledging HPE stock as collateral for loans. We believe that these policies further align executives' interests with those of our stockholders. 
      POLICY ON RECOVERY IN EVENT OF FINANCIAL RESTATEMENT         
HPE maintains a "clawback" policy that permits the Company to recover certain annual and long-term cash incentives from senior executives in the event that fraud or personal misconduct results in a significant restatement of financial results. The policy permits the recovery of incentives paid from those senior executives whose fraud or misconduct resulted in the restatement to the extent the amounts paid would have been lower absent the fraud or misconduct, as determined by the Board. In addition, HPE's equity grant agreements and employee agreements regarding confidential information and proprietary developments provide that incentive and equity awards are subject to clawback, cancellation, or other appropriate treatment if the recipient engages in misconduct that is prohibited by applicable law or HPE policy, or if clawback is otherwise required by applicable law or HPE policy. 
      FISCAL 2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAM         
The HRC Committee approved a fiscal 2019 compensation structure that continues to align our executives with stockholder interests and drive our business strategy.
Corporate-level Section 16 Officers will continue to be measured at the corporate level, while the Section 16 Officers who are Business Segment Presidents will continue to be measured at the business level. While the maximum total payout continues to be 200% of target, each individual financial metric may fund up to 200% of target, reduced from 250% of target in prior years. MBOs will continue to be a modifier of financial results, and will be based on pre-established performance goals that support our business strategy. The potential MBO outcome will shift from a 20% increase or 20% decrease, to an outcome that may range between a 20% increase and 20% decrease. 
In fiscal 2019, the HRC Committee will continue its ongoing evaluation of the overall compensation system to ensure that it best supports the Company's talent needs, rewards management for the successful execution of operating goals and the long-term vision associated with the recently completed portfolio restructuring, and aligns pay with stockholder interests and strong governance standards. 
      HPE'S FISCAL 2018 CEO TRANSITION         
As previously disclosed in our 2018 proxy, Ms. Whitman and the Board mutually agreed that her retirement date would be effective as of February 1, 2018, and that she would become a non-employee director on HPE's Board following her retirement as CEO. Ms. Whitman's fiscal 2018 base salary remained unchanged from fiscal 2017 for the duration of her tenure as CEO, and she did not participate in HPE's fiscal 2018 annual or long-term incentive programs as a result of her impending retirement from the Company. 
In conjunction with the equity modifications that were approved in May 2016 by the independent members of the Board, all unvested equity held by Ms. Whitman as of May 24, 2016, vested in full upon her retirement. Based on HPE's standard retirement treatment of equity awards, Ms. Whitman's RSUs granted after May 24, 2016, continue to vest in full based on their original vesting schedule.

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Executive compensation (CD&A) 
Ms. Whitman's PCSOs granted after May 24, 2016 received pro rata vesting treatment as a result of her retirement and the achievement of the associated performance conditions prior to the forfeiture dates. See the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" table for further details. 
Upon the appointment to CEO effective February 1, 2018, Mr. Neri's base salary increased to $1 million with a target annual incentive of 150%. Mr. Neri's fiscal 2018 annual equity award in the amount of $9 million reflected his appointment to CEO. Additionally, Mr. Neri's total target compensation upon promotion was conservatively positioned below the median of our peers, with the intent to bring him into closer alignment within a reasonable period of time as Mr. Neri gains experience in the CEO role, subject to business and individual performance, as well as other factors. 
      ACCOUNTING AND TAX EFFECTS         
The impact of accounting treatment is considered in developing and implementing our compensation programs, including the accounting treatment as it applies to amounts awarded or paid to our executives. 
The impact of federal tax laws on our compensation programs is also considered, including the deductibility of compensation paid to the NEOs, as limited by Code Section 162(m). Historically, our compensation program was designed with the intention that compensation paid in various forms may be eligible to qualify for deductibility under Code Section 162(m), but there have been and may be other exceptions for administrative or other reasons. In addition, the recent elimination of the performance-based compensation exception under Code Section 162(m) as a result of the recent enactment of the so-called "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017" will have an effect on the tax deductibility of our future compensation programs.

table 2018. As of October 31, 2017, the assumptions included a discount rate of 1.92% and mortality in accordance with the AG forecast table 2016. The earliest unreduced retirement age in the Nederland Plan is age 67. Due to his transfer from the Netherlands to the U.S. at the request of the Company, Mr. Neri is also covered under the IRG. As of October 31, 2018, the present value of IRG benefits is based on a discount rate of 4.26%, lump sum interest rates of 3.21% for the first five years, 4.26% for the next 15 years and 4.55% thereafter, and applicable mortality. As of October 31, 2017, the assumptions included a discount rate of 3.34%, lump sum interest rates of 1.96% for the first five years, 3.58% for the next 15 years and 4.35% thereafter, and applicable mortality. The earliest unreduced retirement age for the IRG based on Mr. Neri's employment history is age 65. 
      NARRATIVE TO THE FISCAL 2018 PENSION BENEFITS TABLE       
HPE does not sponsor any qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plans and only participates in one nonqualified U.S. defined benefit retirement plan for selected international transfers. As a result, no NEO currently accrues a benefit under any U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan. Benefits previously accrued by an NEO under non-U.S. HPE pension plans are payable to them following termination of employment, subject to the terms of the applicable plan. Mr. Neri, who is a participant in the nonqualified U.S. plan for international transfers, has the potential to accrue an additional benefit under the International Retirement Guarantee ("IRG"), but only in the event that HPE requires him to change the country of his employment. 
      TERMS OF THE NETHERLANDS PENSION PROGRAM       
Mr. Neri earned a pension benefit under a Netherlands pension program based on his final pay and years of service while employed by HP Inc. in the Netherlands. That pension plan considers a pensionable base which is salary less an offset; the offset reflects the Dutch social security benefits which do not vary with pay levels. The annual accrual that was provided when Mr. Neri participated was 1.75% of his final pensionable base. There is also a 70% spousal benefit provided upon his death while receiving retirement payments. The benefit under the Dutch pension plan is subject to an annual conditional indexation (there was 0.21% of indexation in fiscal 2018). In 2014, with Dutch law changes to extend unreduced retirement ages, all previously accrued benefits were converted to a pension commencing at age 67.

      TERMS OF THE INTERNATIONAL RETIREMENT GUARANTEE       
Employees who transferred internationally at HP Inc.'s request prior to 2000 were put into an international umbrella plan. This plan determines the country of guarantee which is generally the country in which an employee has spent the longest portion of his HP Inc. or HPE career. For Mr. Neri, the country of guarantee is currently the U.S. The IRG determines the present value of a full career benefit for Mr. Neri under the HP Inc. sponsored retirement benefit plans that applied to employees working in the U.S. prior to the separation of HPE from HP Inc., and to the HPE 401(k) Plan after the separation, and U.S. Social Security (since the U.S. is his country of guarantee) then offsets the present value of the retirement benefits from plans and social insurance systems in the countries in which he earned retirement benefits for his total period of HP Inc. and HPE employment. The net benefit value is payable as a single sum as soon as practicable after termination or retirement. This is a nonqualified retirement plan. 
We do not sponsor any other supplemental defined benefit pension plans or special retiree medical benefit plans for executive officers.

      NARRATIVE TO THE FISCAL 2018 NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION TABLE       
The amounts reported in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table were provided under the EDCP, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that permits eligible U.S. employees to defer base salary in excess of the amount taken into account under the qualified HPE 401(k) Plan and bonus amounts of up to 95% of the annual incentive bonus payable under the PfR program. In addition, a matching contribution is available under the plan to eligible employees. The matching contribution applies to base salary deferrals on compensation above the Code limit that applies to the qualified HPE 401(k) Plan up to a maximum of two times that compensation limit. In calendar year 2017, the NEOs were eligible for a matching contribution up to 3% on base salary contributions in excess of the Code limit up to a maximum of two times that limit (matching contributions were available on calendar year 2017 base salary from $270,000 to $540,000). In calendar year 2018, the NEOs were eligible for a matching contribution up to 4% on base salary contributions in excess of the Code limit up to a maximum of two times that limit (matching contributions were available on calendar year 2018 base salary from $275,000 to $550,000). In effect, the EDCP permits these executives and all eligible

employees to receive a 401(k)-type matching contribution on a portion of base salary deferrals in excess of Code limits. 
Upon becoming eligible for participation, employees must specify the amount of base salary and/or the percentage of annual incentives to be deferred, as well as the time and form of payment. If termination of employment occurs before retirement (defined under the EDCP as at least age 55 with 15 years of service), distribution is made in the form of a lump sum in January of the year following the year of termination, subject to any delay required under Code Section 409A. At retirement (or earlier, if properly elected), benefits are paid according to the distribution election made by the participant at the time of the deferral election subject to any delay required under Code Section 409A. No withdrawals are permitted prior to the previously elected distribution date, other than hardship withdrawals as permitted by applicable law. 
Amounts deferred or credited under the EDCP are credited with notional investment earnings based on participant investment elections made from among the investment options available under the HPE 401(k) Plan. Accounts maintained for participants under the EDCP are not held in trust, and all such accounts are subject to the claims of general creditors of HPE. No amounts are credited with above-market earnings.

       Potential payments upon termination or change in control       
The amounts in the following table generally estimate potential payments that would have been due if an NEO had terminated employment with HPE effective October 31, 2018, under each of the circumstances specified below. These amounts are in addition to benefits generally available to U.S. employees upon termination of employment, such as distributions from the HPE 401(k) Plan and payment of accrued vacation where required.

      NARRATIVE TO THE POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL TABLE       
This narrative reflects plans and provisions in effect as of October 31, 2018. In fiscal 2018, Section 16 Officers (including all of the NEOs) were covered by our Severance and Long-term Incentive Change in Control Plan for Executive Officers ("SPEO"), which is intended to protect HPE and its stockholders, and provide a level of transition assistance in the event of an involuntary termination of employment. Under the SPEO, participants who incur an involuntary termination, not for cause, and who execute a full release of claims following such termination, which release has not been revoked or attempted to be revoked, are eligible to receive severance benefits in an amount determined as a multiple of the sum of base salary and the average of the actual annual incentives (or, where applicable, payments under the sales incentive plan) paid for the preceding three years. In the case of the CEO, the multiplier is 2.0, and in the case of the NEOs other than the CEO, the multiplier is 1.5. In all cases, the SPEO benefit will not exceed 2.99 times the sum of the executive's base salary plus target annual incentive as in effect immediately prior to the termination of employment. 
In addition to the cash benefit, the participants in the SPEO were eligible to receive (1) a pro rata annual incentive award for the year of termination based on actual performance results, (2) pro rata vesting of unvested equity awards if any applicable performance conditions have been satisfied, and (3) a lump-sum health-benefit stipend in an amount equal to 18 months' COBRA premiums for continued group medical coverage for the executive and his or her eligible dependents, to the extent those premiums exceed 18 times the monthly premiums for active employees in the same plan with the same level of coverage as of the date of termination. 
      VOLUNTARY OR FOR "CAUSE" TERMINATION       
In general, an NEO who remained employed through October 31, 2018, but voluntarily terminated employment immediately thereafter, or was terminated immediately thereafter in a for "cause" termination, would be eligible to (1) receive his or her annual incentive amount earned for fiscal 2018 under the PfR program (subject to any discretionary downward adjustment or elimination by the HRC Committee prior to actual payment, and to any applicable clawback policy), (2) exercise his or her vested stock options up to three months following termination or by the original expiration date, if earlier, (3) receive a distribution of vested amounts deferred or credited under the EDCP, and (4) receive a distribution of his or her vested benefits, if any, under the HPE 401(k) Plan (and Mr. Neri would also be entitled to his pensions that are payable under the IRG and the pension programs available in the Netherlands). An NEO who terminated employment before October 31, 2018, either voluntarily or in a for "cause" termination, would generally not have been eligible to receive any amount under the PfR program with respect to the fiscal year in which the termination occurred, except that the HRC Committee has the discretion to make payment of prorated bonus amounts to individuals on leave of absence or in non-pay status, as well as in connection with certain voluntary severance incentives, workforce reductions, and similar programs.

      NOT FOR "CAUSE" TERMINATION       
A not for "cause" termination of an NEO who remained employed through October 31, 2018 and was terminated immediately thereafter would qualify the NEO for the amounts described above under a "voluntary" termination in addition to benefits under the SPEO if the NEO signs the required release of claims in favor of HPE and does not revoke that release. In addition to the cash severance benefits and pro rata equity awards payable under the SPEO, the NEO would be eligible to exercise vested stock options up to one year after termination or by the original expiration date, if earlier. The amounts shown for Messrs. Stonesifer and Gomez in the table above reflect their actual treatment as a result of their separation from the Company. 
      TERMINATION FOLLOWING A CHANGE IN CONTROL       
The SPEO provides for full accelerated vesting of outstanding stock options, RSUs, and PCSOs upon involuntary termination not for cause or voluntary termination for good reason (as defined in the SPEO) within 24 months after a change in control in which HPE is the survivor or the survivor assumes or replaces the equity awards ("double trigger"), with PARSUs vesting based on target performance. In situations where HPE is not the survivor and equity awards are not assumed by the surviving corporation, vesting will be automatically accelerated upon the change in control, with PARSUs vesting based upon the greater of the number of PARSUs that would vest based on actual performance and the number of PARSUs that would vest pro rata based upon target performance. 
      DEATH OR DISABILITY TERMINATIONS       
An NEO who continued employment through October 31, 2018, and whose employment was terminated immediately thereafter due to death or disability would be eligible to (1) receive his or her full annual incentive amount earned for fiscal 2018 determined by HPE in its sole discretion, (2) receive a distribution of vested amounts deferred or credited under the EDCP, and (3) receive a distribution of his or her vested benefits under the HPE 401(k) Plan and any HP Inc. pension plans. 
Upon termination due to death or disability, stock options, RSUs, and PCSOs held by the NEO would vest in full without regard to the satisfaction of applicable performance conditions. PARSUs held by the NEO will vest in full at the target amount. If the termination was due to disability, stock options and PCSOs must be exercised within three years of termination or by the original expiration date, if earlier. If the termination was due to death, stock options and PCSOs must be exercised within one year of termination or by the original expiration date, if earlier. 
      HPE RETIREMENT ARRANGEMENTS       
Upon retirement on or after age 55, with age plus years of service totaling at least 70 at the time of termination, HPE employees in the United States are entitled to the benefits described below. For equity awards granted after November 1, 2016, if retirement occurs three months or more after the grant date, employees receive full vesting of time-vested options and time-vested RSUs. These awards will continue vesting on the original vesting schedule, and those options would remain exercisable up to three years after retirement, or the original expiration date, if earlier. To the extent retirement occurs within three months after the grant date, such awards will be immediately forfeited. PCSOs are subject to pro rata vesting on retirement, subject to attaining the stock price performance goals. PARSUs granted on or after December 7, 2017, if any, are paid on a full-vesting basis to retired participants at the end of the performance period, subject to final performance. Bonuses, if any, under the annual incentive program may be paid in prorated amounts at the discretion of the HRC Committee based on actual results. If required in accordance with Code Section 409A, certain amounts payable upon retirement (or other termination of employment) of the NEOs and other key employees will not be paid out for at least six months following termination of employment. 
The HPE-sponsored U.S. retiree medical program, for which our NEOs may be eligible, provides eligible retirees with access to coverage at group rates only, with no direct subsidy provided by HPE. All NEOs could be eligible for this program if they retire from HPE on or after age 55 with at least ten years of qualifying service or a combination of age plus years of service totaling at least 80. In addition, beginning at age 45, eligible U.S. employees may

participate in the HPE Retirement Medical Savings Account Plan (the "RMSA"), under which participants are eligible to receive HPE matching credits of up to $1,200 per year, beginning at age 45, and provided that the employee's most recent hire date with HP Inc., was prior to August 1, 2008, up to a lifetime maximum of $12,000, which can be used to cover the cost of such retiree medical coverage (or other qualifying medical expenses) if the employee retires from HPE on or after age 55 with at least ten years of qualifying service or a combination of age plus years of service totaling at least 80. Mr. Neri is the only NEO currently eligible for the HPE matching credits under the RMSA. However, Mr. Neri is not contributing to an RMSA and is therefore not receiving matching credits. 
      CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) PAY RATIO       
For fiscal 2018, the median annual total compensation of all employees of HPE (other than our CEO) was $65,652. The annual total compensation of our current CEO was $12,623,005. Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median annual total compensation of all employees was approximately 192 to 1. 
We identified the "median employee" by using the following methodology and material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates (consistent with all applicable SEC rules):

      Audit Committee composition       
The Audit Committee of Hewlett Packard Enterprise is composed of four directors, Michael J. Angelakis, Pamela L. Carter, Jean M. Hobby, and Mary Agnes Wilderotter. Mrs. Wilderotter serves as the Chair of the Audit Committee. Every member of the Audit Committee is independent and three, including the Chair, are audit experts. 
      Audit Committee oversight       
The purpose of the Audit Committee is to represent and assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibilities for generally overseeing our financial reporting process and financial statements, as well as compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence, the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm, and risk assessment and risk management. The Audit Committee, at its discretion, may request a review of any issue it deems necessary to ensure the integrity of the Company's financial statements, adherence to regulatory requirements, or adherence with the Company's ERM program. The Audit Committee has the authority to obtain advice and assistance from outside legal, accounting or other advisors as the Audit Committee deems necessary to carry out its duties and receives appropriate funding, as determined by the Audit Committee, from Hewlett Packard Enterprise for such advice and assistance. 
A more expansive listing of the Audit Committee's duties and responsibilities can be found in the Audit Committee Charter, which is reviewed annually by the NGSR Committee and available at:  http://investors.hpe.com/~/media/Files/H/HP-Enterprise-IR/documents/committees/audit-committee-charter-october2015.pdf.  
      Selection and oversight of external auditor       
The Audit Committee appoints, compensates, oversees, and manages Hewlett Packard Enterprise's relationship with its independent registered public accounting firm (which reports directly to the Audit Committee). Ernst & Young LLP, has served as Hewlett Packard Enterprise's independent registered public accounting firm since the company's inception in November 2015. 
In reviewing and approving audit and non-audit service fees, the Audit Committee considers a number of factors including scope and quality of work, as well as an assessment of impact on auditor independence of non-audit fees and services. 
In selecting HPE's independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee conducts an assessment of the firm's qualifications and performance; the quality and candor of their communications with the Audit Committee and the Company; and our auditor's independence, objectivity, and professionalism. 
      Committee meetings       
The Audit Committee disposes of its duties through a series of regularly-scheduled meetings, including dedicated meetings to review quarterly earnings releases and financial filings with the SEC, and regular communications from the Company on material risk oversight matters. At least six Audit Committee meetings are held each year. During fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee met a total of 11 times. The Audit Committee reviews and discusses a number of different topics and items of business in meetings including, but not limited to, annual risk management overviews, cyber security, internal audit matters, Sarbanes-Oxley 404 plan matters, ethics and compliance trends and matters, earnings releases, auditor updates, required disclosures, and business segment specific risk reviews. Management, internal audit, and EY are invited to attend committee meetings and present on these topics as well as internal and external audit plans and budget forecasts. 
The Audit Committee regularly meets in separate executive sessions at which only members are present and in private sessions with each of management, the internal auditors, and the independent registered public accounting firm. During fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee held seven executive sessions, six private sessions with management, seven private sessions with the head of internal audit, and seven private sessions with EY.

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Questions and answers 
14.  What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?  
Most of our stockholders hold their shares through a broker, trustee or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially. 
15.  Who is entitled to vote and how many shares can I vote?  
Each holder of shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on February 4, 2019, the record date for the annual meeting, is entitled to cast one vote per share on all items being voted upon at the annual meeting. You may vote all shares owned by you as of this time, including (1) shares held directly in your name as the stockholder of record, including shares purchased through our dividend reinvestment program and employee stock purchase plans, and shares held through our Direct Registration Service; and (2) shares held for you as the beneficial owner through a broker, trustee or other nominee. 
On the record date, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company had approximately 1,376,962,202 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 
16.  How can I vote my shares during the annual meeting?  
This year's annual meeting will be held entirely online to allow greater participation. Stockholders may participate in the annual meeting by visiting the following website: 
HPE.onlineshareholdermeeting.com
To participate in the annual meeting, you will need the 16-digit control number included on your notice of Internet availability of the proxy materials, on your proxy card or on the instructions that accompanied your proxy materials. 
Shares held in your name as the stockholder of record may be voted electronically during the annual meeting. Shares for which you are the beneficial owner but not the stockholder of record also may be voted electronically during the annual meeting, except that shares held in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise 401(k) Plan cannot be voted electronically during the annual meeting. If you hold shares in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise 401(k) Plan, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on March 29, 2019 for the trustee to vote your shares. However, holders of shares in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise 401(k) Plan will still be able to view the annual meeting webcast and ask questions during the annual meeting. 
Even if you plan to participate in the annual meeting online, we recommend that you also vote by proxy as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to participate in the annual meeting. 
17.  How can I vote my shares without participating in the annual meeting?  
Whether you hold shares directly as the stockholder of record or through a broker, trustee or other nominee as the beneficial owner, you may direct how your shares are voted without participating in the annual meeting. There are three ways to vote by proxy:

Table of Contents
2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Questions and answers e-mail. Stockholders who have received a paper copy of a proxy card or voting instruction card by mail may submit proxies over the Internet by following the instructions on the proxy card or voting instruction card. 
18.  What is the deadline for voting my shares?  
If you hold shares as the stockholder of record, or through the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), your vote by proxy must be received before the polls close during the annual meeting. 
If you hold shares in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 401(k) Plan, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on March 29, 2019 for the trustee to vote your shares. 
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held through a broker, trustee or other nominee, please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, trustee or nominee. 
19.  May I change my vote or revoke my proxy?  
You may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time prior to the vote during the annual meeting, except that any change to your voting instructions for shares held in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 401(k) Plan must be provided by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on March 29, 2019 as described above. 
If you are the stockholder of record, you may change your vote by: (1) granting a new proxy bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy); (2) providing a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary at the address below in Question 34 prior to your shares being voted; or (3) voting your shares electronically during the annual meeting. Participation in the annual meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically make that request. For shares you hold beneficially in the name of a broker, trustee or other nominee, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, trustee or nominee, or by participating in the meeting and electronically voting your shares during the meeting (except that shares held in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise 401(k) Plan cannot be voted electronically at the annual meeting). 
20.  Is my vote confidential?  
Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed, either within Hewlett Packard Enterprise or to third parties, except: (1) as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements; (2) to allow for the tabulation of votes and certification of the vote; and (3) to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation. Occasionally, stockholders provide written comments on their proxy card, which are then forwarded to management. 
21.  How are votes counted, and what effect do abstentions and broker non-votes have on the proposals?  
In the election of directors, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" with respect to each

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Questions and answers of the nominees. If you elect to abstain in the election of directors, the abstention will not impact the election of directors. In tabulating the voting results for the election of directors, only "FOR" and "AGAINST" votes are counted. 
For all items of business, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." If you elect to abstain, the abstention will have the same effect as an "AGAINST" vote. 
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in the name of a broker, trustee or other nominee and do not provide that broker, trustee or other nominee with voting instructions, your shares may constitute "broker non-votes." Generally, broker non-votes occur on a matter when a broker is not permitted to vote on that matter without instructions from the beneficial owner and instructions are not given. Under the NYSE rules, brokers, trustees or other nominees may generally vote on routine matters but cannot vote on non-routine matters. Only Proposal No. 2 (ratifying the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm) is considered a routine matter. The other proposals are not considered routine matters, and without your instructions, your broker cannot vote your shares. In tabulating the voting results for any particular proposal, shares that constitute broker non-votes are not considered, votes cast or entitled to vote on that proposal. Thus, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any matter being voted on at the meeting. 
If you provide specific instructions with regard to certain items, your shares will be voted as you instruct on such items. If you vote by proxy card or voting instruction card and sign the card without giving specific instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board (FOR all of our nominees to the Board, FOR ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, FOR the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, and AGAINST the stockholder proposal related to action by written consent of stockholders. 
For any shares you hold in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise 401(k) Plan, if your voting instructions are not received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on March 29, 2019, your shares will be voted in proportion to the way the shares held by the other Hewlett Packard Enterprise 401(k) Plan participants are voted, except as may be otherwise required by law. 
22.  What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals?  
In the election of directors, each director will be elected by the vote of the majority of votes cast with respect to that director nominee. A majority of votes cast means that the number of votes cast for a nominee's election must exceed the number of votes cast against such nominee's election. Each nominee receiving more votes "FOR" his or her election than votes "AGAINST" his or her election will be elected. Approval of each of the other proposals requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on that proposal at the annual meeting.

        Stockholder proposals, director nominations and related Bylaws provisions       
34.  What is the deadline to propose actions (other than director nominations) for consideration at next year's annual meeting of stockholders?  
You may submit proposals for consideration at future stockholder meetings. For a stockholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement for the annual meeting next year, the Corporate Secretary must receive the written proposal at our principal executive offices no later than October 16, 2019. Such proposals also must comply with SEC regulations under Rule 14a-8 regarding the inclusion of stockholder proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials. Proposals should be addressed to: 
Corporate Secretary  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company  6280 America Center Drive  San Jose, California 95002  Fax: (650) 857-4837  bod-hpe@hpe.com
For a stockholder proposal that is not intended to be included in our proxy statement for next year's annual meeting under Rule 14a-8, the stockholder must provide the information required by our Bylaws and give timely notice to the Corporate Secretary in accordance with our Bylaws, which, in general, require that the notice be received by the Corporate Secretary:
If the date of the stockholder meeting is moved more than 30 days before or 60 days after the anniversary of our annual meeting for the prior year, then notice of a stockholder proposal that is not intended to be included in our proxy statement under Rule 14a-8 must be received no earlier than the close of business 120 days prior to the meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the following two dates:

2019 notice and proxy statement â€” Questions and answers 
35.  How may I recommend individuals to serve as directors and what is the deadline for a director recommendation?  
You may recommend director candidates for consideration by the NGSR Committee. Any uch recommendations should include verification of the stockholder status of the person submitting the recommendation and the nominee's name and qualifications for Board membership and should be directed to the Corporate Secretary at the address of our principal executive offices set forth in Question 34 above. See "Proposal No. 1â€”Election of Directorsâ€”Director Nominee Experience and Qualifications" for more information regarding our Board membership criteria. 
A stockholder may send a recommended director candidate's name and information to the Board at any time. Generally, such proposed candidates are considered at the first or second Board meeting prior to the issuance of the proxy statement for our annual meeting. 
36.  How may I nominate individuals to serve as directors and what are the deadlines for a director nomination?  
Our Bylaws permit stockholders to nominate directors for consideration at an annual meeting. To nominate a director for consideration at an annual meeting (but not for inclusion in our proxy statement), a nominating stockholder must provide the information required by our Bylaws and give timely notice of the nomination to the Corporate Secretary in accordance with our Bylaws, and each nominee must meet the qualifications required by our Bylaws. To nominate a director for consideration at next year's annual meeting, in general the notice must be received by the Corporate Secretary between the close of business on December 5, 2019 and the close of business on January 4, 2020, unless the annual meeting is moved by more than 30 days before or 60 days after the anniversary of the prior year's annual meeting, in which case the deadline will be as described in Question 34 above. 
In addition, our Bylaws provide that under certain circumstances, a stockholder or group of stockholders may include director candidates that they have nominated in our annual meeting proxy statement. These proxy access provisions of our Bylaws provide, among other things, that a stockholder or group of up to twenty stockholders seeking to include director candidates in our annual meeting proxy statement must own 3% or more of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's outstanding common stock continuously for at least the previous three years. The number of stockholder-nominated candidates appearing in any annual meeting proxy statement cannot exceed 20% of the number of directors then serving on the Board. If 20% is not a whole number, the maximum number of stockholder-nominated candidates would be the closest whole number below 20%. Based on the current Board size of 13 directors, the maximum number of proxy access candidates that we would be required to include in our proxy materials for an annual meeting is two. Nominees submitted under the proxy access procedures that are later withdrawn or are included in the proxy materials as Board-nominated candidates will be counted in determining whether the 20% maximum has been reached. If the number of stockholder-nominated candidates exceeds 20%, each nominating stockholder or group of stockholders may select one nominee for inclusion in our proxy materials until the maximum number is reached. The order of selection would be determined by the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock held by each nominating stockholder or group of stockholders. The nominating stockholder or group of stockholders also must deliver the information required by our Bylaws, and each nominee must meet the qualifications required by our Bylaws. Requests to include stockholder-nominated candidates in our proxy materials for next year's annual meeting must be received by the Corporate Secretary:
