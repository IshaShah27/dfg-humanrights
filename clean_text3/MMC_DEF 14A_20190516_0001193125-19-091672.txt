Stockholder Engagement 
In 2011, we expanded the breadth and consistency of our stockholder engagement. In each of the past five years, we have engaged with institutional stockholders holding approximately 25% to 45% of the Company's common stock. Discussions with stockholders cover corporate governance, executive compensation and environmental and social topics. Feedback received during the stockholder engagement process is shared with senior executives, the Board and its committees. We are committed to ongoing engagement with our stockholders and intend to continue these outreach efforts. 
Risk Oversight 
It is the responsibility of the Company's senior management to assess and manage our exposure to risk and to bring to the Board's attention the most material risks facing the Company. The Board oversees risk management directly and through its committees. 
Annually, the Board reviews management's assessment of the Company's key enterprise risks. Senior management then briefs the Board on its strategy with respect to each risk and provides a mid-year status update and a report at year-end. The Board receives updates from management on specific risks throughout the year, including on human capital management and cybersecurity. 
The Audit Committee regularly reviews the Company's policies and practices with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including cybersecurity risk. The Directors and Governance Committee considers risks relating to CEO succession planning, and the Compensation Committee considers risks relating to the design of executive compensation programs and arrangements. See the discussion under "Committees" on page 11 for additional information about the Board's committees. 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Oversight and Activities 
With the creation of the Corporate Responsibility Committee in 2008, the Board has formally focused on key aspects of the Company's environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives for more than a decade. In 2018, the Company formed a cross-functional management committee to coordinate and communicate on the Company's ESG initiatives. Our Corporate Citizenship Report and related information is available on our website at http://www.mmc.com/esg. 
The Board oversees the Company's ESG initiatives and strategies primarily through its committees. 
Corporate Responsibility Committee.  The Corporate Responsibility Committee has responsibility for sustainability, diversity and inclusion and social responsibility, as well as corporate communications and government relations. It includes members from each of the Board's other committees. The Corporate Responsibility Committee receives reports at least annually on environmental matters from the Company's Chief Sustainability Officer and on diversity and inclusion and social responsibility matters from the Company's Chief Human Resources Officer. 
Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee has responsibility to review certain key human resource strategic activities, including those relating to diversity, training and recruitment. The Compensation Committee coordinates with the Corporate Responsibility Committee on diversity initiatives and receives annual reports on diversity and inclusion from the Company's Chief Human Resources Officer. 
Directors and Governance Committee.  The Directors and Governance Committee takes a leadership role in shaping the Company's corporate governance principles and practices. It receives regular updates on governance practices and developments from the Company's General Counsel. 
Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee has responsibility for the Company's policies, systems and controls designed to promote ethical behavior and compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. It receives regular updates from the Company's Chief Compliance Officer.

Following each committee meeting, the respective committee chair reports on the meeting to the full Board. See the discussion under "Committees" on page 11 for additional information about the Board's committees. 
Management ESG Committee.  In 2018, a committee was formed with members drawn from across the Company to coordinate and communicate on the Company's ESG initiatives. The committee is comprised of colleagues from Legal, Compliance, Human Resources, Corporate Social Responsibility, Investor Relations, Communications and Government Relations. Members of the committee include the Company's Deputy General Counsel, Corporate Secretary & Chief Compliance Officer, the secretaries to the Board's committees, the Company's Chief Sustainability Officer, the Company's Head of Corporate Responsibility, as well as other colleagues who support the Company's ESG initiatives. 
Codes of Conduct 
Our reputation is fundamental to our business. The Company's directors and officers and other colleagues are expected to act ethically at all times. To provide guidance in this regard, the Company has adopted a Code of Conduct, The Greater Good, which applies to all of our directors, officers and other colleagues. Additionally, The Greater Good requires the Company's agents, subcontractors and suppliers to comply with relevant aspects of our compliance policies. The dissemination of The Greater Good to the Company's colleagues includes comprehensive training and communication. In 2016, there was a campaign requiring colleagues to recertify their commitment to The Greater Good. Each year, the Company's directors and senior executives certify their commitment to The Greater Good. The Company has also adopted an additional Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, which applies to our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and controller. Both of these codes are posted on the Company's website at http://www.mmc.com and print copies are available to any stockholder upon request. We will disclose any amendments to, or waivers of, the Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers on our website within four business days. 
CEO Succession Planning and Succession Planning for Senior Executives 
The Board believes that planning for CEO succession is one of its most important responsibilities. CEO succession planning is regularly discussed at Board meetings and in executive sessions. The Board, taking into account the recommendations of the Directors and Governance Committee, approves and maintains a succession plan for the CEO. At least annually, independent directors meet with the CEO to discuss potential successors. In addition, a confidential procedure is maintained for the timely and efficient transfer of the CEO's responsibilities in the event of an emergency or his sudden incapacitation or departure. 
The Board also believes that planning for succession below the CEO level is a key responsibility. The CEO periodically reviews with the independent directors the performance of senior executives and any succession issues related to those individuals. The Compensation Committee has responsibility for reviewing the Company's executive talent review process for senior executives. Every year, the Compensation Committee reviews succession plans for direct reports to the CEO and other key executive positions. 
Directors engage with senior executives and others at Board and committee meetings and in less formal settings to allow directors to personally assess potential candidates for CEO and senior executive roles. 
Director Recruitment, Nomination and Succession Planning 
The Board, taking into account the recommendation of the Directors and Governance Committee, is responsible for nominating a slate of director candidates for election at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders. 
DIRECTOR RECRUITMENT 
The Board has delegated to the Directors and Governance Committee the authority to identify, consider and recommend to the Board potential new director candidates and to engage one or more search firms to assist the Committee in that regard. The Directors and Governance Committee reviews with the Board periodically the skills and characteristics to be sought in any new director candidates. In evaluating the skills and characteristics to be sought in new director candidates, the Directors and Governance Committee considers, among other factors, the criteria described under "Director Qualifications" on page 8 and the skills and experiences shown in the "Director Skills and Experience" matrix on page 9. In its recruitment process, the Directors and Governance Committee and the Board seek to reflect gender, racial and ethnic diversity in the pool of director candidates.

DIRECTOR NOMINATION PROCESS 
As part of the process for nominating director candidates, the Board evaluates each individual director in the context of the Board as a whole, with the objective of recommending a group that can best support the success of our business and represent stockholder interests. The Directors and Governance Committee may consider recommendations for director candidates from search firms, other directors and stockholders. In deciding whether to nominate an incumbent director for re-election, the Board considers many factors, including the criteria described under "Director Qualifications" on page 8, such as gender, racial and ethnic diversity, as well as his or her length of service and performance on the Board. 
DIRECTOR SUCCESSION PLANNING 
The Board is committed to effective succession planning. The Directors and Governance Committee has responsibility to review the composition and structure of the Board as a whole, taking into account such factors as the Board's current mix and diversity of skills, backgrounds and experiences, and to make recommendations to the Board as appropriate. In its review of Board composition, the Directors and Governance Committee considers succession planning in light of factors such as skills needed and upcoming retirements and other potential departures. 
Director Orientation and Continuing Education 
All new directors participate in an orientation program throughout their first year on the Board to familiarize them with the Company's business, strategy, finances, policies, corporate governance practices and culture. The orientation program includes in-person meetings with the Company's senior executives and comprehensive background materials. Directors are provided training on our code of conduct, The Greater Good. Thereafter, each director certifies annually that he or she has read it and agrees to abide by its policies and practices. Additional orientation sessions with key advisors are provided for Audit and Compensation Committee members. Orientation sessions are tailored upon request to meet directors' needs and interests. 
Directors are also encouraged to participate in continuing education programs. Continuing education programs may be part of regular Board or committee meetings or third-party presentations. Additionally, the Company pays for directors to have access to third-party resources that provide updates on issues and programs relevant to public companies and their directors. 
Director Independence 
The Board has determined that all directors other than Mr. Glaser are independent under the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") listed company rules and the standards set forth in the Governance Guidelines. Therefore, the Board has satisfied the objective, set forth in the Governance Guidelines, that a substantial majority of the Company's directors be independent of management. 
For a director to be considered independent, the Board must affirmatively determine that the director has no direct or indirect material relationship with the Company. The Board has established standards to assist it in making determinations of director independence. These standards conform to, or are more exacting than, the independence requirements provided in the NYSE listed company rules. The Company's director independence standards are set forth as Annex A to our Governance Guidelines. 
All members of the Audit, Compensation and Directors and Governance Committees must be independent directors under the NYSE listed company rules and the standards set forth in the Company's Governance Guidelines. Members of the Audit Committee must also satisfy a separate Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and NYSE independence requirement, which provides that they may not be affiliates and may not accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the Company or any of its subsidiaries, other than their directors' compensation. The Board evaluated each member of the Compensation Committee under the additional NYSE compensation committee member independence standards and also determined that these members qualify as "non-employee directors" (as defined under Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and as "outside directors" (as defined in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code). 
Under our Governance Guidelines, if a director whom the Board has deemed independent has a change in circumstances or relationships that might cause the Board to reconsider that determination, he or she must immediately notify the chairman of the Board and the chair of the Directors and Governance Committee.

Review of Related Person Transactions 
The Company maintains a written Policy Regarding Related Person Transactions, which sets forth standards and procedures for the review and approval or ratification of transactions between the Company and related persons. The policy is administered by the Directors and Governance Committee with assistance from the Company's Corporate Secretary. 
In determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Directors and Governance Committee will review the facts and circumstances including: the commercial reasonableness of the transaction; the benefits of the transaction to the Company; the availability of other sources for the products or services involved in the transaction; the materiality and nature of the related person's direct or indirect interest in the transaction and the potential public perception of the transaction. The Directors and Governance Committee will approve or ratify a related person transaction only if the Committee determines that the related person transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
If the Directors and Governance Committee determines not to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the transaction will not be entered into or continued. No member of the Directors and Governance Committee will participate in any review or determination if the Committee member or any of his or her immediate family members is the related person. 
See the discussion under "Transactions with Management and Others" on page 70. 
Stockholder Nominations for Director Candidates 
Stockholders may recommend or nominate director candidates in writing to the Company's Corporate Secretary. All stockholder recommendations for director candidates are considered and they are evaluated in the same manner as other director candidates. Nominating stockholders must meet the requirements described in Article III of our bylaws. The notice of nomination must meet bylaw requirements, including as to timeliness and form, and be delivered to the Company's Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices: Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Attn: Directors and Governance Committee, c/o Katherine J. Brennan—Corporate Secretary, 1166 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036-2774. See the discussion under "Submission of Stockholder Proposals and Other Items of Business for 2020 Annual Meeting" on page 75. 
Director Election Voting Standard 
The Company's bylaws provide that, in an uncontested election of directors (i.e., where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected), a director nominee must receive more votes cast "for" than "against" his or her election in order to be elected to the Board. 
In connection with the Company's majority voting standard for director elections, the Board has adopted the following procedures, which are set forth more fully in Section E.3 of our Governance Guidelines:

Board Composition, Leadership and Size 
At the 2019 annual meeting, stockholders will vote on the election of twelve (12) directors. H. Edward Hanway currently serves as the Board's independent chairman. 
The only member of management who serves on the Board is Daniel S. Glaser, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. The position of chairman of the Board has been held by an independent director since 2005. The Board believes that this currently is the best leadership structure for the Company. 
Director Qualifications 
As provided in our Governance Guidelines, all directors must demonstrate the highest standards of ethics and integrity, must be independent thinkers with strong analytical ability and must be committed to representing all of the Company's stockholders rather than any particular interest group. In addition to these characteristics, our Governance Guidelines provide that each director candidate be evaluated by the Board against the following criteria: (1) the candidate's personal and professional reputation and background; (2) the candidate's industry knowledge; (3) the candidate's experience with businesses or other organizations comparable to the Company in terms of size or complexity; (4) the interplay of the candidate's skills and experience with those of the incumbent directors; (5) the extent to which the candidate would provide substantive expertise that is currently sought by the Board or any committees of the Board; (6) the candidate's ability to commit the time necessary to fulfill a director's responsibilities; (7) relevant legal and regulatory requirements and evolving best practices in corporate governance; (8) the gender, racial, ethnic and cultural diversity of each potential candidate and (9) any other criteria the Board deems appropriate.

Board Diversity 
We are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive Board. Of our twelve directors, five (42%) are diverse, including two women. 
Our Governance Guidelines specify that the gender, racial, ethnic and cultural diversity of each potential director candidate be considered by the Board. In its recruitment process, the Directors and Governance Committee and the Board seek to reflect gender, race and ethnic diversity in the pool of director candidates. The Directors and Governance Committee and the Board also consider gender, race and ethnic diversity in the director nomination process. 
Board Refreshment 
The Board is committed to effective succession planning and refreshment. Two directors have joined since 2016, enhancing the Board's breadth and depth of experience and diversity. The average tenure of our directors is nine years. In deciding whether to nominate an incumbent director for re-election, the Board considers many factors, including tenure. The Board believes that a variety of director tenures provides fresh perspectives and valuable insight developed over time into the Company's operations. 
Retirement 
Our Governance Guidelines require our independent directors to resign no later than at the annual meeting of stockholders following their 75th birthday. Any director who is an employee of the Company will resign from the Board when his or her employment ends. 
Attendance
The Board held eleven meetings, including telephonic meetings, during 2018. All directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and committees on which they served. The Board's policy is to have all directors attend the annual meetings of stockholders. All of our directors were present at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. 
Executive Sessions 
Our independent directors meet in executive session without management at regularly scheduled in-person Board meetings. In 2018, they held six executive sessions, which were presided over by the independent chairman of the Board. In addition, the members of the Audit, Compensation and Directors and Governance Committees meet in executive session without management at regularly scheduled in-person committee meetings. 
Board and Committee Evaluations 
The Directors and Governance Committee oversees an annual evaluation of the Board's performance and effectiveness. The evaluation focuses on the Board's contribution to the Company over the preceding year, including areas in which the Board or management believes the Board could enhance its future contributions. Each year, the Directors and Governance Committee reviews and considers the self-evaluation for the upcoming year. 
As part of the Board's self-evaluation process, each director completes a questionnaire soliciting quantitative ratings and qualitative commentary. Recent changes to the self-evaluation include beginning the questionnaire with open-ended questions and expanding qualitative feedback. The questionnaire solicits directors' views on topics such as: 
The responses to the questionnaire are compiled on an unattributed basis and are discussed by the Board in executive session. Based on the evaluation results, changes in practices or procedures are considered and, as appropriate, implemented. More generally, directors are encouraged to make suggestions at any time for improving the Board's practices. 
In addition, each of the Audit, Compensation and Directors and Governance Committees evaluates its own performance annually pursuant to their respective charters. Each Committee's self-evaluation is conducted in an executive session and includes an assessment of its fulfillment of its responsibilities under its charter and our Governance Guidelines.

The Audit Committee selects, oversees and approves, pursuant to a pre-approval policy, all services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm reports to the Audit Committee. 
All members of the Audit Committee are "financially literate," as required by the NYSE and determined by the Board. The Board has determined that Anthony K. Anderson, Bruce P. Nolop, Marc D. Oken and Lloyd M. Yates have the requisite qualifications to satisfy the SEC definition of "audit committee financial expert." 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE 
The primary responsibilities of the Compensation Committee are to: 
Meeting Schedule.   The Compensation Committee met six times in 2018, including a special meeting in February to complete its annual review of, and make decisions on, executive compensation. Decisions relating to significant matters are usually presented to the Compensation Committee and discussed at more than one meeting to allow for full consideration of the implications and possible alternatives before a final decision is made. The Compensation Committee receives support from its independent compensation consultant and the Company's management, including the Company's human resources staff, as described below. At each of its meetings, the Compensation Committee meets in executive session and without management present. The independent compensation consultant attends portions of the executive sessions. 
The Compensation Committee may delegate all or a portion of its duties and responsibilities to the chair of the Compensation Committee or a subcommittee of the Compensation Committee. If necessary, the chair is authorized to take action on behalf of the Compensation Committee between its regularly scheduled meetings, within prescribed guidelines. If any such action is taken, the chair reports such action to the Compensation Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
Independent Compensation Consultant.   The Compensation Committee has engaged Pay Governance LLC as its independent compensation consultant to support the Compensation Committee in performing its duties and to provide analysis and make recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding our executive compensation program. The independent compensation consultant reports directly to the Compensation Committee and provides advice and analysis solely to the Compensation Committee. The independent compensation consultant supports the Compensation Committee by: 
The Compensation Committee requested and received advice from the independent compensation consultant with respect to all significant matters addressed by the Compensation Committee during 2018. Except for the services provided to the Board, neither the individual compensation consultant nor Pay Governance LLC nor any of its affiliates provided any services to the Company or its affiliates in 2018. 
The Compensation Committee assessed the work of Pay Governance LLC during 2018 pursuant to SEC rules and concluded that Pay Governance's work did not raise any conflict of interest. 
Company Management.   The Company's management, including the Company's human resources staff, supports the Compensation Committee by:

In addition, our President and Chief Executive Officer provides recommendations with respect to the compensation of our other senior executives. 
Our President and Chief Executive Officer, senior members of the Company's human resources staff and internal legal counsel attended Compensation Committee meetings when invited but were not present for executive sessions or for any discussion of their own compensation. 
Timing and Procedures of Equity-Based Compensation Awards.   Annual awards under our LTI compensation program are approved at a prescheduled meeting of the Compensation Committee each February and, consistent with our historical practice, are granted on that same date. 
In addition, the Compensation Committee periodically grants restricted stock unit awards to newly hired senior executives and to continuing senior executives for increased responsibilities that accompany changes in position and for retention purposes. These awards are approved at prescheduled meetings of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has also authorized our President and Chief Executive Officer to make such awards to individuals who are not senior executives, subject to prescribed parameters. These awards are granted on the first calendar day of the month following approval of the award by the Compensation Committee or our President and Chief Executive Officer, as applicable. In the event that an award is approved prior to an individual's start date with the Company, the award will be granted on the first calendar day of the first month on or following the individual's start date; however, if an award is approved contingent on the award recipient providing documentation supporting the forfeiture of compensation from a former employer and that documentation has not been provided as of the individual's start date, the award will be granted on the first calendar day of the month following the provision of such documentation and acceptance by the Company. 
Typically, equity-based awards are denominated as a dollar value and then converted into a number of performance stock units, restricted stock units or stock options. The number of performance stock units or restricted stock units is determined based on the grant date fair value of the Company's common stock, which is defined as the average of the high and low trading prices of the Company's common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the grant date. The number of stock options is determined based on the grant date fair value of a stock option to purchase a share of the Company's common stock. The grant date fair value of stock options is determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ("FASB ASC Topic 718"). Stock options have an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low trading prices of the Company's common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the grant date. We believe that our equity-based compensation grant procedures effectively protect against the manipulation of grant timing for employee gain. 
The Company's human resources staff regularly monitors, and updates the Compensation Committee on, the use of shares of the Company's common stock for equity-based awards and the number of shares available for future awards under our equity-based compensation plans. As part of the process of granting annual LTI compensation, the Compensation Committee considers share use and equity run rate (as defined in "2018 Highlights" on page 24) so that annual LTI awards, and the extent to which shares of the Company's common stock are used for those awards, are maintained at a reasonable level. 
DIRECTORS AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE 
The Directors and Governance Committee's duties and responsibilities include, among other things:

FINANCE COMMITTEE 
The Finance Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the Board concerning, among other matters, the Company's capital structure, capital management and methods of corporate finance (including proposed issuances of securities or other financing transactions) and proposed acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions. 
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY COMMITTEE 
The Corporate Responsibility Committee's purpose is to create value for our stakeholders by enhancing the Company's reputation, business position and colleague engagement. In particular, the Corporate Responsibility Committee focuses on government relations, corporate communications, social responsibility, diversity and inclusion and sustainability. The Corporate Responsibility Committee receives at least annual updates on sustainability, environmental matters, social responsibility and diversity and inclusion topics and reports to the Board on a regular basis. 
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
The Executive Committee is empowered to act for the full Board during the intervals between Board meetings, except with respect to matters that, under Delaware law or the Company's bylaws, may not be delegated to a committee of the Board. The Executive Committee meets as necessary, with all actions taken by the Committee reported at the next Board meeting.

Edward Hanway, Deborah C. Hopkins, Elaine La Roche, Steven A. Mills, Bruce P. Nolop, Marc D. Oken, Morton O. Schapiro, Lloyd M. Yates and R. David Yost. 
The Board has nominated each of these individuals to serve until the 2020 annual meeting. Each nominee has indicated that he or she will serve if elected. We do not anticipate that any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling to stand for election, but if that happens, your proxy may be voted for another person nominated by the Board or the Board may reduce its size. Each director holds office until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified or his or her earlier resignation, death or removal. 
In nominating the following slate of director candidates for election at the Company's annual meeting of stockholders, the Board has evaluated each nominee by reference to the criteria described above on pages 8 and 9 under the headings "Director Qualifications" and "Director Skills and Experience." In addition, the Board evaluates each individual director in the context of the Board as a whole, with the objective of recommending a group that can best support the success of our businesses and represent stockholder interests. 
The following section contains information provided by the nominees about their principal occupations, business experience and other matters, including their 2019 committee assignments, as well as a description of how each individual's experience qualifies him or her to serve as a director of the Company. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR all of the director nominees.

Recognizing that executive compensation is an important matter for our stockholders, and in accordance with SEC rules, we are asking our stockholders to approve an advisory resolution on the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. 
This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices as described in this proxy statement. Although the voting results are not binding, the Board and the Compensation Committee will take into account the results of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. We will conduct this annual advisory vote through our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, when the next advisory vote on the frequency of future say-on-pay votes will occur. 
We encourage our stockholders to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which immediately follows this proposal. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes our executive compensation program and related policies and practices and explains the decisions the Compensation Committee has made under this program and the factors considered in making those decisions. We also encourage our stockholders to review the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other compensation tables and accompanying narratives, which provide detailed information on the compensation of our named executive officers. 
STOCKHOLDERS ARE BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON THE FOLLOWING RESOLUTION: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Marsh & McLennan Companies approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the executive compensation tables and the related narratives.

Approximately 95% of the votes cast on the say-on-pay proposal were voted in  favor of our executive compensation policies and practices.   Following our  2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, members of our management, at the direction of the Compensation Committee, discussed our executive compensation policies and practices, as well as the results of our 2018 say-on-pay vote, with a number of our  large institutional stockholders and the major proxy advisory firms. These discussions were favorable, consistent with our 95% approval rate in 2018.   The Compensation Committee is committed to ongoing engagement with our stockholders and the major proxy advisory firms and intends to continue these  outreach efforts.

Following our  2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, members of our management, at the direction of the Compensation Committee, discussed our executive compensation policies and practices, as well as the results of our 2018 say-on-pay vote, with a number of our  large institutional stockholders and the major proxy advisory firms. These discussions were favorable, consistent with our 95% approval rate in 2018.   The Compensation Committee is committed to ongoing engagement with our stockholders and the major proxy advisory firms and intends to continue these  outreach efforts.

2018 AND 2019 ANNUAL TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
The following table summarizes the decisions made by the Compensation Committee in February 2019 and February 2018 with respect to the annual total direct compensation of our named executive officers. The compensation decisions reflected here, and the rationale for such decisions, are discussed in "Executive Compensation Determinations" beginning on page 31. For Mr. Hearn, only February 2019 compensation decisions are shown because he was not a named executive officer in our 2018 proxy statement. 
Mr. Portalatin completed service as President and CEO of Mercer and as an executive officer of the Company effective February 28, 2019 and transitioned into a Vice Chairman role. As a result, the Compensation Committee's decision regarding Mr. Portalatin's 2018 compensation was limited to his annual bonus award for the 2018 performance year.

Executive Compensation Design, Elements and Process 
Our executive compensation program is governed by four guiding principles: 
The principal elements of our executive compensation program are base salary, annual bonuses and annual LTI awards. The Compensation Committee believes that each compensation element, and all of these elements combined, are important to maintain an executive compensation program that is competitive, performance-based and stockholder-focused. 
Our integrated compensation framework heavily weights variable compensation to reward achievements against pre-established, quantifiable financial performance objectives and individual strategic performance objectives. In addition, because a significant portion of variable compensation is delivered in the form of equity-based awards, the value ultimately realized by our senior executives from these awards depends on stockholder value creation as measured by the future performance of our stock price. 
As of December 31, 2018, variable compensation represented about 89% of our CEO's target total direct compensation and about 82% for our other named executive officers, as shown in the following chart. 
COMPETITIVENESS OF PAY 
The Compensation Committee regularly reviews market data with the objective of understanding and evaluating the competitiveness of our executive compensation program and each senior executive's total direct compensation and pay mix, taking into account the individual's role, responsibilities and performance. The Compensation Committee uses this information and exercises its judgment in determining individual compensation levels and seeks input from its independent compensation consultant prior to making compensation decisions for our senior executives. Market-based executive compensation data is used as a "market check" only and compensation levels for our senior executives are not set to correspond to any specific level of market competitiveness. 
The Compensation Committee reviews executive compensation information for direct competitors as well as companies in the broader financial services and general industry sectors. Competitive analyses from these different perspectives recognize that the Company is diverse on an enterprise-wide basis and competes for executive talent in different businesses on an operating company basis. 
Peer Group for Executive Compensation Purposes 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the executive compensation data disclosed in the publicly available filings of the companies that comprise our peer group for executive compensation purposes. The peer group is based

on business lines, talent pool and company size, as reflected by revenue and market capitalization, and includes insurance, consulting and other business services companies, as listed in the table below. The Compensation Committee reviews the peer group periodically and makes adjustments that it deems are appropriate or necessary, for example, as a result of business combinations and other changes. The Compensation Committee did not make changes to the peer group in 2018.

Financial Services and General Industry Surveys 
The Compensation Committee also reviewed executive compensation data drawn from two industry subsets (Financial Services and General Industry) of S&P 500® companies that participated in an executive compensation survey conducted by an independent compensation consulting firm. Each subset was refined based on revenue and market capitalization. For a list of the companies comprising these subsets, please refer to Exhibit B. The operating company CEO comparisons were based on subsidiaries or divisions of all companies that participated in the executive compensation survey (instead of only S&P 500® companies) in order to have a significant sample size for these particular comparisons. 
EMPLOYMENT LETTERS 
Each of our senior executives has an employment letter that sets forth his or her compensation arrangements and other terms and conditions of employment. These letters are discussed in "Employment Letters" on page 47. 
BASE SALARY 
Base salary is intended to provide a fixed level of compensation that is appropriate given a senior executive's role in the organization, his or her skills and experience, the competitive market for his or her position and internal equity considerations. A senior executive's base salary is set forth in his or her employment letter and may be adjusted when the Compensation Committee determines an adjustment is appropriate to reflect a change in these factors. 
ANNUAL BONUS 
Our annual bonus is a variable pay program intended to link the cash-based incentive compensation to: 
The Compensation Committee takes a holistic approach to assessing performance and determining the actual bonus award for each senior executive. The Compensation Committee believes that annual bonus awards should be based on the achievement of objective, measurable financial results and how those results are achieved. In addition, the Compensation Committee believes it is important to measure individual executive performance against his or her achievement toward strategic objectives and other Company priorities. After the end of the year, each senior executive's performance was assessed by Mr. Glaser and the Compensation Committee (and, in the case of Mr. Glaser's performance, solely by the Compensation Committee). 
A senior executive's target annual bonus is set forth in his or her employment letter and may be adjusted when the Compensation Committee determines an adjustment is appropriate or necessary to reflect a change in his or her responsibilities, the competitive market for talent or internal equity considerations. The target annual bonuses for our named executive officers for 2018 are set forth in "Determination of 2018 Annual Bonuses" on page 36. 
ANNUAL LTI AWARD 
Annual LTI compensation is a variable pay program intended to align the financial interests of our senior executives with maximizing the return to our stockholders. Annual LTI compensation for our senior executives is delivered in a mix of equity-based awards consisting of stock options, which reward stock price appreciation and the creation of stockholder value; performance stock units ("PSUs"), which reward the achievement of specific Company financial objectives; and restricted stock units ("RSUs"), which further align the financial interests of our senior executives with our stockholders and also support our retention objectives.

The Compensation Committee reviews the mix of equity-based awards each year. In 2019, the Compensation Committee determined that the mix reflected in the table below is consistent with the objective of aligning the financial interests of our senior executives with maximizing stockholder value. The annual LTI compensation of our senior executives is delivered predominantly in stock options and PSU awards, the value of which is contingent on stock price appreciation or achieving specific Company financial objectives.

Executive Compensation Determinations 
The Compensation Committee takes a total compensation approach in setting the pay of our senior executives and makes decisions regarding base salary, annual bonuses and LTI awards in February of each year. This approach enables the Compensation Committee to evaluate performance on a consistent basis each year and to consider the appropriate level of fixed and variable compensation within each senior executive's total compensation package. 
While the Compensation Committee recognizes that elements of compensation may be interrelated, it does not require or assume any fixed relationship among the various elements of compensation within the total direct compensation framework or between the compensation of our CEO and that of any other senior executive. In addition, accrued pension and amounts realized or realizable under previously granted equity-based awards did not influence the Compensation Committee's decisions. 
The Compensation Committee considers the recommendations of our CEO when determining the compensation of our other senior executives. 
BASE SALARY 
The Compensation Committee increased Mr. Glaser's base salary from $1,400,000 to $1,500,000 effective April 1, 2018. Mr. Glaser's increase was based on the competitive market and his long-term performance and contributions as CEO. This is the first increase in Mr. Glaser's base salary since he was appointed CEO in 2013. 
The Compensation Committee did not adjust the base salaries of our other named executive officers during 2018. 
ANNUAL BONUS 
The Compensation Committee determined the 2018 annual bonus awards for our named executive officers using the following framework: 
Each senior executive's target bonus was allocated between financial and strategic performance according to weightings associated with his or her position. The Compensation Committee then assessed financial performance and each senior executive's strategic performance and determined a payout level for each portion of the senior executive's target annual bonus. The multiplier for competitive financial performance was determined and applied to the sum of the payout levels for financial and strategic performance for each senior executive. Using this result, the Compensation Committee then conducted a qualitative assessment to determine the actual bonus award for each senior executive. The Compensation Committee believes that the use of judgment in the qualitative assessment helps reward performance appropriately, particularly on a year-to-year basis.

Mr. Glaser's increase was based on the competitive market and his long-term performance and contributions as CEO. The Compensation Committee did not adjust the target bonuses for our other named executive officers in 2018.

2018 Financial Performance Measure 
For 2018, the financial performance measure for all senior executives was Company or operating company net operating income, as applicable, as modified for executive compensation purposes. The Compensation Committee set challenging targets for our named executive officers to align with our 2018 objective of driving strong earnings growth across the Company. 
Performance targets for 2018 were set above the targeted and actual performance for 2017. Performance targets were based on threshold, target and maximum levels in dollars rather than growth rates. Target and actual results in the table below are expressed as a percentage of prior-year results.

2018 Multiplier for Competitive Financial Performance 
Overview 
The multiplier for competitive financial performance was intended to calibrate our performance on a relative basis by comparing adjusted EPS growth for the Company with adjusted EPS growth of our peer group companies and the S&P 500®. The effectiveness of the calibration of the Company's performance versus the external market depends on the consistency and comparability of all companies' adjusted EPS results for purposes of measuring growth. 
Over the course of 2017 and 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed adjusted EPS growth projections for the comparator group and identified challenges in comparing results for certain peer group companies and the S&P 500®. Based on these reviews, the Compensation Committee anticipated that the multiplier may not accurately reflect the Company's competitive financial performance for 2018. 
The multiplier for competitive financial performance in 2018 was calculated and applied in a manner consistent with past practice. However, due to anomalies in results for peer group companies and the S&P 500® in 2017 and 2018, which are described below, the Compensation Committee does not believe that the calculated multiplier was indicative of the Company's competitive financial performance for 2018. 
Multiplier Framework 
Within the comparator group, the S&P 500® was weighted most heavily at 30% as it represents the broadest market comparison. Aon and Willis Towers Watson were weighted at 25% and 20%, respectively, as they are direct competitors of the Company and have divisions that compete directly with our Risk & Insurance Services and Consulting segments. The five additional companies listed in the table below were each equally weighted at 5%.

The multiplier for competitive financial performance uses our adjusted EPS growth as reported by the Company and by our peer group in press releases for fourth quarter earnings, as well as an estimate of 2018 EPS growth for the S&P 500® as available from FactSet Research Systems Inc. These publicly reported results were selected based on their availability and comparability. Adjusted EPS growth is assessed on a percentile basis with the weightings in the preceding table. The following table shows the threshold, target and maximum multiplier based on percentile ranking.

Note: Interpolation is used to determine the multiplier for a percentile ranking between threshold/target or target/maximum. 
Using the framework described above, our adjusted EPS growth achieved a threshold ranking on a weighted basis, which resulted in a multiplier of 0.70x. Final results for the multiplier were reviewed by Pay Governance LLC, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant. Despite the Compensation Committee's belief that the calculated multiplier was not indicative of the Company's competitive financial performance for 2018, it was applied to the sum of the bonus payout levels for 2018 Financial Performance and 2018 Strategic Performance for each named executive officer.
The Compensation Committee's Review of the 2018 Multiplier 
In its review of adjusted EPS growth for the 2018 fiscal year as reported by the Company and by our peer group, as well as an estimate of 2018 EPS growth for the S&P 500®; the Compensation Committee identified significant challenges in using this data to assess the Company's relative performance for 2018. 
Considering that the 2018 relative performance assessment was impacted by these anomalies, the Compensation Committee reviewed an analysis of 2016 to 2018 growth rates to enhance comparability of performance. The 2016-2018 analysis showed that the Company outperformed six of the eight components in the comparator group. The Compensation Committee believed that this two-year analysis was more reflective of the Company's relative performance in 2018.

Qualitative Assessment 
The Compensation Committee believes that the use of judgment in making final bonus award decisions helps reward performance appropriately on a year-to-year basis and also on an internal equity basis among senior executives. In addition to performance as measured against the previously described financial and strategic objectives, the Compensation Committee also assessed how these objectives were achieved and considered each senior executive's current-year performance and bonus award vis-à-vis his or her prior-year performance and bonus award; compensation relative to peers at direct competitors; and his or her total direct compensation.

ANNUAL LTI AWARDS 
The annual equity-based awards granted to our senior executives are determined by the Compensation Committee as part of its annual total compensation review. In determining the awards, the Compensation Committee considers the senior executive's performance and his or her expected future contributions to the Company's performance along with external market competitiveness, internal equity comparisons and the target LTI award set forth in the senior executive's employment letter. Mr. Glaser also provides LTI award recommendations for senior executives other than himself. 
The grant date fair values of the annual LTI awards granted to our named executive officers in February 2019 are shown in the following table. They are not reflected in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" on page 45 because the awards were made after the end of the 2018 fiscal year. Mr. Portalatin, who completed service as President and CEO of Mercer effective February 28, 2019, was not granted an LTI award in February 2019.

 PSU Awards The  performance measure for PSU awards, which represent 25% of the grant date fair value of LTI compensation for our senior executives, is adjusted EPS growth as modified for executive compensation purposes and measured on a three-year annualized growth  rate basis. Depending on our actual financial performance results, 0% to 200% of the number of PSUs granted is delivered in shares of our common stock. The following tables provide the payout (as a percentage of target) for maximum, target and  threshold performance levels for the 2019 and 2016 PSU awards, respectively. The Compensation Committee sets the performance levels after reviewing our financial strategy, the design of PSU awards at peer group companies and historical EPS growth  data for the S&P 500®. At the time of setting the target and determining the payouts at varying levels of performance for these awards, the Compensation Committee believed that achievement  of the target for adjusted EPS growth was a challenging goal.

Changes for 2019 
For 2019, we made certain changes with respect to executive compensation and our annual bonus framework, as discussed below. 
SENIOR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACTIONS AND DECISIONS 
Mr. Glaser. The Compensation Committee increased Mr. Glaser's target annual bonus from $3,000,000 to $3,750,000, effective for the 2019 performance year and his target LTI award from $9,500,000 to $11,000,000, effective for the February 2019 grant. Mr. Glaser's increases were made taking into account the competitive market, internal equity and his long-term performance and contributions as President and CEO of the Company. 
Mr. McGivney. The Compensation Committee increased Mr. McGivney's annual base salary from $750,000 to $800,000 effective April 1, 2019, his target annual bonus from $1,200,000 to $1,300,000, effective for the 2019 performance year, and his target LTI award from $2,000,000 to $2,600,000, effective for the February 2019 grant. Mr. McGivney's increases were made taking into account the competitive market, internal equity and his long-term performance and contributions as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. 
Mr. Portalatin. On January 16, 2019, we announced that Mr. Portalatin would step down from the role of President and CEO of Mercer and would be appointed Vice Chairman of the Company effective March 1, 2019. Mr. Portalatin's compensation for his new role was set as follows: 
While employed by the Company and for 12 months following his termination of employment, Mr. Portalatin will be subject to certain restrictive covenants. Mr. Portalatin's employment as Vice Chairman of the Company was conditioned on his entry into a waiver and release in connection with a letter agreement documenting the terms of his employment and at the termination of his employment. 
ANNUAL BONUS FRAMEWORK 
The Compensation Committee made two changes to the annual bonus framework for 2019:

Benefit Plans and Other Programs 
RETIREMENT AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS 
We offer retirement and deferred compensation plans, in which all of our senior executives are eligible to participate, to maintain a competitive compensation program. 
We maintain a defined contribution retirement program in the U.S. consisting of the Supplemental Savings & Investment Plan ("SSIP"), an unfunded nonqualified defined contribution retirement plan that is coordinated with our 401(k) Savings & Investment Plan. Additional information about the SSIP, including individual amounts deferred by our named executive officers, Company matching credits and earnings during 2018, as well as account balances as of the end of 2018, is presented in "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table" on page 55. Earnings with respect to all of our nonqualified defined contribution plans are based upon actual market performance, and preferential or above-market earnings are not offered. 
We discontinued future service accruals in our U.S. defined benefit retirement program effective December 31, 2016. The features of our U.S. retirement program, including the present value of the accumulated pension benefits for our named executive officers as of the end of 2018, are presented in further detail in "Defined Benefit Retirement Program" on page 53. We do not have individually-designed defined benefit arrangements for any named executive officer. 
SEVERANCE ARRANGEMENTS 
Severance payments and benefits for our senior executives, other than Mr. Portalatin in his role as Vice Chairman of the Company effective March 1, 2019, are provided under our Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan, which provides for severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination of employment without cause (as defined in the plan) in an amount equal to the sum of the senior executive's then-current base salary and average annual bonus award over the three prior years, plus an amount equal to a pro rata bonus for the year of termination. 
While compensation decisions regarding our senior executives affect the potential payments under these arrangements, the existence of these severance arrangements did not affect the Compensation Committee's decisions with respect to other elements of compensation for our named executive officers because these severance arrangements are contingent in nature and may never be triggered. 
The terms of the Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan are discussed more fully in "Termination of Employment" on page 58. The amount of the estimated payments and benefits payable to our named executive officers, assuming a termination of employment as of the last business day of 2018, is presented in "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" on page 56. 
CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS 
Change-in-control payments and benefits are provided to our senior executives through our equity-based compensation plans and the Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan, as applicable. These arrangements are intended to retain our senior executives and provide continuity of management in the event of an actual or potential change in control of the Company. Consistent with this objective, the terms of our equity-based awards contain a "double-trigger" vesting provision, which requires both a change in control of the Company and a subsequent specified termination of employment for vesting to be accelerated. The Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan also includes a "double-trigger" change-in-control provision rather than providing severance payments and benefits solely on the basis of a change in control of the Company. We believe that requiring a "double trigger," rather than providing severance payments (and accelerated vesting of equity-based awards) solely on the basis of a change in control, is more consistent with the purpose of encouraging the continued employment of our senior executives following a change in control of the Company. 
We do not provide any excise tax payments, reimbursements or "gross ups" in connection with a change in control of the Company to any of our senior executives under any plan or arrangement. 
The amount of the estimated payments and benefits payable to our named executive officers, assuming a change in control of the Company and subsequent specified termination of employment as of the last business day of 2018, is presented in "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" on page 56.

OTHER BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES 
Our senior executives are eligible to participate in our health and welfare benefit programs on the same basis as our other eligible employees. We also provide certain perquisites and other personal benefits to our senior executives. In general, the perquisites or other personal benefits provided to our senior executives include (i) the cost of financial counseling and certain income tax return preparation and (ii) from time to time, relocation or housing costs associated with hiring a newly recruited or promoted senior executive. 
In addition, the Compensation Committee has determined to provide Mr. Glaser access to a car and driver for business and commuting purposes and to corporate aircraft, in which we maintain fractional interests, for business and personal travel. Such personal air travel is limited to an amount not to exceed $130,000 per calendar year as determined based on the aggregate incremental cost of such travel to the Company. The imputed income attributable to Mr. Glaser's personal use of corporate aircraft and a car and driver was taxable income to Mr. Glaser. The taxes associated with this income were not reimbursed or paid by the Company. 
The incremental cost of providing perquisites and other personal benefits during 2018 to our named executive officers is presented in the footnotes to the "All Other Compensation" column of the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" on page 45.

Risk and Reward Features of Executive Compensation Program 
The Compensation Committee strives to maintain an appropriate balance between risk and reward in support of our overall business strategy. Our executive compensation principles, policies and practices are designed to encourage an appropriate level of risk-taking but not to encourage our senior executives to take excessive or unnecessary risks. To achieve this balance, we maintain the following policies and practices:

   Stockholder-Focused LTI Program         Equity-based awards to our senior  executives are granted annually on a discretionary basis by the Compensation Committee taking into consideration each individual's past performance and expected future contributions. Awards are made in a combination of stock options,  RSU awards and PSU awards to align the financial interests of our senior executives with maximizing our return to stockholders. PSU awards are earned based on our achievement against financial performance objectives, as determined by the  Compensation Committee, over a three-year performance period.   All equity-based awards are  subject to multi-year vesting requirements or performance periods with complete forfeiture of unvested awards upon a voluntary termination of employment by a senior executive (other than by reason of retirement) or termination of employment for  cause. None of our equity-based awards are scheduled to begin vesting until after one year following their grant. In addition, the terms of our outstanding and unvested equity-based awards contain a "double-trigger" vesting provision in  the event of a change in control of the Company. We do not provide any excise tax payments, reimbursements or "gross ups" in connection with a change in control of the Company to any of our senior executives under any plan or  arrangement.

   Compensation Recovery  ("Clawback") Policies       We may, to the extent permitted by  applicable law, cancel or require reimbursement of any annual bonus awards received by a senior executive if and to the extent that: (i) the amount of the award was based on the achievement of specified consolidated, segment or operating  company financial results, and we subsequently restate those financial results; (ii) in the Compensation Committee's judgment, the senior executive engaged in intentional misconduct that contributed to the need for the restatement; and  (iii) the senior executive's award would have been lower if the financial results in question had been properly reported. In such case, we will seek to recover from the senior executive the amount by which the actual annual bonus award  paid for the relevant period exceeded the amount that would have been paid based on the restated financial results. The policy provides that we will not seek to recover compensation paid more than three years prior to the date the applicable  restatement is disclosed. Also, our 2011 Incentive and Stock Award Plan allows us to "claw back" outstanding or already-settled equity-based awards.

   Severance Payments       Severance  protections for our senior executives are set at a uniform level equal to his or her base salary and three-year average annual bonus award (a "1x multiple"). In addition, without stockholder approval, we will not enter into a  severance agreement with a senior executive that provides for any cash severance payment that exceeds 2.99 times the sum of his or her base salary and three-year average annual bonus award.

In light of the above, and based on management's annual review and analysis focused on the incentive compensation programs covering our general employee population, we believe our compensation policies and practices do not encourage excessive or inappropriate risk-taking and that the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for our employees are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
We maintain stock ownership guidelines for our senior executives that are intended to align the financial interests of our senior executives with our stockholders by requiring them to acquire and maintain a meaningful ownership interest in our common stock. These guidelines are intended to take into account an individual's needs for portfolio diversification, while maintaining an ownership interest at levels sufficient to assure our stockholders of management's commitment to long-term value creation. Our senior executives are required, over a five-year period, to acquire and hold shares or stock units of our common stock with an aggregate value at least equal to a specified multiple of their base salary. The current multiples for our named executive officers are as follows:

HOLDING REQUIREMENT FOR EQUITY-BASED AWARDS 
Under our stock ownership guidelines, our senior executives are required to hold shares of our common stock acquired in connection with the distribution of stock units or exercise of stock options (net of any tax withholding and, in the case of stock options, the exercise price) until the required multiple of base salary is reached. In addition, our senior executives may not sell any shares of our common stock, however acquired, unless their ownership interest after such sale is at or above the required multiple of base salary stipulated under our stock ownership guidelines.

Tax and Accounting Considerations 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows public companies a federal income tax deduction for compensation in excess of $1 million that is paid to a named executive officer in any taxable year. Given the recent changes to Section 162(m), the incentive compensation and base salary over $1 million paid to our named executive officers for 2018 generally will not be tax deductible. The Compensation Committee reserves the right to award compensation that is not tax deductible. 
We also structure compensation in a manner intended to avoid the incurrence of any additional tax, interest or penalties under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code governing the provision of nonqualified deferred compensation to our service providers. 
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, which requires us to recognize compensation expense relating to share-based payments (such as stock options, PSU awards and RSU awards) in our financial statements. The recognition of this expense has not caused us to limit or otherwise significantly alter the equity- based compensation element of our executive compensation program. This is because we believe equity-based compensation is a necessary component of a competitive executive compensation program and fulfills important program objectives. The Compensation Committee considers the potential impact of FASB ASC Topic 718 on any proposed change to the equity-based compensation element of our program. 
Additional Considerations 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis includes statements regarding the use of various performance measures and related target levels in the limited context of our executive compensation program. These target levels are not intended to be statements of management's expectations of our future financial results or other guidance. Investors should not apply these target levels in any other context. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the preceding Compensation Discussion and Analysis, as well as the accompanying compensation tables and related narratives. Based on that review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated into the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(1)  Mr. Doyle was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of Marsh LLC on July 5, 2017; his compensation is  shown for 2018 and 2017 only since he was not a named executive officer in 2016. As indicated in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, Mr. Portalatin completed service as President and CEO of Mercer Consulting Group, Inc. effective  February 28, 2019, after which date he was no longer an executive officer of the Company. For Mr. Hearn, only compensation for 2018 is shown because he was not a named executive officer for 2017 and 2016.  
(2)  The amounts reported in the "Stock Awards" and "Option Awards" columns represent the grant date fair  value of the awards for the years ended December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The amounts reported in the "Stock Awards" column represent  both PSU and RSU awards. The grant date fair value of the PSU award granted in each of these years to each of the named executive officers is reported based on performance at the target level. As stated in the description of the PSU awards following  the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" on page 48, the payout based on maximum performance is 200% of the target level, which, if achieved, would correspond to the values reported in the table below, holding constant the grant date  fair value of the Company's common stock. The assumptions used in calculating the amounts reported for awards granted in 2018 are included in footnote 9 to the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended  December 31, 2018, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2019. The assumptions used in calculating the amounts reported for awards granted prior to 2018 are included in the footnote  captioned "Stock Benefit Plans" to the Company's audited financial statements for the relevant fiscal year, included in the Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K previously filed with the SEC. The amounts reported in these  columns may differ slightly from the corresponding amounts shown in the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" on page 48 due to rounding to the nearest whole dollar as required by SEC rules. In addition, the amounts reported in these  columns differ slightly from the amounts disclosed in the "2018 and 2019 Annual Total Direct Compensation of Named Executive Officers" section on page 28 of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis due to rounding to the nearest whole  share.

(4)  The amounts reported in the "Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings" column  represent the increase, if any, in the present value of the named executive officers' benefits (both vested and unvested) under the tax-qualified Marsh & McLennan Companies Retirement Plan, the Company's Benefit Equalization Plan  and the Company's Supplemental Retirement Plan. For 2018, the amount reported for each named executive officer reflects changes in age and service, the interest rate and the mortality assumption projecting longer life expectancies, and any  change in base salary. In 2018, the sums of the change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings for Mr. Glaser, Mr. McGivney, Mr. Doyle, Mr. Portalatin and Mr. Hearn were negative (-$219,474,  -$103,238, -$12,110, -$83,828 and -$3,390, respectively); as required by SEC rules, the negative changes are shown in the Summary Compensation Table as zero. The assumptions used in calculating the amounts reported are included in footnote 8 to the  Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2019. The Company's retirement program is described  in further detail in "Defined Benefit Retirement Program" on page 53. No named executive officer received preferential or above-market earnings on deferred compensation. The Company discontinued future service accruals in the defined  benefit retirement program effective December 31, 2016.

STOCK OPTIONS 
Stock options represent the right to purchase a specified number of shares of the Company's common stock at a specified exercise price for a specified period of time. Stock options are scheduled to vest in four equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, with earlier vesting and shortened exercisability in the event of death, disability and specified terminations of employment. The stock options granted to the named executive officers on February 21, 2018 are scheduled to vest on February 21, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and will expire no later than February 20, 2028. The stock options have an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low trading prices of shares of the Company's common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the grant date. 
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS 
An RSU represents a promise to deliver a share of the Company's common stock as soon as practicable after vesting. Annual awards of RSUs are scheduled to vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the 28th of the month in which the first anniversary of the grant date occurs, with full or pro rata vesting in the event of death, disability and specified terminations of employment. The RSU awards granted to the named executive officers on February 21, 2018 are scheduled to vest on February 28 of 2019, 2020 and 2021. RSU awards include the right to payment of dividend equivalents for each share of common stock that is paid in respect of a vested RSU. Dividend equivalents that relate to RSU awards that do not vest or are forfeited also will be forfeited. Holders of RSU awards have no right to vote the shares of common stock subject to the award. 
PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT AWARDS 
A PSU represents a promise to deliver, as soon as practicable after the end of the performance period, a number of shares of the Company's common stock ranging from 0% to 200% of the number of PSUs granted, depending on the Company's achievement of a financial performance objective as determined by the Compensation Committee over a three-year performance period. The performance measure is the Company's adjusted EPS as modified for executive compensation purposes (as defined in the "Annual LTI Awards" section on pages 30 to 31 of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis) on a three-year annualized growth rate basis. The target adjusted EPS growth rate for the PSU awards is 8%. The PSU awards granted to the named executive officers on February 21, 2018 are scheduled to vest on February 28, 2021, with full or pro rata vesting in the event of death, disability and specified terminations of employment. PSU awards include the right to payment of dividend equivalents for each share of common stock that is paid in respect of vested PSU awards. Dividend equivalents that relate to PSU awards that do not vest or are forfeited also will be forfeited. Holders of PSU awards have no right to vote the shares of common stock subject to the award. 
The treatment of these awards upon termination of employment or a change in control of the Company is described in further detail in "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" on page 56.

(4)  Represents the number of shares to be received in respect of PSU awards assuming target performance for the 2016 PSU award  and the achievement of maximum performance for the 2017 and 2018 PSU awards. The PSU awards granted in February 2016 vested on February 28, 2019, and PSU awards granted in May 2016, February 2017, and February 2018 will vest on May 1,  2019, February 28, 2020, and February 28, 2021, respectively, and will be paid in a number of shares of the Company's common stock determined based on actual performance over the applicable three-year performance period. Our adjusted  EPS growth as modified for executive compensation purposes for 2016, 2017 and 2018, were determined by the Compensation Committee in the first quarter after the end of the year. As of December 31, 2018, performance was tracking between  threshold and target for the 2016 PSU award and above target payout level for the 2017 and 2018 PSU awards. If the Company does not attain target performance for the 2016 PSU award or the maximum performance for the 2017 or 2018 PSU awards over the  applicable three-year performance period, the number of shares received by the named executive officers upon settlement will be lower. The number of deliverable shares will range from 0% to 200% of the number of PSUs granted. See the  "Performance Results for Our 2016 PSU Awards" section on page 38 of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the narrative following the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" above with respect to the 2018 PSU awards  granted to the named executive officers.  
(5)  Pursuant to a domestic relations order, Mr. Glaser transferred a portion of each award to his former spouse. As of  December 31, 2018, Mr. Glaser held options to purchase 2,040,853 shares of common stock, 65,428 restricted stock units and 98,143 performance stock units and Mr. Glaser's former spouse held options to purchase 1,244,589 shares of  common stock, 5,553 restricted stock units and 12,703 performance stock units.

Defined Benefit Retirement Program 
The Company discontinued future service accruals effective December 31, 2016 in the tax-qualified Marsh & McLennan Companies Retirement Plan, the nonqualified Benefit Equalization Plan and the nonqualified Supplemental Retirement Plan (collectively, the "U.S. Retirement Program"). The Benefit Equalization Plan is a restoration plan that provides those participants subject to certain Internal Revenue Code limitations with retirement benefits on a comparable basis to those provided to employees who are not subject to such limitations. The Supplemental Retirement Plan provides for an enhanced benefit for a select group of highly compensated employees. Messrs. Glaser, McGivney and Portalatin participate in the United States defined benefit retirement program. Mr. Doyle and Mr. Hearn are not eligible to participate in the United States defined benefit retirement program because they did not meet the eligibility requirements to join the retirement program prior to December 31, 2016. 
For participants who are eligible for these plans, annual benefits payable at age 65 in the form of a single-life annuity are determined generally by the following formula: 
The above sum is reduced by an amount representing a portion of the participant's estimated Social Security benefit. Participants who are at least age 65 are eligible for normal retirement benefits and participants who have attained five years of vesting service and are at least age 55 are eligible for early retirement benefits. Of the named executive officers, Mr. Glaser and Mr. Portalatin are eligible for an early retirement benefit. Benefits under the retirement program vest upon the earliest of (i) a participant's attainment of five years of vesting service, (ii) attainment of age 65 or (iii) a change in control of the Company. Messrs. Glaser, McGivney and Portalatin currently have a vested benefit under the retirement program. 
The present value of the accumulated pension benefits of the named executive officers who participate in these plans as of the end of 2018, as well as other information about each of our defined benefit retirement plans, is reported in the table below. Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts, other than retirement age, are included in footnote 8 to the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2019. The assumed retirement age used for purposes of this table is 65 years for all named executives who participate in these plans. Benefits under the tax-qualified Marsh & McLennan Companies Retirement Plan are generally paid as a monthly annuity for the life of the retiree and his or her designated survivor, if the participant has elected to be paid on a joint and survivor basis. The Company's policy for funding its obligation under the tax-qualified plan is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the funding requirements set forth in applicable law. The Company is not required to, and does not, fund any of its obligations to the named executive officers who participate in these plans under any of its nonqualified defined benefit retirement plans.

The U.S. Retirement Program provides a survivor benefit, in the form of a monthly annuity, to a qualifying spouse or domestic partner upon the death of a vested participant. The present value of  this survivor benefit in the event of death on December 31, 2018 was $740,572 for Mr. McGivney and $697,189 for Mr. Portalatin. The total amounts reported in this column may not equal the sum of amounts reflected due to rounding to  the nearest whole dollar as required by SEC rules.  
(3)  Mr. Glaser and Mr. Portalatin are eligible for an early retirement benefit. Their early retirement benefits are  separately quantified in the table included in the "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" section on page 56.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table 
The Company maintains the Supplemental Savings & Investment Plan (the "SSIP"), a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that coordinates with the Company's 401(k) Savings & Investment Plan to give eligible participants the opportunity to defer compensation on a pre-tax basis in addition to what is allowed under the tax-qualified plan. 
Under the SSIP, selected participants who have reached any one of the limitations set forth in the Internal Revenue Code under the Company's 401(k) Savings & Investment Plan may, at their election, defer up to 30% of their base salary and notionally invest this amount in any or all of the plan's notional investment alternatives. These alternatives consist of a variety of mutual funds and units of the Company's common stock. Participants in the SSIP may change their investment elections at any time, both as to future deferrals and existing balances; however, once a participant notionally invests an amount in units of the Company's common stock, that amount cannot be reallocated to any other notional investment. 
After a participant completes one year of service with the Company, the Company provides matching credits at the same rate as the Company's 401(k) Savings & Investment Plan. Effective January 1, 2017, eligible participants who are employed by an eligible participating company and have completed one year of service receive a 4% fixed company credit with respect to their base salary over the Internal Revenue Service limit on compensation that may be considered under the Company's 401(k) Savings & Investment Plan, whether or not they elect to make employee deferrals to the SSIP. 
Participants are not permitted to make withdrawals from their accounts while they are employed by the Company. Participants are generally entitled to payment of their accounts after their employment ends, including upon retirement, death or disability in a lump sum or annual installments over 2 to 15 years. 
All of the named executive officers are eligible to participate in the SSIP.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
The following table sets forth the estimated payments and benefits to be provided to the named executive officers in the event of the specified terminations of employment, including following a change in control of the Company. In accordance with SEC rules, this table assumes that the relevant triggering event occurred on December 31, 2018, the last business day of the last completed fiscal year, and that the market price of the Company's common stock was the closing stock price as of December 31, 2018 ($79.75 per share), the last trading day of 2018. 
The employment letter for each named executive officer, other than Mr. Portalatin in his role as Vice Chairman of the Company effective March 1, 2019, provides that he will participate in the Company's Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan. In general, the Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan provides for cash severance in the event of an involuntary termination of employment without "cause" (as described below) or, within the two-year period following a change in control of the Company, either by the successor entity without cause or by the participant for a termination of employment for "good reason" (as described in "Termination of Employment" below). In addition, each such named executive officer is eligible for specified benefits upon death or "disability" (as described in "Termination of Employment" below). 
Cash severance under the Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan is paid in a lump sum equal to: 
The Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan also provides 12 months of outplacement services and continued medical and dental coverage for 12 months at active employee rates. Severance payments and benefits are conditioned on a participant having executed a waiver and release of claims (including restrictive covenants). The cash severance amounts included in the following table reflect the employment arrangements in effect on December 31, 2018. 
The terms and conditions of equity-based awards provide for full or pro rata vesting in the event of death, disability and specified terminations of employment. 
Mr. Portalatin's employment letter as Vice Chairman of the Company provides that he will not be eligible for any severance benefits upon the termination of his employment. 
As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Glaser and Mr. Portalatin were eligible to commence benefit payments under the Company's defined benefit retirement program upon an early retirement.

For certain events such as retirement, the values are based on results as determined by the Compensation Committee and the Company's long-term target performance  for the remaining years of the award period for each award. For events in which the vesting of equity-based awards accelerates, such as death, the values are based on performance for abbreviated award periods.  
(3)  Each of the named executive officers is eligible to continue receiving Company-sponsored health insurance for 12 months  following certain terminations of employment. To receive such benefits, a named executive officer is required to contribute at the same level as similarly situated active employees. Each of the named executive officers is eligible to receive  outplacement services for a period of 12 months.  
(4)  The amounts reported in this column, where applicable, include the Company's 401(k) Savings & Investment  Plan matching contributions made by the Company that would vest in the event of death or permanent disability (as defined the Company's Long-Term Disability Plan).

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT 
Upon any termination of employment, including a termination for "cause" or without "good reason," a named executive officer will receive any accrued pay and regular post-employment payments and benefits under the terms of the Company's applicable plans. The amounts reported in the table above do not include payments and benefits that are provided on a nondiscriminatory basis to eligible employees upon termination of employment, including: 
The Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan defines "cause" as a participant's: (i) willful failure to substantially perform the duties consistent with his or her position which is not remedied within 10 days after receipt of written notice from the Company specifying such failure; (ii) willful violation of any written Company policy, including, but not limited to, the Company's Code of Business Conduct & Ethics; (iii) commission at any time of any act or omission that results in a conviction, plea of no contest, plea of nolo contendere or imposition of unadjudicated probation for any felony or crime involving moral turpitude; (iv) unlawful use (including being under the influence) or possession of illegal drugs; (v) gross negligence or willful misconduct which results in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a material loss to the Company or material damage to the reputation of the Company; or (vi) violation of any statutory or common law duty of loyalty to the Company, including the commission at any time of any act of fraud, embezzlement or material breach of fiduciary duty against the Company. 
The Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan defines "good reason" as: (i) a material reduction in the participant's base salary; (ii) a material reduction in the participant's annual incentive opportunity (including a material adverse change in the method of calculating the participant's annual incentive); (iii) a material diminution of the participant's duties, responsibilities or authority; or (iv) a relocation of more than 50 miles from the participant's office location in effect immediately prior to the change in control of the Company. This definition of "good reason" only applies during the 24-month period following a change in control of the Company. 
The employment letter for each named executive officer defines "permanent disability" as occurring when it is determined (by the Company's disability carrier for the primary long-term disability plan or program applicable to the named executive officer because of his or her employment with the Company) that the named executive officer is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.

CHANGE IN CONTROL 
As described in the "Change-in-Control Arrangements" section on page 40, the terms of our outstanding and unvested equity-based awards contain a "double-trigger" change-in-control vesting provision, which requires a change in control of the Company followed by a specified termination of employment for accelerated vesting to occur. Under the double-trigger provision, a change in control of the Company by itself would not cause an employee's equity-based award to vest, so long as the award is assumed or replaced on equivalent terms. In that case, vesting would continue pursuant to the award's original vesting schedule unless, in addition to the change in control, the employee's employment terminates without "cause" or for "good reason" during the 24 months following the change in control. 
The change-in-control provisions included in our Senior Executive Severance Pay Plan also require both "double-trigger" events to occur for payments and benefits to be provided. 
We do not provide change-in-control excise tax reimbursements to any of our senior executives under any plan or arrangement. 
Cash severance payments are not eligible for any tax reimbursement benefit. 
We use the same definition of "change in control" in the equity incentive plans and the Senior Executive Severance 
Pay Plan. 
The definitions of "cause" and "good reason" in equity-based awards for the named executive officers are similar to those described above in "Termination of Employment." 
RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS 
Each of the named executive officers is subject to nonsolicitation covenants that prohibit the executive from: 
Each of the named executive officers is also subject to noncompetition covenants that prohibit the executive from engaging in a competitive activity. 
For Mr. Glaser, the noncompetition and nonsolicitation period ends 24 months after the date of termination of employment. For the other named executive officers other than Mr. Portalatin, this period ends 12 months after the date of termination of employment. For Mr. Portalatin, this period ends on March 1, 2020. 
In addition, at all times prior to and following termination of employment, the named executive officers are subject to a perpetual confidentiality covenant.

Item 3 — Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the independent external audit firm retained to audit the Company's financial statements. The Audit Committee has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year, subject to stockholder ratification. Deloitte & Touche was first retained as the independent registered accounting firm of the Company in 1989. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the compensation of Deloitte & Touche in connection with the annual appointment process. As part of its regular process, the Audit Committee annually reviews and approves the leadership, composition and organization of the external audit team. The Audit Committee also periodically considers the rotation of the independent external audit firm. Further, in conjunction with the mandated rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm's lead audit partner, the Audit Committee and its chairman are directly involved in the review and approval of Deloitte & Touche's lead audit partner. The members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of Deloitte & Touche to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its investors. 
Deloitte & Touche will audit our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2019 and perform other services. Deloitte & Touche acted as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2018. A Deloitte & Touche representative will be present at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders and will have an opportunity to make a statement and to answer your questions. 
Although ratification is not required by the Company's bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting this proposal as a matter of good corporate practice. If the selection is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another independent auditor. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may select a different auditor at any time during the year if it determines that this would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR this proposal. 
FEES OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

pre-approval by the Audit Committee. In lieu of Audit Committee pre-approval on an engagement-by-engagement basis, each category of permitted services, with reasonable detail as to the types of services contemplated, is pre-approved as part of the annual Audit Committee budget approved by the Audit Committee. Permitted services not contemplated during the budget process must be presented to the Audit Committee for approval prior to the commencement of the relevant engagement. The Audit Committee chair, or, if he is not available, any other member of the Committee, may grant approval for any such engagement if approval is required prior to the next scheduled meeting of the Committee. Any such approvals are reported to the Audit Committee at its next meeting. At least twice a year, the Audit Committee is presented with a report showing amounts billed by the independent registered public accounting firm compared to the budget approvals for each of the categories of permitted services. The Committee reviews the suitability of the pre-approval policy at least annually. 
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is comprised of the five directors named below. Each member of the Committee is independent as required by the Company, the listing standards of the NYSE and the SEC's audit committee independence rules. The primary function of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its oversight responsibilities with respect to the integrity of the Company's financial statements; the qualifications, independence and performance of the Company's independent auditors; the performance of the Company's internal audit function; and compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements. The Committee operates pursuant to a charter approved by the Board of Directors. 
Management is responsible for the Company's financial statements, the overall reporting process and the system of internal control, including internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for conducting annual audits and quarterly reviews of the Company's financial statements and expressing an opinion as to the conformity of the annual financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and expressing an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. 
In performing their oversight responsibility, members of the Audit Committee rely without independent verification on the information provided to them and on the representations made by management and Deloitte & Touche. The members of the Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not experts in the fields of accounting or auditing, including in respect of auditor independence. 
During 2018, the Audit Committee executed its oversight function through a series of meetings and teleconferences with management and Deloitte & Touche. The Audit Committee also reviewed and discussed with management and Deloitte & Touche the Company's audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, as well as matters related to internal control over financial reporting and the processes that support the Company's reporting of financial results. The Committee also discussed with Deloitte & Touche the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 1301 (formerly AS No. 16) (Communications with Audit Committees) and Rule 2-07 of SEC Regulation S-X. The Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte & Touche required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, has considered whether the provision of other non-audit services by Deloitte & Touche to the Company is compatible with maintaining Deloitte & Touche's independence and has discussed with Deloitte & Touche that firm's independence. 
Based upon the review and discussions described in this report, the Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, that the audited financial statements and management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC. The Committee has also selected Deloitte & Touche as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. The Board of Directors concurred with that selection and has recommended this selection to the Company's stockholders for ratification.

Any such material plans under which awards in Company shares may currently be granted are included as exhibits to, or incorporated by reference in, the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Stock Purchase Plan for French Employees and Save As You Earn Plan (U.K.). Eligible employees may elect to contribute to these plans through regular payroll deductions over an offering period that varies by plan from one to five years. On each purchase date, generally the end of the offering period, participants may receive their contributions plus interest in cash or use that amount to acquire shares of stock at a discounted purchase price. Under the U.K. Plan, the purchase price may be no less than 95% of the market price of the stock at the beginning of the offering period. Under the French Plan, the purchase price may be no less than 95% of the market price of the stock at the end of the offering period. 
2000 Employee Incentive and Stock Award Plan and predecessor plans and programs. The terms of the 2000 Employee Incentive and Stock Award Plan are described in Note 9 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2011.

No future awards may be granted under these or any other predecessor plan or program.

Scheme shares may be provided from the remaining 173,768 treasury shares or from open market purchases. Open market purchases do not count against the remaining treasury shares available.

CEO Pay Ratio 
The ratio of the annual total compensation for our CEO compared to the annual total compensation of our median employee for fiscal year 2018 is 269, as calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We believe this ratio to be a reasonable estimate, based upon the assumptions and adjustments described below. 
The ratio for fiscal year 2018 is based on the annual total compensation of the Company's median employee (excluding the CEO) and the CEO (as disclosed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement), as follows: 
The employment of the median employee reported in the 2018 proxy statement terminated in 2018. Accordingly, for 2018, we identified an alternative median employee as of December 5, 2017 in accordance with the same methodology used to determine the original median employee in 2017, using for such purposes our U.S. and non-U.S. employees (totaling approximately 66,900). 
We annualized the base salary of regular full-time and part-time employees hired in 2017 and of employees on a leave of absence. We did not annualize the base salary of temporary employees. 
For employees paid other than in U.S. dollars, we converted their compensation to U.S. dollars using the Company's budgeted currency exchange rates for 2017 for base salary and 2016 for cash incentive compensation. 
After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for that employee for fiscal year 2018 using the same methodology used to calculate the amount reported for our named executive officers in the "Total" column of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than ten percent of the Company's common stock, to file with the SEC initial reports of beneficial ownership and reports of changes in beneficial ownership of the Company's common stock. The Company assists its directors and executive officers by monitoring transactions and completing and filing Section 16 reports on their behalf. All Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to such individuals were complied with in 2018.

In December 2018, RegEd was acquired by a third party, with Falfurrias retaining an equity interest. RegEd is a private company that provides compliance management, education, licensing and registration services to insurance brokers, insurance carriers and broker dealers, including the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. In 2018, RegEd received approximately $1.5 million in fees and other compensation from the Company pursuant to arms-length agreements. In addition, Marsh was engaged during 2017 to place insurance on commercial terms in the ordinary course of Marsh's business for several of Falfurrias' portfolio companies and personal insurance for Mr. Oken, for which the Company received total payments of less than $660,000 in 2018. In 2018, Falfurrias conducted a request for proposal process and selected Oliver Wyman to perform consulting services for one of its portfolio companies. Oliver Wyman was engaged on standard commercial terms in the ordinary course of its business and received a fee of $500,000 plus capped expenses.

Information About Our Annual Meeting and Solicitation of Proxies 
WHY HAVE I RECEIVED A NOTICE REGARDING INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS INSTEAD OF PRINTED COPIES OF THESE MATERIALS IN THE MAIL? 
In order to reduce paper and postage costs, and in accordance with SEC rules, we have elected to furnish our proxy materials to stockholders over the Internet. Most stockholders are receiving by mail a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice"), which provides general information about the annual meeting, the address of the website on which our proxy statement and annual report are available for review, printing and downloading and instructions on how to submit proxy votes. For those who wish to receive their materials in a different format (e.g., paper copy by mail or electronic copy by e-mail), the Notice contains instructions on how to do so. Stockholders who are current employees of the Company or who have elected to receive proxy materials via electronic delivery will receive via e-mail the proxy statement, annual report and instructions on how to vote. Stockholders who have elected to receive paper copies of the proxy materials will receive these materials by mail. 
WHO CAN VOTE ON THE MATTERS BEING DECIDED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING? 
With respect to each matter properly brought before the meeting, each stockholder who held shares as of the close of business on March 18, 2019, which we refer to as the record date, is entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each share of common stock held as of that date. As of the record date, there were outstanding 507,562,015 shares of Marsh & McLennan Companies common stock entitled to vote. 
Stockholders of Record 
If, as of the close of business on the record date, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Equiniti Trust Company, you are a stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the meeting or by proxy. The Company is incorporated in Delaware, and in accordance with Delaware law, a list of the Company's common stockholders of record as of the record date will be available for inspection at our principal executive offices at 1166 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York for at least ten days prior to the annual meeting. 
Beneficial ("Street Name") Stockholders 
If, as of the close of business on the record date, your shares were not held directly in your name but rather were held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank or similar intermediary organization, then you are the beneficial holder of shares held in "street name." The intermediary is considered to be the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the annual meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct the intermediary how to vote the shares held in your account. 
HOW DO I VOTE? 
Whether you hold shares as a stockholder of record or beneficial owner, you may direct how your shares are voted without attending the annual meeting. Even if you plan to attend the annual meeting, we encourage you to vote in advance of the meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote by submitting a proxy in accordance with the instructions included in your Notice or on your proxy card. If you are a beneficial owner holding shares in street name, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to your broker, bank, trustee or other intermediary in accordance with the voting instruction form provided to you. Executors, administrators, trustees, guardians, attorneys and other representatives voting on behalf of a stockholder should indicate the capacity in which they are voting and corporations should vote by an authorized officer whose title should be indicated. 
YOU MAY VOTE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER: 
By Telephone or the Internet 
You may vote your shares via telephone or the Internet as instructed in the Notice or the proxy card, depending on how you received the proxy materials. The telephone and Internet procedures are designed to authenticate a stockholder's identity, to allow stockholders to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. 
By Mail 
Stockholders who receive hard copies of the proxy materials may choose to vote by mail and, if you so choose, should complete, sign and date your proxy card or voting instruction card and mail it in the pre-addressed envelope included with the proxy materials. Note that, if you are a stockholder of record and you sign and return a proxy, but do not specify how to vote, your shares will be voted by the proxies in accordance with the Board's recommendations, which will be in favor of our director nominees (Item 1); to approve, by nonbinding vote, the compensation of our named executive officers (Item 2); and in favor of the ratification of the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm (Item 3).

CAN I VOTE MY SHARES IN PERSON AT THE ANNUAL MEETING? 
Yes. However, even if you plan to attend the meeting, we recommend that you vote in advance of the meeting. If you vote in advance and then attend the meeting, you can always change your vote at the meeting. If your shares are held in street name and you decide to vote in person at the annual meeting, you must obtain from your broker, bank or other intermediary record holder a valid proxy giving you the right to vote the shares, and bring that proxy to the meeting. 
CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE? 
Yes. Stockholders of record may revoke their proxy before it is voted at the annual meeting by (i) submitting a new proxy with a later date, (ii) voting in person at the annual meeting or (iii) sending written notification of revocation addressed to: Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Attn: Katherine J. Brennan—Corporate Secretary, 1166 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036-2774 
If you hold your shares in street name, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker or other intermediary, following the instructions they provided; or, if you have obtained a legal proxy from your broker or other intermediary giving you the right to vote your shares, by attending the meeting and voting in person. 
WHAT SHOULD I DO TO ATTEND THE ANNUAL MEETING? 
Stockholders (of record or beneficial) and their proxy holders may attend the annual meeting by sending a request to AnnualMeeting@mmc.com with the following information: (i) your name and complete mailing address; (ii) the names of any family members who will accompany you; (iii) if you will be naming a representative to attend the meeting on your behalf, the name, address and telephone number of that individual; and (iv) proof that you owned shares of the Company's common stock as of March 18, 2019 (such as a letter from your bank or broker or a photocopy of your voting instruction form or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials). 
Advance registration is available to registered and beneficial owners and must be requested no later than May 14, 2019. Please note that seating is limited and registration requests will be processed in the order they are received. You may also join us via live webcast on http://www.mmc.com. 
In addition to registering in advance, please bring a form of government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license, state-issued identification card or passport, to be admitted to the annual meeting. Marsh & McLennan Companies colleagues wishing to attend the annual meeting may present their current employee identification card to be admitted. 
If you were the beneficial owner of shares held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record, you or your representative must also bring proof of your stock ownership on March 18, 2019, such as an account statement or similar evidence of ownership. 
For safety and security reasons, large bags, briefcases, packages, cameras, recording equipment or other electronic devices will not be permitted in the annual meeting. If you do not comply with the procedures outlined above for attending the annual meeting in person, we will not be able to admit you to the annual meeting. 
Whether you hold shares as a stockholder of record or are a beneficial owner, we urge you to vote in advance by Internet, telephone or mail so that your vote will be counted in the event you later decide not to attend the annual meeting. 
WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO CONDUCT BUSINESS AT THE ANNUAL MEETING? 
In order to carry on the business of the annual meeting, we must have a quorum. This means at least a majority of the outstanding shares eligible to vote must be present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting. Both abstentions and broker nonvotes (described below) are counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

WHAT ARE THE VOTING REQUIREMENTS TO ELECT DIRECTORS AND TO APPROVE THE OTHER PROPOSALS DISCUSSED IN THE PROXY STATEMENT? 
The voting standards applicable to the annual meeting are as follows: 
Election of Directors 
The Company's bylaws provide that in an uncontested election, a nominee will be elected if the number of votes cast "for" the nominee's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" the nominee's election. Abstentions will not be included in the total number of votes cast and therefore will have no effect on the election's outcome. The election of directors is not considered a "routine" matter and thus brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote in the election of directors if they did not receive instructions from a beneficial owner. (See "Significance of Broker Nonvotes" below.) 
Our Governance Guidelines address the procedures to be followed if an incumbent director standing for reelection in an uncontested election fails to receive a majority of the votes cast. See "Director Election Voting Standard" on page 6. 
Vote Required for Other Proposals

   Proposal         Vote Required   
   Proposal         Vote Required   
   Proposal         Vote Required   
    Item 2—Advisory  (nonbinding) vote to approve named executive officer compensation         Majority of the shares  entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy 
    Item 2—Advisory  (nonbinding) vote to approve named executive officer compensation         Majority of the shares  entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy 
    Item 2—Advisory  (nonbinding) vote to approve named executive officer compensation         Majority of the shares  entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy 
    Item 3—Ratification of the  selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm   
    Item 3—Ratification of the  selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm   
[END TABLE]
In accordance with Delaware law, abstentions will be treated as present and entitled to vote for purposes of voting on these items, while broker nonvotes (described below) will not. Abstentions have the effect of a vote "against" each of the proposals. 
Significance of "Broker Nonvotes" 
The rules of the NYSE provide that, when a matter to be voted on at an annual meeting is "non-routine," a broker holding shares of record on behalf of a client may vote those shares only if the broker has received voting instructions from the client. The broker may submit a proxy on any routine matter, for which instructions were required but not provided, but when the broker refrains from voting on non-routine matters, a "broker nonvote" occurs. Shares subject to a broker nonvote are not counted as present or represented with respect to those matters, but are counted as present and represented for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the annual meeting. Under the rules of the NYSE, the election of directors (Item 1) and the nonbinding vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers (Item 2) are considered non-routine. 
COULD ADDITIONAL MATTERS BE DECIDED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING? 
As of the date of this proxy statement, we do not know of any matters not described in this proxy statement that will be presented at the meeting. However, if any other matter shall properly come before the meeting, the persons named in the proxy will use their discretion to vote on such matter on behalf of shares for which proxies were submitted. 
WHO CONDUCTS THE ANNUAL MEETING? 
The independent chairman of the Board of Directors acts as chairman of the annual meeting and has the authority to conduct the annual meeting so that the business of the meeting is carried out in an orderly and timely manner. In doing so, the chairman has the discretion to establish reasonable rules for discussion, comments and questions during the meeting. 
WHO WILL COUNT THE VOTES AT THE ANNUAL MEETING? 
One or more representatives of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will tabulate the votes and act as independent inspectors of election. 
HOW MAY I OBTAIN ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF PROXY MATERIALS IN THE FUTURE? 
Most stockholders may elect to receive future proxy statements and annual reports electronically via e-mail or the Internet instead of receiving paper copies in the mail. If you are a stockholder of record, you may choose this electronic delivery option by following the instructions provided when you vote over the Internet. Active employees of the Company who hold Marsh & McLennan Companies common stock in certain employee benefit plan accounts or are stockholders of record generally receive their proxy materials by electronic delivery to their business e-mail accounts.

    Additional Information (Continued)   
[END TABLE]
If you are a beneficial owner who holds shares in street name, it is likely that you will have the option to choose future electronic delivery of proxy materials when you vote over the Internet. Otherwise, please contact your broker or other intermediary holder of record for information regarding electronic delivery of proxy materials. 
Stockholders who receive their proxy materials electronically receive an e-mail message with instructions on how to access the proxy statement and annual report and vote. If you have chosen to receive proxy materials electronically, your choice will remain in effect until you revoke it. 
HOW ARE MATERIALS PROVIDED TO STOCKHOLDERS SHARING THE SAME ADDRESS? 
In order to reduce paper and postage costs, we have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this procedure, stockholders of record or who hold shares in certain employee benefit plan accounts and who share the same last name and reside at the same mailing address will receive one Notice or one set of proxy materials (if they have elected to receive hard copies of the proxy materials), unless one of the stockholders at that address has notified us that they wish to receive individual copies. 
Stockholders who participate in householding continue to receive separate control numbers for voting and, in the case of those who receive hard copies of the proxy materials, separate proxy cards. Householding does not in any way affect dividend check mailings.

Non-GAAP Measures 
Includes Revenue Standard Impact 
Twelve Months Ended December 31 
(Millions) (Unaudited) 
Overview 
The Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (referred to in this release as "GAAP" or "reported" results). The Company also refers to and presents below certain additional non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These measures are: adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating margin, adjusted income, net of tax and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). The Company has included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP in the following tables. 
The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that enables investors to better compare the Company's performance across periods. Management also uses these measures internally to assess the operating performance of its businesses, to assess performance for employee compensation purposes and to decide how to allocate resources. However, investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP measures include adjustments that reflect how management views our businesses, and may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. 
ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AND ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN 
Adjusted operating income (loss) is calculated by excluding the impact of certain noteworthy items from the Company's GAAP operating income or (loss). The following tables identify these noteworthy items and reconcile adjusted operating income (loss) to GAAP operating income or loss, on a consolidated and segment basis, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The following tables also present adjusted operating margin. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by consolidated or segment GAAP revenue adjusted for the subsidiary or affiliate transactions discussed below.

ADJUSTED INCOME, NET OF TAX AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE 
Adjusted income, net of tax is calculated as the Company's GAAP income from continuing operations, adjusted to reflect the after-tax impact of the operating income adjustments set forth in the preceding tables and investments gains or losses related to the impact of mark-to-market adjustments on certain equity securities previously recorded to equity, change in fair value of the acquisition related derivative contracts, amortization of bridge financing fees, pension settlement charges and adjustments to provisional 2017 tax estimates. Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing the Company's adjusted income, net of tax, by MMC's average number of shares outstanding-diluted for the relevant period. The following tables reconcile adjusted income, net of tax to GAAP income from continuing operations and adjusted EPS to GAAP EPS for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.

   The Company has an investment in Alexander Forbes ("AF"), which is accounted for using the equity method.  AF's shares (which are publicly traded on the Johannesburg stock exchange) have been trading below the Company's carrying value.
