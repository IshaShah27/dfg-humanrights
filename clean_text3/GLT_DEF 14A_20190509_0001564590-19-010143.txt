PROXY SUMMARY
Business Highlights
Glatfelter is a leading global supplier in the manufacturing of engineered materials.  Headquartered in York, Pennsylvania, we own and operate manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the Philippines as well as sales and distribution offices in Russia, France, Italy and China.  Our 11 manufacturing facilities have a combined production capacity of approximately 292,000 metric tons of composite fibers and airlaid products used in a wide array of applications.  Additional information about our business can be found in our Annual Report posted at http://www.glatfelter.com/about_us/ investor_relations/annual_reports.aspx.
We operate under two separate business units:  Advanced Airlaid Materials ("AMBU") and Composite Fibers ("CFBU").  These businesses serve key, growing global markets such as hygiene, wipes and table top products, substrates for beverage filtration, and building and electrical applications.  Our growth strategy is focused on expanding our engineered materials businesses.  
Our strategy focuses on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Expanding our engineered materials businesses• Investing in organic growth and strategic acquisitions to expand capabilities and broaden scale• Driving innovation and growth by leveraging market-leading positions

 Maintaining a healthy balance sheet and financial flexibility• Funding organic and inorganic growth opportunities• Applying disciplined capital spending 
[END TABLE]
During 2018, we made significant progress in the strategic transformation of our business into a leading global supplier of engineered materials.  We achieved significant milestones to reshape our portfolio to a more growth-oriented platform.
[BEGIN TABLE]
    1.  We completed the AMBU capacity expansion project by building a new facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas to service the North American airlaid market;  
    2.  We completed the acquisition of Georgia-Pacific's European nonwovens business on October 1 including a state-of-the-art facility in Steinfurt, Germany.  The Steinfurt facility produces high-quality airlaid products for table top, wipes, hygiene, food pad, and other nonwoven materials primarily used within consumer and industrial end-use applications; and   
    3.  We completed the sale of the Specialty Papers business unit ("SPBU") on October 31, which was a transformative event in the Company's history.  The divestiture provides Glatfelter the opportunity to invest greater energy and resources in our faster-growing, higher-profit engineered materials businesses.  
[END TABLE]
The successful execution of these strategic transactions, and the opening of our new state-of-the-art facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas in 2018, were pivotal steps as we build the new Glatfelter.  These transactions support our strategic focus and solidify our platform for long-term growth.  As a result, our annual revenues approximate $1 billion through two global operating units serving high-value, niche nonwovens growth markets and we are a less capital-intensive business.

PROXY SUMMARY
We've taken meaningful steps since 2010 to evolve Glatfelter from a U.S.-focused paper business to a global leading player in engineered materials. 
Glatfelter Transformation History – Building Momentum in Engineered Materials
As a leading global supplier of engineered materials for consumer and industrial applications, we maintain leading positions in key segments serving markets that are growing commensurate with or in excess of gross domestic product ("GDP"). We partner with leading consumer product companies and other market leaders to provide high-quality, innovative solutions delivering outstanding performance to meet market requirements. Over the past several years, we have made investments to increase production capacity and improve our technical capabilities to ensure we are best positioned to serve the market demands and grow our revenue. We are committed to growing in our key markets and will make appropriate investments to support our customers and satisfy market demands.
In the first quarter of 2018, we produced and delivered our first commercial shipment of airlaid wipes product from our new $90 million facility in Arkansas.  This 20,000 metric-ton facility was built to meet the growing demands of the North American market. Throughout 2018, this facility continued to ramp up production and shipments of wipes and table top products to our growing customers. This investment, together with the Steinfurt acquisition, increases our total global airlaid materials capacity to approximately 150,000 metric tons. 
We are committed to ensuring our cost structure is competitive. Our goals are to maintain and grow our leading market positions, partner with customers to provide innovative solutions for new markets and generate strong free cash flows driven by delivering on cost reduction and continuous improvement initiatives.

PROXY SUMMARY
2018 Year in Review 
On an adjusted basis, a non-GAAP measure, our earnings for 2018 totaled $9.2 million, or $0.21 per share, compared with $26.4 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, a year ago. These results were below our expectations and were adversely impacted by i) rapid and significant increases in input costs together with more aggressive competition in Composite Fibers; ii) slower than anticipated demand in Advanced Airlaid Materials; and (iii) a higher tax rate.
We used $6.0 million of cash from operations in 2018 compared with $53.2 million generated a year ago. The decrease in cash from operations primarily reflects higher use of cash for working capital predominantly in inventory, as well as strategic initiatives and higher payments for interest and taxes.  During 2018 and 2017, capital expenditures totaled $42 million and $81 million, respectively, reflecting the completion in early 2018 of spending in connection with the completion of the airlaid capacity expansion project. 
The following charts present financial information for the periods indicated.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") by business unit represents operating profit as presented in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization (totals exclude corporate unallocated costs and other income and expense items).  A reconciliation of adjusted earnings per share to the nearest GAAP measure is incorporated by reference to Item 7 – Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
† Results are from continuing operations with an assumed tax rate of 40% for 2016 – 2017.

PROXY SUMMARY
Compensation Highlights
The Compensation Committee designs compensation programs that reflect the Company's financial performance and are market-competitive based on a person's responsibilities, individual performance and ability to exemplify the Company's Core Values (Integrity, Financial Discipline, Mutual Respect, Customer Focus, and Environmental and Social Responsibility). The objectives of the Company's executive compensation programs are to attract, retain, motivate, and reward executives crucial to achieving the Company's strategic plan and creating long-term shareholder value.  Our compensation programs are organized around three principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Pay for Performance       Pay at Risk     Shareholder Alignment    
      Pay for Performance       Pay at Risk     Shareholder Alignment    
      Rewarding achievement of financial outcomes that increase shareholder value       Providing a mix of compensation with strong emphasis on short- and long-term incentives tied to the Company's financial performance     Requiring executives to own a meaningful personal stake in the Company

• Added a cumulative three-year relative Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") modifier to performance share awards beginning in 2018 to emphasize the long-term nature of the program and reward for outperformance versus peers; and 
• Under the annual bonus plan for the Business Unit Presidents the weight of business unit operating profit metric results in the short-term incentive plan was increased from 40% to 70% to emphasize the need for continued growth of the engineered materials business. 
[END TABLE]
Payout results under our 2018 compensation programs included the following, reinforcing the pay-for-performance nature of our incentive plans:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No payouts were earned under the Company's short-term incentive plan due to below threshold performance achieved on the Company's operating net income, Business Unit operating profit and cash flow metrics. 
• For the performance shares granted in 2017, a payout of 50.5% of target was earned based on cumulative EBITDA and average return on capital employed ("ROCE") performance for the performance period ending December 31, 2018.  Service through December 31, 2019 is required for vesting and no TSR modifier applies to this grant.

PROXY SUMMARY
Governance and Best Practices
Comprised entirely of independent directors, the Compensation Committee regularly monitors and implements best practices in executive compensation and governance.  The following practices demonstrate our commitment to strong governance within our executive compensation programs:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 What We Do  What We Don't Do 
 ✓  Maintain a pay mix that is heavily performance-based.        X  Provide for excise tax gross-ups in the event of a change in control, starting with newly eligible executives in 2011. 
 ✓  Establish compensation levels after consideration of peer group market data, generally targeted at the size-adjusted 50th percentile for total direct compensation (base, short- and long-term incentive), with the ability to pay higher or lower based on breadth of leadership experience.        X  Backdate or reprice stock options or stock appreciation rights. 
 ✓  Assess and design compensation programs to mitigate compensation-related risks.        X  Pay dividend equivalents on unearned performance awards. 
 ✓  Maintain stock ownership guidelines for executives.        X  Permit hedging transactions or short sales. 
 ✓  Use multiple performance metrics in the short- and long-term incentive plans to avoid heavy reliance on one definition of success.        X  Permit pledging or holding Company stock in a margin account. 
 ✓  Maintain a clawback policy.         X  Provide excessive perquisites. 
 ✓  Require double-trigger vesting of long-term incentives at change in control.             
 ✓  Maintain holding requirements on equity grants.             
 ✓  Regularly engage with shareholders to gather input and feedback on compensation program design.             
 ✓  Retain an independent compensation consultant who meets regularly in executive session with the Compensation Committee.

Proposal 2: Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year 2019. Deloitte audited the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
Although shareholder ratification is not required by our organizational documents or applicable law, the Board believes that it is a sound corporate governance practice to seek shareholder ratification of the appointment of Deloitte. In the event the shareholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection. 
A Deloitte representative is expected to attend the Annual Meeting and will be available to respond to appropriate shareholder questions. 
What did the Company pay its independent registered public accounting firm in 2017 and 2018? 
For the years ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2018, fees paid to Deloitte by the Company were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    2017        2018    
 Audit Fees(1)  $  3,002,418        $  3,030,181    
 Audit Related Fees(2)     311,991        $  564,470    
 Tax Fees(3)     238,000        $  463,209    
 Total Fees  $  3,552,409        $  4,057,860    
 (1)  Audit Fees - were for professional services rendered for the annual audits of the consolidated financial statements of the Company including the audits of internal control over financial reporting, review of quarterly financial statements included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and statutory audits and regulatory filings in foreign jurisdictions.   
 (2)  Audit-Related Fees – were for assurance and related services reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company's consolidated financial statements, including, in 2017 and 2018, the audit of carve-out financial statements. 
 (3)  Tax Fees – were primarily for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning services, including tax planning and consultations.  
[END TABLE]
All of Deloitte's 2018 services for the Company were permissible under applicable laws and regulations.  The Audit Committee's Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy ("Pre-Approval Policy") provides for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services performed by Deloitte. Under the Pre-Approval Policy, the Audit Committee must pre-approve specific services, including fee levels, to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm in a designated category (audit, audit-related, tax services and all other services). For fiscal year 2018, 100% of all Fees were approved by the Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee may delegate this authority in writing to one or more of its members, and in such case the member or members to whom such authority is delegated must report their decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT  › 13
Proposal 3: Advisory Approval of Named Executive Officer Compensation ("Say-on-Pay" Vote) 
Executive compensation is an important topic for our shareholders. At the core of our executive compensation philosophy is the belief that compensation should reflect performance; be fair, competitive and reasonable; and be determined in a manner consistent with the Company's long-term strategy, competitive industry practice, sound corporate governance principles and shareholder interests. We believe our compensation program is strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. We urge our shareholders to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") section of this proxy statement for additional details on the Company's compensation philosophy and objectives and the 2018 compensation of the NEOs. 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the "Exchange Act"), we are asking shareholders to vote on the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion is hereby APPROVED. 
As an advisory vote, the results on this proposal are non-binding. Nevertheless, the Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our shareholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for our NEOs. 
The Board has adopted a policy providing for annual say-on-pay advisory votes. The next say-on-pay advisory vote will be held at our 2020 Annual Meeting. 
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" the non-binding resolution approving the compensation paid to the NEOs, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion.

 Corporate Governance and Board of Directors 
Corporate Governance Principles 
The Board and Management are dedicated to effective corporate governance. The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Principles that provide a framework for the Company's governance. The Board has also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and a Code of Business Ethics for our CEO and Senior Financial Officers. The Corporate Governance Principles are set forth in full on the Corporate Governance page of the Company's website at www.glatfelter.com/about_us/corporate_governance, which contains the Company's Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, its Code of Business Conduct, a list of the directors and executive officers of the Company, the charters of each of the 
Committees of the Board, and the Company's Code of Business Ethics for the CEO and Senior Financial Officers. Copies of these materials are available, in print at no charge, upon request to the Secretary of the Company at 96 South George Street, Suite 500, York, PA 17401-1434. 
The Company intends to satisfy the disclosure requirement for any future amendments to, or waivers from, its Code of Business Conduct or Code of Business Ethics for the CEO and Senior Financial Officers by posting such information on its website. 
Board Composition and Leadership 
The Board currently consists of nine members, but Mr. Ill will not be standing for re-election.  Based on the smaller size of the Company the Board will be reduced to eight members effective on the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Each year, the Board elects one of its members to serve as Chair. Under the Board's governance structure, the Chair: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• presides at all meetings of the Board, other than executive sessions;  
• identifies strategic issues to be considered for the Board agenda; and  
• consults with directors on the development of the schedule, agenda and materials for all meetings of the Board.  
[END TABLE]
When considering the election of a Chair, the Board reviews its governance structure and the qualifications of each director and determines who is best qualified to chair the Board. The Board believes the Company and its shareholders are best served by having a Chair who has wide-ranging, in-depth knowledge of the Company's business operations and the Company's industry and who can best execute the Company's strategic plan. Based on his extensive experience and knowledge of the Company's operations, industry, competitive challenges and opportunities, the Board has determined that Dante C. Parrini is the director best qualified to serve in the role of Chair. The Board nominated Mr. Parrini in February 2019 as Chair, subject to his re-election as a director at the Annual Meeting. 
The Board has also determined that when the same person serves as both Chair and CEO, the interests of the Company and the shareholders are best served by appointment of an independent Lead Director. In February 2019, the Nominating and Corporate Governance ("NCG") Committee recommended, and the independent directors approved, Kevin M. Fogarty to continue as the independent Lead Director, effective on the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting, subject to his re-election as a director at the Annual Meeting. The Lead Director presides over the executive sessions of the Board and coordinates and develops the agenda for those sessions. The Lead Director communicates to the Chair and CEO regarding the discussions at executive sessions as appropriate. In the absence or disability of the Chair, the Lead Director assumes the authority of and performs the duties of the Chair, as provided in Section 2.18 of the Company's By-laws, including presiding at any Board meeting at which the Chair is not in attendance. 
Board Independence 
The Corporate Governance Principles and the Company's policies and procedures provide for an empowered, independent Board and the full involvement of the independent members of the Board in the Board's operations and decision making. 
In the Company's Corporate Governance Principles, the Board has adopted the NYSE standards for determining the independence of directors, which require that a director not have a material relationship with the Company. 
Annually, each member of the Board is required to complete a questionnaire designed, in part, to provide information to assist the Board in determining if the director is independent under 
NYSE rules and our Corporate Governance Principles. In addition, each director or nominee for director has an affirmative duty to disclose to the NCG Committee relationships between and among that director (or an immediate family member), the Company, and/or Management. The Board has determined the following directors nominees are independent and have no material relationship with the Company: Ms. Dahlberg and Messrs. Brown, DeBenedictis, Fogarty, Hall, Naples and Stewart. The Board has determined Mr. Parrini, as the Company's CEO, is not an independent director as defined under the NYSE listing standards and the Company's Corporate Governance Principles.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS
Evaluation of Board Nominees 
The NCG Committee reviews all director nominations submitted to the Company, including individuals recommended by shareholders, directors or members of Management. When evaluating whether to recommend an individual for nomination or re-nomination, the NCG Committee will consider, at a minimum and in accordance with the Company's Corporate Governance Principles, the candidate's independence, availability to serve on the Board, knowledge, experience, skills, expertise, wisdom, integrity, business acumen and understanding of the Company's business environment. 
In evaluating director candidates, the NCG Committee considers a wide variety of qualifications, attributes and other factors and recognizes that a diversity of viewpoints and practical experiences can enhance the effectiveness of the Board. Accordingly, as part of its evaluation of each director candidate, the NCG Committee takes into account how that candidate's background, experience, qualifications, attributes and skills meet the changing needs of the Company, and may complement, supplement or duplicate those of other prospective candidates. 
The NCG Committee reviews the qualifications of each incumbent director, including the director's understanding of the Company's businesses and the environment in which the Company operates, attendance and participation at meetings and independence, including any relationships with the 
Company. Prior to nomination, each candidate for director must consent to stand for election, and each director nominee must agree in writing to abide by the Company's majority voting policy. 
After the NCG Committee has completed its evaluation of all director candidates, it presents a recommended slate of directors to the Board for consideration and approval. The NCG Committee also discusses with the Board any candidates considered by the NCG Committee but not recommended for election or re-election as a director. 
We will report any material change to this procedure in a quarterly or annual filing with the SEC. In addition, we will make any changes to this procedure available promptly by posting that information on the Corporate Governance section of our website at http://www.glatfelter.com/about_us/ corporate_governance. 
Based on the process described above, the NCG Committee recommended, and the Board approved to nominate, each of the incumbent directors for re-election at the Annual Meeting. These decisions were based on the individual experience, qualifications, attributes and skills of each candidate, including as described in the skills matrix on page 3. The NCG Committee and the Board assessed these factors in light of the Company's business, which provides diverse lines of engineered materials. 
Resignation and Majority Voting Policy 
Director Nominee Irrevocable Resignation
Each person who is nominated to stand for election as director must, as a condition to such nomination, tender an irrevocable resignation in advance of the meeting for the election of directors.  Such resignation will be effective if, pursuant to the Company's By-laws, (a) the person does not receive a majority vote at the next meeting for the election of directors, or (b) in the case of a nominee who is an incumbent director, the Board accepts the resignation.
Majority Voting
Contested Election. In an election of directors, where the Board determines that the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast.
Uncontested Election. If in an election of directors in which the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, any nominee who is not an incumbent director and receives a plurality of the votes cast but does not receive a majority of the votes cast, the nominee's resignation will be automatically accepted.  If the nominee is an incumbent director and receives a plurality but not majority of the votes cast, the NCG Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept the director's resignation or whether other action should be taken.  The incumbent director not receiving a majority of the votes cast will not participate in the NCG Committee's recommendation or the Board's decision regarding the tendered resignation.  The independent members of the Board will consider the NCG Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose the Board's decision and the basis for that decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the final election results.  
A director whose resignation is not accepted by the Board will continue to serve until the next annual meeting at which he or she is up for election and until his or her successor is duly elected, or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director's resignation is accepted by the Board, or if a nominee for director who is not an incumbent director is deemed to have been elected and to have automatically resigned, then the Board, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the Company's By-laws, or may amend the Company's By-laws to decrease the size of the Board.

Board Meetings 
The Board held eight meetings during 2018. The standing committees established by the Board held a total of 17 meetings in 2018 (including one meeting held by the Finance Committee, which was dissolved in May 2018). Each incumbent director attended at least 90% of the total number of Board and Committee meetings on which he or she served in 2018. Independent directors meet in regularly scheduled executive sessions (without Management), presided by the Lead Director. 
The Company does not have a policy regarding director attendance at the Annual Meeting, though all directors traditionally attend the Annual Meeting. Eight of our nine directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
Committees of the Board of Directors 
Our Board has three standing committees: Audit, Compensation and Nominating & Corporate Governance (NCG). In May 2018, the Finance Committee was dissolved and its duties assumed by the Board and other Board Committees.  Each committee has its own Charter, which is available, at no charge, from the Secretary or on the Company's website at http://www.glatfelter.com/about_us/corporate_governance. 
The Board determined that all members of each of the Audit, Compensation, and NCG Committees are independent as required under the current listing standards of the NYSE and the SEC's applicable rules and regulations. 
The following chart provides a summary of each committee's duties and responsibilities.

Continuing Board Education 
We believe that our shareholders are best served by a Board that is well versed in subject matter relevant to board service and thoroughly comprehends the role and responsibilities of an effective board in the oversight and management of the Company.  We feel it is appropriate for our directors to have access to educational programs on an ongoing basis to assist them in discharging their duties as directors.  Since November 
2017, the Company has been a member of the National Association of Corporate Directors.  This membership provides continuing education programs, research data, conferences and other resources for the Company's directors and executives.   The NCG Committee periodically reviews and oversees orientation programs for newly-elected directors and continuing education programs for incumbent directors.
Risk Oversight 
The Board performs its oversight role using several different levels of review. For its reviews of the Company's business unit operations and corporate functions, the Board reviews and considers the primary risks associated with those units and functions. The Board also reviews risks associated with the Company's strategic plan at an annual strategic planning session and periodically throughout the year as part of its consideration of the Company's strategy. 
Each Committee also oversees the management of Company risks falling within the Committee's areas of responsibility. In performing this oversight function, each Committee has full access to Management as well as the ability to engage advisors. At each Board meeting, the Chair of each Committee reports to the Board on the Committee's oversight activities. 
The Company continues to manage its enterprise risks through a variety of policies, programs and internal control functions and processes designed to identify the primary risks and protect the Company's operations and reputation while ensuring legal compliance. The below chart summarizes the Board's risk- governance framework.

[END TABLE]
Non-employee directors receive compensation for their service that is designed to compensate them fairly for the time, effort and accountability required of a Board member and align their interests with our stockholders.  In making its recommendation to the Board on independent director compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the results of an analysis of director compensation provided by Meridian Compensation Partners LLC, independent compensation consultant.  In 2018, Meridian conducted a competitive assessment of the Company's compensation program for non-executive directors.  The assessment included a review of annual cash retainers, annual equity grants, meeting fees and Committee fees compared to the Company's compensation peer group (see page 29 regarding the 2018 Compensation Peer Group).  The results of the assessment determined that non-executive director total compensation approximates the median of the peer group, and that the Company's pay policies are aligned with market.  
Cash Compensation 
In 2018 each non-employee director received an annual retainer fee of $70,000, paid in cash. In addition to the annual retainer, non-employee directors were paid in cash $1,500 for each Committee meeting they attended in excess of eight Committee meetings per year. The director serving as Chair of the Audit Committee was paid an additional $20,000 in cash for his service; the director serving as Chair of the Compensation Committee was paid an additional $15,000 in cash for his service; the directors serving as Chair of the Finance Committee and the NCG Committee each received an additional $10,000 in cash for their service. The Lead Director received an additional $20,000 for his service in that capacity. All accrued, but unpaid, director cash compensation payments are made twice annually, on May 1 and November 1. 
Equity Compensation 
In 2018, each non-employee director received an annual RSU award valued at $115,000 on the grant date. Such awards vest 100%, all restrictions lapse and the shares are paid out on the first anniversary of the grant date.  During the one-year vesting period, quarterly dividends accrue in the form of additional RSUs (but are not paid until the awards vest). RSUs granted to directors will immediately vest upon a change in control. In the event of the death or disability of the director, all unvested RSUs will become immediately vested, and the restrictions will lapse. 
Deferred Compensation 
Pursuant to the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, every year each director may elect to defer 50%, 75% or 100% of his or her annual retainer for serving on the Board, but any fees paid to a director for attending meetings of any Committee or for serving as a Chair may not be deferred. No deferral elections were made in 2018. 
Other Benefits and Coverage 
Each non-employee director is covered by the Company's director and officer liability insurance policy, has entered into an indemnification agreement with the Company, and is covered under the Company's travel accident insurance policy.
Share Ownership Guidelines 
The Company has established share ownership guidelines for non-employee directors to enhance their alignment with shareholders' interests. The share ownership guidelines preclude the sale of shares by a director until he or she holds shares with a value equal to 5X the annual Board retainer of $70,000. Directly held shares and unvested RSUs count toward attainment of the guideline.

Glatfelter enhances everyday life for millions of people around the world through the products we make, the manner in which we conduct our business and the value that we generate for all stakeholders. "Sustainability" means striking the appropriate balance between our environmental responsibilities, financial performance, and social responsibilities. Only through continually achieving this balance can we truly be sustainable.Every day, Glatfelter PEOPLE bring this sustainability mindset to the workplace and the communities we call home.  Most of our facilities are located in small communities where our actions make a lasting impact. As an employer, we understand the integral role we play in these communities because of the taxes we pay, the jobs we create that sustain families, and the philanthropic endeavors we support. We actively encourage our 2,600 employees to be involved in their communities and the activities important to them.
For 154 years we have taken seriously our role as a responsible corporate citizen. The confidence and trust our customers, employees, and communities have placed in us must be consistently earned over time through our performance and commitment to building a better tomorrow.
Environmental Responsibility
Looking at our products' lifecycles, incorporating sustainable materials and creating products that conserve resources and improve everyday life are some of the ways we protect the environment. Air emission methods, water discharge practices and production processes are all thoughtfully examined. Increasing our use of environmentally-friendly raw materials and renewable fibers, as well as reducing waste by recycling any off-quality products, helps to reduce our environmental footprint.
Glatfelter focuses on finding new and beneficial ways of using the waste and byproduct of our airlaid manufacturing process, alone or in combination with other materials, to meet needs that exist in our society. Thanks to airlaid's high-fluid absorption and retention properties, additional applications in North America include animal bedding, spill control, and agricultural functions. Last year, Glatfelter's AMBU waste prevention, re-use, and recycling initiatives successfully diverted 96 percent of airlaid byproducts away from landfills and incinerators.
When Unilever wanted to offer its customers a fully biodegradable tea bag through its PG Tips brand, the company turned to Glatfelter's Dynagreen filter paper. Glatfelter developed the paper, which uses a plant-based biopolymer rather than a more traditional crude oil polymer, as the heat-sealable component in the paper—making it fully biodegradable.  It was an environmentally-driven decision to create this alternative for our customers.
Conservation and innovation are necessary to sustain the Earth's natural resources, which is why we are working with our customers and suppliers to create value and develop sustainable, global solutions.
Economic Sustainability
Since 1864, Glatfelter has been a secure and profitable investment for the communities in which we operate, our skilled and dedicated employees, the countless suppliers who rely on us to help keep their small businesses in operation, and our investors, who provide us the opportunity to grow stronger and return value.
We have built a business model around high-value niche markets using speed, flexibility, innovation, solid operational performance and customer intimacy. This model has enabled us to build strong customer relationships and enhance shareholder value. It has also positioned us to reinvest in our business to develop new world-class products. 
In June 2018, Glatfelter celebrated the grand opening of its state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas, which began operations earlier in the year. It is Glatfelter's first newly-constructed facility and first airlaid facility located within the United States. The opening of the Fort Smith facility made Glatfelter the world's largest producer of airlaid material and cemented our position as a leader in the personal care market.
In October 2018, Glatfelter further expanded its airlaid capacity by acquiring Georgia-Pacific's European Nonwovens business with operations located in Steinfurt, Germany and sales offices in France and Italy.  The Steinfurt facility produces high-quality airlaid products for the table top, wipes, hygiene, food pad, and other nonwoven materials markets.  The acquisition complemented Glatfelter's existing business, provided immediate financial benefit and marked a key milestone in accelerating the growth of our engineered materials businesses.
With a strong balance sheet and investments in new products, Glatfelter is strategically positioned for continual growth and to become the global supplier of choice in the markets we serve.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Social Responsibility
From a well-established safety management system to ongoing training efforts and charitable giving programs, Glatfelter encourages a work environment that is safe, promotes healthy living and gives back to the community.
Globally, Glatfelter completed 2018 with a total case incident rate ("TCIR") of 1.08.  Half of all our facilities have safety rankings among the industry's top 25% or better.  With every injury-free day that passes we get closer to earning world-class safety performance.
Concern and caring for current and future generations is a critical part of sustainability. By investing in employee education through U.S.-based tuition reimbursement and European-based apprenticeship programs, Glatfelter is helping to strengthen communities in the regions in which we operate by living our Core Values and providing opportunities to others. 
The ability to develop highly skilled workers is a key competitive advantage, and one that our leaders in Gernsbach, Germany leverage through a proven apprenticeship program.  Apprentices alternate for three years between a vocational education classroom and the Gernsbach facility, receiving real-world experience to become proficient as paper technology engineers, industrial clerks (office workers), electrical technicians, and industrial mechanics, careers that depend on internship-trained workers.  A similar apprenticeship program was implemented in 2017 for our United Kingdom manufacturing operations. 
Nearly all apprentices complete their on-the-job training and 92% go on to become loyal employees.  In fact, more than 40% of Gernsbach's 650 employees are former apprentices.  Gernsbach's training and apprenticeship programs are just one example of Glatfelter's dedication to developing a world-class workforce with the technical know-how and commitment to customer service that customers have come to rely on for more than 150 years.
Through philanthropy and volunteerism, we impact many communities—and many countries—in positive ways, helping to ensure the sustainability of our business, employees, customers, and fellow world residents.  Volunteer services embrace many areas of the community, including the arts, education, economic development and the environment.
Our facility in Gernsbach, Germany supported local cultural organizations and partnered with educators to sustain healthy families.  In Ober-Schmitten, Germany, Glatfelter PEOPLE participated in an annual challenge run for charity, while the Falkenhagen, Germany facility lent charitable support to the local art club, "Friends of Art – Pritzwalk."  
Glatfelter's Fort Smith, Arkansas, PEOPLE engaged in a variety of projects supporting community organizations like the United Way of Fort Smith and Hope Humane Society, while the Corporate Office partnered with the York, Pennsylvania-based water company and health system and underwrote a Summer Reading Program for more than 10,000 local children.  Our facility in Gatineau, Canada, sponsored a year-long urban ecology and community engagement program for teenagers.
In the Philippines, we facilitate an abaca sustainability initiative aimed at improving people's lives.  Since its inception, the program has offered agricultural education, training and certification coordination for hundreds of local farmers, and it has established and supported a women's handicraft group, generating income for many families in the area.  The Philippines Team also demonstrated incredible commitment to the local community with donations of water, food and personal hygiene supplies to the Marawi Relief Operation and Relief Center.
Together, Glatfelter PEOPLE are contributing to the betterment of the communities in which we operate and live around the world.

INTRODUCTION 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") describes the Company's executive compensation philosophy and programs, the 2018 compensation decisions made by the Compensation Committee and the factors influencing their decisions.  The CD&A focuses on the compensation of the following 2018 named executive officers ("NEOs"): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Dante C. Parrini, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO")  
• John P. Jacunski, Executive Vice President ("EVP") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO")  
• Christopher W. Astley, Senior Vice President ("SVP") and Business Unit President, Advanced Airlaid Materials ("AMBU")  
• Samuel L. Hillard, Vice President ("VP"), Corporate Development & Strategy 
• Martin Rapp, SVP and Business Unit President, Composite Fibers ("CFBU")  
[END TABLE]
On February 28, 2019, the Board appointed Mr. Hillard to the position of Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, effective March 1, 2019.  Mr. Hillard succeeds Mr. Jacunski, who will be leaving the Company effective March 31, 2019.  In addition, Mr. Rapp will be leaving the Company effective October 1, 2019.  The responsibilities of Mr. Rapp's role will be redefined as part of the migration from a business unit structure to a functional operating model, as announced in the Company's March 1, 2019 press release.
Upon execution of severance agreements, the Company will disclose the terms of such agreements by filing Current Reports on Form 8-K pursuant to Item 5.02(e).  
SAY-ON-PAY VOTE AND SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
Overview 
An advisory shareholder vote on the Company's executive compensation practices ("Say-on-Pay") was held at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, with 96% of the shares voting in favor of the Company's NEO compensation.  During 2017, we engaged in extensive shareholder engagement to solicit feedback on our executive compensation programs and implemented several changes between 2017 and 2018 to improve alignment with shareholder expectations.  The following changes took effect in 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For 2018, the Compensation Committee approved short-term incentive compensation targets based on Company growth and financial improvement from year to year, tied directly to the 2018 operating plan.  The rigorous targets took into consideration the expected market conditions from each business unit, including gains in key markets, recently developed new products, the completion of major capital investments, and cost optimization initiatives, with an overall focus on adjusting to pressures in specialty paper markets and gains in engineered products;  
• The Compensation Committee added a cumulative three-year relative Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") as a modifier to PSAs; and 
• Under the annual bonus plan for Business Unit Presidents, the weight of business unit operating profit metric results in the short-term incentive plan was increased from 40% to 70% to emphasize the need for continued growth of the engineered materials business. 
[END TABLE]
These actions were intended to further align the Company's compensation philosophy and executive compensation practices with shareholder expectations, enhancing pay for performance and pay at risk, as reflected in our favorable Say-on-Pay vote in 2018.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
2018 Year in Review 
In 2018 our strategy focused on leveraging organic growth and growth through acquisitions in global engineered materials businesses.  Our business has undergone a significant strategic transformation into a leading global supplier of engineered materials. Milestones achieved in 2018 include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    1.  The successful production of airlaid wipes product from our new $90 million facility in Arkansas. This facility, with 20,000 metric-ton capacity, was built to meet the growing demands of the North American market;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    2.  The acquisition of a European nonwovens business based in Steinfurt, Germany for $181 million. The facility is a state-of-the-art, 32,000-metric-ton-capacity manufacturing facility that employs approximately 220 people; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    3.  Delivered on commitment to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Specialty Papers business unit by successfully completing its sale for $360 million. 
[END TABLE]
These actions were pivotal steps as we build the new Glatfelter, which is more focused on businesses with attractive growth profiles, wider margins and lower capital investment.  The new Glatfelter is approximately a $1 billion revenue business with two global operating units serving high-valued, niche nonwovens growth markets.  
For 2018, we reported the following key financial results (from continuing operations giving effect to Specialty Papers business unit as a discontinued operation):
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consolidated net sales totaled $866.3 million compared with $800.4 million in 2017; and 
• Adjusted income totaled $9.2 million, or $0.21 per share, compared with $26.4 million or $0.59 per share in 2017. 
[END TABLE]
Additionally, as we seek to optimize the efficiency of our business, in the third quarter of 2018 we launched plans to right-size our corporate headquarters which is expected to generate $14 million to $16 million of annual savings by the end of 2019.
From an operating perspective our 2018 results were below expectations.  Results were adversely impacted by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Rapid and significant increases in input costs together with limited selling price increases due to competitive environment in CFBU; 
• Slower than anticipated ramp-up of North American capacity in AMBU together with extended qualification period for new customers; and 
• A higher tax rate due in part to the new U.S. tax laws and lower domestic earnings as a result of the divestiture of SPBU. 
[END TABLE]
The following provides a summary for each of our business units' performance in 2018.
ADVANCED AIRLAID MATERIALS
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Net sales increased $55.3 million and totaled $311.4 million in 2018, primarily due to higher shipping volumes reflecting 5.6% organic growth and the Steinfurt acquisition. 
• The Steinfurt acquisition and the Fort Smith facility increased production capacity by 52,000 metric tons. 
• Operating income totaled $29.9 million in 2018, substantially in-line with the prior year.  
[END TABLE]
COMPOSITE FIBERS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Net sales increased $10.6 million, or 1.9%, and totaled $554.9 million in 2018.  On a constant currency basis, net sales declined 1.5% and shipping volumes declined 4.4%. 
• Higher raw material and energy prices adversely impacted results by $17.1 million. 
• Operating income decreased $13.9 million to $48.4 million in 2018 primarily due to significantly higher input costs.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
2018 Compensation Overview
The elements of our executive compensation programs for 2018 included base salary, short- and long-term incentives, minimal perquisites, and retirement and other benefits, as summarized in the following table: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Primary Elements of Compensation 
 Element  Form  Relation to Performance 
 Base Salary  Fixed Cash  Reflects each executive's performance, responsibilities, skills and value to the Company 
 Short-Term Incentive ("STI")  Annual Cash Bonus  (Management Incentive Plan)  Variable pay motivates and rewards executives for achieving annual financial results 
 Short-Term Incentive ("STI")  Annual Cash Bonus  (Management Incentive Plan)  Variable pay motivates and rewards executives for achieving annual financial results 
 Long-Term Incentives ("LTI")  Performance Share Awards ("PSAs")  Variable pay motivates and rewards executives for achieving cumulative business results derived from the Company's strategic plan; directly aligns Management's interests with shareholders' interests 
 Other Benefits  Pension and 401(k) plan, supplemental retirement plans, health and welfare benefits, severance arrangements and minimal perquisites  Market-competitive offerings to attract and retain high caliber executive talent 
[END TABLE]
2018 NEO Compensation Overview and Highlights
The NEOs received the following compensation, with short- and long-term incentives linked to Company performance: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salaries:  
    o  All NEOs received salary increases in 2018, following 2017 when all NEO salaries were frozen.  The average of all increases was 4.5% and increases were based on individual performance and market-competitive compensation levels for the roles.    
• Short-term incentive ("STI") awards payable under the Management Incentive Plan ("MIP"):  
    o  The NEOs' annual incentives under the MIP were contingent on the achievement of Operating Net Income ("ONI") and Free Cash Flow (each as defined under Elements of Compensation; Short-Term Incentives: The Management Incentive Plan section), to encourage the executives to focus on earnings and cash flow generation at the corporate level.  STI awards for business unit leaders (Messrs. Astley and Rapp) were also based on the operating profit aligned to the performance of their respective business units.   
    o  Individual STI target bonus opportunities were unchanged for 2018, except that Mr. Hillard received a five percent target increase to align with market-competitive levels (i.e. market median). 
    o  Financial performance and payout results: 
    -  Results for ONI, Free Cash Flow, and AMBU and CFBU operating profits all fell below the threshold as compared to the financial targets established by the Compensation Committee at the start of the performance period.  As a result, none of the NEOs received STI payouts for fiscal year 2018 performance.   
• Long-term incentives ("LTI"):  
    o  The Company provided all NEOs with market-competitive equity awards tied to long-term performance measures derived from the Company's strategic plan.  
    o  The long-term incentive program ("LTIP") is primarily performance-based with 60% of a NEOs equity value (at target) awarded in PSAs tied directly to the achievement of Return on Capital Employed ("ROCE") and EBITDA goals.  The remaining value is in time-vested RSUs.   
    -  PSAs have a three-year vesting period and provide an opportunity to receive shares of Company common stock contingent upon the achievement of two-year performance goals tied to ROCE and cumulative EBITDA and excluding unusual items.  A three-year relative cumulative TSR modifier also applies to grants beginning in 2018.  The Compensation Committee added this metric to the program after receiving feedback from key shareholders following an outreach program conducted in 2017. 
    -  RSUs cliff vest at the end of a three-year vesting period based on continued service and are designed to promote retention and provide motivation to increase share value.  RSUs are not subject to a TSR modifier. 
    o  The PSAs granted in 2016, which vested at the end of the three-year period on December 31, 2018, resulted in a 93.4% payout based on cumulative EBITDA and average ROCE performance for the performance period which ended on December 31, 2017.  The 2016 PSAs are not subject to a TSR modifier.  Additional details regarding these performance results are provided on page 34. 
    o  For the PSAs granted in 2017, which are earned based on cumulative EBITDA and average ROCE performance for the performance period ending December 31, 2018, a payout of 50.5% of target was achieved.  Service through December 31, 2019 is required for vesting and no TSR modifier applies to this grant.  Additional details regarding the performance results are provided on page 35. 
    o  To recognize his achievements with the SPBU divestiture and nonwoven acquisition during 2018, Mr. Hillard received a one-time retention grant of 31,170 RSUs on December 20, 2018, in addition to his annual grants under the LTIP.  Mr. Hillard must remain employed for three years to vest in the award.   
[END TABLE]
2019 PROXY STATEMENT  › 27
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
In addition to total direct compensation (consisting of base salary, STI and LTI) the Company provides retirement benefits to NEOs which are important for long-term retention. Messrs. Parrini and Jacunski participate in legacy pension plans that the Compensation Committee considers prior commitments based on their long service.  The legacy pension plans (qualified and non-qualified) have been closed to new entrants since 2007.  Changes in the pension value illustrated in the proxy Summary Compensation Table are legacy pension agreements and determined in substantial part by actuarial factors outside the Compensation Committee's direct control (see footnote 4 of the Summary Compensation Table for additional details regarding change in pension values).
Additional details regarding the compensation programs are included in the Compensation Programs and Elements of Compensation and Target Pay Mix sections of the CD&A.
COMPENSATION PROGRAMS 
Compensation Program Objectives 
The objectives of the Company's executive compensation programs are to attract, retain, motivate, and reward those executives crucial to the success of the Company and to create long-term shareholder value.  Our programs are organized around three principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Pay for Performance       Pay at Risk     Shareholder Alignment    
      Pay for Performance       Pay at Risk     Shareholder Alignment    
      Rewarding achievement of financial outcomes that increase shareholder value       Providing a mix of compensation with strong emphasis on short- and long-term incentives tied to the Company's financial performance     Requiring executives to own a meaningful personal stake in the Company    
[END TABLE]
Overview 
The Compensation Committee believes compensation should reflect the Company's financial performance and be competitive based on a person's responsibilities, individual performance and ability to exemplify the Company's Core Values of Integrity, Financial Discipline, Mutual Respect, Customer Focus, and Environmental and Social Responsibility.  The Compensation Committee recommends approval of the Company's compensation philosophy to the Board and oversees the compensation programs for the NEOs and other executive officers of the Company.  All compensation decisions impacting the Chief Executive Officer are approved by the Compensation Committee and require the ratification and approval of the independent members of the Board. 
Total compensation for the NEOs and other Company executive officers consists of base salary, short-term and long-term incentives, retirement and other benefits, and minimal perquisites.  The Company's executive compensation programs generally target total compensation at the size-adjusted 50th percentile of the peer group.  A significant portion of each NEO's compensation is tied to the Company's financial performance.  The opportunity to earn incentive compensation, and the level of pay at risk, generally increases commensurate with the NEO's level of responsibility. 
The Compensation Committee reviews the incentive plans annually, as discussed in the Risk Oversight section of this proxy statement, to determine whether they present undue risk to the Company.
Determination of Compensation Levels 
The Compensation Committee seeks input from certain NEOs, external advisors and other Company executives when determining compensation decisions.  Specifically: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The Compensation Committee retains an independent compensation consultant ("Consultant") that meets in executive session regularly at each meeting to provide advice, information and analysis on executive compensation and benefits. 
 The Compensation Committee confers with the Consultant, the CEO, the CFO, and the Vice President of Human Resources to design compensation programs and obtain background on the Company's key financial objectives, metrics and performance, and design of the Company's short- and long-term incentive compensation programs. 
 Compensation decisions pertaining to the CEO are ratified by the independent members of the Board, based on recommendations by the Compensation Committee and guidance from the Consultant. 
 Compensation decisions pertaining to the NEOs, other than the CEO, are made by the Compensation Committee with consideration of recommendations from the CEO and guidance from the Consultant. 
 The Company's legal counsel and Human Resources staff provide legal, governance and technical input to the Compensation Committee with oversight by the Consultant. 
[END TABLE]
28   ›  P. H. GLATFELTER COMPANY
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Compensation Committee may invite NEOs to attend portions of its meetings; however, the Compensation Committee meets in executive session alone and with and without the Consultant to reach final decisions regarding NEO compensation.
To assist with reviewing NEO compensation, the Compensation Committee considers market benchmark data, pay history, tally sheets, vested and unvested equity holdings and required share ownership.  The Compensation Committee uses this information, in addition to market compensation data, individual and Company performance, and the Company's succession planning when making compensation decisions for each NEO. 
Consistent with the prior year, the Compensation Committee continued to retain the services of Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian") as the Consultant during 2018.  The role of the Consultant is to assist with: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• providing competitive compensation market data;  
• assessing the competitiveness of the executive compensation programs;  
• making recommendations regarding program design based on prevailing market practices and business conditions; and  
• advising the Compensation Committee on:  
    o  the level of each NEO's compensation;  
    o  composition of the compensation peer group;  
    o  incentive plan performance metrics and design;  
    o  external trends and regulatory developments;  
    o  revisions or additions to the Company's executive compensation policies; and o  Say-on-Pay guidance and input. 
[END TABLE]
Compensation Peer Group and Benchmarking Process 
To determine market levels, the Company targets the size-adjusted 50th percentile, and the Compensation Committee reviews target total compensation for similarly situated executives from peer group companies ("Compensation Peer Group") where data is available, as well as from multiple nationally-recognized compensation survey sources including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• William H. Mercer's Executive Compensation Database;  
• Willis Towers Watson's Executive Compensation Database; and  
• Korn Ferry Hay Group's Executive Compensation Database. 
[END TABLE]
A market analysis is performed annually for the CEO and CFO and biennially for the remaining executives, unless market conditions warrant a market study for additional executive roles for the year.  For 2018 compensation decisions, the market review included the total compensation of the CEO and CFO and all other NEOs. 
The Compensation Committee annually reviews the Company's Compensation Peer Group to establish a relevant and appropriate peer group size.  For 2018, AEP Industries was removed due to its acquisition by Berry Global.  The annual revenues of the companies in the 2018 Compensation Peer Group range from $599 million to $6.1 billion with median revenue of $3.4 billion. 
The Compensation Committee believes the current peer group was appropriate for 2018 as it consists of companies within a reasonable revenue range compared to Glatfelter (subject to size-adjusting as described below) in the paper, packaging and forest products industries.  In selecting peer companies, the Compensation Committee targets consistency in the Company's Compensation Peer Group to ensure it continues to reflect companies within its industry for which the Company competes for talent. 
Recognizing that the median annual revenue of the Company's Compensation Peer Group is greater than the Company's 2018 annual revenue, the Company targets the size-adjusted revenue at the 50th percentile through regression analysis to determine appropriate market levels in setting competitive pay.  The Compensation Committee believes the methodology of benchmarking pay to regressed peer compensation levels is a widely-accepted and appropriate methodology.
The following is a list of companies included in the Compensation Peer Group for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2018 Compensation Peer Group 
     Aptar Group, Inc.  Neenah Inc. 
     Avery Dennison Corp.  Packaging Corp. of America 
     Bemis Company Inc.  Potlatch Corp. 
     Clearwater Paper Corp.  Rayonier, Inc. 
     Domtar Corp.  Resolute Forest Products, Inc. 
     Graphic Packaging Holding Co.  Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. 
     Greif, Inc.  Silgan Holdings, Inc. 
     KapStone Paper & Packaging Corp.  Sonoco Products Co. 
[END TABLE]
Although the revenue size of the Company has been reduced significantly following the sale of SPBU, the Committee has decided to keep the Compensation Peer Group unchanged as it considers 2019 pay changes. The peer group companies remain those for whom we compete with for business and for talent, and the statistical analyses used to size-adjust the data compensates for the size variances that exist among the group.  Going forward, we plan to continue to monitor the Compensation Peer Group and also analyze a sub-set of the group (which eliminates those companies with revenues over $5 billion) to ensure that these companies do not skew the overall results of the existing group. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT  › 29
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
TARGET PAY MIX 
Annually, the Compensation Committee reviews the mix of base salary, STI and LTI, which comprises total target direct compensation, for each NEO to ensure an appropriate level of the executives' recurring target compensation is tied to Company performance.  The Compensation Committee believes this approach is appropriate to provide year-over-year consistency in analyzing the pay mix when compared to the peer group. 
The mix of compensation varies for each NEO with an average of 61% of target pay considered at risk.  This average does not include pension or other benefits.  Mr. Parrini has the greatest level of STI and LTI opportunity, with 73% of his total target direct compensation considered at risk.  The Compensation Committee believes this level is appropriate for Mr. Parrini given his responsibility as CEO to deliver and sustain shareholder value. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO Compensation Mix  All Other NEO Average Compensation Mix 
[END TABLE]
Base Salary 
The Compensation Committee believes base salary, which contributes to the Company's compensation objectives of attracting and retaining talented executives, is an important element of compensation.  The base salaries of the NEOs are approved annually by the Compensation Committee and, in the case of the CEO, by the independent members of the Board.  The Compensation Committee considers several factors, without any assigned relative weightings, when determining base salary increases for NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• salary recommendations from the CEO for the NEOs other than himself;  
• Company and individual NEO performance;  
• the accountability and complexity of the NEO's role in attaining Company objectives;  
• the external competitiveness of the NEO's compensation;  
• Company executive succession planning; and 
• internal equity and retention considerations.  
[END TABLE]
For 2018, the following NEO base salary increases were approved, in each case, to more closely approximate the market median and to account for individual performance (following 2017, when base salaries for NEOs were frozen):

Short-Term Incentives: The Management Incentive Plan 
The Company provides an annual STI bonus opportunity to the NEOs under the Company's MIP.  The Compensation Committee approves a target bonus for each NEO expressed as a percentage of the NEO's base salary.  The Compensation Committee establishes target bonuses for the NEOs at the 50th percentile of the market.  There were no changes to NEO target bonuses for 2018 except for Mr. Hillard, whose target was increased by five percentage points for closer alignment to market-competitive levels. 
2018 NEO target bonus opportunities were as follows:

For 2018, the Compensation Committee adopted a MIP design generally consistent with the design used in 2017 with a floor of 80% achievement of target performance which pays 50% of the target award and a ceiling of 140% achievement, which pays 200% of target. Performance below threshold levels results in a zero payout.  The 2018 MIP incorporated the following two metrics for all NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ONI – (weighted 80% for corporate positions and 24% for business unit positions).  ONI is defined as net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("US GAAP"), adjusted to exclude after-tax pension expense, the cost of strategic initiatives, and certain other items as specified by the Compensation Committee.    
• Free Cash Flow – (weighted 20% for corporate positions and 6% for business unit positions).  Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flows from operations determined in accordance with US GAAP less capital expenditures (adjusted to exclude spending related to strategic initiatives), and certain other adjustments as specified by the Compensation Committee.     
• Business Unit Operating Profit – (weighted 70% for business unit positions only). Operating profit is determined in accordance with US GAAP and excludes pension expense and certain non-recurring items as determined by the Compensation Committee.  For 2018 the business unit NEOs' weighting for business unit operating profit was increased from 40% to 70% to emphasize the need for continued growth in the engineered materials business.    
[END TABLE]
These metrics are intended to focus NEOs and other key executives on generating earnings and effectively managing cash flow.  The Compensation Committee supported continuing to use these metrics in 2018 to reinforce the Company's operational and strategic objectives.  
In 2018, the performance metrics were weighted as follows for the NEOs:

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The targeted performance levels of ONI, Free Cash Flow, and business unit operating profit or EBITDA were derived from the Company's 2018 budgeted levels as approved by the Board.  Developing the budget involves a variety of factors and assumptions including the Company's strategic planning process and an assessment of the expected business environment.  The Compensation Committee incorporates a requirement that the Company achieve minimum performance ("Threshold") for each metric separately before any bonus may be earned ("Threshold") on the respective portions of the overall award.
The Compensation Committee set rigorous MIP goals with targets above the prior year actual results to emphasize the importance of year-over-year growth.  In setting performance goals for 2018, the Compensation Committee considered, among other factors, expectations of projected growth in many markets with a focus on markets across engineered products.  The Compensation Committee considered major capital projects expected to be completed, with ongoing long-term investments in AMBU.  In addition, the Compensation Committee considered the increasingly challenging business environment due to secular declines in demand in the former Specialty Papers business unit, increasing competition, and excess capacity in many key markets.  Furthermore, the Compensation Committee considered the risk that adverse global economic conditions could impact our target markets resulting in decreased demand for our products.  In determining 2018 performance results, the Compensation Committee made an adjustment for the last two months of 2018 to account for the sale of the Specialty Papers business unit on October 31.
The following table outlines the approved threshold, target and maximum payment opportunities and financial goals for the NEOs under the 2018 MIP, as well as the weighted payout results based on the performance metric weights.  Because all metrics fell below the required threshold performance, no MIP payouts were earned by any NEOs for 2018 performance.

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee determined that changes to the general design of the LTI awards would be made for 2018 to incorporate a relative TSR modifier to align compensation with performance using an established and appropriate index.  PSAs remain tied to the Company's EBITDA and ROCE performance, with the addition of a three-year relative TSR modifier to be measured against the S&P SmallCap 600 index.  
EBITDA is a commonly used measure of the cash earnings that are generated.  ROCE measures how effectively capital is being employed and the return from capital management decisions.  ROCE, in general terms, is calculated as adjusted earnings divided by a capital base.  These metrics are appropriate due to the focus on efficient use of resources and longer-term profitability across the business units.
PSAs have a two-year performance period and a three-year vesting period, so that a NEO must remain employed for one year after the end of the performance period to receive the underlying shares.  In 2018, the Company added a three-year cumulative relative TSR modifier as part of the PSA design.  The Compensation Committee believes that a two-year performance period is appropriate for PSAs at this time, in order to give more accurate visibility to goal setting.  In determining to establish a two-year performance measurement period for PSAs granted in 2018, the Compensation Committee considered (1) the need to provide line-of-sight to incent executives to achieve capital productivity and earnings goals over the longer-term and (2) the inability to forecast performance goals beyond the two-year period due to cyclical downturns in our business and adverse global economic conditions.  The Compensation Committee decided to set two-year performance goals, with one additional year of time-based vesting (assuming achievement of the performance goals), in order to promote sustained performance focus, encourage long-term retention and align with a three-year vesting period.  The TSR modifier will apply a positive or negative 25% modifier if the Company's TSR is in the first or fourth quartile, respectively.  An overall maximum payment of 200% will be applied regardless of any TSR modifier.
Given their relationship to our annual operating plan and business strategy, the pre-established ROCE and EBITDA goals and their specific target levels for the 2018-2019 performance period are confidential and commercially-sensitive information that we do not publicly disclose until after the performance period is completed.  We believe that such information would provide our competitors, customers and other third parties with significant insights regarding our confidential business strategies and could cause us substantial competitive harm.  The Compensation Committee set 2018-2019 ROCE and EBITDA targets for the PSAs at a level that it believed would be challenging, but possible, for the Company to achieve. 
The RSUs cliff-vest at the end of a three-year period, based on continued service.  The Compensation Committee determined that three-year vesting is appropriate for RSUs because it aligns with the Company's strategic planning cycle and supports retention.  RSUs are not subject to a TSR modifier.
In addition to his annual LTI grant, Mr. Hillard received a one-time retention grant of 31,170 RSUs on December 20, 2018 to recognize his achievements with the SPBU divestiture and nonwoven acquisition during 2018.  Mr. Hillard must remain employed for three years to vest in the award.

PERQUISITES 
Perquisites at Glatfelter are very limited.  The Compensation Committee believes perquisites should be a minimal part of executive compensation.  Perquisites include a club membership for Mr. Parrini and a car allowance for Mr. Rapp, as is customary for executives in Europe.  All NEOs are eligible to receive a Company-paid executive physical and executive long-term disability coverage.  More information on the perquisite costs can be found in the Summary Compensation Table. 
POST-EMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION 
The Compensation Committee believes offering post-employment compensation allows the Company to attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees and executives in the current competitive marketplace. 
The Company provides qualified and non-qualified pension plans for U.S.-based employees and other arrangements for those outside of the U.S.  Regarding the qualified pension plan, eligible employees who were hired prior to 2007 participate in a traditional pension formula and those hired beginning in 2007 and later participate in a cash balance pension formula. 
Non-qualified pension plans consist of a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") and a Supplemental Management 
Pension Plan ("SMPP").  The SERP is tied to the qualified pension plan and provides post-employment benefits for eligible NEOs.  The SMPP provides an Early Retirement Supplement for certain NEOs.  Details regarding pension benefits and potential payments to the NEOs under these plans are discussed in the Pension Benefits section.
All plans except the qualified cash balance and SERP Restoration for cash balance are closed to new entrants. 
The NEOs participate in the following pension plans:

ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES 
Executive Severance Guidelines 
The Company has executive severance guidelines to serve as the basis for determining the severance benefits available to the CEO, EVP, SVPs and other VPs in the case of certain terminations of employment from the Company (other than for cause, resignation, death or disability).  The severance guidelines do not apply in circumstances in which change in control agreements apply.  The Compensation Committee retains the authority to modify or terminate severance arrangements, in its discretion, as circumstances may warrant. Additional details on severance guidelines and potential payments in the event of a termination of employment are discussed in the "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" section. 
Change in Control Arrangements and Double Trigger Equity Grant Vesting 
The Company has entered into Change in Control ("CIC") Agreements with each of the NEOs and certain other executives. The Compensation Committee believes these arrangements will serve as an incentive for executives to act in the interest of shareholders in the event of a CIC, without regard to personal risks to their continued employment resulting from a CIC. Generally, these agreements provide for severance and other benefits to be paid to executives upon a qualifying CIC.  Since 2011, new CIC Agreements do not provide a tax gross-up provision for excise taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  Therefore, Messrs. Astley and Hillard do not have any tax gross-up provisions.  The legacy CIC agreements of Messrs. Parrini, Jacunski and Rapp, which were entered into before 2011, contain tax gross-up provisions. 
The Company's equity grant agreements include "double trigger" provisions that accelerate vesting in the event of a CIC if the executive is terminated without cause or resigns with good reason (as defined in the applicable agreement).  The Compensation Committee believes that the double trigger provision will ensure continuity of Management during mergers and acquisitions and assist with retaining key executives, ultimately benefitting shareholders.  Additional details on the CIC agreements and potential payments in the event of a CIC are discussed in the "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control" section.   
Executive Share Ownership Guidelines 
The Compensation Committee believes it is important to require the Company's senior executives, including NEOs, to meet minimum stock ownership guidelines. 
The executive share ownership guidelines align the interests of the shareholders with the Company's long-term growth strategy. The Compensation Committee determines the guidelines using a multiple of each senior executive's base salary.  Depending on the executive's position, the executive share ownership guidelines require the executive to own Company stock that ranges in value from two to five times the senior executive's base salary as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2018 Share Ownership Guidelines 
 Position  Ownership Guideline (Relative to Base Salary) 
 Position  Ownership Guideline (Relative to Base Salary) 
 CEO  5X 
 CFO  3X 
 Other Executives  2X 
[END TABLE]
The value of required ownership is adjusted annually for salary increases and the number of shares needed to be owned will be affected by changes in stock price.  Directly-owned shares, beneficially-owned shares held indirectly (e.g., by family members, trusts, etc.) and shares held in the 401(k) plan are eligible for satisfying ownership guidelines.  The share ownership guidelines also include unvested restricted stock and RSUs, and earned, but unvested PSAs, consistent with market practices. 
Holding Requirement 
Until the executive share ownership guideline level is attained, executives must retain 50% of net after-tax profit shares realized at exercise of SOSARs and payment of PSAs and RSUs.  The Compensation Committee reviews executives' progress toward satisfying the requirements annually. 
Clawback Policy 
The Compensation Committee has discretion to recover or "claw back" incentive compensation when the basis for recouping performance-based compensation is triggered by a material financial restatement.  The Compensation Committee may recoup performance-based compensation, including cash and equity incentive awards, that is paid within three years prior to a restatement and in excess of the amount the NEO or executive officer would have otherwise received without the material noncompliance.  Recoupment is applicable to an executive who is directly accountable for the cause of the restatement and could apply to any officer in an upward reporting hierarchy to the responsible individual.  In addition, a recoupment could be made for compensation paid in a fiscal year in which an officer engages in intentional misconduct in performing his or her duties. 
Hedging and Pledging Policies 
All executives and directors, including the NEOs, are subject to an insider trading policy under which hedging transactions, including put or call options, short selling or similar hedging activities involving Company stock, and pledging of Company stock are prohibited. 
Tax Deductibility under Code Section 162(m) 
Section 162(m) of the Code generally imposes a $ 1 million deduction limitation on compensation paid to certain executive officers of a publicly-held corporation during the year.  For 2018, the executive officers to whom the Section 162(m) deduction limit applies include the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the next three most highly compensated executive officers, and any such "covered employee" for a year after 2016.  The Compensation Committee reserves discretion to award compensation that is not deductible under Section 162(m), as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
ROLE OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND CONSULTANT INDEPENDENCE 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for approving NEO compensation, and, in the case of the CEO, submits his pay for ratification and approval by the independent members of the Board.  The Chair of the Compensation Committee is responsible for leading the Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee may form subcommittees and delegate authority.  The meetings of the Compensation Committee are regularly attended by the Consultant.  The CEO, CFO, and Vice President of Human Resources also generally attend the Compensation Committee meetings.  All members of Management present at the meeting, including the CEO, are excused from the meeting prior to any discussion of their compensation. The Compensation Committee holds a final executive session with only Compensation Committee members present before approving any compensation. 
The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage compensation consultants, legal counsel or other advisors, as needed.  The Compensation Committee provides oversight and approves related fees and retention terms of the consultants, counsel or advisors, and may select a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other advisor after assessing that person's independence from Management or members of the Compensation Committee. 
During 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Meridian Compensation Partners LLC, an executive compensation consulting firm (the "Consultant"), to provide advice and assistance to the Compensation Committee and to Management in the area of executive and non-employee directors' compensation for the Company.  The Consultant reports directly to the Compensation Committee and has been authorized by the Compensation Committee to work with certain executive officers of the Company and other employees in the Company's human resources, legal and finance departments. 
The Compensation Committee has established several practices to ensure the Consultant's independence, candor and objectivity.  The Consultant is engaged by and reports directly to the Compensation Committee, frequently meets separately with the Compensation Committee with no members of Management present and consults with the Compensation Committee's Chair between meetings as needed.  Management periodically reports to the Compensation Committee the fees paid for services performed by the Consultant, and the Compensation Committee approves the annual work plan and budget for the Consultant.  In 2018, the Compensation Committee assessed the independence of the Consultant and other outside advisors as required under the NYSE listing rules, and considered and assessed all relevant factors, including those required by the SEC that could give rise to potential conflict of interests with respect to the Consultant.  Based on this review, the Compensation Committee did not identify any conflict of interest raised by the work conducted by the Consultant for 2018. 
Report of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company's Compensation Discussion and Analysis with Management.

 (3)  The 2018, 2017 and 2016 amounts reflect cash payments under the Company's MIP.  See discussion of the MIP in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis section."   
 (4)  For each of the NEOs, the estimated amounts reflect the actuarial increase in the present value of benefits under all pension plans established by the Company, based on interest rate and mortality assumptions that are consistent with those used in the Company's financial statements.  The assumptions relating to the same are disclosed in the 2018 Pension Benefits table.  These amounts may reflect benefits which the NEOs are not currently entitled to receive, to the extent that such amounts are not vested.  The amounts shown only include the change in pension value.  They do not include any above-market earnings on nonqualified defined contribution plans.  There are no deferred compensation plans.  The Company did not make any changes to the pension benefits during 2018.  
[END TABLE]
For Mr. Parrini, the change in pension value was a reduction of $860,000, which is reported as $0 for purposes of summary compensation table reporting.  The change in actuarial present value of his pension value is attributable to three factors.  First, higher discount rate assumptions were used to estimate the value of the benefit.  A higher discount rate produces a lower pension value.  Second, as Mr. Parrini worked for a full year in 2018, his pension benefits increased because he earned an additional year of benefit service for pension purposes.   Third, Mr. Parrini's pay decreased, as measured by his average compensation over the five years immediately preceding his assumed retirement.  Mr. Parrini's total compensation decreased by 44% compared to 2017.  Overall, the increase in discount rates and decrease in pay more than offset any increase due to service.  As described in "Pension Benefits," a significant portion of Mr. Parrini's SERP benefit is unvested. 
Mr. Jacunski's change in pension value was a reduction of $10,000, which is reported as $0 for purposes of summary compensation table reporting.  The actuarial present value of his pension is attributable to three factors. First, higher discount rate assumptions were used to estimate the value of the benefit. A higher discount rate produces a lower pension value. Second, as Mr. Jacunski worked for a full year in 2018, his pension benefits increased because he earned an additional year of benefit service. Third, Mr. Jacunski's reported change in the pension value is attributable to a decrease in his pay for 2018, which resulted in only a modest increase in his final average compensation for purposes of the Restoration Pension. Overall, the increase in discount rates more than offset any increases due to service and changes in final average compensation.

CEO Pay Ratio 
We are providing information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Parrini, our CEO, as required by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
For 2018, our ratio was estimated as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Name        Annual Total Compensation   (in 000x) 1 
    Name        Annual Total Compensation   (in 000x) 1 
 CEO        $2,808.1 
 Median Employee        $69.0 
 CEO Pay Ratio        41:1 
    (1)  Annual total compensation includes compensation calculated for purposes of the summary compensation table as well as benefit premiums for the CEO and the median employee. 
• We continued to use October 1 as the date to determine the median employee, which for 2018 included SPBU and Steinfurt employees. 
• All employees throughout our global operations were considered. 
• Given the geographical distribution of our employee population, we use a variety of pay elements to structure the compensation arrangements of employees, with cash compensation being the most commonly used form of annual pay.  Consequently, for purposes of measuring the compensation in determining the median employee, we selected base salary or wages, overtime and short-term incentives as the most appropriate measure of compensation.  In making this determination we annualized the compensation of permanent employees hired between January 1, 2018 and October 1, 2018. 
• Using this methodology, we determined the appropriate median employee to be a full-time employee in Germany.  The 2017 median employee could no longer be used as the employee's employment was terminated during 2018. 
• For purposes of this determination, we applied the appropriate exchange rate to U.S. dollars of the average exchange rate for October 2018 as to our non-US employees. 
[END TABLE]
When calculating the Annual Total Compensation of the CEO, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of our Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement as well as benefit premiums paid by the Company.  We used the same methodology for calculating the Annual Total Compensation for the median employee.

PENSION PLAN OVERVIEW 
QUALIFIED PLANS 
All U.S.-based NEOs participate in the Qualified Pension Plan, which is a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan.  The Qualified Pension Plan has two methods under which participant benefits are determined: the traditional pension and the cash balance pension. 
Traditional Pension (closed to new entrants since 2007) 
Messrs. Parrini and Jacunski were plan participants on January 1, 2007, and are eligible for a normal unreduced retirement pension ("traditional pension") beginning at age 65 equal to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 1.4% of final average compensation multiplied by years of benefit service (to a maximum of 25)       +       0.5% of final average compensation for each year of benefit service in excess of 25   
 1.4% of final average compensation multiplied by years of benefit service (to a maximum of 25)       +       0.5% of final average compensation for each year of benefit service in excess of 25   
[END TABLE]
Eligible compensation includes salary as listed in the Summary Compensation Table, plus paid non-equity incentive plan compensation (to a maximum of the IRS limit, which was $275,000 for 2018). 
The Qualified Pension Plan provides for early retirement benefits for participants who retire at or after age 55 and prior to age 65. 
The amount of the monthly early retirement pension is reduced due to early commencement at the rate of 2.5% per year. 
Cash Balance Pension 
Messrs. Astley and Hillard were hired after January 1, 2007, and therefore participate in the cash balance pension.  At the end of each month, the Company determines contribution credits equal to 5.5% of their eligible monthly base pay. Interest is accrued on the account balance at the end of each month based on an external index (Moody's AA Nominal bond yield).  Full vesting occurs after three years of service.
Mr. Rapp's Pension Agreement
Mr. Rapp is covered under a Retirement Pension Contract, dated October 31, 2007, negotiated with the Company at the time of his hire to offset loss from his prior employer.  Under this arrangement, he is eligible for a normal retirement benefit after having attained age 65.
Mr. Rapp's normal retirement benefit is based on 1.5% of his pensionable income multiplied by his years of service. Pensionable income is the average of his base pay plus bonus for the five years immediately preceding his retirement.  Mr. Rapp is eligible for an early retirement benefit after reaching age 60.  His early retirement benefit equals his normal retirement benefit reduced by 2.5% per year.  Mr. Rapp's normal form of benefit is a 60% joint-and-survivor annuity.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
NON-QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS 
The Company also sponsors for certain executives non-qualified pension plans, providing benefits that coordinate with and supplement the pension plan benefits. 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)
The SERP consists of post-employment benefits for certain NEOs who have been approved for participation by the Compensation Committee, or by the independent members of the Board in the case of the CEO.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Restoration Pension Benefit  The Restoration Pension under the SERP provides those executives whose benefits under the Qualified Pension are reduced due to legal limits with a supplemental pension benefit.  The supplemental benefit restores the portion of the pension benefit that was earned but not able to be paid under the Qualified Pension because of the legal limits provided in the Code.  The Restoration Pension is generally paid in the form of an annuity, except that small benefit amounts are paid in a lump sum.  Employees will generally be eligible for the Restoration Pension if they have at least one year of pensionable compensation in excess of the Code's annual compensation limit for qualified pension plans.  Participants are vested in their Restoration Pension, except in the event of termination for cause and after meeting certain service requirements. 
 Final Average Compensation Pension  The FAC Pension under the SERP pays a pension benefit equal to 2% of the executive's average compensation over the five years immediately preceding his retirement, multiplied by the participant's years of benefit service under the Qualified Pension Plan, up to a maximum of 27.5 years.  The FAC Pension benefits are offset against the Restoration Pension and Traditional Pension Plan benefits.    The FAC Pension only vests at age 55 and is payable following the executive's retirement on or after age 55.  If the FAC Pension is payable prior to age 62, the monthly amount of the benefit is reduced to reflect its early commencement.  A survivor benefit is also payable under the FAC Pension to the participant's surviving spouse in the event of the participant's death before the FAC Pension commences.    Only Mr. Parrini is eligible for the FAC Pension.  If Mr. Parrini receives a FAC Pension, his benefit will be paid in a lump sum.  In the event of a change in control of the Company, the FAC Pension will vest regardless of age, and his FAC Pension benefit will be fixed at 55% of his average final compensation as though he reached normal retirement as defined under the plan.  Mr. Parrini's FAC Pension is currently unvested.    
 Final Average Compensation Pension  The FAC Pension under the SERP pays a pension benefit equal to 2% of the executive's average compensation over the five years immediately preceding his retirement, multiplied by the participant's years of benefit service under the Qualified Pension Plan, up to a maximum of 27.5 years.  The FAC Pension benefits are offset against the Restoration Pension and Traditional Pension Plan benefits.    The FAC Pension only vests at age 55 and is payable following the executive's retirement on or after age 55.  If the FAC Pension is payable prior to age 62, the monthly amount of the benefit is reduced to reflect its early commencement.  A survivor benefit is also payable under the FAC Pension to the participant's surviving spouse in the event of the participant's death before the FAC Pension commences.    Only Mr. Parrini is eligible for the FAC Pension.  If Mr. Parrini receives a FAC Pension, his benefit will be paid in a lump sum.  In the event of a change in control of the Company, the FAC Pension will vest regardless of age, and his FAC Pension benefit will be fixed at 55% of his average final compensation as though he reached normal retirement as defined under the plan.  Mr. Parrini's FAC Pension is currently unvested.

Mr. Parrini's FAC Pension is currently unvested.    
[END TABLE]
Supplemental Management Pension Plan (SMPP) 
The SMPP provides an Early Retirement Supplement to benefits otherwise provided by the Qualified Pension Plan if the participant retires early.  Normal retirement age under the Qualified Pension Plan is age 65; however, under the Qualified Plan, a participant who is at least age 55 may either: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Elect early retirement and receive a reduced monthly early retirement pension that begins immediately following retirement, or  
• Postpone the start of the pension until a later date, but not later than age 65.  
[END TABLE]
If the participant agrees to postpone his or her Qualified Pension Plan pension until at least 36 months following the early retirement date, then the Early Retirement Supplement will pay a supplemental benefit during the 36-month period.  The Early Retirement Supplement is equal to the sum of the monthly amount of the Qualified Pension Plan benefit in the form of a single life annuity. The benefit begins on the first day of the month following early retirement and continues for 36 months (or until normal retirement date), at which time the Qualified Pension Plan pension begins to be paid, subject to a six-month delay as applicable under Section 409A of the Code.  Mr. Jacunski is the only NEO eligible to participate in the SMPP.  Mr. Parrini does not participate in the SMPP since he is eligible for the FAC pension benefits.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
EXECUTIVE TERMINATION GUIDELINES
Payments made to a NEO upon involuntary termination by the Company without cause are made in accordance with the Company's executive termination guidelines.  The executive termination guidelines do not apply if the NEO is eligible to receive payments under a Change in Control Agreement upon a termination of employment.  The table on the following page describes benefits payable under the executive termination guidelines.
CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENTS AND DOUBLE TRIGGER EQUITY VESTING
The Company has entered into a Change in Control Agreement with each NEO as described in the CD&A. Under these agreements, each executive's employment with the Company will continue for two years from the date of a change in control or each executive will become entitled to severance payments and benefits upon termination under certain conditions within such two-year period.  During such period, the employee will continue in a position at least equal to the position held prior to the change in control and will receive compensation and benefits from the Company at least equal to those paid prior to the change in control.  The table below describes the benefits payable under the Change in Control Agreements. 
Change in Control.  Under Change in Control Agreements, change in control means: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the acquisition of direct or indirect beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding voting securities by any person, entity or group, excluding the Company, its subsidiaries, any employee benefit plan of the Company or its subsidiaries; and any purchaser or group of purchasers who are descendants of, or entities controlled by descendants of, P. H. Glatfelter;  
• in any 12-month period, the ceasing of individuals who constitute the Board to constitute at least a majority of the Board, other than any person becoming a director whose election was approved by at least a majority of incumbent directors, excluding any such person whose initial election occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest; or  
• the consummation of (i) a reorganization, merger or consolidation in which shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such event do not, immediately thereafter, beneficially own more than 50% of the combined voting power of the reorganized, merged or consolidated company's then outstanding voting securities; or (ii) a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to a third party.  
[END TABLE]
Tax Gross-Up Payments.  For Change in Control Agreements in effect before 2011 (including Messrs. Parrini, Jacunski and Rapp), if any payment contingent on a change in control is subject to excise tax under the Code, then an additional payment will be made to the executive so that the amount he receives on a net basis will be the same amount he would have received without the excise tax.  Beginning in 2011, the provision for excise tax gross-ups was eliminated from the new Change in Control Agreements for Company executives.  Messrs. Astley and Hillard's Change in Control Agreements, therefore, do not contain a tax gross-up provision. 
"Double Trigger" Provisions.  Under equity grant agreements, a double trigger provision accelerates vesting in the event of a change in control if the executive is terminated without cause or resigns with good reason (as those terms are defined in the agreements).

 Cash Severance  The NEO receives a severance payment in an amount equal to• two times the NEO's annual base salary (at the highest rate achieved before the date of termination), plus• the NEO's annual bonus, defined as the greater of the NEO's three-year average bonus or the NEO's target bonus.  The Compensation Committee may authorize severance benefits if determined to be appropriate.

 Long-Term Incentives ("LTI")  A "double trigger" provision applies, under which RSUs, SOSARs and PSAs will accelerate vesting upon involuntary termination or good reason termination upon or following a change in control.   PSAs will generally be deemed to have been earned at the greater of target or actual performance through the change in control.   In the event of a change in control in which the Company's stock is no longer the stock of the surviving entity, the Company will cause the surviving entity to issue replacement RSUs and PSAs.  A value restoration payment with respect to any vested replacement SOSARs, RSUs or PSAs will be paid based on the difference between the fair market value of the surviving entity's common stock on the date of the change in control and, if less, the fair market value of the surviving entity's common stock on the vesting date (which will include the date of the Participant's involuntary Separation from Service other than for Cause, or voluntary Separation from Service for Good Reason). Any value restoration payment will include interest (at the prime rate of interest of the Company's principal bank in effect on the vesting date for the period between the date of the change in control and the vesting date) and will be paid in cash within thirty (30) days after the vesting date.   RSUs: If the NEO ceases employment other than upon death, disability or retirement, unvested RSUs are forfeited.  If the NEO is terminated for cause, outstanding RSUs, vested or unvested, are forfeited.    For grants prior to 2013 upon death, disability or retirement, unvested RSUs are pro-rated.  For grants beginning in 2013, upon death or disability, vesting of RSUs is accelerated and upon retirement, unvested RSUs are pro-rated.   SOSARs:  If the NEO ceases employment other than upon death, disability, retirement or termination for cause, then, for a period of 90 days following such termination, the NEO may exercise any vested SOSARs. Unvested SOSARs are forfeited.  If the NEO is terminated for cause, outstanding SOSARs, vested or unvested, are forfeited.  Upon retirement, there is pro-rated vesting of SOSARs, and the SOSARs are exercisable for a period of 3 years or if shorter, until the end of the term.  In the case of death or disability, all unvested SOSARs will accelerate and become fully vested and exercisable for three years from the date of such death or disability, or if shorter, until the end of the term.   PSAs:  If the NEO ceases employment, other than upon death, disability or retirement, unvested PSAs are forfeited.

In the event of a change in control, his FAC Pension will vest.  The FAC Pension is offset against the Restoration Pension and his qualified plan benefits.  The amount shown is the incremental value of the FAC Pension above these benefits.

 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
Related Party Transactions Policy 
The NCG Committee (or its Chair, under some circumstances) will review the relevant facts of all proposed Related Person Transactions and either approve or disapprove of the entry into the Related Person Transaction. 
For purposes of this review, as defined in the NCG Committee Charter, a "Related Person Transaction" is a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) involving an amount that is at least $120,000, and in which the Company was, is or will be a participant, and in which any Related Person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. A "Related Person" is generally any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year was, (i) a director or executive officer of the Company or a nominee to become a director of the Company; (ii) any person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of the Company's voting securities; (iii) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons; or (iv) any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed or is a general partner or principal or in a similar position, or in which such person has a 5% or greater beneficial ownership interest. There were no Related Person Transactions during 2018. 
Related Person Transactions are approved only if they are determined to be in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. No director may participate in any consideration or approval of a Related Person Transaction in which he or she, or any of his or her immediate family members or related entities, is the Related Person. 
If a Related Person Transaction that has not been previously approved or ratified is discovered, the NCG Committee, or its Chair, will promptly consider all of the relevant facts. If the transaction is ongoing, the NCG Committee will consider all options and may ratify, amend or terminate the Related Person Transaction. If the transaction has been completed, the NCG Committee will consider if rescission of the transaction is appropriate and if disciplinary action is warranted. The NCG Committee will review all ongoing Related Person Transactions on an annual basis to determine whether to continue, modify or terminate the Related Person Transaction. 
In reviewing the relevant facts related to all proposed Related Person Transactions, the NCG Committee, or its Chair, will take the following considerations into account, along with other factors it deems appropriate: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the benefits to the Company of the transactions;  
• the impact on a director's independence, in the event the "Related Person" is a director, an immediate family member of a director or an entity in which a director is a partner, shareholder or executive officer;  
• the availability of other sources for comparable products or services;  
• the terms of the transaction; and 
• the terms available from unrelated third parties or to employees generally.  
[END TABLE]
To the extent that the NCG Committee, or its Chair, needs additional information to make an informed decision regarding a proposed Related Person Transaction, the NCG Committee, or its Chair, may consult with Management of the Company or other members of the Board. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
The current members of the Company's Compensation Committee are Lee C. Stewart (Chair), Kathleen A. Dahlberg, Nicholas DeBenedictis and J. Robert Hall. No executive officer of the Company has served as a director or member of the 
Compensation Committee (or other committee serving an equivalent function) of any other entity whose executive officers served as a director or member of the Compensation Committee of the Company.

Report of the Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the Company's Management and its independent registered public accounting firm. The Company's Management has advised the Audit Committee that such audited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
The Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees," as issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Audit Committee has also discussed with Deloitte its independence from the Company and its Management. The Audit Committee has received a letter and written disclosures from Deloitte required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, disclosing all relationships between Deloitte and its related entities and the Company. In addition to the information provided by Deloitte, the Audit Committee considered the level of non-audit and tax services provided by Deloitte in determining that it was independent. Based on the review and discussions described above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Company's Board that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC. 
The foregoing Report does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other filing of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates the Report by reference therein.

 Frequently Asked Questions 
When and where is the Annual Meeting? 
The 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held on Thursday, May 9, 2019, at 9:00 a.m., at the York County History Center, Historical Society Museum, 250 East Market Street, York, PA 17403. 
Who may attend the meeting and what else is required for admittance? 
Only shareholders of the Company's common stock on March 15, 2019 (the "Record Date") may attend the Annual Meeting, and those shareholders attending in person must present an admission ticket or other proof of stock ownership to be admitted to the Annual Meeting. For example, a shareholder may present an account statement or a letter from his/her bank or broker confirming that the shareholder owned Company common stock on the Record Date. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For registered shareholders of the Company, an admission ticket is attached to their proxy card. Registered shareholders planning to attend the Annual Meeting are requested to vote in advance of the Annual Meeting by telephone, internet or mail by completing and mailing in their proxy card, retaining the admission ticket and presenting the ticket at the Annual Meeting if they plan to attend.  
• Shareholders whose shares are registered in the name of a bank, broker or other institution are referred to as "beneficial owners" of Company stock. Beneficial owners should have received voting instructions or a proxy card from their broker or agent rather than from the Company and should follow the voting instructions provided by their broker or agent to ensure that their votes are counted.  
[END TABLE]
What is the difference between a registered shareholder and a beneficial owner? 
If your shares are registered in your name in the records of our transfer agent, Computershare, you are a "registered shareholder," also sometimes called a shareholder (or stockholder) of record. If you are a registered shareholder, we sent this Notice directly to you. 
If your shares are held in the name of your broker or bank, your shares are held in "street name" and you are considered the "beneficial owner." This Notice has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other holder of record, who is considered the shareholder of record for those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other holder of record how to vote your shares by following the voting instructions included in the mailing. 
Why did I receive these materials? 
You are receiving these materials because, as a shareholder, the Company is soliciting your vote on matters to be considered at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The Notice of Annual Meeting, this proxy statement, the accompanying proxy card and our 2018 Annual Report to shareholders, were first sent or given to shareholders on March 29, 2019. Please read this proxy statement and vote your shares by mailing the attached proxy card, voting online, by telephone or in person at the Annual 
Meeting. The Board has appointed directors J. Robert Hall and Lee C. Stewart, or either of them (the "Proxy Holders") with power of substitution, to vote all properly-executed proxies received from shareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting or at any adjournment of the Annual Meeting. 
Who is entitled to vote? 
Shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 15, 2019, the Record Date, may vote at the Annual Meeting. At the close of business on March 15, 2019, there were 44,023,064 shares of the Company's common stock issued and outstanding and eligible to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
How do I vote? 
If you are a registered shareholder, meaning you hold your shares in your own name as a holder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or instruct the Proxy Holders named in the enclosed proxy card how to vote your shares. You may vote your proxy by telephone at 1-800-652-VOTE (8683), online at http://www.investorvote.com/GLT or by completing and signing the enclosed proxy card and returning it promptly in the enclosed envelope (requiring no postage if mailed in the United States). Please make certain you mark, sign and date your proxy card prior to mailing. All valid proxies received and not revoked prior to the Annual Meeting will be voted in accordance with your instructions. 
If you are a beneficial owner, meaning your shares are held by a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), you should receive directions from your bank or broker that you must follow in order to have your shares voted. 
Will my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card? 
If a shareholder of record signs and returns the accompanying proxy card, but does not make any selections, the Board's appointed Proxy Holders will have discretion to vote the shareholder's shares on behalf of the shareholder at the Annual Meeting as recommended by the Board. 
If a beneficial owner of shares does not provide the bank or broker holding such shares with specific voting instructions, under the rules of various national and regional securities exchanges, the shareholder's bank or broker may generally vote on routine matters but cannot vote on non-routine matters. Proposal 1 (election of directors) and Proposal 3 (advisory vote on executive compensation) are non-routine matters. Proposal 2 (ratification of auditors) is routine. 
If a shareholder's bank or broker does not receive the shareholder's instructions on how to vote the shareholder's shares on a non-routine matter, the shareholder's bank or broker will inform the Company it does not have the beneficial owner's authority to vote on the non-routine matter.  We encourage beneficial shareholders to provide voting instructions to the bank, broker or agent holding their shares by carefully following the instructions in the notice provided by the shareholder's bank, broker or agent.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
How do I change my vote or revoke my proxy, if I wish to do so? 
Shareholders of record can revoke their proxy at any time before their shares are voted if they (1) deliver a written revocation of their proxy to the Company's Secretary; (2) submit a later-dated proxy (or voting instruction form if they hold their shares in street name); or (3) vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Shareholders who are beneficial owners should follow the instructions provided by their respective broker or bank to change their vote. 
What is the required quorum to hold this Annual Meeting? 
As of March 15, 2019, 44,023,064 shares of the Company's common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote. The presence of shareholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes that all shareholders are entitled to cast on a particular matter will constitute a quorum for the purposes of such matter. Abstentions or broker "non-votes" are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. A broker "non-vote" occurs when a broker or bank holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular matter because the broker or bank does not have discretionary voting authority to vote on the proposal, and the beneficial owner has not provided voting instructions. 
May shareholders ask questions at the Annual Meeting? 
Yes. After the formal business of the Annual Meeting has concluded and adjourned, the chair of the meeting will answer questions from shareholders during the designated question and answer period of the meeting. To provide an opportunity for everyone wishing to ask a question, shareholders will be limited to three (3) minutes each to present their question. When speaking, shareholders must direct questions to the chair and limit their questions to matters relating directly to the business of the meeting. Shareholders will not be permitted to make statements. 
Who pays for the proxy solicitation related to the Annual Meeting? 
The Company pays the cost of preparing, printing, assembling and mailing this proxy statement and other proxy solicitation materials. The Company will also reimburse brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding the proxy statement and other proxy solicitation materials to beneficial owners. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, some of our directors, officers, other employees and agents may solicit proxies personally, by telephone and by other means. The officers and directors who may solicit proxies personally receive no special compensation for any solicitation activities. 
What proposals will be acted upon at the meeting, and what number of votes is needed for the proposals to be adopted?

Approval of Named Executive Officer Compensation. This proposal gives you, as a shareholder, the opportunity to endorse, not endorse, or take no position on our compensation program for the NEOs.  A majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, in person or by proxy, must vote "For" the proposal to approve NEO compensation for fiscal year 2018.  While the Board intends to carefully consider the shareholder vote on this proposal, this vote is not binding on the Company and is advisory in nature. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT  › 53
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
What are the Board of Directors' recommendations for voting on these proposals? 
The Board recommends a vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the election of the eight nominees for director;  
• FOR the ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019; and 
• FOR approval of named executive officer compensation.   
[END TABLE]
What are my options for voting on these proposals? 
A shareholder is entitled to one vote per share of stock owned on the Record Date, on each item of business presented at the Annual Meeting, except each shareholder has cumulative voting rights for electing directors. Cumulative voting means a shareholder is entitled to as many votes in electing directors as is equal to the number of shares of common stock owned by the shareholder on the Record Date, multiplied by the number of directors to be elected. Accordingly, for the election of eight directors, a shareholder may either cast that total number of votes "For" or "Withhold" all of those votes from a single nominee. The shareholder may also distribute or withhold the total number of votes among the eight nominees as the shareholder determines, up to the number of shares of common stock owned by the shareholder on the Record Date, multiplied by eight. To utilize cumulative voting, a shareholder must check the appropriate box on the proxy card. 
For the proposal to ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, a shareholder may either vote "For" or "Against" the proposal or "Abstain" from voting. 
For the non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation, commonly known as a "say on pay" vote, a shareholder may either vote "For" or "Against" the proposal or "Abstain" from voting. 
Aside from these proposals, will any other business be acted upon at the meeting? 
No. The Company's By-laws required shareholders to submit to the Company, by November 30, 2018, notice of all director nominations and shareholder proposals to be considered at the 2019 Annual Meeting, regardless of whether shareholders sought inclusion of their nomination or proposal in this proxy statement or intended to solicit proxies on their own. Because the Company did not receive any such notice of nominations or proposals, no other director nominations, shareholder proposals or other matters will be considered at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
How may a shareholder present a proposal for next year's Annual Meeting? 
A shareholder wishing to present a proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting must submit it to the Company's Secretary pursuant to the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and the Company's By-laws prescribe the procedures a shareholder must follow. To present a proposal for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting, whether or not the shareholder wishes to include the matter in the proxy statement for that meeting, a notice including all of the information required by the Company's By-laws must be submitted in writing to the Company's Secretary and delivered to, or mailed and received by, the Company no later than the close of business on November 29, 2019, regardless of delivery method. 
How may a shareholder nominate a candidate to sit on the Board of Directors? 
A shareholder may recommend nominees for consideration by the Board's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for nomination for election to the Board. Shareholder recommendations for director nominees will receive the same consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee that all other director nominee recommendations receive. If a shareholder wishes to recommend a nominee for director, the shareholder must submit such recommendation in writing, together with any supporting materials deemed appropriate, to the Company's Secretary. Such recommendation must be made in accordance with the procedures described herein and in the Company's By-laws. To nominate a candidate for director at the 2020 Annual Meeting, notice of the nomination must be in writing and delivered to, or mailed and received by, the Company no later than the close of business on November 29, 2019. 
What must be included in the notice to submit a shareholder proposal or to nominate a director candidate? 
Requirements for the notice are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A proposal submitted by a shareholder must include a description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting the business at the meeting and any material interest the shareholder has in the business.  
• A nomination for election to the Board must include information regarding the nominee (name, address, occupation, number of shares held and a representation by both shareholder and nominee that there are no undisclosed voting arrangements).  
• The notice must include:  
    o  the shareholder's name and address, a description of the shares held, and a description of any arrangement or agreement with other shareholders or the nominee with respect to the nomination;  
    o  a representation that the shareholder will attend the 2020 Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, and will submit the proposal or make the nomination;  
    o  a description of any hedging arrangements for Company stock into which the shareholder has entered; and o  a statement whether the shareholder intends to solicit, or participate in the solicitation of, proxies for the proposal or nomination.  
[END TABLE]
This is a general description of the notice required to submit a proposal or nomination for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting. The Company's By-laws contain a complete description of the notice requirements for shareholder proposals. Copies of the Company's By-laws may be obtained from the Company's website at http://www.glatfelter.com/Files/about_us/

A shareholder may obtain a copy of the Annual Report, this proxy statement, and form of proxy, relating to this Annual Meeting and future meetings of shareholders, without charge by writing to: Investor Relations, P. H. Glatfelter Company, 96 South George Street, Suite 520, York, PA 17401.

Other Business 
As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board knows of no business that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting other than the items referred to above. If any other matter is properly brought before the Annual Meeting for action by shareholders, the persons named in the accompanying proxy will have discretionary authority to vote proxies for such matter in accordance with their best judgment. 
"Householding" 
The Company is permitted by SEC regulations to deliver a single Annual Report or proxy statement to any household at which two or more registered shareholders have the same last name and address, unless the Company has received instructions to the contrary from one or more of the shareholders. This is known as "householding" and is intended to save the cost of delivering multiple duplicate copies of the proxy materials to the same address. The Company will continue to include a separate proxy card for each registered shareholder account. 
The Company will deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the Annual Report or proxy statement, as applicable, to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered.
