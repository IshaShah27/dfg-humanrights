Mr. Salveson received his undergraduate degree from St. Olaf College in 1987 and an M.M.M. in finance from the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.
The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Salveson should serve as a director of CryoLife because of his broad experience in the healthcare industry and the medical technology sector, and, particularly, his  extensive experience in strategic advisory roles for healthcare companies in hundreds of transactions.

The Board of Directors' Recommendation
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR EACH OF THE nine NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR LISTED IN THIS PROPOSAL ONE.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS MATTERS
Our Board of Directors believes that the purpose of corporate governance is to serve the interests of the Company and  the Company's stockholders in a manner that is consistent with its fiduciary duties and the Company's mission and core values. The Board of Directors has adopted and adheres to corporate governance practices that the Board of Directors and senior management believe promote this purpose, are sound, and represent best practices. The Board of Directors reviews these practices on an ongoing basis and revises them as appropriate.
Director Independence
In connection with its annual review in March 2019, and based on the information available to it, the Board of Directors determined that none of Ms. Borgstrom or Messrs. Ackerman, Bevevino, Bullock, Burbank, McCall, Morgan, or Salveson, or Dr. Ronald C. Elkins, who served as a director until his retirement in May 2018, has or had a material relationship with CryoLife, and that each qualified as independent directors under NYSE Listing Standards.
In addition to qualifying as "independent" within the meaning of Section 303A.02 of the NYSE Listing Company Standards, each member of the Compensation Committee must be a "non-employee director" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and at least two members of the Compensation Committee must be "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In determining the independence of any director who will serve on the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors will consider all factors relevant to determining whether such director has a relationship with us that is material to the director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a Compensation Committee member, including, but not limited to (i) the source of compensation of such director, including any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee paid by us to the director and (ii) whether such director is affiliated with us, one of our subsidiaries, or an affiliate of one of our subsidiaries.
In addition to qualifying as "independent" within the meaning of Section 303.A02 of the NYSE Listing Standards, each member of the Audit Committee must also meet the criteria of Section 303.A06 and Rule 10A-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Until February 2017, Mr. Ackerman served as a Consultant to Charles River Laboratories. Prior to that date, Mr. Ackerman held various positions at Charles River Laboratories, including most recently, as Senior Financial Advisor. CryoLife has made purchases from Charles River Laboratories relating to supplies, including supplies for certain of its clinical trials, in each of the last several years, although the amount spent in recent years does not meet the threshold for a related party transaction as discussed below, and anticipates doing so in the current year. CryoLife's purchases from Charles River Laboratories were made on an arm's-length basis. The amount of these purchases falls within the categorical standards for commercial relationships that are deemed not material and would not impair a director's independence. The Board of Directors understood that Mr. Ackerman's compensation from Charles River Laboratories was in no way impacted by the size or amount of the business transacted between the two companies. The Board of Directors determined that Mr. Ackerman's relationship with Charles River Laboratories is not a material relationship that could impair his independence as a director as of CryoLife.
Since 2005, Ms. Borgstrom has served as the CEO of Yale New Haven Health. Prior to that date, Ms. Borgstrom held various senior leadership positions at Yale New Haven Health. In 2018, Yale New Haven Health paid CryoLife $326,732 for tissue preservation services and BioGlue and On-X products provided by CryoLife, and we expect this relationship to continue. These purchases were made on an arm's-length bases. The Board of Directors considered this relationship and determined that Ms. Borgstrom's relationship with Yale New Haven Health is not a material relationship that could impair her independence as a director of CryoLife.
Dr. Elkins is a former Chief of the Section of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery at the University of Oklahoma Health Services Center and is a Professor Emeritus of the Center. In 2018, the Center paid CryoLife $54,989 for tissue preservation services and BioGlue and On-X products provided by CryoLife. Dr. Elkins' son, Charles Craig Elkins, M.D., is a cardiac surgeon who has implanted CryoLife preserved cardiac tissues at Integris Baptist Medical Center in Oklahoma City. Integris Health, including Integris Baptist Medical Center, paid CryoLife $692,108 for tissue preservation services and BioGlue and On-X products in 2018, and we expect this relationship to continue. These purchases were made on an arm's-length basis. The Board of Directors considered these relationships and determined that they are not material relationships that would have impaired Dr. Elkins's independence.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement The Board of Directors' Right to Retain Advisors
The Board of Directors has authorized committees of the Board of Directors to retain their own advisors, such as auditors, compensation consultants, search firms, legal counsel, and others, to the extent the committees deem it appropriate.
The Board of Directors' Leadership Structure
The President and Chief Executive Officer of CryoLife serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors believes that this structure promotes fluid communication and coordination between the Board of Directors and management. Also, the Board of Directors believes that Mr. Mackin is well-suited to fill his management and Board of Directors roles and that the Board of Directors benefits from his serving in these dual roles.
In order to foster the Board of Directors' independence from management, the leadership structure of the Board of Directors also includes a Presiding Director, a position held by an independent director. Mr. McCall assumed the role of Presiding Director in December 2005. The Presiding Director has frequent contact with Mr. Mackin and other members of management on a broad range of matters and has additional corporate governance responsibilities for the Board of Directors. Mr. McCall also serves as liaison between Mr. Mackin and the independent directors, approves meeting agendas and schedules to insure there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items, approves certain information sent to the Board, has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors, and can, if requested by major stockholders, consult with them directly.
The Board of Directors' Role in Risk Oversight
The Board of Directors has an active role, as a whole and also at the committee level, in overseeing the management of our risks. Management is primarily responsible for risk management, and management reports directly to the committees and the Board of Directors with respect to risk management. The Board of Directors is responsible for general oversight of risks and regular review of information regarding our risks, including credit risks, liquidity risks, and operational risks. In its risk oversight role, the Board of Directors reviews periodically the Company's strategic plan, as well as an assessment of potential material risks facing the Company. While the Board of Directors has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, various committees of the Board of Directors also have responsibility for risk management.
In particular, the Compensation Committee is responsible for ensuring that our compensation policies and practices do not incent excessive or inappropriate risk-taking by employees or non-employee directors. The Audit Committee is primarily responsible for, in coordination with our independent registered public accounting firm, oversight of our internal controls, operation of our internal audit, and various financial and compliance functions. The Corporate Governance Committee monitors risk by ensuring that proper corporate governance standards are maintained and that the Board of Directors is comprised of qualified directors. The Compliance Committee is primarily responsible for oversight of our healthcare compliance function, including our compliance with quality systems and regulatory assurance laws and regulations, as well as our compliance with other healthcare compliance laws and regulations. Together with the Audit Committee, the Compliance Committee also assists in oversight of our compliance with certain laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and such policies as our Code of Conduct.
Board of Directors and Committee Meetings, Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Attendance
During 2018, each director attended, either in person or by telephone, at least 75% of the meetings of the Board of Directors and the committees of the Board of Directors on which s/he served. In general, members of the Board of Directors become members of committees immediately following the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
The Board of Directors held ten meetings during 2018. All of the then-current members of the Board of Directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Company does not have a policy requiring directors to attend the annual meeting, but attendance is encouraged. 
Standing Committees of the Board of Directors; Committee Assignments
During 2018, the Board of Directors had four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Governance Committee, and the Compliance Committee. In 2018, the Audit Committee met fourteen times, the Compensation Committee met fifteen times, the Corporate Governance Committee met eight times, the Compliance Committee met four times, the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance Committee met jointly one time, and the Audit Committee and the Compliance Committee met jointly one time. These committees are described below, and the following table lists the members of each of the standing committees as of the date of this Proxy Statement:
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement  
Audit Committee — The Audit Committee operates under a written charter that sets out the committee's functions and responsibilities. The Audit Committee currently consists of three non-employee directors: Mr. Morgan, Chair, Mr. Ackerman, and Mr. Bevevino, each of whom served on the Audit Committee for all of 2018. Each of the members of the Audit Committee meets the requirements of independence of Section 303A.02 of the current NYSE Listing Standards and also meets the criteria of Section 303A.06, as set forth in Rule 10A-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, regarding listing standards related to audit committees. No member of the Audit Committee serves on the audit committee of more than three public companies. In addition, the Board of Directors has determined that all of the current members of the Audit Committee satisfy the definition of an "audit committee financial expert," as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
The Audit Committee charter gives the Audit Committee the authority and responsibility for the appointment, retention, compensation, and oversight of CryoLife's independent registered public accounting firm, including pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services to be performed by CryoLife's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also oversees, and must review and approve, all significant related party transactions.

The Audit Committee reviews the general scope of CryoLife's annual audit and the nature of services to be performed for CryoLife in connection with it, acting as liaison between the Board of Directors and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also reviews various Company policies, including those relating to accounting practices and internal control systems of CryoLife. In addition, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the performance of CryoLife's independent registered public accounting firm, for engaging or discharging CryoLife's independent registered public accounting firm, and for assisting the Board of Directors in its oversight of risk management and legal and financial regulatory requirements.
Compensation Committee — The Compensation Committee operates under a written charter that sets out the committee's functions and responsibilities. The Compensation Committee currently consists of three non-employee directors: Mr. Bevevino, Chair, Mr. Ackerman, and Mr. McCall, each of whom served on the Compensation Committee for all of 2018. Until February 2018, Dr. Elkins was Compensation Committee chair, and he remained a member of the Compensation Committee until his retirement in May 2018. Each member of the Compensation Committee meets, or met, the independence requirements of Sections 303A.02(a)(i) and (ii) of the current NYSE Listing Standards, is a non-employee director within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act and is a disinterested director within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Pursuant to the Compensation Committee charter, the Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing with the Company CEO, the performance of officers and setting the annual compensation for all officers, including the salary and the compensation package of officers. The Compensation Committee also oversees the issuance of stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and other stock rights and cash incentives under CryoLife's stock and incentive plans. In conjunction with the Corporate Governance Committee and Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee approves severance arrangements for the CEO and other officers. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the performance metrics upon which a portion of the compensation of CryoLife's CEO and other officers is based, and together with the Corporate Governance Committee, annually reviews the CEO's objectives and performance, recommends changes thereto, and sets the CEO's compensation package. See Compensation Discussion and Analysis on page 22 for information concerning the Compensation Committee's role, processes, and activities in overseeing executive compensation.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to delegate any of its decisions to a sub-committee of the Compensation Committee consisting of two committee members, provided that a full report of any action taken is promptly made to the full Compensation Committee.
The Compensation Committee has the power to retain, determine the terms of engagement and compensation of, and terminate any consulting firm that may assist it in its decisions.
Corporate Governance Committee — The Corporate Governance Committee operates under a written charter that sets out the committee's functions and responsibilities. The Corporate Governance Committee currently consists of four non-employee directors: Mr. McCall, Chair, Mr. Bullock, Mr. Burbank, and Mr. Salveson, each of whom served on the Corporate Governance Committee for all of 2018. Each of these individuals meets the requirements of independence of Section 303A.02 of the current NYSE Listing Standards. The Corporate Governance Committee recommends potential candidates for the Board of Directors and oversees the annual self-evaluations of the Board of Directors and its committees. The Corporate Governance Committee is also responsible for overseeing succession planning for the Board and officers, including the CEO. Each year the Corporate Governance Committee, together with the Compensation Committee, evaluates the performance of CryoLife's CEO and sets his compensation. The Corporate Governance Committee also recommends to the Board of Directors how the other committees of the Board of Directors should be structured and which non-employee directors should be members of those committees. The Corporate Governance Committee also reviews and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding the development of, and compliance with, the Company's corporate governance guidelines and other governance policies, procedures, and practices.
Compliance Committee — The Compliance Committee operates under a written charter that sets out the committee's functions and responsibilities. The Compliance Committee currently consists of four non-employee directors: Mr. Salveson, Chair, Mr. Bullock, Mr. Morgan, and Ms. Borgstrom. Messrs. Salveson, Bullock, and Morgan each served on the Compliance Committee for all of 2018. Ms. Borgstrom was appointed to the committee in July 2018. Dr. Elkins was a member of the Compliance Committee until his retirement in May 2018. Each of these individuals meets the requirements of independence of Section 303A.02 of the current NYSE Listing Standards. The charter of the Compliance Committee requires that a majority of its members be independent. Among other things, the Compliance Committee assists the Company in its oversight of CryoLife's compliance with healthcare laws and regulations, including regulations and laws related to regulatory affairs and quality assurance, and general healthcare compliance such as the Anti-Kickback Statute. The Compliance Committee also receives periodic reports from the Company's senior management regarding quality and regulatory systems and provides input into certain internal regulatory affairs and quality assurance and healthcare compliance policies. Finally, pursuant to its charter, the Compliance Committee, jointly with the Audit Committee, assists in the oversight of compliance with certain policies and procedures such as the Company's Code of Conduct and our policy with respect to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Procedures for Stockholders Who Wish to Submit Recommendations to the Board of Directors
Stockholders may recommend potential candidates for director to the Corporate Governance Committee. The policy of the Corporate Governance Committee is to give the same consideration to nominees recommended by stockholders that it gives to individuals whose names are submitted by management or non-employee directors, provided such recommendations from stockholders are made in accordance with procedures described in this Proxy Statement under the FAQ "What is the deadline for submitting proposals for consideration at next year's Annual Meeting of Stockholders or to nominate individuals to serve as directors?" When considering a potential candidate, the Corporate Governance Committee considers, among other things, demonstrated character, judgment, relevant business, functional, and industry experience, degree of intellectual and business acumen, and, when contemplating overall board diversity, ethnic background and gender. The Corporate Governance Committee does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity; however, the Board of Directors and the Corporate Governance Committee believe that it is important that the members of the Board of Directors represent diverse viewpoints. The Corporate Governance Committee's process for identifying and evaluating nominees typically involves a series of internal discussions, review of information concerning candidates, and interviews of selected candidates. From time to time, we have also engaged one or more executive search consulting firms to assist in the identification and recruitment of potential director candidates.
The Corporate Governance Committee has not received any recommended director nominees for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting from any CryoLife stockholder or group of stockholders beneficially owning in excess of 5% of CryoLife's outstanding common stock. Stockholders may communicate with the Corporate Governance Committee or the Board of Directors by following the procedures set forth below at Communication with the Board of Directors and its Committees on page 17.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement The current policy of the Board of Directors requires each director to offer to voluntarily resign upon a change in such director's principal employment or line of business. The Corporate Governance Committee will then review whether such director continues to meet the needs of the Board of Directors and whether to make a recommendation to the Board of Directors that it should accept the director's offer to resign.
Current policy of the Board of Directors also limits the number of other public company boards on which CryoLife's directors may serve. Non-employee directors may serve on no more than three public company boards in addition to service on the Company's Board of Directors, and the CEO's service on the board of any other organization is restricted by  his employment agreement with the Company and is subject to prior approval by the Board of Directors.
CryoLife, Inc. Code of Conduct
CryoLife has established a Code of Conduct that clarifies the Company's standards of conduct in potentially sensitive situations; makes clear that CryoLife expects all employees, officers, and non-employee directors to abide by applicable legal and regulatory requirements and to understand and appreciate the ethical considerations of their decisions; and reaffirms the Company's long-standing commitment to a culture of corporate and individual accountability and responsibility for the highest ethical and business practices.
In addition to the Code of Conduct, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller, Assistant Controller, and all other senior financial officers are also subject to the Company's Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers. In the event that CryoLife amends or waives any of the provisions of the Code of Conduct or Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers applicable to its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Controller, or Assistant Controller, the Company will disclose that information on the Company's website at http://investors.cryolife.com/corporate-governance/cryolifes-code-conduct.
Policies and Procedures for Review, Approval, or Ratification of Transactions with Related Parties
The Board of Directors has adopted policies and procedures for review, approval, or ratification of transactions with related parties.
Types of Transactions Covered
It is our policy to enter into or ratify related party transactions only when the Board of Directors, acting through the Audit Committee or as otherwise described herein, determines that the related party transaction in question is in, or is not inconsistent with, the best interests of CryoLife and its stockholders. We follow the policies and procedures below for any transaction in which we are, or are to be, a participant and the annual amount involved exceeds $50,000 and in which any related party, as defined below, had, has, or will have a direct or indirect interest. Pursuant to the policy, compensatory arrangements with an officer or non-employee director that are approved or ratified by the Compensation Committee or compensation received under our employee benefit plans that are available to all employees do not require additional Audit Committee approval.
The Company subjects the following related parties to these policies: non-employee directors (and nominees); executive officers; beneficial owners of more than 5% of our stock; any immediate family members of these persons; and, any entity in which any of these persons is employed, or is a general partner or principal, or has a similar position, or in which the person has a 10% or greater beneficial ownership interest.
Standards Applied and Persons Responsible for Approving Related Party Transactions
The Corporate Secretary is responsible for submitting to the Audit Committee for its advance review and approval any related party transaction, other than on-going transactions, into which we propose to enter. If the Corporate Secretary determines that it is not practicable or desirable to wait until the next regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting, she will submit the related party transaction for approval or ratification to the Chair of the Audit Committee, who possesses delegated authority to act between Audit Committee meetings. The Chair will report any action he has taken under this delegated authority to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting and seek ratification of such approval. If any related party transaction inadvertently occurs before the Audit Committee has approved it, the Corporate Secretary will submit the transaction to the Audit Committee for ratification as soon as reasonably practicable. If the Audit Committee does not ratify the transaction, the Audit Committee will direct management as to what action it proposes management take regarding the transaction.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement When considering a related party transaction, the Audit Committee will examine all factors it deems relevant. The Audit Committee, or the Chair, will approve only those transactions that they have determined in good faith are in, or are not inconsistent with, the best interests of CryoLife and its stockholders.
The Corporate Secretary may delegate her duties under the policy to another officer of CryoLife if she gives notice of the delegation to the Audit Committee at a regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting.
Review of Ongoing Transactions
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the first quarter of each fiscal year, the Audit Committee reviews all related party transactions that are ongoing and have a remaining term of more than six months or remaining amounts payable to or receivable from CryoLife of more than $50,000 annually. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, the Audit Committee will determine whether it is, or is not inconsistent with, the best interests of CryoLife and its stockholders to continue, modify, or terminate the on-going related party transaction. Review of 2018 ongoing related party transactions is located at Director Independence beginning on page 12.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Elements of Non-Employee Director Compensation
Annual Retainer and Committee Chair Fees
Each of the non-employee directors of CryoLife receives an annual cash retainer for service on the Board of Directors, service on committees of the Board of Directors, service as the Chair of the committees of the Board of Directors, and service as Presiding Director, as applicable and as noted in the table below. CryoLife pays all cash retainers on a prorated monthly basis. Currently, the Presiding Director is also the Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee, and he does not receive any additional compensation for his position as Chair of that committee.
Restricted Stock Grants
A portion of the non-employee directors' annual compensation is issued as restricted stock. The shares of restricted stock are issued each year generally following the annual meeting of stockholders. With respect to 2018 grants, the Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees recommended, and the Board of Directors approved a grant value of $125,000 per non-employee director and in May 2018, the Company granted 4,638 shares of restricted stock to each of the non-employee directors at the time of the grant, which will vest on May 24, 2019. In August 2018, Ms. Borgstrom was granted 3,456 shares of restricted stock, pro-rated for her service from July 2018 to May 2019, which will vest on August 9, 2019. The size and terms of the grants are subject to periodic re-evaluation jointly by the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance Committee. All equity grants to non-employee directors in 2018 were made pursuant to the CryoLife, Inc. Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the "ECIP"). The non-employee director will forfeit any unvested portion of the award if he ceases to serve as a director, other than for specific reasons under certain circumstances as described within the ECIP.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement Fiscal 2018 Director Compensation
The following table provides compensation information for the one-year period ended December 31, 2018, for each person who was a member of our Board of Directors in 2018, other than J. Patrick Mackin:
J. Patrick Mackin, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer received no compensation in 2018 for his services as a director of the Company. His compensation as an executive officer of the Company is detailed in the Summary Compensation Table on page 37.
Director Stock Ownership Requirements
In November 2015, the Corporate Governance Committee approved a change to the non-employee director stock ownership requirements to five times the then current annual board service retainer for non-employee directors. All non-employee directors currently satisfy this standard, except Ms. Borgstrom, who only became a director in July 2018. The Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees evaluate stock ownership requirements for non-employee directors on an annual basis.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Board of Directors maintains an Audit Committee of three non-employee directors. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee believe that the Audit Committee's current member composition satisfies the rules of the NYSE that govern audit committee composition, including the requirement that all audit committee members be "Independent Directors" as that term is defined by Sections 303A.02 and 303A.06 of the NYSE Listing Standards and Rule 10A-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The Audit Committee oversees CryoLife's financial processes on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the systems of internal controls. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed the audited financial statements included in CryoLife's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2018 with management, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee have adopted a written Audit Committee Charter. Since the first quarter of 2004, CryoLife has retained a separate accounting firm to provide internal audit services. The internal audit function reports directly to the Audit Committee and, for administrative purposes, to the Chief Financial Officer.
During the course of fiscal 2018, management completed the documentation, testing, and evaluation of CryoLife's system of internal controls over financial reporting in response to the requirements set forth in Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations. The Audit Committee was kept informed of the progress of the evaluation and provided oversight and advice to management during the process. In connection with this oversight, the Audit Committee received periodic updates provided by management and Ernst & Young LLP, CryoLife's independent registered public accounting firm, at each regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting. The Audit Committee also reviewed the report of management on internal controls over financial reporting contained in CryoLife's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2018, as well as Ernst & Young LLP's Reports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm included in CryoLife's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2018 related to its audit of (i) CryoLife's consolidated financial statements and (ii) the effectiveness of CryoLife's internal controls over financial reporting. The Audit Committee continues to oversee CryoLife's efforts related to CryoLife's internal controls over financial reporting and management's preparations for the evaluation thereof for fiscal 2019.
The Audit Committee reviewed with Ernst & Young LLP, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, their judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of CryoLife's accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under generally accepted auditing standards. Ernst & Young LLP also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the letter required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding Ernst & Young LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. The Audit Committee discussed with Ernst & Young LLP that firm's independence from management and CryoLife.
The Audit Committee discussed with Ernst & Young LLP the overall scope and plans for its audit. The Audit Committee met with Ernst & Young LLP, with and without management present, to discuss the results of its examination, its evaluation of CryoLife's internal controls, and the overall quality of CryoLife's financial reporting.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee members did not become aware of any material misstatement in the audited financial statements and recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in CryoLife's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee has approved Ernst & Young LLP as CryoLife's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019.

This foregoing audit committee report is not "soliciting material," is not deemed "filed" with the SEC, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement into any filing of ours under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under the Exchange Act, except to the extent we specifically incorporate this report by reference.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement PROPOSAL TWO – ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
CryoLife seeks a non-binding vote from its stockholders to approve the compensation paid to our named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and narrative discussion. This vote is commonly referred to as a "Say on Pay" vote because it gives stockholders an opportunity to express their approval or disapproval to the Company regarding its pay practices.
As discussed in detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis that follows, our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, retain, motivate, and reward executive talent that is capable of, and appropriately incented to, deliver on CryoLife's short and long-term growth and other strategic objectives and on CryoLife's commitments to its stockholders, in particular, long-term value creation. We believe that the form and amount of compensation we provide our current named executive officers appropriately reflects their extensive management experience, continued high performance, and exceptional service to CryoLife and our stockholders.
We invite you to consider the details of our executive compensation program as disclosed more fully throughout this Proxy Statement. Regardless of the outcome of this "Say on Pay" vote, CryoLife welcomes input from its stockholders regarding executive compensation and other matters related to the Company's success generally. We believe in a corporate governance structure that is responsive to stockholder concerns, and we view this vote as a meaningful opportunity to gauge stockholder approval of our executive compensation policies. Given the information provided in this Proxy Statement, the Board of Directors asks you to approve the following advisory resolution:
"Resolved, that CryoLife's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to CryoLife's named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement."
Required Vote
The votes cast for this proposal must exceed the votes cast against it in order for it to be approved. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be relevant to the outcome. As previously disclosed and approved by the stockholders, the Board of Directors currently submits a say on pay proposal annually. The annual frequency of this disclosure and approval was the subject of a vote of the stockholders at the Company's 2017 Annual Meeting and was supported by more than 77% of the stockholder votes.
The Board of Directors' Recommendation
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION PAID TO CRYOLIFE'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the principles, objectives, and features of our executive compensation program as applied to our chief executive officer and the other executive officers included in the Summary Compensation Table of this Proxy Statement (collectively, our "named executive officers"). For 2018, our named executive officers were:
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Compensation Committee, referred to hereafter as the "Committee," generally considers and approves executive compensation each year at a meeting held in the first quarter of the fiscal year. These compensation decisions take into account a variety of information and analyses, including alignment of compensation vehicles with the Committee's compensation philosophy, prior-year Company and individual executive performance, current-year performance expectations, any changes in roles and responsibilities, and competitive market data provided by the Committee's independent compensation consultant and by management.
2017 Say on Pay Vote and 2018 Program Decisions
At CryoLife's Annual Meeting of stockholders on May 17, 2017, over 81% of the stockholder votes cast were in favor of our named executive officers' 2016 compensation. This advisory vote indicated strong stockholder support for the executive compensation program.
The Committee considered these 2017 advisory vote results as it evaluated its compensation policies and made compensation decisions subsequent to the 2017 Annual Meeting. Based in part on this consideration, together with the individual executive's performance and the Company's actual and expected performance, as well as competitive market data provided by the Committee's independent compensation consultant and by management, and after also considering recommendations from its independent compensation consultant and from management, the Committee decided not to make significant changes to the executive compensation programs for 2018. The Committee also worked within the parameters of the ECIP when making compensation decisions for 2018. The following is a summary of the Committee's significant decisions regarding named executive officer compensation for 2018:
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement  
Pay-for-Performance Alignment
The Committee believes it has developed a compensation program that ensures that the interests of the Company's executives are aligned with those of its stockholders by strongly linking executive compensation with Company and personal performance at levels such that officers are incented to drive long-term value creation. The key pay-for-performance aspects of the executive compensation program are described below:
As described in this Proxy Statement, in 2018 the executive compensation program effectively delivered pay-for-performance, as follows:
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement Throughout this Proxy Statement, we refer to revenue, adjusted net income, and adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA reflect adjustments to similar measures reported under U.S. GAAP. Appendix A to this Proxy Statement provides certain required information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation to our audited U.S. GAAP financial statement measures for 2018, as presented in our 2018 Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2019.
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILTIES
Compensation Committee
The Committee determines and approves the compensation of CryoLife's officers, including the named executive officers. The Committee is supported by the CEO, executive management, and an independent compensation consultant, who attends Committee meetings when invited and provides input and information as requested by the Committee. The Committee regularly meets in executive session without the CEO or any members of management present. For 2018 the Committee made compensation decisions based on its own considerations and analyses, as well as recommendations from management and its  independent compensation consultant. Our CEO does not make recommendations to the Compensation or Corporate Governance Committees or participate in Compensation or Corporate Governance Committee or Board meetings regarding his own compensation, except to discuss his own compensation with those Committees or the Board during his annual performance review.
Independent Compensation Consultant
The Committee has the authority to engage independent consultants, including independent compensation consultants, to assist with its responsibilities. With respect to general executive compensation decisions made during fiscal 2018 and regarding 2018 compensation, the Committee retained Willis Towers Watson & Co. ("Willis Towers Watson") as its primary independent compensation consultant for general executive compensation matters. The independent compensation consultant reports directly to the Committee, is directed by the Committee, and provides only those services authorized by the Committee; it provides no other services to CryoLife. The independent compensation consultant generally performs an annual review of officer and non-employee director compensation, analyzes the relationship between officer, including our CEO, pay and Company performance, compares officer and non-employee director compensation against such compensation provided by appropriate comparator companies and industry standards, informs the Committee of emerging practices and trends, assists with special projects at the request of the Committee, and attends Committee meetings when invited. In February 2018, and again in February 2019, the Committee assessed the independence of Willis Towers Watson pursuant to applicable SEC and NYSE rules and concluded that Willis Tower Watson was independent and its work for the Committee did not raise any conflict of interest concerns.
COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVES
The Committee's compensation philosophy is to attract, retain, motivate, and reward executive talent that has the capability to, and is appropriately incented to, deliver on the Company's short and long-term growth and other strategic objectives and on the Company's commitments to its stockholders, in particular  long-term value creation. To that end, the Company has designed the compensation program to align with corporate strategy and short-term and long-term objectives, achieve market competitiveness, emphasize pay for performance, align with stockholder interests, balance the interests of key stakeholders, and recognize the unique attributes specific to CryoLife and its executive team. Each primary component of compensation is intended to accomplish one or more of these objectives, as summarized in the following chart:
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement

Long-Term Incentive  Encourage and reward long-term stockholder value creation, retain          highly capable executive talent, and facilitate long-term stock ownership among our executive team to further align executive and          stockholder interests.    Performance Stock Units   Stock Options   Restricted Stock Awards Performance stock units are not earned unless specific levels of Company performance are achieved during the relevant performance period; stock options deliver realizable value to executives only if the stock price increases beyond the grant date stock price; the realizable value of restricted stock awards is linked to CryoLife's stock price after the grant date.

COMPENSATION MIX
The Committee approves the primary components of the executive compensation program and generally intends for it to provide more variable pay opportunities than fixed pay opportunities and to place significant weight on long-term incentive opportunities. These objectives result in a pay program that aligns pay and performance. The following chart summarizes the target pay mix for the named executive officers for fiscal 2018:
MARKET ANALYSIS
As part of its decision-making process, the Committee requests and reviews relevant and credible market data regarding executive compensation levels, Company performance, and the relative relationship between executive pay and Company performance. However, the Committee views this data as one of many inputs in its decision-making process, which also includes other assessments of the Company's performance, assessments of each executive's performance, significant changes in roles and responsibilities, internal pay equity among executives, and retention considerations.
Each year, the Committee reviews and considers an officer compensation study prepared by its independent compensation consultant, additional compensation survey data provided by management, and internal equity information. The executive compensation study is generally completed in the fourth quarter of the year and is used to inform the Committee's decisions regarding the subsequent year's compensation. Accordingly, the relevant study and market information reviewed by the Committee with regard to 2018 officer compensation was prepared in October 2017 and presented to the Committee in the fourth quarter of 2017. We refer to this study as the "2017 Study." An updated version of the 2017 Study was considered at the March 2018 Committee meeting. As in prior years, the 2017 Study assessed both the competitiveness of pay levels and the alignment of pay with Company performance.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement The Company's 2018 compensation peer group, which is described in more detail below, had median revenues, based on the latest figures available at the time the 2017 Study was prepared, of $236 million and median market capitalization as of July 2017, of $846 million. In addition to using officer pay information as disclosed by companies in the compensation peer group, the 2017 Study used survey data drawn from four compensation surveys of U.S. companies, including biotech and healthcare companies, with targeted revenues of $200-250 million, in order to approximate the Company's estimated revenue for 2018. With respect to all named executive officers included in the 2017 Study, the data in the study was an even blend of the 2018 peer group and the survey information. In each case, Willis Towers Watson trended the compensation data forward to January 1, 2018 by a factor of 3.0%. We refer to the blended 2018 peer group and survey compensation data for all named executive officers as the "2018 Peer Group Information."
The following peer companies were used for the 2017 Study:
The Committee believed that the pay practices of these companies provided a useful reference point for pay and performance comparisons at CryoLife, especially considering CryoLife's anticipated growth.
The following survey sources were used in the 2017 Study:
Both the peer companies and survey sources were recommended by Willis Towers Watson, the Committee's independent compensation consultant at that time, and approved by the Committee. In approving the peer group, the Committee considered the fact that each company is (or was at the time) publicly-traded, operates in a similar industry, is similar in size, scope, and complexity and is representative of our pool for executive talent. The Committee also concluded that the companies are (or were at the time) within a reasonable range of CryoLife's historical, current, and projected revenues. Nonetheless, the Committee reviews and considers changes to the peer group and survey sources in connection with each year's study. This is done to ensure that the peer group and survey sources continue to reflect the most appropriate reference points for CryoLife.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement 2018 COMPENSATION COMPONENTS
The primary components of CryoLife's executive compensation program are base salary, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives. CryoLife also provides executives with tax-deferred savings opportunities, participation in Company-wide benefits programs, and limited perquisites.
2018 Base Salary
The Committee generally reviews base salary levels each February as part of its overall review and approval of the executive compensation program. Based on its review in late 2017 and early 2018, the Committee determined it appropriate to increase named executive officers' base salaries, on average, by 4% above 2017 levels.
Analysis
The 2017 Study of peer group base salaries found our named executive officer salaries to be within a competitive range of 97-110% of the median of their peer group. Based on input from management and in consultation with Willis Towers Watson, the Committee approved merit increases for 2018 for all officers, ranging from 3% to 5%, with named executive officer raises ranging from 3.1% to 5%. In approving salary increases to named executive officers, the Committee considered current market positioning, both individual and Company performance during 2017, and the Company's overall salary increase budget for employees.
2018 Short-Term Incentives
The Committee approved the 2018 short-term incentive program (the "2018 Cash Bonus Plan") in March 2018, with the understanding that in the absence of an agreement between the Company and the executive, the Committee could alter the 2018 Cash Bonus Plan at any time. The 2018 Cash Bonus Plan provides for the same performance measures (adjusted for projected changes in 2018 levels of revenue and adjusted net income) and the same design as the 2017 program, with increased target incentive opportunities from the 2017 program for the CEO and the Senior Vice Presidents. The CEO's target incentive opportunity increased from 85% of his base salary to 100% of his base salary and the Senior Vice Presidents' target incentive opportunity increased from 45% of their base salaries to 50% of their base salaries (other than the Senior Vice President, Global Sales and Marketing, whose target incentive opportunity was already 50% of his base salary). The target incentive opportunity for the Executive Vice President, COO, and CFO remained the same from 2017 to 2018 at 60% of his base salary. The increase in opportunity for certain executives reflects the impact of the increased size, scope, and business complexity of the Company following its acquisition of JOTEC AG, and the impact of those increases upon market competitiveness, as well as the Committee's ongoing assessment of Company performance.
Analysis
The chart below shows the performance metrics set for the 2018 Cash Bonus Plan:
See Appendix A to this Proxy Statement for further details regarding the revenue and adjusted net income performance measure and the reconciliation of that measure to net income as reported for purposes of U.S. GAAP.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement Upon review and consideration, the Committee believed that the performance measures of revenue and adjusted net income used in the 2018 short-term incentive program would motivate management to achieve increases in 2018 revenues and adjusted net income, as well as drive personal performance and provide appropriate retention incentives. As a result, the Committee approved the same revenue and adjusted net income measures (as adjusted for 2018 forecast results) that it used with respect to 2017 for use in the 2018 Cash Bonus Plan, with the increased target payouts as previously discussed.
The Committee believed that 2018 revenue and adjusted net income thresholds and target performance levels were challenging. The 2018 revenue and adjusted net income targets are within the range of 2018 product and service revenue guidance previously publicly announced by CryoLife.
For 2018, the performance measures and weights for the short-term incentive program remained the same as in 2017, with a 100% payout for performance at target levels, a 140% total cap on payout for performance, and the following additional primary features:
The performance ranges are generally narrow relative to the payout ranges in order to focus executives on achieving business performance goals in a manner consistent with business plans and communicated guidance.
Analysis – Program Design
In arriving at its decision to approve the 2018 short-term incentive program design, measures, and goals, the Committee took into consideration the following:
The Committee sets short-term incentive opportunities, in conjunction with a review of base salaries, as part of executives' overall "target total cash compensation." The Committee decided to carry forward for 2018 the design of the 2017 short-term incentive program (with adjusted targets, as discussed below), as it believed that the performance measures of revenue and adjusted net income used in the 2017 program would continue to motivate management to achieve improvements in those metrics. The Committee also believed that these goals would drive the personal performance of the named executive officers and provide appropriate retention incentives.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement With respect to adjusted net income and revenue, the Committee made no adjustments to exclude items over which it believed that management has insufficient control or could distort the underlying operating performance of the Company.
The Committee discussed management's recommended 2018 performance targets and payout opportunities with its independent compensation consultant and with management and determined that the recommended continuation of the 2017 program design, with updated targets to reflect the 2018 goals, and increased payout opportunities for most senior executives, were consistent with its desire to ensure that no short-term incentives would be paid unless challenging performance was achieved and then only at levels commensurate with such performance. The Committee believed that the 2018 short-term incentive program target percentages provided each officer warranted increases, in most cases, to maintain market competitiveness and to reflect the recent growth of the Company and the increasing complexity of its business. With these previously discussed increases, the Committee believed the 2018 short-term incentive program was appropriately incentivizing given the senior executive's position with CryoLife, and that the incentives were appropriately sized based on the 2018 Peer Group Information and the internal pay equity information reviewed by the Committee.
Analysis – Plan Payout
The 2018 short-term incentive payouts in early 2019 through the 2018 Cash Bonus Plan were based on actual financial performance results of CryoLife relative to the pre-determined goals and on the individual performance results of each executive officer with respect to the individual performance component. Individual performance bonuses for each named executive officer (other than that for the CEO) were based on reviews conducted by the CEO of individual performance relative to individual goals. Mr. Mackin's 2018 individual performance bonus reflected a review of his 2018 performance jointly by the Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance Committee. Having certified the other performance metrics, and considered Mr. Mackin's individual performance, the Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees approved his bonus payout at the amount below.
The following tables show the performance results for 2018 and the actual amount of short-term incentive paid to each named executive officer:
[BEGIN TABLE]
2018 Annual Incentive Program (Cash Bonus) Actual vs. Target Performance 
2018 Annual Incentive Program (Cash Bonus) Actual vs. Target Performance 
Individual Performance 20  1 – 5 performance ratings 0% - 200% of target payout based on individual performance of officer 
Individual Performance 20  1 – 5 performance ratings 0% - 200% of target payout based on individual performance of officer

[END TABLE]
These tables demonstrate how the short-term incentive program design effectively aligned performance and compensation, as the Company's below-target performance with respect to adjusted net income yielded a payout at 75.0% for that portion of the bonus payout.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement 2018 Long-Term Incentives
Based on input from management and in consultation with Willis Towers Watson, the Committee considered the long-term incentive program and determined to continue the design of the 2018 program to have the mix of equity awards be based on an equal allocation of value among stock options, restricted stock, and performance stock units, with approximately one-third of the value being granted allocated to each type of award. This mix is altered for Company officers located outside of the United States to accommodate local tax issues.
The Committee determined that the estimated grant date fair value of the awards to officers in 2018 would be established at new levels reflecting the values in the market analysis contained in the 2017 Study which took into consideration the anticipated (and later realized) growth of the Company, as well as the increase in the complexity of its business following the acquisition of JOTEC AG. To determine the number of options, shares of restricted stock, and target performance shares to be used to deliver such grant date fair value, the Committee directed management to determine the numbers of shares of restricted stock and target performance stock units using the closing share price of the Company's stock on the date before the date of grant, and to also determine the number of stock options using the estimated fair value of the options as of the same date. Grants were made on the first permissible day following approval. As anticipated, this method results in the grant values approved by the Committee being slightly different from the grant date fair value of the equity granted. In this instance, grant values approved by the Committee were converted to shares using a stock price of $21.70, the closing price on March 9, 2018, the trading date before the grants were made, and the grant date fair value was determined using a stock price of $21.55, the closing price on March 12, 2018, the date the grants were made.
See Appendix A for further details regarding the adjusted EBITDA measure and the reconciliation of that measure to the appropriate figures as reported under U.S. GAAP. For 2018, the performance stock units are subject to a single performance measure, adjusted EBITDA, as further described under Analysis, below.
The following table provides the 2018 equity awards to the named executive officers, as approved by the Committee:
Analysis
In approving the 2018 equity award levels, the Committee considered the following factors:
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement  
The Committee determined vesting schedules in consultation with Willis Towers Watson and believed that such vesting provided the appropriate long-term incentive for executives' continued employment. Time-based awards vest over a three-year period. For performance share units, the Committee believed that adjusted EBITDA is generally a reasonable proxy for CryoLife's performance, but allows for adjustments to eliminate items that might provide improper incentives and items over which management has little or no control. The Committee believed that the adjusted EBITDA threshold and target performance levels were challenging. The 2018 adjusted EBITDA calculation methodology was consistent with the methodology used in 2017, and based on management's expectations, the target performance level was consistent with the range of 2018 earnings per share guidance previously publicly announced by CryoLife. See Appendix A for further details regarding the adjusted EBITDA measure and the reconciliation of that measure to the relevant U.S. GAAP measures.
Analysis – PSUs Earned
In arriving at its decision in March 2019 to certify the Company's adjusted EBITDA performance with respect to the 2018 performance stock units, the Committee took into consideration the Company's actual performance results relative to the pre-determined performance goals. The following table presents the target, threshold, and maximum adjusted EBITDA performance levels associated with target, threshold, and maximum award opportunities under the 2018 performance stock unit grants. The table also provides the actual performance level for 2018, as certified by the Committee, together with the associated levels of shares that were earned.
2018 Performance Stock Units
Actual vs. Target/Threshold/Maximum Performance
[BEGIN TABLE]
Adjusted EBITDA  $62,360,000-   $67,565,000- $ 55,220,000 $ 75,361,000 $ 59,458,000 91.5 80.0 
[END TABLE]
The performance stock units are earned based on two different payout methods, as set forth in the chart below.  First, for performance to target from 85.0% to 103.9%, the performance levels are defined in ranges, and payout is as associated below with a range of performance. Second, for performance to target from 104.0% to 116.0%, performance and payout is assessed on a sliding scale, with the data points listed in the chart representing points along that scale.

[END TABLE]
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement Pursuant to the terms of the performance stock award granted in 2018, the total number of performance stock units that are eligible to be earned are determined based on the results of the single performance metric during the 2018 year. Thereafter, the awards will vest based on the officer's continued service: 50% of the shares earned vested on March 12, 2019 (following certification of the performance metrics), 25% of the shares earned will vest on March 12, 2020, and the remaining 25% of the shares earned will vest on March 12, 2021, assuming the officer continues to be employed by the Company on those dates and the Committee took no action to waive the employment requirement. See Appendix A for further details regarding the adjusted EBITDA performance measure and the reconciliation of that measure to net income as reported for purposes of U.S. GAAP.	
Target Total Direct Compensation
The Committee believed that the blend of stock options, restricted stock, and performance stock units appropriately balanced the performance, stockholder alignment, and retention objectives of CryoLife's long-term incentive program. The use of multiple award types is a common practice among industry peers, and the Committee believes that the use of performance stock units creates an even stronger alignment between pay and performance. In addition, the annual grant frequency results in more continuous performance and retention strength by reflecting changes in the stock price year over year.
The Committee used a value-based approach to determine the size of 2018 equity grants, as it believed that such an approach more accurately matched the intended value of the equity and intended compensation. The Committee applied vesting schedules for the 2018 equity awards that it believes provided the appropriate long-term incentive to retain officers.
In determining the individual components of the officers' 2018 compensation (i.e., salary, target short-term incentive, and long-term incentive), the Committee evaluated the resulting target total direct compensation against market benchmarks, as follows below, taking into account the Committee's desire to have target total direct compensation generally within a competitive range of the Company's peer group median. The following table summarizes the named executive officers' 2018 target total direct compensation; the positioning of that compensation relative to the peer group median; and the primary rationale for approving each named executive officer's compensation at the level shown:

CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement Equity and Cash Incentive Plan
In May 2015, the stockholders approved certain amendments to the ECIP that were recommended by the Board of Directors based on management's recommendation and in consultation with Willis Towers Watson. The 2015 amendments included new provisions for cash-based incentive payments that were intended to comply with the requirements to be "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m). In May 2016, the stockholders approved certain further amendments to the ECIP that were also recommended by the Board of Directors based on management's recommendation and in consultation with Willis Towers Watson. The approved 2016 amendments included establishing a separate, lower cap for awards available for grant to individual non-employee directors and a higher annual cap for awards available for grant to individual employees. In May 2018, the stockholders approved a proposal for authorization of an additional  1.9 million shares for  the ECIP, which were registered in February 2019.
2018 Deferred Compensation
The CryoLife, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan allows certain key employees of CryoLife, including the named executive officers, to defer receipt of some or all of their salaries, commissions, and/or the cash portion of any bonus awarded pursuant to the short-term executive incentive plan. The plan's administrative committee, subject to ratification and approval of the Committee, establishes the maximum and minimum percentages of bonus awards that plan participants may defer in each plan year. These percentages were from 0 to 75% for base salary, commissions, and the annual cash bonus for 2018. Because this plan provides for tax-deferred growth of deferred compensation, it is a tool the Company uses to attract and retain officer-level talent.
2018 Perquisites
It is CryoLife's policy not to provide perquisites to its officers without prior approval of the Committee. To the extent that perquisites are incidental to a business-related expense, such as personal use of a business club, the named executive officers are generally required to reimburse CryoLife for any incremental cost of such personal benefit. Other than these incidental personal benefits, none of our named executive officers receive any perquisites that are not also provided on a non-discriminatory basis to all full-time employees, except for Mr. Mackin, whose compensation is discussed at Employment, Separation and Release, and Change of Control Agreements below, and except for supplemental disability insurance and airline club memberships provided to certain of the named executive officers. In keeping with CryoLife's practice with respect to all full-time employees, executive officers are also eligible to receive certain one-time benefits upon achieving employment milestones, including receiving $5,000 towards a vacation upon reaching 15 years of service with CryoLife and $10,000 towards a vacation upon reaching 20 years of service with CryoLife.
2019 Long-Term Incentive Performance-Based Equity Grant
On February 28, 2019, the Committee approved a long-term incentive performance-based equity grant ("LTIP") for executives and certain other members of senior management. The LTIP will be an additional equity vehicle and is not intended to replace already existing compensation programs.
The LTIP has three performance periods, which span a total of five years. Performance for each period is measured against adjusted revenue growth targets, with the payout subject to negative or positive adjustment, by a modifier that is correlated with the Company's gross margin achievement over the performance period.
The Committee believes the LTIP will serve several purposes, all of which support the Committee's compensation philosophy as described above on page 24. First, the LTIP is designed to focus management on achieving superior Company revenue and gross margin performance over a five year period, both of which are closely aligned with stockholder value. Second, the LTIP has been awarded to executives and certain members of management who have been identified as key to the accomplishment of important, long-term strategic objectives and goals of the Company. The Committee intends for the LTIP to serve as a long-term retention device for these employees. Because the LTIP has longer performance periods and longer vesting periods than existing equity programs, the Committee believes the LTIP will have an even stronger impact on superior Company performance and on employee retention than do the existing programs. The LTIP is also intended to reward employees should their efforts over the performance period prove successful in driving superior Company performance, as payouts under the LTIP require revenue growth beyond the historical  Company average.
The text of the form of grant agreement for the LTIP, which is also the Company's form of grant agreement for all performance-based equity grants going forward, is attached hereto as Appendix B. More detailed information regarding the LTIP, including precise metric targets and payout amounts for named executive officers will be provided in the Company's Form DEF 14A (Definitive Proxy Statement) to be filed in advance of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement EMPLOYMENT, SEPARATION AND RELEASE, AND CHANGE OF CONTROL AGREEMENTS
Employment Agreement with J. Patrick Mackin
In July 2014 the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Mackin as President and CEO, and CryoLife and Mr. Mackin entered into an employment agreement (the "Mackin Agreement"). The Mackin Agreement addresses Mr. Mackin's role and responsibilities as our President and Chief Executive Officer, his rights to compensation and benefits during active employment, and his termination benefits. The Board of Directors determined that it was appropriate to provide Mr. Mackin with an employment agreement due to the Company's desire to attract and retain high-performing individuals for this role.
The material terms of the Mackin Agreement and his potential termination payments are further described and quantified at Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control – J. Patrick Mackin beginning on page 47.
Employment Agreements with Other Named Executive Officers
CryoLife is not party to employment agreements with Messrs. Lee, McDermid, or Davis or with Ms. Holloway that provide any guarantee of employment and they are at-will employees.
Change of Control Agreements with Other Named Executive Officers
	On November 21, 2016, CryoLife entered into change of control agreements with each of the named executive officers other than Mr. Mackin (whose change of control arrangements are set forth in the Mackin Agreement). The change of control agreements, which automatically extend absent Company action, generally, provide that the Company will pay a severance payment if the officer is terminated by the Company without cause or terminates his or her own employment for good reason during a period extending from six months before to two years after a change of control of CryoLife. This is a "double-trigger" provision that requires not only a change of control of CryoLife but also an employment action before CryoLife is required to make payments pursuant to the agreements. The Committee approved termination payments under the agreements for executives based on their officer status and ability to influence decisions regarding whether or not a change of control transaction should be pursued, with Mr. Lee receiving a payment of 2 times base salary and cash bonus plus healthcare coverage and the Senior Vice Presidents, including Ms. Holloway and Messrs. McDermid and Davis, receiving 1.5 times base salary and cash bonus plus healthcare coverage.	
ADDITIONAL POLICIES AND PRACTICES
Clawback Policy
CryoLife has a standalone Clawback Policy. This clawback allows CryoLife to recover bonus awards that were paid in the 12-month period prior to a significant financial statement restatement. The amounts may be recovered at the discretion of the Committee and subject to applicable laws if the award was made on the basis of CryoLife having met or exceeded specific performance targets for performance periods affected by the restatement. In such an event, the Committee may require participants to repay to CryoLife the difference between the bonus actually received by the participant and the amount of the recalculated bonus, using the restated financial results. Furthermore, Mr. Mackin's employment agreement contains an additional requirement that he repay any portion of severance payments he has previously received from the Company if he fails to comply with certain post-employment protective covenants.
To the extent not addressed by the provisions above, the Committee continues to consider the appropriate structure for additional clawback provisions, including whether or not the clawback should require executive fault or negligence, should be mandatory, and/or should include performance-based equity. The Committee intends to adopt and disclose an updated policy in compliance with, and to the extent required by, the Dodd–Frank Act, and will do so following the issuance of final guidance by the Securities and Exchange Commission, if not earlier.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
CryoLife maintains stock ownership guidelines for executives that have been recommended and approved by the Committee, along with the Corporate Governance Committee, and approved by the Board of Directors. The current stock ownership guidelines were adopted in November 2015 and require the following stock ownership requirements for the named executive officers:
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement a.           Section 16 Officers: Each Section 16 officer of the Company shall continuously hold a value of the Company's common stock equal to the value of a multiple of that officer's then current base pay at CryoLife. The multiples applicable to such officers are as follows:
b.           Retention requirements: Each Section 16 Officer who has not yet acquired ownership of the required value of common stock set forth above must retain at least 50% of the net number of shares acquired upon the exercise of any employee stock option or the vesting of any performance shares, restricted stock, or restricted stock units (the net number of shares acquired shall be the number of shares remaining after shares are tendered, sold, or netted to pay any applicable exercise price and withholding taxes).
c.           Waivers: The Chairs of the Committee and the Corporate Governance Committee shall have the authority to grant waivers from these stock ownership requirements in compelling circumstances such as undue hardship.
d.          Qualifying shares: For purposes of satisfying these stock ownership requirements, the following shall be included: shares owned directly or indirectly (1) through a stock purchase plan sponsored by the Company; (2) by the person's spouse; (3) in a revocable trust of which the person or the person's spouse is the trustee; (4) any other shares related to or underlying vested or unvested restricted stock awards and performance share awards (after performance metric has been certified); or, (5) vested restricted stock units and vested performance share units (at actual, earned levels and only if and to the extent that any applicable performance criteria have been satisfied). It shall not include shares held through any other form of indirect beneficial ownership or shares underlying unexercised options or unvested performance share units whose performance metric requirements were not met.
These guidelines became effective for all currently employed named executive officers on November 17, 2015. As of March 6, 2019, all named executive officers are in compliance with the ownership levels set forth in the guidelines.
Anti-Hedging Policy
All CryoLife employees, including executive officers, are expressly prohibited in the CryoLife, Inc. Insider Trading Policy and Guidelines with Respect to Certain Transactions in Securities (the "Insider Trading Policy"), which is available for review at http://investors.cryolife.com/corporate-governance/cryolifes-code-conduct from derivative securities or hedging transactions with respect to the Company's securities. Specifically, executive officers are prohibited from engaging in transactions in publicly-traded options, such as puts and calls, and other derivative securities with respect to the Company's securities. This prohibition extends to any hedging or similar transaction designed to decrease the risks associated with holding Company securities, including but not limited to prepaid variable contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds. Stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other securities issued pursuant to Company benefit plans or other compensatory arrangements with the Company are not subject to this prohibition.
Furthermore, both short sales, which are the sale of a security that must be borrowed to make delivery, and "selling short against the box," which is transacting a sale with a delayed delivery, are prohibited with respect to Company securities under the Insider Trading Policy and executive officers may not engage in such transactions.
Equity Grants/Inside Information
The Committee generally adheres to a policy of not granting equity-based compensation awards at times when insiders are in possession of material, non-public information. In all other instances, if the Committee approves the grant of an option or equity award at a time when it is in possession of material, non-public information, it is the Committee's general policy to delay the grant and pricing of the option and/or issuance of the equity award until a date after the public dissemination of all such material, non-public information.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement TAX IMPACT OF COMPENSATION DECISIONS
Section 162(m)
During the 2017 fiscal year, Section 162(m) generally limited to $1 million the compensation, other than certain "performance-based" compensation, that CryoLife may deduct for federal income tax purposes with respect to the compensation of each of our "covered employees," which for 2017 included the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, and the other 2017 named executive officers. Beginning in 2018, Section 162(m) no longer contained an exception for "performance-based" compensation for arrangements that are not considered "grandfathered." Therefore, Section 162(m) was not a significant factor in the Committee's compensation decisions for 2018 although the Committee continues to believe it is appropriate to emphasize performance-based compensation.
Section 409A
Since Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, which deals with deferred compensation arrangements, was enacted, the Committee's policy has been to structure all executive compensation arrangements to comply, to the extent feasible, with the provisions of Section 409A so that the executives do not have to pay additional tax and CryoLife does not incur additional withholding obligations. The Committee intends to continue this practice.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Statements made in this Proxy Statement that look forward in time or that express management's beliefs, expectations, or hopes are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements reflect the views of management at the time such statements are made and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, estimates, and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These statements include those regarding future plans and intentions of the Committee and/or Board of Directors related to compensation decisions, and expectations that certain performance targets for management are achievable. These future events may not occur as and when expected, if at all, and, together with the Company's business, are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Along with risks specific to our business, management's ability to attain certain performance targets is subject to risks affecting the economy generally and other factors that are beyond our control. For additional risks impacting the Company's business, see the Risk Factors section of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements.

NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION
The CryoLife, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan allows certain key employees of CryoLife, including the named executive officers, to defer receipt of some or all of their salaries, commissions and/or the cash portion of any bonus awarded pursuant to the short-term executive incentive plan. The plan's administrative committee, subject to ratification and approval of the Committee, establishes the maximum and minimum percentages of bonus awards that plan participants may defer in each plan year. These percentages were from 0 to 75% for base salary, commissions, and the annual cash bonus for 2017. Plan participants may establish their respective deferral amounts for their base salaries and commissions prior to the beginning of each calendar year, and prior to July for their short-term incentive compensation for that year, which is calculated and paid after the completion of the plan year.
The plan provides for tax-deferred growth of deferred compensation and, pursuant to the terms of the plan, CryoLife agrees to distribute to participants the deferred amounts, credited/debited with hypothetical gains and/or losses linked to the performance of investment options selected by participants from among the non-proprietary investment options available under the plan. The plan does not have investment options that provide for above-market or preferential earnings. Distribution of all deferred compensation, including any gains or losses, occurs upon death, disability, retirement, or termination. Plan participants may elect to receive the distribution in a lump sum or in annual installments of up to 15 years, or via a combination thereof upon death, disability, or retirement. Also, a plan participant may elect to receive distributions while still employed by CryoLife if at least two years have elapsed from the plan year in which the deferred amounts would have otherwise been paid to the plan participant if not for the deferral. Distributions made while the plan participant is still employed by CryoLife and distributions made pursuant to termination will be paid in a lump sum to the plan participant. Hardship withdrawals during any plan year may be made upon the occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency for a particular plan participant or if a plan participant receives a hardship distribution under CryoLife's 401(k) plan. All deferred amounts and deemed earnings thereon are fully vested at all times.

CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE OF CONTROL
We have entered into certain agreements and maintain certain plans that will require us to provide compensation to the named executive officers in the event of specified terminations of their employment or upon a change of control of CryoLife.
Employment, Separation and Release, and Change of Control Agreements
Employment Agreement with J. Patrick Mackin
Pursuant to the Mackin Agreement, Mr. Mackin will receive certain compensation upon the termination of his employment, other than termination for cause or voluntary termination without good reason.
The Mackin Agreement has an initial term of three years following the effective date, extended by one day for each day beginning on the second anniversary of the effective date. The Mackin Agreement provides that commencing January 1, 2015, Mr. Mackin is entitled to participate in annual long-term incentive opportunities as determined by the Committee consistent with those provided to similarly situated CryoLife executive officers and in accordance with CryoLife's plans and applicable award agreements. Benefits currently include participation in CryoLife's plan-based awards with other CryoLife executives for performance stock units, stock options, and restricted stock subject to continued employment and achievement of corporate/Board of Directors objectives set by the Committee.
The Mackin Agreement provides for an initial target cash bonus of 60% of base salary, a $200,000 signing bonus and new hire grants of options to purchase 400,000 shares of Company common stock and a performance share grant with respect to 250,000 shares of Company common stock, the performance metric thereto having been determined satisfied by the Committee as of December 31, 2015. In the event Mr. Mackin's employment is terminated without cause or Mr. Mackin resigns for good reason, he is entitled to a cash severance payment of 1.5 times his base salary and annual cash bonus for the year of termination (or the prior year bonus if termination is prior to the date bonuses are awarded) paid in regular payroll installments over eighteen months plus continued Company medical coverage for the same period. If Mr. Mackin's employment is terminated without cause, or Mr. Mackin resigns for good reason during the period beginning six months prior to and ending two years following a change of control of the Company, Mr. Mackin is entitled to receive a termination payment, in lieu of the severance described in the prior sentence, of 2.5 times his base salary and annual cash bonus for the year of termination (or the prior year bonus if termination is prior to the date bonuses are awarded), paid in a lump sum. The agreement also includes various post-employment prohibitions regarding competing with us, soliciting our employees and customers, and disclosing our confidential information.
For purposes of the Mackin Agreement, "cause" generally means (i) an intentional act of fraud, embezzlement, theft, or any other material violation of law that occurs during or in the course of the executive's employment, (ii) intentional damage of Company assets, (iii) intentional disclosure of Company confidential information contrary to the Company's policies, (iv) material breach of the executive's obligations under the agreement, (v) intentional engagement by the executive in any activity that would constitute a breach of his duty of loyalty or of his assigned duties, (vi) intentional breach by the executive of any Company policies or procedures, (vii) willful and continued failure by the executive to perform his assigned duties, other than as a result of incapacity due to physical or mental illness, (viii) executive is prevented from performing certain duties contemplated by the agreement by reason of an agreement with a prior employer or (ix) willful conduct by the executive that is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company, monetarily or otherwise.
For purposes of the Mackin Agreement, "good reason" generally means (i) the assignment to the executive, without his consent, of any duties materially inconsistent with his position, authority, duties, or responsibilities, including changes in status, offices, or titles and any change in the executive's reporting requirements that would cause him to report to an officer who is junior in seniority to the officer to whom he previously reported, (ii) requiring the executive to be based other than within 25 miles of Company headquarters as of the effective date or (iii) any other action that results in a material diminution in his position, authority, duties, responsibilities, or aggregate base salary and cash bonus.
Change of Control Agreements with Other Named Executive Officers
On November 21, 2016, CryoLife entered into change of control agreements with each of Messrs. Lee, McDermid, and Davis and Ms. Holloway that provide that the Company will pay severance payments if he or she is terminated by the Company without cause or if he or she terminates their employment for good reason during a period extending from six months before to two years after a change of control of CryoLife. This is a "double trigger" provision that requires not only a change of control of CryoLife but also an adverse employment action.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement Terms of the Change of Control Agreements
We will not be required to make a severance payment in connection with the change of control agreements if we terminate an executive's employment for cause, which means:
An executive may terminate his or her employment for good reason in connection with a change of control without forfeiting his or her severance pay if any of the following events occur during the term of the agreement:

The change of control agreements provide that we will pay any severance payment due in a lump sum not later than 30 days following the date of termination in the event of a termination following a change of control, or 30 days following a change of control in the event of a termination occurring within the six-month period preceding the change of control. We will delay payment of the severance payment until six months after the executive's termination if necessary to prevent him or her from having to pay additional tax under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. We will also subject any severance payment to normal payroll tax withholding and compliance with non-compete obligations.
Agreement Not to Solicit or Compete
Messrs. Lee, McDermid, and Davis and Ms. Holloway agree not to solicit any actual or prospective customers of CryoLife with whom they have had contact for a competing business or to solicit employees of CryoLife to leave CryoLife. Messrs. Lee, McDermid, and Davis agree, and Ms. Holloway agrees, subject to applicable professional and ethical obligations and other legal requirements, not to join a competing business during the term of the agreement and for a period of one year following the termination of employment. CryoLife or an acquiring company is not required to make the severance payment, and the officer is required to repay any portion of the severance payment already received, if he or she solicits customers or employees of CryoLife during the term of the agreement and for a period of one year following the termination of employment.
Termination and Change of Control Payments
The amount of compensation we would be required to pay to each named executive officer under certain termination and change of control scenarios is provided in the tables beginning on page 47. Amounts included in the tables are estimates and are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon the events discussed below, any actual amounts paid or distributed may differ materially.

CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement Compensation Risk Assessment
In accordance with the requirements of Item 402(s) of Regulation S-K, to the extent that risks may arise from our compensation policies and practices for our employees that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us, we are required to discuss our policies and practices for compensating our employees (including our employees that are not named executive officers) as they relate to our risk management practices and risk-taking incentives. The Committee has determined that our compensation policies and practices for our employees, including our named executive officers, are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us because unacceptable risks that may be encouraged, directly or indirectly, through a compensation method are mitigated through policy or practice, the Company's training programs, the Company's internal controls, or external factors such as risk of civil or criminal prosecution, which are made known to employees through training.
Our Committee routinely assesses our compensation policies and practices and takes this consideration into account as part of its review.

The table also shows information concerning beneficial ownership by the named executive officers and by all current non-employee directors and executive officers as a group. The number of shares beneficially owned is determined under the rules of the SEC, and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under those rules, beneficial ownership includes any shares as to which the individual has sole or shared voting power or investment power and also any shares that the individual has the right to acquire within 60 days after March 6, 2019, through the exercise of any stock option or other right.

CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement PROPOSAL THREE – APPROVAL OF certain AmendmentS to the amended and restated articles of incorporation of cryolife, inc.
The Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of CryoLife, Inc. (the "Articles") outline the governance of the Company under the applicable corporate statutes in the State of Florida, where the Company is incorporated.
Proposed Amendments
The Board of Directors proposes to amend the Articles to: (1) replace an itemized list of corporate powers with a broader, but more typical and significantly shorter, provision that gives the Company all powers permitted under Florida law; (2) remove language regarding preferred stock, as the Company has no designated preferred stock and does not anticipate issuing any preferred stock in the future; and, (3) correct incorrect statutory citations.
These changes clarify existing Company authority to be what is allowed under Florida law and remove unnecessary language from the Company's Articles. The changes are not intended in any way to lessen the powers of our stockholders. The text of the Articles as amended by the proposed amendments, formatted to highlight the proposed amendments, is attached hereto as Appendix C, and we urge stockholders to review Appendix C carefully.
If the Company's stockholders approve the amendments to the Articles, the Company will file the new Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of CryoLife, Inc. with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida and will file a Form 8-K with the SEC, noting the amendment.
"Resolved, that CryoLife's stockholders approve the amendments to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of CryoLife, Inc."
Required Vote
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast, either for or against, by the holders of the shares of common stock voting is required to approve this proposal. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of this vote.
The Board of Directors' Recommendation
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE AmendmentS to the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of cryolife, inc.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement PROPOSAL FOUR – RATIFICATION OF THE APPROVAL OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
General Information
The Board of Directors recommends the Company's stockholders ratify the approval of Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Representatives of Ernst & Young are expected to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting, and representatives of the firm will have the opportunity to make a statement at the meeting if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
The submission of the approval of Ernst & Young for ratification by stockholders is not legally required; however, the Board of Directors believes that such submission is consistent with best practices in corporate governance and is an opportunity for stockholders to provide direct feedback to the Board of Directors on an important issue of corporate governance. If the stockholders do not ratify the approval of Ernst & Young, the selection of such firm as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company will be reconsidered by the Audit Committee, provided that the committee retains sole authority with respect to all decisions regarding the engagement of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, including the decision as to whether or not the 2019 appointment will stand, regardless of whether the stockholders vote to ratify the approval.
Fees Incurred for Work Performed by the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017
The following table presents Ernst & Young's professional service fees for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements for fiscal years ending 2018 and 2017, as well as fees for other services rendered during those periods.
The Company's Audit Committee approved all of the services described above. The Audit Committee has determined that the payments made to Ernst & Young for these services are compatible with maintaining such firm's independence.
Audit Committee's Pre-approval Policies and Procedures
The Audit Committee has the sole authority to appoint or replace, compensate, and oversee the work of any independent registered public accounting firm, who must be, when required, a registered firm as defined by law whose purpose is the preparation or issuance of an audit report or related work. The independent registered public accounting firm's reports and other communications are to be delivered directly to the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee is responsible for the resolution of disagreements between management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding financial reporting.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and non-audit services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm and all engagement fees and terms in connection therewith, except as otherwise permitted by federal law and regulations. To date, no services have been approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to 17 CFR 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C), which provides a limited exception to the requirement that services be approved in advance by the Audit Committee if certain conditions are met.
Required Vote
The votes cast for this proposal must exceed the votes cast against it in order for it to be approved. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be relevant to the outcome.
The Board of Directors' Recommendation 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE RATIFICATION OF The approval of ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.

CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement APPENDIX A –NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE INFORMATION
Set forth below in this Appendix A is important information about the following non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this Proxy Statement:
Although we believe that these measures are useful tools, no single financial measure provides all of the information that is necessary to gain a complete understanding of our performance, condition, and liquidity. Therefore these numbers are intended to be, and should be, evaluated in the context of the full information provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the footnotes thereto, and the accompanying management's discussion and analysis, as well as in our other filings with the SEC.
Adjusted Net Income
As discussed in this Proxy Statement, annual bonuses paid to executives under our short-term incentive plan are partially conditioned upon the achievement of specified levels of "adjusted net income." The use of this non-GAAP, adjusted performance measure in the short-term incentive plan was intended to create a stronger performance incentive by focusing on controllable variables within the core business and to minimize unintended consequences by excluding items that were highly variable or difficult to predict during the goal-setting process. We disclosed herein the actual 2018 performance results using this non-GAAP measure so that investors may see the extent to which the goals were achieved. We believe disclosing this information is useful because it helps explain how challenging our annual bonus targets are over time.
Adjusted net income for 2018 was calculated as net income and exclusive of:
The table below provides a reconciliation of 2018 adjusted net income to 2018 net income under GAAP:
2018 Adjusted Net Income (in Thousands)

Adjusted EBITDA
As discussed in this Proxy Statement, the 2018 annual grants of performance stock units to executives are conditioned upon the Company's achievement of pre-determined levels of adjusted EBITDA. The use of these non-GAAP adjusted performance measures was intended to create a stronger performance incentive by focusing on controllable variables within the core business and to minimize unintended consequences by excluding items that were highly variable or difficult to predict during the goal-setting process.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income operations and before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as further adjusted by removing the impact of the following:

EXHIBIT A
PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARD AGREEMENT
This Performance Share Award Agreement (together with the Performance Share Award Grant Notice to which this Agreement is attached, the "Agreement") is made as of the Date of Grant set forth in the Grant Notice by and between CryoLife, Inc., a Florida corporation (the "Company"), and _________ (the "Participant"). Capitalized terms used but not specifically defined herein shall have the meanings specified in the Plan,  the Grant Notice, or this Performance Share Award Agreement.
1.        Award.  Effective as of the Date of Grant set forth in the Grant Notice above (the "Date of Grant"), the Company hereby grants to the Participant the target number of PSUs set forth in the Grant Notice (the "Target PSUs") on the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, the Performance Share Award Agreement and the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference as a part of this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the Plan and this Agreement the Performance Share Award, the terms of the Plan shall control, except as to treatment upon a Change of Control Event in which the terms of this Agreement control. To the extent earned, each PSU represents the right to receive one share of Stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Notice, the Performance Share Award Agreement, and the Plan; provided, however, that, depending on the level of performance determined to be attained with respect to the Performance Goal, the number of shares of Stock that may be earned hereunder in respect of this Award may range from ___% to ___% of the Target PSUs. Unless and until the PSUs have become vested in the manner set forth in the Grant Notice, the Participant will have no right to receive any Stock or other payments in respect of the PSUs. Prior to settlement of this Award, the PSUs and this Award represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable only from the general assets of the Company.
2.        Vesting of PSUs.  Except as otherwise set forth in Section 3(b), the PSUs shall vest and become Earned PSUs in accordance with the Participant's satisfaction of the vesting requirements and schedule set forth in the Grant Notice and based on the extent to which the Company has satisfied the Performance Goals set forth in the Grant Notice, which shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion following the end of the Performance Period (and any PSUs that do not become Earned PSUs shall be automatically forfeited).  Unless and until the PSUs have vested and become Earned PSUs as described in the preceding sentence, the Participant will have no right to receive any dividends or other distribution with respect to the PSUs.
3.        Effect of Termination of Employment or Service. [EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE FOR EACH AGREEMENT.] 
4.        Settlement of PSUs. As soon as administratively practicable following the date on which the PSUs vest, but in no event later than [DATE] of the calendar year following the vesting date, the Company shall deliver to the Participant (or the Participant's permitted transferee, if applicable), a number of shares of Stock equal to the number of Earned PSUs; provided, however, that any fractional PSU that becomes earned hereunder shall be rounded down at the time shares of Stock are issued in settlement of such PSU. No fractional shares of Stock, nor the cash value of any fractional shares of Stock, shall be issuable or payable to the Participant pursuant to this Agreement. All shares of Stock, if any, issued hereunder shall be delivered either by delivering one or more certificates for such shares to the Participant or by entering such shares in book-entry form, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. The value of shares of Stock shall not bear any interest owing to the passage of time. Neither this Section 4 nor any action taken pursuant to or in accordance with this Agreement shall be construed to create a trust or a funded or secured obligation of any kind.
CRYOLIFE, INC.  |  2019 Proxy Statement
B-3 
5.        Tax Withholding. Unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Committee) have been made by Participant with respect to the payment of federal, state, local, or foreign income, the Company will withhold employment and other taxes which the Committee determines must be withheld ("Tax Related Items") with respect to the Stock so issuable. The Committee hereby allows Participant, pursuant to such procedures as the Committee may specify from time to time, to satisfy such Tax Related Items, in whole or in part (without limitation) by one or more of the following: (a) paying cash; or (b) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value, as defined in the Plan, equal to the amount of the Tax Related Items required to be withheld. If the obligation for Tax Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number of shares of Stock as described above, Participant will be deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Stock subject to the vested PSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax Related Items due as a result of any aspect of the Award. If Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of the Tax Related Items at the time any portion of the Award is scheduled to vest, Participant will permanently forfeit such portion of the Award and no shares of Stock will be issued to Participant pursuant to them.
6.        Non-Transferability.  During the lifetime of the Participant, the PSUs may not be sold, pledged, assigned, or transferred in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, unless and until the shares of Stock underlying the PSUs have been issued, and all restrictions applicable to such shares have lapsed. Neither the PSUs nor any interest or right therein shall be liable for the debts, contracts, or engagements of the Participant or his or her successors in interest or shall be subject to disposition by transfer, alienation, anticipation, pledge, encumbrance, assignment or any other means, whether such disposition be voluntary or involuntary or by operation of law by judgment, levy, attachment, garnishment or any other legal or equitable proceedings (including bankruptcy), and any attempted disposition thereof shall be null and void and of no effect, except to the extent that such disposition is permitted by the preceding sentence.
7.        Compliance with Applicable Law. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the issuance of shares of Stock hereunder will be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of applicable law with respect to such securities and with the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. No shares of Stock will be issued hereunder if such issuance would constitute a violation of any applicable law or regulation or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, shares of Stock will not be issued hereunder unless: (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act is in effect at the time of such issuance with respect to the shares to be issued or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares to be issued are permitted to be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary for the lawful issuance and sale of any shares of Stock hereunder will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue such shares as to which such requisite authority has not been obtained. As a condition to any issuance of Stock hereunder, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any requirements that may be necessary or appropriate to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect to such compliance as may be requested by the Company.
8.        Legends. If a stock certificate is issued with respect to shares of Stock issued hereunder, such certificate shall bear such legend or legends as the Committee deems appropriate in order to reflect the restrictions set forth in this Agreement and to ensure compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the SEC, any applicable laws or the requirements of any stock exchange on which the Stock is then listed. If the shares of Stock issued hereunder are held in book-entry form, then such entry will reflect that the shares are subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement.
9.        Rights as a Stockholder. The Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to any shares of Stock that may become deliverable hereunder unless and until the Participant has become the holder of record of such shares of Stock, and no adjustments shall be made for dividends in cash or other property, distributions, or other rights in respect of any such shares of Stock.
10.      Execution of Receipts and Releases. Any issuance or transfer of shares of Stock or other property to the Participant or the Participant's legal representative, heir, legatee, or distributee, in accordance with this Agreement shall be in full satisfaction of all claims of such Person hereunder. As a condition precedent to such payment or issuance, the Company may require the Participant or the Participant's legal representative, heir, legatee, or distributee to execute (and not revoke within any time provided to do so) a release and receipt therefor in such form as it shall determine appropriate; provided, however, that any review period under such release will not modify the date of settlement with respect to Earned PSUs.

11.      No Right to Continued Employment, Service or Awards. Nothing in the adoption of the Plan, nor the award of the PSUs hereunder pursuant to the Grant Notice or the Performance Share Award Agreement, shall confer upon the Participant the right to continued employment by any Eligible Employer, or any other entity, or affect in any way the rights of an Eligible Employer to terminate such employment relationship at any time. The grant of the PSUs is a one-time benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive a grant of Awards or benefits in lieu of Awards in the future. Any future Awards will be granted at the sole discretion of the Company.
12.      Legal and Equitable Remedies. The Participant acknowledges that a violation or attempted breach of any of the Participant's covenants and agreements in this Agreement will cause such damage as will be irreparable, the exact amount of which would be difficult to ascertain and for which there will be no adequate remedy at law, and accordingly, the parties hereto agree that the Company and its Affiliates shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction issued by any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining the Participant or the affiliates, partners, or agents of the Participant from such breach or attempted violation of such covenants and agreements, as well as to recover from the Participant any and all costs and expenses sustained or incurred by the Company or any Affiliate in obtaining such an injunction, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees. The parties to this Agreement agree that no bond or other security shall be required in connection with such injunction. Any exercise by either of the parties to this Agreement of its rights pursuant to this Section 12 shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedies to which such party may be entitled.
13.      Notices. Any notices or other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be sufficient if in writing. In the case of Participant, such notices or communications shall be effectively delivered if hand delivered to Employee at Employee's principal place of employment or if sent by registered or certified mail to Employee at the last address Employee has filed with the Company. In the case of the Company, such notices or communications shall be effectively delivered if sent by registered or certified mail to the Company at its principal business address.
14.      Consent to Electronic Delivery; Electronic Signature. In lieu of receiving documents in paper format, the Participant agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to accept electronic delivery of any documents that the Company may be required to deliver (including, but not limited to, prospectuses, prospectus supplements, grant or award notifications and agreements, account statements, annual and quarterly reports and all other forms of communications) in connection with this and any other Award made or offered by the Company. Electronic delivery may be via the Company's electronic mail system or by reference to a location on the Company intranet to which the Participant has access. The Participant hereby consents to any and all procedures the Company has established or may establish for an electronic signature system for delivery and acceptance of any such documents that the Company may be required to deliver, and agrees that his or her electronic signature is the same as, and shall have the same force and effect as, his or her manual signature.
15.      Agreement to Furnish Information. The Participant agrees to furnish to the Company all information requested by the Company to enable it to comply with any reporting or other requirement imposed upon the Company by or under any applicable statute or regulation.
16.      Entire Agreement; Amendment. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and contains all the covenants, promises, representations, warranties, and agreements between the parties with respect to the PSUs granted hereby; provided¸ however, that the terms of this Agreement shall not modify and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of any employment, consulting, and/or severance agreement between the Company (or an Affiliate or other entity) and the Participant in effect as of the date a determination is to be made under this Agreement. Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence, except as provided therein, all prior understandings and agreements, if any, among the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof are hereby null and void and of no further force and effect. The Committee may, in its sole discretion, amend this Agreement from time to time in any manner that is not inconsistent with the Plan.
17.      Severability and Waiver. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Waiver by any party of any breach of this Agreement or failure to exercise any right hereunder shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other breach or right. The failure of any party to take action by reason of such breach or to exercise any such right shall not deprive the party of the right to take action at any time while or after such breach or condition giving rise to such rights continues.

20.      Successors and Assigns. The Company may assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the Participant's consent.

Delivery of an executed counterpart of this  Agreement by facsimile or portable document format (.pdf) attachment to electronic mail shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of the Agreement.
23.      Section 409A. The PSUs are intended to be exempt from or compliant with Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder (collectively, "Section 409A"). If the Participant is deemed to be a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by the Committee, at a time when the Participant becomes eligible for settlement of the PSUs or payment of Dividend Equivalents upon his "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A, then to the extent necessary to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A, such settlement will be delayed until the earlier of: (a) the date that is six months following Employee's separation from service and (b) the Participant's death. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representations that the payments provided under this Agreement are exempt from or compliant with Section 409A and in no event shall the Company be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by the Participant on account of non-compliance with Section 409A.

(2)       Dividends and Distributions.
(A)       Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (the common Stock"), of the Corporation, and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 10 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(B)       The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per share on the Series A Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.
(C)       Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.
(3)       Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:
(A)       Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after issuance of Series A Preferred Stock declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

(i)       declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock;
(ii)       declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled;
(iii)       redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock; or
(iv)       redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
(B)       The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of this subparagraph 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.
(5)       Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein, in the Certificate of Incorporation, or in any other document or filing creating a series of Preferred Stock or any similar stock or as otherwise required by law.

(6)       Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up. Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution shall be made (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have received $1.00 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, provided that the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of shares of Common Stock, or (2) to the holders of shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series A Preferred Stock and all such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(7)       Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of common stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. In the event both this subparagraph 7 and subparagraph 2 appear to apply to a transaction, this subparagraph 7 will control.
(8)       No Redemption: No Sinking Fund. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable; provided, however, that the Corporation may purchase or otherwise acquire outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock in the open market or by offer to any holder or holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall not be subject to or entitled to the operation of a retirement or sinking fund.
(9)       Rank. The Series A Preferred Stock shall rank, with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, junior to all series of any other class of the Corporation's Preferred Stock, unless the Board of Directors shall specifically determine otherwise in fixing the powers, preferences, and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the shares of such series and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof.
(10)       Fractional Shares. The Series A Preferred Stock shall be issuable upon exercise of the Rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement in whole shares or in any fraction of a share that is one one-hundredth of a share or any integral multiple of such fraction which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to receive dividends, exercise voting rights, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of fractional shares, the Corporation, prior to the first issuance of a share or a fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, may elect (1) to make a cash payment as provided in the Rights Agreement for fractions of a share other than one one-hundredth of a share or any integral multiple thereof or (2) to issue depository receipt evidencing such authorized fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Corporation and a depository selected by the Corporation; provided that such agreement shall provide that the holders of such depository receipts shall have all the rights, privileges and preferences to which they are entitled as holders of the Series A Preferred Stock.
