Shareholders of record of the Company's Common Stock (the "Common Stock"), at the close of business on February 15, 2019 (the "Record Date"), are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting or any adjournments thereof. On the Record Date, the Company had outstanding 4,943,186 shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. A majority of the outstanding shares constitutes a quorum. Except in the election of directors, each share of Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote on each matter presented at the Annual Meeting for shareholder approval. Action on a matter is approved if the votes cast in favor of the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action. Abstentions, which include broker non-votes, are counted for purposes of determining a quorum, but are otherwise not counted. 
Any person giving a Proxy has the right to revoke it at any time before it is exercised. A shareholder may revoke his or her Proxy (l) by revoking it in person at the Annual Meeting, (2) by written notification to the Secretary of the Company which is received prior to the exercise of the Proxy, or (3) by a subsequent Proxy presented to the Company prior to the exercise of the Proxy. All properly executed Proxies, if not revoked, will be voted as directed. If the shareholder does not direct to the contrary, the shares will be voted "FOR" the nominees listed in Item 1, "FOR" Items 2, 3 and 5 and "3 years" for Item 4 described in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Solicitation of Proxies will be primarily by mail. Officers, directors, and employees of The Peoples Bank (hereinafter referred to as the "Bank") also may solicit Proxies personally. The Company will reimburse brokers and other persons holding shares in their names, or in the names of nominees, for the expense of transmitting Proxy materials. The cost of soliciting Proxies will be borne by the Company.

II. Management Proposals 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Item 1:  Election of Directors

The following nominees have been designated by the Nominating Committee and are proposed by the Board of Directors for election at the Annual Meeting.

In the election of directors, each shareholder may vote his shares cumulatively by multiplying the number of shares he is entitled to vote by the number of directors to be elected. This product shall be the number of votes the shareholder may cast for one nominee or by distributing this number of votes among any number of nominees. If a shareholder withholds authority for one or more nominees and does not direct otherwise, the total number of votes that the shareholder is entitled to cast will be distributed equally among the remaining nominees. Should any of these nominees be unable to accept the nomination, the shares voted in favor of the nominee will be voted for such other persons as the Board of Directors shall nominate. Each director is elected to hold office until the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until his successor is elected and qualified. 
The persons who will be elected to the Board of Directors will be the six nominees receiving the largest number of votes.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Item 3:  Advisory Vote on Compensation of Executive Officers  
[END TABLE]
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and regulations promulgated thereunder require the Company to conduct a separate shareholder vote to approve the   compensation of named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Dodd-Frank Act further provides that this shareholder vote shall not be binding on the issuer or board of directors of an issuer, and may not be construed: 1) as overruling a decision by such board of directors; 2) to create or imply any change to the fiduciary duties of such issuer or board of directors; or 3) to create or imply any additional fiduciary duties for such issuer or board of directors. The above-referenced provisions give you as a shareholder the right to endorse or not endorse our executive compensation through the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that the shareholders approve the compensation of the named executive officers of the Company as set forth under the heading "Compensation of Executive Officers and Directors" in Section VI in the 2019 Proxy Statement, including the compensation discussion and analysis, the compensation tables and related material." 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Company or the Board of Directors. However, the Compensation Committee will take into account the voting results when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" approval of the resolution. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Item 4:  Advisory Vote on Frequency of Non-Binding Shareholder Vote to  Approve Compensation of Executive Officers  
[END TABLE]
As discussed above, the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated thereunder require the Company to conduct a separate shareholder vote to approve compensation of named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. The Dodd-Frank Act further provides that this shareholder vote shall occur every 1, 2 or 3 years. Shareholders are entitled to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to reflect the desired frequency of such vote as being every 1, 2 or 3 years. 
The above-referenced provisions give you as a shareholder the right to vote on the frequency of future non-binding shareholder votes to approve executive compensation. 
The proxy card attached to this Proxy Statement includes four choices with regard to the desired frequency of the shareholder vote to approve executive compensation: The proxy card provides you with the ability to vote for one of the following: 1 year; 2 years; 3 years; or Abstain. As discussed below, it is the Board's recommendation that the frequency of the vote be held once every three (3) years. However, you are not being asked to approve or disapprove the Board's recommendation. 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Company or the Board. However, the Board will take into account the voting results when scheduling future shareholder votes on executive compensation. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote for holding the required non-binding shareholder vote to approve executive compensation once every 3 years.  III. Corporate Governance 
General 
The Company has a long-standing commitment to strong corporate governance practices. The practices provide an important framework within which our Board of Directors and Management can pursue the strategic objectives of the Company and ensure long-term vitality for the benefit of our shareholders. The cornerstone of our practices is an independent and qualified board of directors. All directors are elected annually by the shareholders, and the membership of all board committees are composed entirely of independent directors. The Company's Code of Conduct, which is posted on its website, www.thepeoples.com, applies to all directors, officers and employees. 
Board Independence 
Messrs. Allen, Kelly, Magruder and O'Keefe are independent as defined by OTCQX listing standards. Mr. Sliman, who is not currently a director but is being nominated for election to the board of directors, is also independent as defined by OTCQX listing standards. 
Board Composition 
The Company's Nominating Committee Charter defines the process and criteria for selecting individuals to be nominated for election to the Board of Directors. It is the Company's intention that all nominees, including those recommended by shareholders, be considered using this same process and criteria. 
In accordance with the by-laws of the Company, the Nominating Committee determines, subject to the Company's by-laws, the size of the Board and develops a slate of nominees to stand for election at the annual meeting of shareholders. In developing the slate, the Nominating Committee considers the qualifications set forth in its Charter. Minutes of all Nominating Committee meetings are maintained. The Nominating Committee reports its recommendations regarding the slate of nominees to the Board of Directors for their ratification. Once the slate is ratified, the Board of Directors instructs the President of the Company to take such actions as are required to distribute proxy materials to the shareholders in accordance with the Company's by-laws and applicable regulatory requirements. 
Further, it is the Company's intention that the minimum qualifications for nominees be those individuals who have an understanding of the Company's role in the local economy and who have demonstrated integrity and good business judgment. The Committee is encouraged to consider geographic and demographic diversity among candidates with financial, regulatory and/or business experience, but not so as to compromise the goal of attracting the most qualified individual candidates. 
Director Nomination 
Since the Company was founded in 1984, there has never been a conflict or dispute regarding director nominations. Accordingly, the Company does not feel that it is necessary at this time to provide a process whereby nominations may be made directly to the Nominating Committee, and this committee does not have a policy for considering candidates recommended by shareholders. However, in accordance with the Company's by-laws, shareholders may make nominations for election to the Board by delivering written nominations to the Company's President not less than 14 days or not more than 50 days prior to the meeting when the election is to be held. If the Company does not give at least 21 days' notice of the meeting, shareholders are allowed to make nominations by mailing or delivering same to the President not later than the close of business on the seventh day following the day on which the notice of meeting is mailed. The Company welcomes nominations from its shareholders; however, nominations not made in accordance with the by-laws may be disregarded by the Chairman of the meeting. The Company has never received nominations from shareholders. 
Shareholder nominations shall include 1) the name, age, business address and residence address of the nominee, 2) the principal occupation or employment of the nominee, 3) the number of shares of the   Company's common stock which are beneficially owned by the nominee, 4) written consent from the potential nominee, and 5) other information relating to the nominee that may be required under federal law and regulations governing such interests. The written notice shall also include the 1) name and address of the shareholder making the nomination, and 2) the number of shares of the Company's common stock which are beneficially owned by the shareholder making the nomination. 
Of the six directors recommended for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting, all nominees except for George J. Sliman, III, were elected as directors at our 2018 Annual Meeting. 
Board Attendance 
There were nine meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company held during 2018. All directors except for Dan Magruder attended 75% or more of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and the total number of meetings held by the committees on which they served. The Board of Directors, at its discretion, meets on a periodic basis in executive session with only non-employee directors in attendance. 
The Company does not have a written policy that members of the Board of Directors attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, but they are encouraged to do so. Four of the directors of the Company were in attendance at the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
Board Leadership 
The Chairman leads the Board of Directors and oversees board meetings and the delivery of information necessary for the Board of Directors' informed decision-making. The Chairman also serves as the principal liaison between the Board of Directors and our Management. The Board of Directors determines whether the role of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer should be separated or combined based on its judgment as to the structure that best serves the interests of the Company. Currently, the Board of Directors believes that the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should be held by the same person as this combination has served and is serving the Company well by providing unified leadership and direction. The Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors is designated as the lead independent director and calls and presides over executive sessions of the Board of Directors. 
Board Committees 
The Company has the following standing committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating Committee. 
The Company's Audit Committee is currently composed of independent directors Drew Allen, Rex E. Kelly, Dan Magruder and Jeffrey H. O'Keefe. The Company's Board of Directors has determined that Drew Allen is an audit committee financial expert as that term is defined in pertinent SEC regulations. The Board based its determination on the experience of Mr. Allen as the chief executive officer of his company in analyzing and evaluating financial statements and consulting with his company's auditors as well as his long tenure on the Company's Audit Committee. Mr. Magruder serves as chairman of the Audit Committee, which met seven times during 2018. The Audit Committee may, from time to time, call upon certain advisors or consultants as it deems necessary. The Audit Committee acts pursuant to its Audit Committee Charter. The Audit Committee submits its report to the shareholders in Section X below. The Audit Committee's Charter is available for review on the Company's website at www.thepeoples.com. 
The Compensation Committee's primary responsibility is to aid the Board of Directors in discharging its duties by recommending to the full Board the compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and other named executive officers of the Company. The Chief Executive Officer may attend meetings of the   Compensation Committee to discuss executive performance and compensation. The Executive Vice-President attends each meeting of the Compensation Committee and presents his insights and suggestions. The Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer each provide information and analysis to the Compensation Committee that is used in determining the named executive officers' compensation. The Compensation Committee has been authorized by the Board of Directors to engage consultants, experts, and/or other advisors that are knowledgeable regarding compensation practices within the financial services industry. The hiring of such consultants is at the discretion of the Committee. The Compensation Committee did not engage any consultants during 2018. The Committee, composed of independent directors Drew Allen, Rex E. Kelly, Dan Magruder and Jeffrey H. O'Keefe, met three times during 2018 to review the executive officers' performance and consider bonuses for the preceding year and salaries for the upcoming year. Mr. Allen serves as chairman of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee's Charter is available for review on the Company's website at www.thepeoples.com. 
The Company's Nominating Committee is composed of independent directors Drew Allen, Rex E. Kelly, Dan Magruder and Jeffrey H. O'Keefe. Mr. Kelly serves as chairman of the Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee acts pursuant to its Nominating Committee Charter which is available on the Company's website at www.thepeoples.com. The Nominating Committee met one time during 2018 and one time in 2019 to nominate individuals to stand for election as directors of the Company. 
Board's Role in Risk Management 
Risk is an integral part of the deliberations of the Board of Directors and its committees throughout the year. The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors annually review the Company's risk assessments, considering management's plan for mitigating these risks. The Board receives monthly written reports relating to the Company's risk management and meets frequently with the Chief Risk Officer and other members of Management. The Audit Committee at its discretion meets on a periodic basis with managers from the Audit, Compliance, Security, I/T Security and Loan Review Departments. 
Shareholder Communication 
The Company has implemented a shareholder communication process to facilitate communications between shareholders and the Board of Directors. Any shareholder of the Company who wishes to communicate with the Board of Directors, a committee of the Board, the independent directors as a group, or any individual member of the Board, may contact Greg M. Batia, Vice President and Auditor, P. O. Box 1172, Biloxi, MS 39533-1172, or at his e-mail address: gbatia@thepeoples.com.

VI. Compensation of Executive Officers and Directors 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Compensation Committee determines the salaries, bonuses and all other compensation of the named executive officers identified in the Summary Compensation Table on page 16 of this Proxy Statement, including the Chief Executive Officer. The Committee is also charged with ensuring that policies and practices are in place to facilitate the development of the Company's management talent, ensure management succession and enhance the Company's corporate governance and social responsibility. 
A. Guiding Philosophy and Objectives: 
The Compensation Committee's guiding philosophy is to attract and retain highly qualified executives, to motivate them to maximize long-term shareholder value while balancing both short-term and long-term objectives, and to pay for performance. The following objectives serve as guiding principles for all compensation decisions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide reasonable levels of total compensation that will enable the Company to attract, retain, and motivate  high caliber executives who are capable of optimizing and maintaining the Company's performance for the benefit of its shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maintain executive compensation that is fair and consistent with the Company's size and the compensation  practices of the financial services industry.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide compensation plans that align with the objective of achieving the mission of being a community bank  offering the highest quality products and services.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align performance bonus opportunities with long-term shareholder interests by making the payment of performance  bonuses dependent on the Company's performance with respect to Return on Assets ("ROA").  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide an incentive for personal performance by allocation of discretionary additional bonus opportunities  dependent on the executive's individual performance.  
[END TABLE]
B. Responsibility of the Compensation Committee: 
The primary responsibility of the Compensation Committee is to aid the Board in discharging its duties by recommending to the full Board the compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and other named executive officers of the Company. 
C. Role of Executive Officers: 
The Chief Executive Officer may attend the meetings of the Compensation Committee to discuss executive performance and compensation. The Executive Vice-President attends each meeting of the Compensation Committee and presents his insights and suggestions. The Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer each provide information and analysis to the Compensation Committee that is used in determining the named executive officers' compensation. 
D. Consultants, Experts and/or Other Advisors: 
The Compensation Committee has been authorized by the Board of Directors to engage consultants, experts, and/or other advisors that are knowledgeable regarding compensation practices within the financial services industry. The hiring of such consultants is at the discretion of the Committee. The Committee did not engage any consultants in 2018. 
E. Factors used to Determine Compensation: 
The Compensation Committee's considerations consist of, but are not limited to, analysis of the following factors: financial performance of the Company, including ROA, return on equity, and management of assets, liabilities, capital and risk. Additionally, the Compensation Committee uses annual compensation surveys to compare the compensation of positions in similar financial institutions of comparable asset size. Specifically, the Bank Administration Institute ("BAI") Bank Cash Compensation Survey, which includes compensation data obtained from banks with assets between $500 million and $1 billion in a region that includes Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee and the Mississippi Bankers Association ("MBA") Salary Survey, which includes compensation data obtained from banks in Mississippi with assets between $500 million and $1 billion, are used as reference material in evaluating the compensation of the named executive officers; however, the Company does not benchmark compensation to any specific company or companies. The Company does not have access to the identity of the specific companies included in these surveys. 
In determining total compensation, the Committee also considers the performance of the individual named executive officers in areas such as: the scope of responsibility of the executive; leadership within the Company, the community and the financial services industry; achievement of work goals; and whether the Company, under the executive's leadership, has been a good corporate citizen while enhancing shareholder value.  All of these factors are considered in the context of the complexity and the difficulty of managing business risks in the prevailing economic conditions and regulatory environment. The analysis is conducted with respect to each of the named executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer. 
F. Compensation Components: 
The named executive officers' total compensation package includes several components. The Company rewards current performance and achievement of short-term goals primarily through salaries and bonuses. Other deferred compensation elements, including the Executive Supplemental Income Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan, are designed to meet long-term objectives including retaining high-performing executives and to plan for management succession as well as to reward loyalty. 
Salaries 
Salaries are the foundation of each named executive officer's total compensation package and are normally the largest single component. Salary is the only guaranteed cash payment a named executive officer receives. The Company's goal is to provide an assured level of cash compensation in the form of salary to attract and retain high caliber executives. Job specific knowledge and experience as well as leadership ability are recognized with salary. 
In establishing the salary of the Chief Executive Officer for 2018, the Committee primarily considered Mr. Swetman's performance and the performance of the Company during 2017 and the compensation levels of chief executive officers of comparable financial institutions. In considering the performance of the Company, the Committee considered the Company's ROA, the change in problem assets and asset growth, but utilized no objective criteria. The Committee utilized asset size peer group compensation data as provided by the MBA and the BAI. 
For other named executive officers, the Committee's recommendation concerning salaries was based upon the compensation levels of executive officers of comparable financial institutions, the performance of the Company during 2017 and the individual performance of these named executive officers. The performance of the Company for purposes of establishing salaries was evaluated based on ROA. Individual performance was measured using criteria such as level of job responsibility, achievement of work goals and management skills. Among the goals considered was the reduction of problem assets. The Committee also considered asset size peer group compensation data as provided by the MBA and BAI for executive officers with similar duties and responsibilities. 
Bonuses 
The Compensation Committee awards performance bonuses based upon pre-determined performance objectives in accordance with The Peoples Bank Bonus Plan ("The Bonus Plan"). Performance bonuses are generally the other cash component paid to named executive officers on an annual basis and may be determined by The Bonus Plan. The Chief Executive Officer and all other named executive officers are eligible to receive a bonus which is based on the financial performance of the Company. The specific formula and pre-determined goals under The Bonus Plan were established by the Compensation Committee using the   Company's ROA. The performance bonus calculation, which is approved by the Compensation Committee, allows the named executive officer to earn up to a maximum percentage of their salary on established ROA targets. The targets and bonus calculations as a percentage of salary and targets are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ROA Target      .670%      .800%      .925%      1.050%      1.175%  
 Chief Executive Officer      15.000%      18.750%      22.500%      26.250%      30.000%  
 Executive Vice-President      12.500%      15.630%      18.750%      21.880%      25.000%  
 Other Named Executive Officer      10.000%      12.500%      15.000%      17.500%      20.000%  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee may, at its discretion, also recommend to the Board that the executive officers receive an additional bonus which is determined on a subjective basis. If this additional discretionary bonus is recommended, the Committee documents its actions in the minutes of their committee meetings. No performance based or discretionary bonuses were awarded to executive officers for 2018 due to the performance of the Company. 
Executive Supplemental Income Plan 
The Company maintains an Executive Supplemental Income Plan ("ESI") which provides executives with salary continuation benefits upon their retirement, or death benefits to their named beneficiary in the event of their death. Executives of the Company and the Bank are selected to participate in the plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors. All named executive officers of the Company have been selected to participate in the plan. ESI benefits are based upon position and salary of the named executive officer at retirement, disability or death. Normal retirement benefits under the plan are equal to 67% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer, 58% of salary for the Executive Vice-President and 50% of salary for the other named executive officer at the time of normal retirement and are payable monthly over a period of 15 years. The ESI is administered by Banc Consulting Partners, who also provide guidance to the Company relating to the valuation method and assumptions. 
The ESI was established in 1988, at which time Mr. Swetman became a participant. Miss Wood and Mr. Fulmer became participants after their date of hire at the discretion of the Board. 
Benefits are also available in the event of death, disability or early retirement. Under early retirement provisions, if separation from service occurs on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date, the Company will pay the named executive officer a reduced benefit. The annual benefit set forth for normal retirement will be reduced by one-half percent (0.5%) for each month or partial month between separation from service and the normal retirement date. The benefit will be paid monthly over a period of 15 years. Benefits will commence on the last day of the month following the named executive officer's separation from service. The early retirement date means the date the named executive officer attains at least age 55, has at least 15 years of employment at the Company, and has participated in this plan for a minimum of five years. As of December 31, 2018, Miss Wood and Mr. Fulmer are the only named executive officers eligible to receive this benefit. The normal retirement date means the date the named executive officer attains age 65. 
If separation from service occurs prior to the early retirement date or prior to the normal retirement date, the Company will pay the named executive officer his or her executive benefit accrual balance as of his or her separation from service. The benefit will be paid in a single lump-sum within 60 days of separation from service.  If a named executive officer becomes disabled prior to the normal retirement date, the Company will pay the named executive officer his or her annual benefit as defined under normal retirement. The benefit will begin the last day of the month commencing with the month following the named executive officer's normal retirement date and the benefits will be paid monthly over a period of 15 years. 
If the named executive officer dies prior to early retirement, normal retirement or disability, the named executive officer's named beneficiary is entitled to full benefits under the ESI. If the named executive officer dies while receiving benefits, the named beneficiary is entitled to the remainder of any unpaid benefits. 
Upon a change of control prior to separation from service, the Company will pay the named executive officer his or her annual benefit as defined under normal retirement. The benefit will begin the last day of the month commencing with the month following the named executive officer's normal retirement date, or, for named executive officers who have already attained their normal retirement date, their separation from service, and the benefits will be paid monthly over a period of 15 years. 
Each named executive officer's agreement under the ESI may be terminated by the Company. In the event the named executive officer's agreement under the ESI is terminated, the Company will pay the named executive officer his or her executive accrual balance as of the termination of the agreement, or, if a change of control has occurred, the normal retirement benefit. The benefit will begin on the first date allowable under the ESI and the benefit will be paid over a period of 15 years, or, in some special circumstances, paid in one lump sum. 
If any amount is required to be included in the income of a named executive officer due to a failure of his or her ESI agreement to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the named executive officer may petition the plan administrator for a distribution of that portion of his or her executive benefit accrual that is required to be included in the named executive officer's income. Upon the grant of such a petition, which will not be unreasonably withheld, the Company will distribute to the named executive officer an amount equal to the portion of the executive benefit accrual required to be included in his or her income, which amount cannot exceed the named executive officer's unpaid executive benefit accrual. Any distribution will affect and reduce the named executive officer's benefits to be paid under his or her ESI agreement. 
The benefits will be paid out of the general assets of the Company. The Company has elected to purchase life insurance contracts, more specifically Bank Owned Life Insurance ("BOLI"), each of which it may use as a source to fund these future benefits. The Company is the owner and beneficiary of these life insurance policies, which are a general asset of the Company. 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
The Company maintains a Deferred Compensation Plan for those executives of the Bank holding the title of vice-president, senior vice-president or executive vice-president and approved for participation in the plan by the Board of Directors. Except for the Chief Executive Officer, all named executive officers participated in the plan in 2018. The plan provides each named executive officer a fixed benefit upon his or her early retirement, normal retirement or disability, or a death benefit to a named beneficiary in the event of the named executive officer's death. The benefit under the plan is $100,000, payable monthly over a 15 year period, upon the named executive officer's early retirement, normal retirement or disability and, in the event of a named executive officer's death, the benefits will be paid to his or her beneficiary. Should the named executive officer separate from service prior to his or her early retirement, normal retirement, disability or death, he or she forfeits all benefits under the plan. In addition, if within three years following his or her separation from service, a named executive officer becomes engaged in the banking business within a certain geographic area around the Company, the named executive officer will forfeit all benefits under the plan.  The Company has purchased life insurance contracts which it may use as a source to fund these future benefits. The Company is the owner and beneficiary of these life insurance policies, which is a general asset of the Company. 
The Deferred Compensation Plan was established in 1992, at which time Miss Wood became a participant. Mr. Fulmer became a participant upon his promotion to vice-president of the Bank. 
If separation from service occurs prior to a named executive officer's normal retirement date, the named executive officer will be entitled to full benefits provided he or she has met the early retirement eligibility. The early retirement date means the first day of any month coincident with or following the month in which the named executive officer attains at least age 55 and has at least 10 years of employment at the Company. The normal retirement date means the date the named executive officer attains age 65. As of December 31, 2018, Miss Wood and Mr. Fulmer are the only named executive officers eligible to receive benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
If a named executive officer becomes disabled, he or she is entitled to full benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
If the named executive officer dies prior to early retirement, normal retirement or disability, the named executive officer's named beneficiary is entitled to full benefits under the Deferred Compensation Plan. If the named executive officer dies while receiving benefits, the named beneficiary is entitled to the remainder of any unpaid benefits. 
In the event of a change of control, unless the Deferred Compensation Plan is terminated by the transferee, purchaser or successor entity within 120 days of the change of control, no named executive officer will be entitled to a distribution under this plan as a result of the change in control. If the Deferred Compensation Plan is terminated within 120 days of a change of control, then each named executive officer will become immediately eligible to receive the present value of his or her benefits under this plan. In addition, in the event the Deferred Compensation Plan is continued but a named executive officer is involuntarily terminated within 180 days of a change of control, the terminated named executive officer will be eligible to receive his or her benefits under this plan. Such benefits will be calculated by taking the present value of the benefits provided and such benefits will be paid in a lump sum within 180 days of the change in control. 
Split-Dollar Agreement 
The Company owns endorsement split-dollar policies, of which the Bank is the owner and beneficiary, which provide a guaranteed death benefit of $150,000 to the Chief Executive Officer's beneficiaries. 
Employee Stock Ownership Plan 
The Company maintains an Employee Stock Ownership Plan covering all eligible employees of the Company. The Board determines the total contribution to the Plan, which is allocated to all participants based on their compensation. 
401(k) Plan 
The Company maintains a 401(k) Plan in which eligible employees of the Company may choose to participate. The Board determines the formula for the matching contribution to the Plan, which is currently 75% of the employee's contribution (up to 6% of compensation).  G. Accounting and Tax Treatment: 
While the Compensation Committee considers the accounting and tax implications in the design of the compensation program, these have not had a significant impact in their decision-making process. 
H. Shareholder Approval of Compensation of Named Executive Officers: 
At our 2016 annual meeting of shareholders, the Company held its second advisory (non-binding) vote on the compensation of the named executive officers. A majority of our shareholders voted in favor of the resolution approving the 2015 compensation of the named executive officers. The Compensation Committee considered these shareholders' votes in determining the 2016 and 2017 compensation of the named executive officers. 
Shareholders are provided the opportunity to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote on the compensation of the named executive officers at the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders. Because this vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board and will not be construed as overruling any decision made by the Board. The Compensation Committee and the Board will take into account the outcome of this advisory vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements, but they are not required to do so. Shareholders will be provided their next opportunity to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote on the compensation of the named executive officers at the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. 
There are no employment contracts with the executive officers.

Directors' Compensation 
During 2018, directors who are employees of the Bank did not receive any compensation for serving on the Board of the Bank or the Company or on any Board committee. All non-employee directors received an annual retainer of $3,500. Non-employee directors additionally receive $1,000 per board meeting attended and $300 per committee meeting attended. The chairman of the Audit Committee received $500 per audit committee meeting attended. The chairman of all other committees received $400 per committee meeting attended. 
The Company offers a Directors' Deferred Income Plan whereby directors of the Company and the Bank are given an opportunity to defer receipt of their annual director's fees. For those who choose to participate, benefits are payable monthly for 10 years beginning on the first day of the month following the later of the director's normal retirement age or separation from service. Normal retirement age is 65. The amount of the benefit will vary depending on the fees the director has deferred and the length of time the fees have been deferred. Interest on deferred fees accrues at an annual rate of 10%, compounded annually. After payments have commenced, interest accrues at an annual rate of 7.50%, compounded monthly. In the event of the director's death, benefits are payable to the director's named beneficiary. The Company has purchased life insurance contracts which it may use as a source to fund these future benefits. The Company is the owner and beneficiary of these life insurance policies, which are a general asset of the Company. 
The Company also offers an Outside Directors' Supplemental Income Plan to provide a benefit to its non-employee directors. The benefit is based upon the age of the Outside Director upon his appointment to the board. Directors Drew Allen and Dan Magruder are entitled to receive $5,000 annually for 10 years, Director Rex E. Kelly is entitled to receive $4,000 annually for 10 years and Director Jeffrey H. O'Keefe is entitled to   receive $6,000 annually for 10 years. The benefit is payable upon the later of the Outside Director's attainment of age sixty-five or cessation of service as a director. An Outside Director must serve as an Outside Director until the earlier of his death or 10 consecutive years as an Outside Director to be entitled to any benefit. In the event of the death of the Outside Director, their beneficiary shall receive a death benefit totaling the remainder of benefits due the Outside Director. The death benefit will be paid in a single lump sum within 90 days following the Outside Director's death. The Company has purchased life insurance contracts which it may use as a source to fund these future benefits. The Company is the owner and beneficiary of these life insurance policies, which are a general asset of the Company.

VII. Transactions with Related Parties 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company, through its bank subsidiary, extends loans in the ordinary course of business to certain officers and directors and their personal business interests at, in the opinion of Management, the same terms including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the same time for comparable loans of similar credit risk with persons not related to the Company or its subsidiaries. These loans, which are subject to approval by the Company's Board of Directors, do not involve more than normal risk of collectability and do not include other unfavorable features.

The Audit Committee has also discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by SAS 61, as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T. The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors the auditors' independence and has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditor's communication with the Audit Committee concerning independence.
