Quorum 
The presence in person or by proxy of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining that a quorum is present. 
Limitations on Voting 
In accordance with the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation, record holders of common stock who beneficially own in excess of 10% of the outstanding shares of our common stock are not entitled to any vote with respect to the shares held in excess of such limit. 
Method of Counting Votes 
As to the election of directors, a stockholder may vote FOR each nominee proposed by the Board or WITHHOLD authority to vote for each nominee being proposed. Directors are elected by a plurality of votes cast, without regard to either broker non-votes or proxies as to which the authority to vote for the nominees being proposed is withheld. Plurality means that individuals who receive the highest number of votes cast are elected, up to the maximum number of directors to be elected at the annual meeting. 
As to the ratification of the appointment of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as our independent registered public accounting firm, a stockholder may: (i) vote FOR the ratification; (ii) vote AGAINST the ratification; or (iii) ABSTAIN from voting on such ratification. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the matter at the Annual Meeting is required for the ratification of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as the independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending June 30, 2019. Shares as to which "ABSTAIN" has been selected will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. 
Participants in the ESOP and 401(k) Plan 
Participants in the Huntingdon Valley Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") will each receive a Vote Instruction Form that reflects all of the shares that the participant may direct the trustee to vote on his or her behalf under the plan. Under the terms of the ESOP, the ESOP trustee votes all shares held by the ESOP, but each ESOP participant may direct the trustee how to vote the shares of HV Bancorp, Inc. common stock allocated to his or her account. The ESOP trustee will vote all unallocated shares of HV Bancorp, Inc. common stock held by the ESOP and allocated shares for which no voting instructions are received in the same proportion as shares for which it has received timely voting instructions. In addition, participants in the Huntingdon Valley Bank Employees Savings Plan ("401(k) Plan") with an interest in the HV Bancorp, Inc. Stock Fund ("Stock Fund") will receive a Vote Instruction Form that allows them to direct the 401(k) Plan trustee to vote their interest in the Stock Fund. If a participant does not direct the 401(k) Plan trustee as to how to vote his or her interest in the Stock Fund, the trustee will vote such interest in the same proportion as it has received voting instructions from other 401(k) Plan participants. The deadline for returning your ESOP Vote Instruction Form and/or 401(k) Vote Instruction Form is November 18, 2018 at 11:59 p.m. local time.  
PROPOSAL I—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Board of Directors is comprised of six members. Our Bylaws provide that directors are divided into three classes, with one class of directors elected annually. Our directors are generally elected to serve for a three-year period and until their respective successors shall have been elected and shall qualify. Two directors will be elected at the Annual Meeting to serve for a three-year period and until their respective successors shall have been   elected and shall qualify. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors has nominated the following persons to serve as directors for three-year terms: Carl Hj. Asplundh III and Robert J. Marino. The two nominees are currently directors of HV Bancorp, Inc. and Huntingdon Valley Bank. The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the election of the nominees. 
The table below sets forth certain information regarding the nominees, the other current members of our Board of Directors, and executive officers who are not directors, including the terms of office of board members. It is intended that the proxies solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors (other than proxies in which the vote is withheld as to any nominee) will be voted at the Annual Meeting for the election of the proposed nominees. If a nominee is unable to serve, the shares represented by all such proxies will be voted for the election of such substitute as the Board of Directors may determine. At this time, the Board of Directors knows of no reason why any of the nominees might be unable to serve, if elected.

Board Independence 
The board of directors has determined that each of our directors, with the exception of Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Travis J. Thompson, is "independent" as defined in the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Mr. Thompson is not independent because he is an executive officer of HV Bancorp, Inc. In determining the independence of the other directors, the board of directors considered loans made to Director Asplundh and/or his related parties as well as the consulting agreement with Director Marino and loans made to him and/or his related parties. 
Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight 
The Board of Directors currently combines the position of Chairman of the Board with the position of Chief Executive Officer, coupled with a lead independent director position to further strengthen the Company's corporate governance structure. Scott W. Froggatt serves as our lead independent director. The Board of Directors believes this provides an efficient and effective leadership model for HV Bancorp, Inc. Combining the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer positions fosters clear accountability, effective decision-making, and alignment on corporate strategy. The Board of Directors believes its administration of its risk oversight function is enhanced by the Board's leadership structure. To assure effective independent oversight, the Board has adopted a number of governance practices, including holding executive sessions of the independent directors after Board meetings, as needed, and the Compensation Committee conducts performance evaluations of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. 
The Board of Directors is actively involved in oversight of risks that could affect HV Bancorp, Inc. This oversight is conducted in part through committees of the Board of Directors, but the full Board of Directors has retained responsibility for general oversight of risks. The Board of Directors satisfies this responsibility through full reports by each committee regarding its considerations and actions, regular reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of particular risks within HV Bancorp, Inc. as well as through internal and external audits. Risks relating to the direct operations of Huntingdon Valley Bank are further overseen by the Board of Directors of Huntingdon Valley Bank, who are the same individuals who serve on the Board of Directors of HV Bancorp, Inc. The Board of Directors of Huntingdon Valley Bank also has additional committees that conduct risk oversight separate from HV Bancorp, Inc. Further, the Board of Directors oversees risks through the establishment of policies and procedures that are designed to guide daily operations in a manner consistent with applicable laws, regulations and risks acceptable to the organization.

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is comprised of Directors Froggatt (Chair), Asplundh and Kelly, each of whom is independent in accordance with Nasdaq listing standards. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also serves as the nominating committee of the board of directors of Huntingdon Valley Bank. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee operates under a written charter which is available on the Investor Relations link on our Internet website at www.myhvb.com. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of HV Bancorp, Inc. met three times during the year ended June 30, 2018. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not have a formal policy or specific guidelines regarding diversity among board members. However, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks members who represent a mix of backgrounds that will reflect the diversity of our stockholders,   employees, and customers, and experiences that will enhance the quality of the Board of Directors' deliberations and decisions. As the holding company for a community bank, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also seeks directors who can continue to strengthen Huntingdon Valley Bank's position in its community and can assist Huntingdon Valley Bank with business development through business and other community contacts. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the following criteria in evaluating and selecting candidates for nomination: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• eligibility criteria in HV Bancorp, Inc.'s bylaws;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the extent to which the candidate would contribute to the range of talent, skill and expertise appropriate for  the Board of Directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the candidate's relevant financial, regulatory and business experience and skills, including knowledge of  the banking and financial services industries, familiarity with the operations of public companies and the ability to read and understand financial statements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the candidate's familiarity with the HV Bancorp, Inc.'s market areas, participation in local business,  civic, or charitable organizations, and ties to local businesses;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the candidate's personal and professional integrity, honesty and reputation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the candidate's ability to represent the best interests of HV Bancorp, Inc. and its stockholders, including  potential for conflicts of interest with the candidate's other endeavors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the candidate's ability to devote sufficient time and energy to perform his or her duties, including the  ability to attend meetings;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether or not the candidate would be independent under applicable SEC rules and Nasdaq listing standards for  purposes of service on the Board of Directors or on any particular committee; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any other factors that the Nominating Committee deems relevant to a candidate's nomination, including the  extent to which the candidate helps the Board of Directors reflect the diversity of HV Bancorp, Inc.'s stockholders, employees, customers and communities, the current composition and size of the Board of Directors, the balance of management and  independent directors.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies nominees by first evaluating the current members of the Board of Directors willing to continue in service, including the current members' board and committee attendance and performance, length of board service, experience and contributions, and independence. Current members of the Board of Directors with skills and experience that are relevant to HV Bancorp, Inc.'s business and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination, balancing the value of continuity of service by existing members of the board with that of obtaining a new perspective. If there is a vacancy on the Board of Directors because any member of the Board of Directors does not wish to continue in service or if the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee decides not to re-nominate a member for re-election, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would determine the desired skills and experience of a new nominee (including a review of the skills set forth above), may solicit suggestions for director candidates from all board members and may engage in other search activities. 
During the year ended June 30, 2018 we did not pay a fee to any third party to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying or evaluating potential nominees for director. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider qualified candidates for director suggested by our stockholders. Stockholders can suggest qualified candidates for director by writing to our Secretary at 3501 Masons Mill Road, Suite 401, Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania 19006. In order for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to consider a candidate suggested by a stockholder, the Secretary must receive a submission not less than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the proxy statement relating to the prior year's annual meeting of stockholders. The submission must include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the name, address and contact information of the candidate, and the number of shares of HV Bancorp, Inc.'s  common stock that are owned by the candidate (and appropriate evidence if the candidate is not a holder of record);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
• an affidavit that such person would not be disqualified under the provisions of Section 3.13 of HV Bancorp,  Inc.'s Bylaws;  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Submissions that are received and that satisfy the above requirements are forwarded to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for further review and consideration, using the same criteria to evaluate the candidate as it uses for evaluating other candidates that it considers. 
Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is comprised of Directors Froggatt (Chair), Asplundh and Kelly, each of whom is independent in accordance with applicable Nasdaq listing standards. No member of the Compensation Committee is a current or former officer or employee of HV Bancorp, Inc. or Huntingdon Valley Bank. The Compensation Committee also serves as the compensation committee of the board of directors of Huntingdon Valley Bank. The Compensation Committee of HV Bancorp, Inc. met two times during the year ended June 30, 2018. 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing the compensation philosophy, developing compensation guidelines, establishing (or recommending to the entire Board of Directors) the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and the other senior executive officers. No executive officer who is also a director participates with respect to decisions on his compensation. The Compensation Committee administers the HV Bancorp, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2018 Equity Incentive Plan") which was approved at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on June 13, 2018. The Compensation Committee may retain, at its discretion, compensation consultants to assist it in making compensation related decisions. The Compensation Committee engaged The Galbreath Group, a compensation consulting firm, in 2018 to assess the Compensation Committee's recommendation for granting stock options and restricted stock to the employees and directors under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee considered the independence of The Galbreath Group in light of SEC rules and Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards and concluded that the work performed by The Galbreath Group and its consultants involved in the engagement did not raise any conflicts of interest and concluded that they were independent consultants to the Compensation Committee. 
The Compensation Committee operates under a written charter which is available on the Investor Relations link on our Internet website at www.myhvb.com. This charter sets forth the responsibilities of the Compensation Committee and reflects the Compensation Committee's commitment to create a compensation structure that not only compensates senior management but also aligns the interests of senior management with those of our stockholders.  Our goal is to determine appropriate compensation levels that will enable us to meet the following objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to attract, retain and motivate an experienced, competent executive management team;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to reward the executive management team for the enhancement of stockholder value based on our annual performance  and the market price of our stock;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to provide compensation rewards that are adequately balanced between short-term and long-term performance goals;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to maintain compensation levels that are competitive with other financial institutions, particularly those  comparable in asset size and market area.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee considers a number of factors in their decisions regarding executive compensation, including, but not limited to, the level of responsibility and performance of the individual executive officers and the overall performance of HV Bancorp, Inc. The Compensation Committee also considers the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer with respect to the compensation of executive officers and on matters of compensation philosophy, plan design and general guidelines for employee compensation. However, the Chief Executive Officer does not vote on and is not present for any discussion of his own compensation.

Thompson, who served as principal executive officer of HV Bancorp, Inc. during 2018 and the total compensation paid to our two other most highly compensated executive officers who earned total compensation in excess of $100,000 for 2018.

(1)  The amounts for the year ended June 30, 2018 represent the grant date fair value of the stock and option  awards granted to the named executive officers under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. The grant date fair value of the stock and option awards have been computed in accordance with the stock-based compensation accounting rules (FASB ASC Topic 718).  Assumptions used in the calculations of these amounts are included in note 11 to our financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 27, 2018.

ESOP Allocations for the year ended June 30, 2018 were 545 shares for Mr. Thompson, 353 shares for Mr. O'Neill and 545 shares for Mr. Hutt.

Amounts included in the "Stock Awards" and "Option Awards" columns of the summary compensation table for the year ended June 30, 2018 represent grants under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. Notwithstanding that (1) these awards vest ratably over a seven-year period following the grant date; and (2) the annual financial statement expense that we are required to recognize for these grants will be expensed ratably over the vesting period and will be significantly less than the amounts included in the "Stock Awards" and "Option Awards" columns for the year ended June 30, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission rules require that we report the full grant date fair value of restricted stock and stock option awards in the year in which the grants are made. In addition, with respect to the stock options, the actual value, if any, realized by any named executive officer from any stock options will depend on the extent to which the market value of HV Bancorp Inc. common stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock option on the date of exercise. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the value realized by a named executive officer will be at or near the value estimated above in the "Options Awards" column. 
Outstanding Equity Awards at Year End. The following table sets forth information with respect to outstanding equity awards as of June 30, 2018 for the named executive officers. All equity awards reflected in this table were granted pursuant to the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, described below.

Employment Agreements
Huntingdon Valley Bank entered into individual employment agreements with Travis J. Thompson, Joseph C. O'Neill, Jr., Charles S. Hutt and J. Christopher Jacobsen, each of which has an initial term of three years. Commencing on the first anniversary date of the agreement and continuing on each anniversary date thereafter, the term of each agreement will renew for one year, unless written notice of non-renewal is provided by the board of directors at least 30 days prior to any anniversary date. Prior to each notice period for non-renewal, the disinterested members of the board of directors will conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of each executive for purposes of determining whether to take action regarding non-renewal of his employment agreement.  The employment agreements provide a base salary for each of Messrs. Thompson, O'Neill, Hutt and Jacobsen in the amounts of $200,000, $150,000, $175,000 and $150,000, respectively. The base salaries may be increased, but not decreased (other than a decrease which is applicable to all senior officers). In addition to base salary, each executive will be entitled to participate in any bonus program and benefit plan made available to senior management employees, and will be reimbursed for all reasonable business expenses incurred. 
In the event of each executive's involuntary termination of employment for reasons other than cause, disability or death, or in the event of his resignation for "good reason," (a "qualifying termination event"), the executive will receive a lump sum cash severance payment equal to the amount base salary that he would have earned had he remained employed for the duration of his "benefit period." The benefit period for Mr. Thompson is 12 months or, if greater, the remaining term of his agreement as of his date of termination. For Messrs. O'Neill, Hutt and Jacobsen, their benefit periods are each for the lesser of 24 months or the remaining term of their agreements as of their date of termination, provided, however that such periods shall be no less than 12 months. In addition, each executive will be entitled to receive life insurance and non-taxable medical and dental insurance coverage substantially comparable to the coverage maintained by Huntingdon Valley Bank for the aforementioned benefit period or, if earlier, until the date on which the executive becomes a full-time employee of another employer and receives comparable health and welfare benefits. For purposes of the employment agreements, "good reason" is defined as: (1) a material reduction in base salary or benefits (other than reduction by Huntingdon Valley Bank that is part of a good faith, overall reduction of such benefits applicable to all employees); (2) a material reduction in the executive's duties or responsibilities; (3) a relocation of the executive's principal place of employment by more than 25 miles from the executive's principal place of employment as of the initial effective date of the employment agreement; or (4) a material breach of the employment agreement by Huntingdon Valley Bank. In order to be entitled to the severance benefits set forth above, the executive will be required to enter into a release of claims against Huntingdon Valley Bank related to his employment. 
If the executive's qualifying termination event occurs on or after the effective date of a change in control of HV Bancorp, Inc. or Huntingdon Valley Bank, the executive will be entitled to (in lieu of the payments and benefits described in the previous paragraph) a severance payment equal to three times (or two times for Mr. Jacobsen) the executive's highest annual rate of base salary and bonus paid, or earned, during the calendar year of the change in control or either of the two calendar years immediately preceding the change in control. Such payment will be payable in a lump sum within 30 days following the executive's date of termination. In addition, Huntingdon Valley Bank (or its successor) will continue to provide the executive with life insurance and non-taxable medical and dental insurance coverage substantially comparable to the coverage provided to the executive immediately prior to his date of termination at no cost to the executive. Such continued coverage will cease upon the earlier of: (1) the date which is three years (or two years for Mr. Jacobsen) after the executive's date of termination; or (2) the date on which the executive becomes a full-time employee of another employer and receives comparable health and welfare benefits. 
In addition, if the executive dies while employed, the executive's estate or beneficiary will be paid his base salary for one year following death, and his family will continue to receive non-taxable medical and dental coverage for one year after his death. The executive will not receive any additional compensation or benefits under his employment agreement in the event he becomes disabled. 
Upon termination of employment (other than a termination in connection with a change in control), each executive will be required to adhere to one-year non-competition and non-solicitation covenants. 
Bonuses 
Discretionary Bonuses. The Compensation Committee has the authority to award discretionary bonus payments to the Named Executive Officers. While strict numerical formulas are not used to quantify the Named Executive Officers' bonus payments, both company-wide and individually-based performance objectives are used to determine bonus payments. Company-wide performance objectives focus on earnings, growth, expense control and asset quality, which are customary metrics used by similarly-situated financial institutions in measuring performance. Individually-based performance objectives are determined based on the individual's responsibilities and contributions to our successful operation. Both the company-wide and individually-based performance objectives are evaluated by the Compensation Committee on an annual basis and also as a trend of performance measured over the prior three years. The Compensation Committee also takes into consideration outside factors that impact our performance, such as national and local economic conditions, the interest rate environment, regulatory mandates and the level of competition in our primary market area.  Based on the foregoing, for the year ended June 30, 2018, Messrs. Thompson and O'Neill earned a bonus of $60,000 and $40,000, respectively, in recognition of their performance and efforts. 
Non-Equity Incentive Compensation. In connection with our strategy of selling long-term, conforming fixed rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, Huntingdon Valley Bank established a bonus pool based on achieving certain performance criteria, including revenue and operating income margin as well as loan quality and compliance with laws for the calendar year ended December 31, 2017. The bonus pool was allocated to Mr. Hutt and his residential staff in January 2018, which resulted in Mr. Hutt receiving a bonus of $132,751. 
Benefit Plans 
401(k) Plan. Huntingdon Valley Bank maintains the Huntingdon Valley Bank 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust (the "401(k) Plan"). The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan just like any other employee. Employees who are 21 or older and have completed two consecutive months of service are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan. 
Under the 401(k) Plan a participant may elect to defer, on a pre-tax basis, up to 96% of his or her salary in any plan year, subject to limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2018, the salary deferral contribution limit is $18,500, provided, however, that a participant over age 50 may contribute an additional $6,000, for a total contribution of $24,500. In addition to salary deferral contributions, Huntingdon Valley Bank may make during the plan year: (1) a discretionary matching contribution to each participant's account based on a percentage of the participant's salary deferral contribution; and/or (2) a profit sharing contribution that would be allocated to each participant's account pro-rata on the basis of each participant's compensation relative to the aggregate compensation of all participants. For the year ended June 30, 2018, there was no profit sharing contribution to the 401(k) Plan. A participant is always 100% vested in his or her salary deferral contributions. However, a participant will vest in his or her employer contributions at a rate of 20% per year after the completion of two years of credited service, such that the participant will be 100% vested upon completion of six years of credited service. The 401(k) Plan permits a participant to direct the investment of his or her own account into various investment options offered, including HV Bancorp, Inc. common stock through the Stock Fund. 
Generally, a participant (or participant's beneficiary) may receive a distribution from his or her vested account beginning at retirement, age 59 1/2 (while employed with Huntingdon Valley Bank), death, disability or termination of employment, and elect for the distribution to be paid in the form of a lump sum payment or annuity or installment payments. 
Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Concurrent with the completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion of Huntingdon Valley Bank and initial public offering of HV Bancorp, Inc. (collectively, the "conversion"), Huntingdon Valley Bank adopted the Huntingdon Valley Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") for eligible employees. Eligible employees who have attained age 21 and are employed with Huntingdon Valley Bank as of January 11, 2017 began participation in the ESOP on the later of the effective date of the ESOP or upon the first entry date commencing on or after the eligible employee's completion of 1,000 hours of service during a continuous 12-month period. 
On behalf of the ESOP, the ESOP trustee purchased 174,570 shares of HV Bancorp, Inc. common stock issued in the after-market following the completion of the conversion. The ESOP funded its stock purchase with a loan from HV Bancorp, Inc. equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The loan will be repaid principally through Huntingdon Valley Bank's contribution to the ESOP and dividends payable on common stock held by the ESOP over the anticipated 20-year term of the loan. The interest rate for the ESOP loan is an adjustable rate equal to the prime rate, as published in The Wall Street Journal, on January 11, 2017. Thereafter the interest rate will adjust annually and will be the prime rate on the first business day of the calendar year, retroactive to January 1 of such year. 
The trustee will hold the shares purchased by the ESOP in an unallocated suspense account, and shares will be released from the suspense account on a pro-rata basis as the trustee repays the loan. The trustee will allocate the   shares released among participants on the basis of each participant's proportional share of compensation relative to all participants. Each participant will vest in his or her benefit at a rate of 20% per year beginning in the second year, such that the participant will be fully vested upon completion of six years of credited service. However, each participant who was employed by Huntingdon Valley Bank prior to the offering will receive credit for vesting purposes for years of service prior to the adoption of the ESOP. A participant also will become fully vested automatically in his or her benefit upon normal retirement, death or disability, or termination of the ESOP. Generally, a participant will receive a distribution from the ESOP upon separation from service. The ESOP reallocates any unvested shares forfeited upon termination of employment among the remaining participants. 
2018 Equity Incentive Plan. On June 13, 2018, the stockholders of HV Bancorp, Inc. approved the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan which provides for the grant of stock based awards to its employees, directors and executive officers of HV Bancorp, Inc. and Huntingdon Valley Bank. The 2018 Equity Plan authorizes the issuance or delivery of up to 305,497 shares of HV Bancorp, Inc. common stock pursuant to grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units; provided, however, that the maximum number of shares of stock that may be delivered pursuant to the exercise of stock options is 218,212 and the maximum number of shares of restricted stock awards or restricted stock units that may be granted is 87,285 shares. 
The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan is administered by the members of HV Bancorp, Inc.'s Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors who are "Disinterested Board Members" as defined in the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee has the authority and discretion to select the persons who will receive the awards; establish the terms and conditions relating to each award; adopt rules and regulations relating to the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan; and interpret the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan also permits the Compensation Committee to delegate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers. 
Our executive officers and outside directors are eligible to receive awards under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. Awards may be granted in a combination of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, incentive stock options, and non-qualified stock options. The exercise price of stock options granted under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan may not be less than the fair market value on the date the stock option is granted. Stock options are subject to vesting conditions and restrictions as determined by the Compensation Committee. Stock awards under 2018 Equity Incentive Plan will be granted only in whole shares of common stock. All restricted stock and stock option grants will be subject to conditions established by the Compensation Committee that are set forth in the award agreement. 
A total of 77,000 restricted stock shares and 198,000 stock options were awarded by the Compensation Committee under 2018 Equity Incentive Plan during 2018. The Named Executive Officers were awarded the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officers    # of Stock Options      # of Restricted Stock Awards   
 Travis J. Thompson      50,000        20,000   
 Joseph C. O'Neill, Jr.      25,000        10,000   
 Charles S. Hutt      25,000        10,000   
[END TABLE]
The stock option and restricted stock awards granted to Named Executive Officers will vest over a seven-year period, with 16 percent becoming vested after the completion of one year of service following the date of grant and then 14 percent becoming vested each year of continued service thereafter for the next six years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these awards would vest upon death, disability or involuntary termination of employment following a change in control. The time-based component of the awards serves as a retention tool for the Named Executive Officers, and the stock options are viewed by the Compensation Committee as performance-based because value is only realized if there is stock price appreciation over the term of the options. 
The Compensation Committee engaged The Galbreath Group, an independent compensation consultant, to assess the Compensation Committee's recommendations for granting stock options and restricted stock to the employees and directors. Particularly for the Named Executive Officers and Directors, the Compensation Committee considered each person's role and position in determining the amount of stock options and restricted stock awards to be received. The Compensation Committee also considered their past contributions, their individual roles in   completing the mutual-to-stock conversion in 2017 and the roles they would play in the future. The Compensation Committee also reviewed survey data regarding awards made to executive officers and directors of other financial institutions that had undertaken a mutual-to-stock conversion and related stock offering. The Galbreath Group concluded that the Compensation Committee's recommendations for the proposed awards were reasonable and intended to align the economic interest of the employees and directors with that of other stockholders, consistent with prevailing compensation practices in the competitive marketplace for similarly-situated financial institutions.

(1)  The amounts for the year ended June 30, 2018 represent the grant date fair value of the stock and option  awards granted to the directors on June 13, 2018 under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. The grant date fair value of the stock and option awards have been computed in accordance with the stock-based compensation accounting rules (FASB ASC Topic  718). Assumptions used in the calculations of these amounts are included in note 11 to our financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 27, 2018. The outstanding  aggregate number of option awards for each director as of June 30, 2018 was 10,000 and no options were granted to Carl Hj. Asplundh III, Robert J. Marino, and Carl Hj. Asplundh, Jr. The outstanding aggregate number of stock awards for each  director as of June 30, 2018 was 5,000 shares and no stock awards were granted to Carl Hj. Asplundh III, Robert J. Marino, and Carl Hj. Asplundh, Jr.  
(2)  Retired from the Board of Directors on January 16, 2018.  
(3)  No director received perquisites or personal benefits that, in the aggregate, were greater than or equal to  $10,000 in fiscal 2018.  
[END TABLE]
For the year ended June 30, 2018, each director of Huntingdon Valley Bank was paid a fee of $1,500 per meeting attended. Additionally, each director was paid a fee for his service on a committee in the amount of $350 for each committee meeting attended and the chairman of such committee was paid $450 for each committee meeting attended. For fiscal year 2018, each person who served as a director of HV Bancorp, Inc. also served as a director of Huntingdon Valley Bank and earned director and committee fees only in his or her capacity as a board or committee member of Huntingdon Valley Bank. Mr. Thompson received no director compensation for his service on the board of directors. 
2018 Equity Incentive Plan. Our directors are eligible to participate in the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan and received grants in 2018 as described in the table above. The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan is described under "Benefit Plans—2018 Equity Incentive Plan" above. 
Consulting Agreement with Robert J. Marino. In January 2018, Huntingdon Valley Bank entered into a business consulting agreement with Mr. Marino to provide deposit sales training, grow deposit market share and identify deposit opportunities. This agreement is for a two-year term that expires on December 31, 2019 and will pay Mr. Marino $50,000 each year. Huntingdon Valley Bank has paid $25,000 in consulting fees to Mr. Marino for the year ended June 30, 2018. 
Transactions With Certain Related Persons 
Loans and Extensions of Credit. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally prohibits publicly traded companies from making loans to their executive officers and directors, but it contains a specific exemption from such prohibition for loans made by federally insured financial institutions, such as Huntingdon Valley Bank, to their executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking regulations.  The aggregate outstanding amount of our loans to our executive officers, directors and their related parties was $3.7 million at June 30, 2018. At June 30, 2018, all of our loans to directors, executive officers and their related parties were made in the ordinary course of business, were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to Huntingdon Valley Bank, and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. These loans were performing according to their original terms at June 30, 2018, and were made in compliance with federal banking regulations. 
Additionally, any transactions that would be required to be reported must be reviewed by our audit committee or another independent body of the board of directors. Any transaction with a director is reviewed by and subject to approval of the members of the board of directors who are not directly involved in the proposed transaction to confirm that the transaction is on terms that are no more favorable than those that would be available to us from an unrelated third party through an arms-length transaction. 
PROPOSAL II—RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended June 30, 2018 was S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. Our Audit Committee has approved the engagement of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. to be our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending June 30, 2019, subject to the ratification of the engagement by our stockholders. At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will consider and vote on the ratification of the Audit Committee's engagement of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. for the year ending June 30, 2019. A representative of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. is expected to attend the annual meeting to respond to appropriate questions and to make a statement if they so desire. 
Even if the engagement of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such change would be in the best interests of HV Bancorp, Inc. and its stockholders. 
Our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended June 30, 2017 was BDO USA, LLP. On February 21, 2018 the Audit Committee met and decided to dismiss BDO USA, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Our consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were audited by BDO USA, LLP. Also, on February 21, 2018, our Audit Committee approved the engagement of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. to be our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended June 30, 2018. 
The audit reports of BDO USA, LLP on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2017 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the year ended June 30, 2017 and the subsequent interim period through February 21, 2018, there were no: (1) disagreements with BDO USA, LLP on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of BDO USA, LLP, would have caused BDO USA, LLP to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its audit reports, or (2) reportable events under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of SEC Regulation S-K.
During the years ended June 30, 2017 through February 21, 2018, we did not consult with S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. regarding any matters or events set forth in Item 304 (a) (2) (i) and (ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. 
Set forth below is certain information concerning aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. and BDO USA, LLP during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees    $ 226,240      $ 84,000   
 Audit-Related Fees    $ 6,975      $ 138,272   
 Tax Fees    $ 23,800      $ 27,664   
 All Other Fees    $ —        $ —     
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees. The aggregate fees billed to us for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements, review of the consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided in connection with our engagement were $62,022 billed by S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. and $164,218 billed by BDO USA, LLP during the year ended June 30, 2018 and $84,000 billed by BDO USA, LLP during the year ended June 30, 2017. 
Audit Related Fees. During the year ended June 30, 2018 audit-related fees of $6,975 were billed by BDO USA, LLP, all of which consisted of fees for services related to the review of the registration statement for the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan and the issuance of its consent. During the year ended June 30, 2017 audit-related fees of $138,272 were billed by BDO USA, LLP, all of which consisted of fees for services related to the mutual-to-stock conversion of Huntingdon Valley Bank and our stock offering, including review of the registration statement and prospectus, the issuance of consents, participation in drafting sessions, the preparation of accounting opinions, assistance with responses to regulatory accounting comments and the preparation of a comfort letter. 
Tax Fees. The aggregate fees billed to us for professional services rendered for tax preparation, tax consultation and tax compliance were $1,500 by S.R. S Snodgrass, P.C. and $22,300 by BDO USA LLP during the year ended June 30, 2018 and $27,664 by BDO USA LLP during the year ended June 30, 2017. 
All Other Fees. There were no other fees billed during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services, which relate primarily to tax compliance services and tax advice rendered was compatible with maintaining the independence of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. The Audit Committee concluded that performing such services did not affect the independence of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. in performing its function as our independent registered public accounting firm. 
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, either by approving an engagement prior to the engagement or pursuant to a pre-approval policy with respect to particular services. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more members of the Audit Committee when expedition of services is necessary. The independent registered public accounting firm and management are required to periodically report to the full Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees for the services performed to date. The audit-related fees and all other fees described above were approved as part of our engagement of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of S.R. Snodgrass, P.C. as independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending June 30, 2019.
