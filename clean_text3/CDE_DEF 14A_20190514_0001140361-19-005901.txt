      During 2018, we took significant steps to further enhance our environmental, social and governance (ESG) framework. Specifically, we completed a materiality assessment and identified key ESG factors that matter most to Coeur. We decided to align our business with ten of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals to clearly communicate our sustainability and social responsibility efforts. We partnered with over 220 community organizations during 2018 to help make a positive impact in the communities in which we have a presence. Additionally, we reduced significant spills by 70% compared to 2017 and continue to tie a meaningful portion of our Annual Incentive Plan to environmental and safety

       Over the course of the year, we remained committed to developing our most important asset – our people. We proactively put our frontline supervisors though IMPACT Training, an intensive, year-long training focused on safety leadership and mining as a business. Moreover, our employees set individual development goals on an annual basis, which aim to progress personal careers and help ensure that our employees have the necessary capabilities and experiences to help Coeur execute on its strategic goals.

       Our team at Coeur worked together to begin delivering results from recent investments we've made at several of our operations. Over the past few years, we made numerous investments and operational improvements to reposition the Palmarejo mine as a sustainable, higher-margin, longer-life operation. Since 2012, we've seen gold and silver grades increase 100% and 63%, respectively, and adjusted costs per silver equivalent ounce(1) decrease by 41% since 2014. Together, these investments and operational improvements contributed to over $130 million of free cash flow(2) from Palmarejo over the past two years. At Kensington, we have also seen our investments deliver positive results. Since 2012, our throughput rates and production have increased 62% and 39%, respectively and our unit costs have

 Develop – Quality Resources, Growth and Plans  
      Invested in high-return, near-mine exploration in 2018 to replace production and grow the Company's overall reserve(1) base for the fourth consecutive year, resulting in:       ►   $44.0 million invested in exploration, 81% of which was deployed for          near-mine exploration at our existing operations, which we consider to be among          the most attractive uses of capital    ►   Silver reserves from continuing operations(1) increased 4%, year-over-year, net of          depletion, to 171.3 million ounces driven by an initial reserve declaration at          Silvertip   ►   Gold reserves were 2.8 million ounces, or 2% lower year-over-year, net of          depletion   ►   Declared initial zinc reserve of 291.2 million pounds of zinc   ►   Declared initial lead reserve of 197.5 million pounds of lead  
      Focused on Silvertip ramp-up:       ►   Commenced commercial production in September 2018   ►   Declared initial reserve and updated mineralized material estimate   ►   Continued to increase mill throughput rates and consistency in early 2019 towards          our target of 1,100 tons per day (1,000 metric tonnes per day)    ►   Completed key infrastructure projects, including a water treatment plant,         new warehouse and a new camp facility   
      Continued to invest in and grow the Company's presence in Nevada, which was ranked as the top mining jurisdiction in 2019 by the Fraser Institute, with strategic acquisitions and high-return investments in existing assets:       ►   Acquired Northern Empire Resources Corp. in October 2018. Northern Empire's          principal assets are the high-grade Sterling Gold Project and the nearby Crown          Block of deposits, both located in southern Nevada    ►   Acquired a large property package adjacent to the Rochester mine consisting of the          Lincoln Hill Project, Wilco Project, Gold Ridge Property and other nearby claims          which significantly bolstered year-end mineralized material   ►   The Rochester mine began construction and installation of a new crusher that          utilizes high-pressure grinding roll crushing technology, the first step in a          re-scoped mine plan that is expected to significantly increase and accelerate          Rochester's silver recoveries and more than double its estimated net asset value  
      Added two highly-qualified directors to our Board in 2018 and another in early 2019, each of whom brings relevant experience and fresh perspectives and adds to the diversity of experience of our Board, including valuable operating and government affairs experience in Mexico, where our largest mine is located, British Columbia, Canada, where the recently-acquired Silvertip mine is located, and Nevada, where we have a significant and growing presence

[BEGIN TABLE]
      Current and Former Chief Executive     Directors with experience in significant leadership positions possess strong abilities to motivate and develop people and understand the complexities and challenges of managing a large organization        Project Development/Management     The mining business is project intensive. Coeur benefits by having directors who have experience through the entire lifecycle of acquiring, developing and managing large and complex projects  
      Diversity (Gender or Ethnic)     We value a Board that reflects the diversity of our workforce and communities        Health, Safety and Environmental     Relevant because operating safely and protecting the environments in which we operate is our highest priority and critical to the success of our business  
      Government/Regulatory Affairs     We operate in a heavily regulated industry that is directly affected by governmental actions at the local, state and federal levels in the United States, Mexico and Canada        Capital Markets Experience     Facilitates analysis and understanding of proposed capital markets transactions, including risks and the impact to our existing capital structure  
      Legal      Facilitates assistance with the Board's oversight of our legal and compliance matters        Extractive Industry     Relevant given the industry in which we operate  
      Economic Trends and Policies     An understanding and awareness of economic trends and policies is critical since we mine and sell commodities and strive to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet, and therefore have significant exposure to macroeconomic trends and changes in the economic policies of central banks and governments        U.S. Public Company Board Service     As a U.S.-based and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)-listed company, Directors who have experience serving on other U.S. public company boards generally are well prepared to fulfill the Board's responsibilities of overseeing and providing insight and guidance to management in the context of U.S. public company regulation and governance structures  
       Cyclical Industry     The mining sector, particularly precious metals mining, is cyclical, and stockholders and management benefit from the perspectives and experience of directors who have lead firms through several full business cycles          
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 As part of the Board's ongoing efforts to seek this balance of skills, experience and tenure, in March 2019 and February 2018, the Board elected three new directors, Brian E. Sandoval in 2019 and Eduardo Luna and Jessica L. McDonald in 2018, to our Board. Each is highly qualified, adds to the diversity of experience of our Board including valuable legal, regulatory and government affairs experience in Nevada (Mr. Sandoval), where our Rochester mine and Sterling gold project and nearby Crown Block of deposits are located, and operating and government affairs experience in Mexico (Mr. Luna), where our largest mine is located, and British Columbia, Canada (Ms. McDonald), where our newest mine, the high-grade Silvertip mine, is located.        
 If all of the nominees are elected to the Board, the average tenure of the directors will be approximately nine years, with five directors having served approximately six years or fewer.

 The NCG Committee reviews and makes recommendations regarding the composition and size of the Board. In identifying director candidates from time to time, the NCG Committee may focus on specific skills and experience of particular importance at the time in order to enhance the overall balance and effectiveness of the Board. The NCG Committee assesses new director candidates and incumbent directors against the key director qualifications identified by the Board as our needs evolve and change over time.     The Board considers candidates identified by search firms it retains or consults with periodically, recommended by current directors and stockholders, and through other methods. The NCG Committee has adopted a policy pursuant to which significant long-term stockholders may recommend a director candidate. See page 29 for more details.     2019 Board Refreshment – Brian E. Sandoval Many of our directors met Mr. Sandoval when he was serving as Governor of Nevada, arising from interactions between the Board and Mr. Sandoval related to the Company's Rochester mine in Nevada. As the end of Mr. Sandoval's term as governor approached, our Chairman, Robert E. Mellor, and our CEO, Mitchell J. Krebs, informally discussed with Mr. Sandoval the possibility of him joining the Company's Board. Given Mr. Sandoval's experience as governor, the Board believed he would bring a number of important skills and perspectives to the Board, including chief executive experience, having served as the chief executive of the State of Nevada, government and regulatory affairs, mining industry experience (given the importance and prevalence of mining in Nevada and Mr. Sandoval's experience interacting with and regulating the mining industry as governor), health, safety and environmental experience (given his familiarity with regulatory requirements and good industry practices, and his experience presiding over environmental cases as a federal judge) and other important leadership skills. In addition, Mr. Sandoval further enhances the ethnic diversity on the Board due to his Hispanic heritage. Following the end of Mr. Sandoval's term as governor in early 2019, discussions accelerated, and directors had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Sandoval, including a joint meeting involving all members of the NCG Committee and other directors. The Company also completed a formal background check on Mr. Sandoval and held discussions with his references. Following all of those actions, after careful consideration the NCG Committee and the Board determined that Mr. Sandoval would be a valuable member of the Board and recommended and elected him to the Board and the EHSCR Committee effective March 8, 2019.     2018 Board Refreshment – Eduardo Luna and Jessica L. McDonald In 2017, against the backdrop of the growing importance of the Palmarejo complex in Mexico within the Company's portfolio of mines and the acquisition of the Silvertip mine in British Columbia, Canada, the Board determined that adding new directors with relevant experience in precious metals mining and Mexico and British Columbia government relations and regulatory matters would benefit the Board. After consulting several outside parties, Mr. Luna and Ms. McDonald were identified among a small group of candidates as individuals who possessed the specific criteria described above. Mr. Luna and Ms. McDonald also possessed many of the other key skills and experiences discussed on page 14 in Director and Nominee Experience and Qualifications. Over a period of several months, Messrs. Mellor and Krebs and, later, the rest of the Board and the entire senior management team carefully assessed the candidacies of Mr. Luna and Ms. McDonald through a series of meetings and conversations with the candidates. In addition, the Company completed a formal background check and discussed each candidate with references who were provided by the candidate and with other individuals who had experience working with or were otherwise familiar in a professional context with Mr. Luna or Ms. McDonald. After careful consideration by the NCG Committee and the Board, the candidacies of Mr. Luna and Ms. McDonald were recommended and approved, and the new directors were elected by the Board effective February 9, 2018.

     2018 Performance   2018 Compensation Result  
 1-Year TSR & CEO Pay Alignment   Negative 41% TSR in 2018   ►   47% decline in payout of CEO AIP from 2017   
 Actual Pay Compared to Target   Below-target execution on key performance indicators, driven primarily by the slower-than-expected ramp-up of our newest mine, Silvertip, in 2018   ►   Three-year performance share units (PSUs) paid out below target despite strong three-year relative TSR, due primarily to a zero payout for operating cash flow per share  
     ►   Below-target AIP payout for corporate performance and capped below 100% for individual performance (for executives other than the CEO, whose AIP is based entirely on corporate performance)  
 LTIP – Performance Shares       ►   91% overall payout of 2016 PSU award:  
 Three-year TSR performance in the 69th percentile of peers   ►   139% payout of PSUs linked to three-year TSR  
 2.5% decrease in reserves and measured and indicated mineralized material per share from continuing operations during the 2016-2018 performance period, due primarily to increase in shares outstanding from equity financings used to retire debt   ►   87% payout of PSUs linked to growth of reserves and measured and indicated mineralized material per share from continuing operations  
 Three-year OCF per share growth below target due to lower OCF in 2018 due in part to lower realized prices from metal sales, slower-than-expected ramp-up at Silvertip, a write-down of metals inventory at Silvertip, and higher cash mining tax payments in Mexico and an increase in shares outstanding over the period    ►   0% payout of PSUs linked to OCF per share  
 LTIP – Restricted Shares (RS)   One-year TSR performance of -41%   ►   Value of RS issued to the CEO in early 2018 decreased 43% as of December 31, 2018   
 AIP   ►   Below target silver equivalent production and OCF driven primarily by the slower-than-expected ramp-up at Silvertip   ►   57% payout of portion of AIP tied to strategic corporate annual objectives, significantly below target  
 ►   Strong performance against AISC per AgEqOz, reduction in significant spills and employee and contractor safety incident rate      
 ►   CLD Committee exercised negative discretion to award no payout to executives in respect of the safety metric due to employee fatalities that occurred at Palmarejo during the year      
[END TABLE]

 What We Do   What We Do Not Do  
 ►   Pay for performance with strong alignment of realized pay to TSR   ►   No excise tax gross-ups, tax gross-ups on perquisites or tax gross-ups applicable to change-in-control and severance payments  
 ►   Proactive stockholder outreach with meaningful compensation program changes made based on feedback   ►   No hedging Coeur stock  
 ►   AIP metrics drive stockholder value, with rigorous goals tied to Board-approved budget and safety and environmental objectives   ►   No pledging Coeur stock  
 ►   Majority of equity compensation in the form of performance shares with three-year cliff vesting tied to rigorous value-driving internal performance metrics and relative TSR   ►   No holding Coeur stock in margin accounts  
 ►   Majority of compensation at-risk   ►   No employment contracts for NEOs other than CEO  
 ►   Independent compensation consultant   ►   No re-pricing of stock options or SARs without stockholder approval  
 ►   Modest perquisites   ►   No guaranteed bonuses for NEOs  
 ►   Double trigger equity acceleration upon a change-in-control   ►   No single trigger cash severance based solely upon a change-in-control of the company  
 ►   Stock ownership guidelines for our directors and executive officers, including 6x base salary for CEO          
 ►   Clawback policy covering both financial restatements and misconduct          
 ►   Annual stockholder say on pay vote

      ► Protect   We are focused on safeguarding the safety and health of our employees and preserving the environment where we operate. Our AIP rewards outstanding health, safety and environmental performance to reflect this commitment.  
      ►Develop   We endeavor to develop quality resources, grow and enhance our assets, pursue new opportunities, develop and grow our people, and build a solid technical foundation. Our LTIP award structure drives performance against these goals by tying a portion of our performance shares to increases in our reserves and other mineralized material, whether at our existing operations or through the acquisition of new properties and assets. Our AIP encourages development of our executives and employees by rewarding exemplary individual performance and growth.  
      ► Deliver   We strive to deliver impactful results through teamwork and act with integrity. Both our AIP and LTIP reward achievement of operational and financial objectives and creation of long-term stockholder value, including by incentivizing increases in OCF per share and outperforming peers in TSR, while our clawback policy holds our executives accountable to act with integrity and in accordance with applicable laws in achieving the goals linked to our compensation programs.
